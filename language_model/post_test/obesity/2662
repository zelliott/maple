We examined whether changes in gut hormone levels due to a single bout of zzso exercise differ between obese young males and normal controls, and attempted to determine the involvement of hormonal changes during exercise in the regulation of energy balance zzso in these obese zzso Seven obese and seven zzso subjects of normal weight participated in exercise and rest zzso zzso consumed a standardized breakfast that was followed by constant cycling exercise at 50% zzso or rest for 60 zzso At lunch, a test meal was zzso and energy intake zzso and relative energy intake zzso were zzso Blood samples were obtained at 30 zzso intervals during both sessions for measurement of zzso insulin, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Plasma levels of zzso and zzso were increased by exercise, whereas plasma zzso levels were unaffected by zzso The areas under the curve zzso of the time courses of zzso and zzso levels did not significantly differ between the two zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso were decreased by exercise in both groups, and energy deficit was significantly larger in obese subjects than in normal zzso The present findings suggest that short-term zzso during a single exercise session might be regulated not by increased amounts of these gut hormones per zzso
