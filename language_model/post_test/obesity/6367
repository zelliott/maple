zzso tissue zzso generates zzso zzso which could be used for fatty acid zzso during zzso To determine whether increased zzso leads to increased fat mass and to explore the role of obesity in the development of insulin resistance, we zzso zzso a regulatory zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso mice showed a chronic increase in zzso activity, which led to increased zzso zzso of free fatty acids zzso increased zzso size and fat mass, and higher body zzso In spite of increased fat mass, transgenic mice showed decreased circulating zzso and normal zzso zzso Moreover, zzso tolerance and zzso insulin sensitivity were zzso zzso muscle zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso content were not affected, suggesting that skeletal muscle insulin sensitivity is normal in transgenic obese zzso Our results indicate the key role of zzso in the control of zzso zzso in zzso tissue and, thus, the contribution of zzso to fat zzso Moreover, they suggest that higher fat mass without increased circulating zzso does not lead to insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes in these zzso
