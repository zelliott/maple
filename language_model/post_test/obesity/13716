zzso zzso differences distinguish the related zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice are more susceptible to diabetes induction by a zzso obesity zzso diabetes zzso or by zzso zzso zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether the zzso differences were the important genetic background zzso determining zzso strain zzso or resistance to these zzso zzso Diabetes zzso of zzso zzso zzso mice was compared with that of the parental zzso and B6 zzso In addition, diabetes severity was studied in zzso X zzso and zzso zzso mice and an zzso segregation analysis was zzso zzso zzso genes expressed in a dominant fashion in the F1 generation, and were transmitted to zzso zzso males without apparent zzso No association between zzso zzso and zzso diabetes resistance was found in response to either the zzso zzso or to zzso zzso associated with development of zzso in zzso zzso also occurred in the zzso zzso zzso However, an apparent interaction between zzso zzso the zzso zzso (on zzso zzso and male gender zzso zzso was indicated by a segregation ratio distortion in recovery of this zzso A more moderate diabetes in some zzso zzso females suggested that zzso genes controlling sex steroid metabolism were the important zzso of zzso sensitivities in the zzso zzso In support of the latter, strain differences were demonstrated in activity levels of steroid zzso which is regulated by a zzso gene likely expressed on both the X and Y zzso and which may control tissue levels of active zzso and zzso We show that the zzso F1 hybrids exhibit the higher activity associated with the zzso zzso
