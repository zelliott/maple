We examined the influence of genetic variation of the zzso cassette (ABC) zzso zzso on zzso B zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

Very zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were determined in 47 men zzso mass index zzso zzso using stable isotope and zzso modeling to estimate production rate zzso fractional zzso rate zzso and zzso to zzso zzso Relative to the zzso zzso subjects carrying the zzso zzso zzso had significantly decreased plasma zzso of zzso zzso and zzso lower zzso of zzso and higher zzso to zzso conversion zzso The zzso and zzso of zzso were also significantly higher with zzso zzso zzso No association was found with zzso zzso Compared with zzso or zzso zzso carriers had significantly higher plasma zzso zzso and lower zzso zzso During multiple zzso analysis including age, zzso model assessment score, plasma zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso were independent zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively zzso 

Variation in the ABC zzso zzso appears to independently influence the metabolism of zzso zzso in zzso zzso This may have therapeutic implications for the management of zzso in these zzso
