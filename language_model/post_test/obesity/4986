Previous studies suggest that blockade of zzso 3 and 4 receptors zzso markedly zzso the chronic zzso effects of zzso Although obesity has been reported to be associated with zzso zzso it is unclear whether obesity alters the cardiovascular and zzso effects of chronic zzso zzso zzso we tested whether the cardiovascular and zzso actions of zzso zzso are attenuated in zzso rats fed a high-fat diet zzso zzso compared with rats fed a standard zzso zzso zzso for 12 zzso A zzso steel zzso was placed in the lateral zzso for zzso infusion, and zzso and zzso zzso were implanted for measurement of mean zzso pressure zzso 24 zzso and IV zzso After a zzso control period, rats were infused with zzso zzso zzso II (10 zzso zzso for 10 days followed by a zzso recovery zzso zzso rats were heavier zzso versus zzso zzso with zzso more visceral fat than zzso rats, zzso zzso versus zzso zzso and insulin zzso zzso rats also had higher zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso II infusion significantly increased zzso in zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso decreased caloric intake zzso and zzso zzso zzso and reduced insulin levels in both groups by approximately zzso Thus, the zzso and cardiovascular actions of chronic zzso zzso are preserved in zzso zzso supporting a potential role for the zzso zzso system in obesity zzso
