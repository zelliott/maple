Japanese zzso zzso zzso is recognized as the monkey species inhabiting the northernmost area in the world, and thus likely to possess unique zzso mechanisms to resist cold weather in zzso We report that obese females are present in the zzso group of Japanese monkey reared in an open zzso of the zzso Research Institute, zzso zzso 

Eight of 12 females were zzso as obese, showing percentage body fat of over zzso The levels of serum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso measured in these obese monkeys were significantly higher than those of non-obese peers of the same group zzso zzso 4; zzso zzso zzso zzso and another Japanese monkey group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso however, serum levels of zzso insulin, zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not differ between obese and non-obese zzso Few serum zzso parameters such as zzso and cholesterol showed lower levels in obese monkeys than their non-obese zzso 

These results show that these obese monkeys in the zzso group have not developed zzso zzso such as zzso In the zzso group, the frequency of obese individuals was high in some maternal zzso suggesting that genetic factors responsible for obesity may have been inherited in these zzso
