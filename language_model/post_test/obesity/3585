zzso zzso mice are susceptible to high-fat diet zzso obesity and have been used in metabolism research for many zzso However, the genetic component of zzso obesity has not yet been zzso This study reports evidence for a paternal transmission of zzso obesity and a correlated expression of zzso and zzso zzso expressed gene 3) imprinted zzso We found that zzso mice are resistant to zzso obesity compared to zzso zzso zzso we generated and analyzed zzso crosses between these mice, zzso zzso F1 progeny with B6 father and zzso F1 progeny with zzso zzso The zzso F1 mice were more sensitive to zzso obesity compared to zzso F1 mice, suggesting a paternal transmission of zzso zzso zzso analysis of imprinted genes in zzso revealed that zzso influences the expression of some of the imprinted genes in zzso tissue in B6 and zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso and zzso which are zzso expressed imprinted genes involved in the regulation of body fat zzso were zzso in B6 and zzso F1 mice, which are susceptible to zzso zzso but not in zzso and zzso F1 mice, which are zzso Furthermore, in zzso analysis showed that zzso but not zzso had an zzso effect on zzso induced zzso expression in zzso Taken together, our findings suggest that the zzso of zzso and zzso imprinted genes in zzso may be involved in the paternal transmission of zzso zzso
