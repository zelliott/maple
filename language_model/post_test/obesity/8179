Little is known about the body mass zzso for adults with class I zzso Our objective was to map the body mass zzso through zzso for young adults with class I obesity in the United zzso 

Data from the National zzso Study of Youth 1979 was used to generate a cohort of zzso men and women, aged zzso years with class I obesity in zzso zzso trajectory modeling was used to identify the number and shape of the body mass index zzso from 1990 to 2008 for this zzso 

By 2008, about zzso of men and women with class I obesity in 1990 experienced a body mass index increase zzso zzso The trajectory analyses showed that roughly one third of the sample were on 1 of 2 body mass index trajectory groups that culminated with an average zzso well above 35 zzso 

The large majority of young adults with class I obesity are likely to gain weight over zzso For many, the weight gain will be significant and greatly increase their risk of zzso zzso and reduced life zzso As a result, zzso surgery or other intensive weight management options might be zzso
