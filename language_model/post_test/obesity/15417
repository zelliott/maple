The molecular zzso of energy expenditure are presently zzso Recently, two zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso have been zzso zzso is expressed widely, and zzso is expressed abundantly in skeletal zzso Both could be important regulators of energy zzso In this paper, we investigated whether altered zzso and zzso zzso levels are associated with obesity or weight zzso 

zzso zzso long and short zzso levels were examined in skeletal muscle and in white zzso tissue of lean, obese, and zzso individuals by zzso protection zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in skeletal muscle was similar in lean individuals and in individuals with obesity at stable zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso zzso were decreased by 38% zzso and zzso zzso respectively, in zzso zzso patients with obesity at stable zzso In contrast, zzso zzso levels were increased by zzso in skeletal muscle of zzso zzso subjects with zzso In a different set of patients, mostly lean, zzso zzso in skeletal muscle was decreased by zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso weight reduction at stable zzso zzso of zzso zzso in subcutaneous zzso tissue was similar in lean individuals and in individuals with zzso and was increased by zzso during active weight zzso 

zzso at reduced body weight in humans is associated with a decrease in zzso zzso in zzso It is possible that reduced zzso expression could contribute to decreased energy expenditure in zzso zzso zzso
