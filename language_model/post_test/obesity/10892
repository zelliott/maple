To study whether insulin sensitivity and insulin response are altered by zzso treatment in obese patients with mild essential zzso 

a zzso zzso zzso randomized, parallel group zzso 

77 patients with mild essential hypertension and body mass zzso 27 were zzso A zzso zzso period of 1-3 weeks was followed by zzso weeks of zzso treatment with either zzso or zzso Patients receiving zzso drugs underwent a zzso zzso period zzso the zzso zzso zzso sensitivity was evaluated by zzso zzso clamp zzso zzso response was measured during intravenous zzso tolerance zzso 

72 patients completed the zzso No serious adverse events were zzso The zzso infusion rate zzso zzso and insulin sensitivity index zzso zzso increased in the zzso subjects by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, whereas the values in the zzso group remained zzso In the zzso zzso zzso with zzso ratio zzso at zzso zzso infusion rate and insulin sensitivity index increased by zzso whereas values in the zzso group remained zzso A zzso comparison showed a statistical significant difference in the M value zzso zzso zzso and a borderline statistical difference in the zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso in zzso of zzso No statistically significant effects were seen in the zzso with a zzso zzso or zzso or zzso at zzso The insulin zzso in response to zzso stimulation was unaffected in zzso as well as in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso treatment improved insulin sensitivity in zzso obese patients with mild hypertension, but not in zzso obese subjects with mild hypertension, when compared to zzso zzso response to zzso stimulation was zzso The drug was well zzso
