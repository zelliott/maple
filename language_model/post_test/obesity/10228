Although zzso sleep zzso is strongly associated with zzso we have little understanding of how obesity may alter the mechanical properties of the zzso and the role of obesity in the zzso of sleep zzso 

The overall objective of this study was to determine the effect of obesity on zzso airway size and zzso wall tissue strain in lean and obese zzso zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging with zzso tissue tagging was performed in zzso spontaneously breathing lean zzso zzso 9) and obese zzso zzso 9) zzso zzso Images acquired during expiration and inspiration of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso were analyzed for airway size and zzso wall tissue strain, using zzso optical flow, and finite element zzso zzso in zzso airway area, lateral and zzso airway zzso and tissue strain zzso zzso and direction of zzso in the lateral and zzso zzso walls were compared by analysis of zzso zzso at p zzso 

Compared with their lean zzso obese rats had the following significant findings: reduced zzso airway zzso area during inspiration and zzso smaller increases in airway area during zzso and decreased lateral airway zzso during zzso zzso strain in the zzso walls showed no significant differences between obese and lean zzso 

These findings suggest that obesity results in a mechanical zzso that decreases zzso airway size and prevents a normal airway response to a given change in zzso wall tissue zzso
