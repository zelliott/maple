In zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in multiple individual zzso were investigated in conscious zzso zzso rats, which when obese are zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso metabolism zzso by zzso was zzso higher in obese zzso than in lean zzso rats, suggesting that obese rats were quite responsive to their zzso zzso zzso 55 zzso In obese compared with lean rats, tissue zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso was increased by 15, 12, and 6 times in zzso zzso zzso white zzso zzso multiplied by zzso in brown zzso zzso increased by 50% in skin from zzso region but not in that from zzso zzso or zzso area; and increased twofold in zzso but similar in heart, in zzso zzso and in total muscular mass of zzso Our data establish that in young obese rats the zzso white zzso tissue was a major zzso tissue whose capacity for zzso disposal compared with that of half the muscular zzso zzso tissue could therefore play an important role in the zzso of zzso in obese rats in the face of their increased zzso zzso
