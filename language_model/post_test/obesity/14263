The influence of obesity on protein dynamics is not clearly zzso We have designed experiments to test the hypothesis that obesity zzso the stimulation of zzso protein synthesis after zzso zzso zzso mice were zzso into 2 groups: group 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso was fed a zzso zzso diet, whereas group 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso was fed a zzso zzso diet ad zzso for 9 zzso On the experiment day, all mice were zzso for 6 hours and given an zzso injection of zzso They were then zzso into 2 zzso and either given a sham saline zzso or a zzso zzso Rates of protein synthesis were determined via the incorporation of zzso (5 hours zzso into total zzso muscle zzso total liver zzso and plasma zzso zzso feeding led to an increase in total body fat zzso zzso and zzso fat pad weights zzso zzso and elevated zzso plasma zzso levels zzso zzso zzso obesity zzso did not affect zzso rates of skeletal muscle protein zzso but did impair the zzso of skeletal muscle protein synthesis in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso slightly reduced zzso rates of synthesis of total zzso proteins and plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso but did not affect the synthesis of either in response to the meal zzso In conclusion, there are zzso in zzso protein metabolism in the zzso mouse model of zzso zzso This model may prove to be helpful in future studies that explore the mechanisms that account for altered protein dynamics in zzso
