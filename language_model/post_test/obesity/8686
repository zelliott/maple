No papers have zzso documented zzso studies of cases involving the inflammation of zzso gallbladder or examined surgical difficulties on the basis of pathological zzso 

On the basis of the zzso inflammation findings on the zzso zzso of zzso patients who underwent zzso zzso zzso the factors affecting the technical difficulty of the operation were examined through zzso clinical findings (13 zzso diagnostic imaging zzso zzso and blood test findings (6 zzso using zzso zzso 

In accordance with the zzso zzso of inflammation findings for the zzso zzso the inflammation findings on the zzso gallbladder indicated a higher correlation with the time required for gallbladder dissection zzso zzso zzso minutes) than with the operation time zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, the technical difficulty of the operation was judged according to the time required for gallbladder zzso For the zzso findings on zzso patients who underwent successful zzso the most influential factors on the time required for gallbladder dissection were the presence of abnormal findings on zzso zzso the degree of fever, obesity index, zzso gallbladder zzso and zzso duct zzso According to the multiple zzso equation of these five factors, the gallbladder dissection for the 19 patients who underwent conversion to open zzso zzso due to extreme inflammation was calculated to require zzso zzso zzso minutes, and the patients who showed a gallbladder dissection time longer than zzso minutes were judged to have high technical difficulty predicted from the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso sensitivity was zzso specificity was zzso accuracy was zzso positive zzso value was zzso and negative zzso value was zzso Next, each finding was scored on the basis of a multiple zzso equation of five factors, and the technical difficulty of the operation was zzso using these zzso The score of the patients who underwent conversion to OC was zzso zzso zzso and the patients who showed a score higher than 6 were judged to have high technical zzso Almost the same results as in the aforementioned zzso evaluation were obtained using these zzso 

The judgment using the scores was satisfactory in terms of the simplicity of evaluating the technical difficulties associated with each patient and the ease of obtaining information for each zzso The zzso of technical difficulty using the scores is useful for zzso prediction of which patients will have difficulties in gallbladder dissection and the conversion to OC in zzso Our results suggest that the consideration of technical difficulties is important for conducting safe operations with avoiding zzso zzso
