We recently demonstrated that in a zzso model of obesity zzso yellow zzso there is a selective zzso resistance with preservation of the sympathetic actions despite loss of appetite and zzso actions of systemic zzso Here, we examined whether selective zzso resistance exists in zzso mice during central neural administration of zzso In zzso obese mice and lean controls, we tested the effects of single zzso zzso injection of zzso or vehicle on food intake and body weight in the conscious state and on zzso sympathetic nerve activity during zzso zzso obese mice had higher zzso mean zzso pressure zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso than lean controls (90 zzso 2 zzso zzso In lean controls zzso to 10), zzso zzso caused a zzso decrease in body weight zzso and food intake zzso For example, zzso zzso (3 zzso decreased food intake and body weight, respectively, by zzso zzso zzso g zzso and zzso zzso zzso g zzso in lean zzso However, in zzso obese mice zzso to 10), zzso zzso did not significantly decrease food intake or body zzso zzso zzso caused in zzso a significant and zzso increase in zzso sympathetic nerve activity that was of the same magnitude in the lean and zzso obese zzso The rise in zzso sympathetic nerve activity induced by zzso zzso (3 zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso in lean controls and 275 zzso zzso zzso in the zzso obese zzso In zzso this study indicates that selective zzso resistance in zzso obese mice occurs with central neural administration of zzso suggesting that selective zzso resistance in this model is not due to a zzso in zzso transport across the blood brain zzso It seems to result instead from zzso in the central neural pathways zzso effects of zzso
