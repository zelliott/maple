zzso and oral zzso are independent risk factors for zzso zzso and their combined effect is stronger than the sum of the isolated zzso It was the objective of this study to investigate the interaction between obesity and zzso at the level of zzso zzso zzso zzso and inflammation in a mouse zzso Female zzso mice were fed a standard fat diet zzso or a high fat diet zzso to induce nutritional zzso After 14 weeks, while maintaining their diet, mice were orally treated eight days with 1 zzso zzso or vehicle zzso per group), and subsequently subjected to an inferior zzso vein zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso model resulted in an increased zzso weight in zzso zzso mice zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso mice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso reduced zzso weight, which was significant for the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso As compared to zzso zzso zzso feeding significantly increased plasma levels of zzso factor VIII, combined factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso causing a zzso shift of the zzso zzso zzso had no significant effects on this profile with either diet, whereas serum zzso A and zzso inflammatory zzso were minimally zzso The synergistic effect of obesity and zzso on the zzso zzso risk in women could not be translated into the mouse zzso zzso zzso administration in a mouse zzso zzso model zzso the zzso zzso associated with nutritionally induced zzso despite a comparable activated plasma zzso profile in zzso and zzso obese zzso
