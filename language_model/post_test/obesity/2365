zzso zzso of left zzso wall thickness zzso and left zzso chamber diameter zzso allow calculation of expected left zzso weight zzso but not of zzso breadth zzso so that zzso of left zzso zzso zzso is not zzso zzso hearts, excluding coronary heart disease, and comparison specimens without zzso were compiled into a series of 78 forensic zzso wherein zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso was measured in zzso and zzso zzso zzso A series of clinical cases tabulating zzso and zzso was assembled from readily available zzso From zzso data, a zzso equation was derived to predict zzso from zzso and zzso zzso this equation to the clinical data produced a scatter plot closely resembling that in the zzso zzso The equation derived here appears to provide valid predictions of zzso sizes expected in zzso zzso The finding is the first of its kind and requires further testing for validation or zzso This is offered as a provisional way to improve the determination of zzso using zzso zzso How this improvement might enhance understanding of the mechanisms for zzso is briefly zzso thus generating working zzso
