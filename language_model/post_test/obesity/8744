Over the zzso most adult humans are able to maintain body energy stores through the process of energy balance, which regulates how much energy is consumed to match how much energy is zzso Energy expenditure is required for resting zzso rate to maintain basic zzso functions zzso heart zzso muscle function, zzso and zzso zzso and store food that is consumed as well as for physical zzso zzso zzso rate is the largest component of daily energy zzso and physical zzso energy expenditure is the most zzso zzso studies in children and adults have shown that energy zzso including physical zzso energy zzso are similar in lean versus obese subjects, especially after controlling for differences in body zzso A major limitation for most studies that have examined the role of energy expenditure in the cause of obesity is their zzso zzso Some zzso studies support the idea that reduced energy expenditure is a risk factor for the development of zzso but most do zzso There are several possibilities that could account for such zzso zzso First, the ambiguous findings in the literature might be explained by the possibility that differences in energy expenditure and physical activity and their impact on the development of obesity are different at the various stages of zzso Second, there could be individual differences in the impact of altered energy expenditure on the regulation of energy zzso The impact of energy expenditure on the cause of obesity could vary among different zzso of the population zzso boys versus girls and different ethnic zzso and could have a differential effect within individuals at different stages of zzso A specific example is the lower energy expenditure in zzso Indians, which zzso to increased risk of zzso It remains to be seen whether the lower zzso rates that have been observed in African-Americans will relate to subsequent weight zzso It is conceivable that susceptible individuals fail to compensate for periodic fluctuations in energy zzso Third, given that obesity can arise as a result of a small energy balance over time, it is unlikely that existing techniques are capable of measuring such small zzso Finally, it can be argued that a focus on energy metabolism as a possible explanation of obesity is unlikely to yield interesting information because of the wide range in energy expenditure in the population even after adjusting for body zzso The major dependent variable that needs to be examined in relation to the cause of obesity is not energy expenditure but change in energy balance over time and the ability to regulate body energy zzso Given that the sudden change in obesity prevalence has occurred during a time of rapid environmental and cultural changes, additional focus on the behavioral and environmental effects on regulation of energy balance is zzso
