The purpose of this study was to assess relations among zzso weight, and body mass index zzso at different ages from childhood to adulthood, and to examine long-term relations among timing of zzso zzso and zzso zzso data from the 1958 British birth cohort (all children born between March 3rd and 9th, 1958) were zzso Height and weight were measured at ages 7, 11, 16, 23 zzso and 33 zzso zzso status was assessed at ages 11 and 16 zzso Data for zzso females and zzso males were zzso Adult height was well predicted from childhood, with strong correlations zzso zzso zzso for both zzso between height at ages 7 and 33 zzso zzso for zzso were weaker, especially between childhood and early adulthood zzso zzso zzso for males and zzso for zzso ages 7 and 33 zzso although they increased with increasing zzso Although the fattest children had the highest risks of adult zzso most obese adults had not been fat at earlier zzso only zzso and zzso of obese zzso men and women, respectively, had been fat at age 7 zzso A strong and evenly graded association was found between timing of zzso and zzso with higher mean zzso for the earlier zzso at ages zzso zzso The moderate prediction of adult zzso in this large and zzso sample suggests that although the prevention of childhood zzso may be desirable, most obese adults could not be identified from their childhood zzso and zzso preventive strategies need to be zzso
