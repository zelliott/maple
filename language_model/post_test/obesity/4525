zzso zzso in the plasma of mice were characterized by zzso zzso and zzso zzso genetically obese zzso mice exhibited zzso zzso with lean zzso largely zzso to an increase in the concentration of cholesterol in zzso zzso Plasma zzso of zzso and zzso were not markedly increased in genetically obese zzso zzso The formation of zzso in liver and plasma was investigated with zzso zzso The synthesis of zzso zzso and zzso from zzso or zzso was enhanced in zzso mice, compared with lean zzso The rate of entry of zzso into zzso calculated from the zzso of incorporation of zzso from zzso into plasma zzso was increased in zzso mice zzso of fatty zzso compared with zzso in lean zzso zzso The removal from plasma of zzso zzso zzso acid was increased in zzso mice zzso zzso compared with zzso in lean zzso Similar results were obtained with an injected zzso emulsion zzso zzso From these zzso estimates of the rates of turnover of plasma zzso in mice zzso on a mixed diet, female, 3 months old) are about zzso of fatty zzso in zzso mice, and zzso in lean zzso zzso The major precursor of zzso and plasma zzso in lean and zzso mice was calculated to be plasma free fatty zzso zzso These results are discussed, in zzso with the role of the liver in zzso metabolism in mice, especially in relation to genetic zzso
