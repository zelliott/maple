To determine the relative changes in position of zzso zzso from zzso to upright patient position and factors affecting zzso tip zzso 

One hundred zzso different zzso zzso were placed through the zzso or jugular veins zzso and zzso positions were documented with use of zzso zzso at the time of zzso zzso chest zzso were obtained with the patient in the upright position within 48 hours after zzso zzso tip positions were numbered from 1 to 8, with 1 representing the zzso zzso zzso junction and 8, the lower right zzso Patient sex and weight, the site of zzso entry, and the size and type of zzso were correlated with the relative change in position on the follow-up chest zzso 

There was a statistically significant zzso zzso change in zzso position on the follow-up chest zzso with a mean difference of zzso zzso positions (usually zzso atrium initially to low superior zzso zzso on zzso zzso tip migration was greater for zzso in the zzso zzso in zzso and in obese zzso 

The zzso tip zzso significantly from the initial position at the time of placement as compared to when the patient assumes the upright zzso This knowledge is important in achieving the desired final zzso zzso
