zzso zzso in the fat mass and zzso zzso gene have been linked with obesity and type 2 diabetes in European zzso We aimed to test the role of zzso genetic zzso in obesity and type 2 diabetes in the Chinese zzso 

We zzso 19 zzso zzso zzso spanning from the 3' end of the neighboring zzso gene to the zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso We analyzed their associations with obesity zzso case and zzso control zzso type 2 diabetes zzso case and zzso control zzso and zzso traits in zzso zzso 

Among the 19 zzso the zzso A zzso was strongly associated with obesity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the Chinese zzso The odds ratio for obesity was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the AA zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the AT zzso compared with the zzso zzso Each additional copy of the zzso A zzso was associated with a zzso increase of approximately zzso zzso The zzso A zzso was substantially less common in the Chinese population than in the European population zzso zzso zzso We did not find significant associations of the 19 zzso with type 2 diabetes or other zzso zzso 

zzso variation in the zzso gene is strongly associated with obesity and zzso in the Chinese zzso The risk zzso is less common in the Chinese population, but its effect size on zzso is comparable with that in the European zzso
