The prevalence of obesity is over zzso in many developed zzso zzso is strongly associated with an increased risk of fatal and chronic conditions such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 zzso Therefore it has become a major public health concern for many zzso zzso devices are a relatively novel approach to promoting dietary zzso The new generation of devices are zzso and use interactive electronic media to facilitate teaching and zzso zzso has grown out of recent developments in information and communication technology, such as the Internet, interactive computer zzso interactive television and mobile zzso The aim of this study is to assess the zzso of zzso devices as a method of promoting weight loss via dietary zzso 

An economic evaluation was performed using decision zzso zzso Outcomes were expressed in terms of zzso zzso zzso and costs were estimated from a health services zzso All zzso estimates were derived from the zzso A systematic review was undertaken to derive the estimate of relative treatment zzso 

The base case results from the zzso Economic zzso Model zzso suggested that the incremental zzso ratio was approximately zzso per zzso zzso zzso compared to conventional zzso This finding was robust to most alternative zzso except a much lower fixed cost of providing zzso zzso zzso value of perfect information zzso analysis showed that while the individual level zzso was arguably zzso the population level value was between zzso and zzso at a willingness to pay between zzso to zzso per additional zzso 

The current economic evidence base suggests that zzso devices for managing the weight of obese individuals are unlikely to be cost-effective unless their fixed costs are much lower than estimated or future devices prove to be much more zzso
