zzso and an enhanced insulin response to oral zzso tolerance test are associated with therapy resistance in zzso In order to explore this association further we studied the insulin sensitivity of subjects with essential hypertension resistant to triple drug therapy zzso with the zzso insulin clamp zzso Well controlled zzso matched for age, gender and body mass index zzso served as zzso Male subjects (7 zzso and 7 zzso were further investigated by zzso of zzso zzso zzso since structural conditions in skeletal muscles might have a role in the above zzso zzso of zzso drug therapy, zzso zzso had a lower insulin sensitivity index than controls zzso zzso In spite of the zzso zzso ratio zzso in the zzso males tended to be higher zzso zzso zzso clearance tended to be lower in zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated with a reduced muscular zzso density zzso zzso zzso p zzso The average zzso muscle zzso area was larger in zzso subjects zzso zzso The mean muscle zzso area correlated with zzso serum insulin zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso of the muscular zzso bed appears to be related to zzso zzso muscle zzso might be an effect of the growth factor properties of insulin and could possibly zzso to zzso of smooth muscle in the resistance zzso This factor might contribute to the association of zzso and hypertension and zzso the response to zzso zzso
