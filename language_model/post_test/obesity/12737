The obese patients undergoing upper abdominal surgery are at particularly high risk to develop zzso pulmonary zzso and zzso is one of the most common ones zzso During the initial zzso period, they are often advised to maintain a zzso position to zzso zzso Although chest physical therapy usually avoids a zzso position, no published data indicate this position as being able to induce zzso in obese patients following upper abdominal zzso We studied zzso adult obese patients without zzso disease undergoing upper abdominal zzso All patients were tested for 5 minutes during the first 3 zzso days in each of 3 zzso zzso zzso lateral zzso and 15 degrees of zzso lateral zzso zzso A statistically significant difference in oxygen zzso related to position was found only on the first zzso day between zzso and zzso lateral zzso zzso The difference in mean zzso value between these 2 positions, however, was only zzso and no significant correlation between the magnitude of obesity and the mean zzso difference was zzso Although zzso oxygen zzso demonstrated statistically significant daily improvement during the first 3 zzso days, the mean zzso values for any 2 consecutive days differed by less than zzso Thus, in obese patients following upper abdominal surgery, 15 degrees of zzso lateral zzso and zzso lateral zzso positions do not induce clinically significant zzso and can be used if necessary and zzso In obese patients with borderline zzso supplemental oxygen used zzso can maintain adequate zzso and allow aggressive zzso
