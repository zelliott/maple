The aim of this study is to determine what factors have been zzso in prospective studies, to predict the zzso of zzso 

We performed a systematic review of zzso literature from 1994 to 2004 to determine what factors predict the development of asthma in both children and zzso This search strategy yielded 40 studies, with 36 providing some estimate of asthma zzso for the total sample and or a specific zzso 

Annual estimated zzso of zzso asthma ranged from zzso to zzso per 1000 zzso zzso factors for incident asthma among children zzso male sex, zzso zzso parental history of zzso zzso zzso and infections, zzso and exposure to indoor zzso tobacco smoke and outdoor zzso zzso factors for zzso asthma included female sex, airway zzso lifestyle factors, and zzso zzso 

zzso factors for asthma include both modifiable and zzso ones, and they vary between children and zzso This review of prospective evidence supports tobacco and smoke avoidance as an intervention for the primary prevention of childhood zzso During adolescence and adulthood, targeting lifestyle factors like obesity and smoking or reducing occupational zzso are the best opportunities for asthma zzso Before specific public health recommendations can be made, however, additional zzso research is needed to better characterize target populations and identify appropriate settings for multifaceted asthma zzso
