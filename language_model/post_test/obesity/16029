zzso zzso in genetically obese zzso zzso rats significantly reduced body weight and energy gains and zzso energy expenditure (by zzso the zzso response to food (by zzso and brown zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso capacity (by zzso compared with zzso zzso obese zzso These changes in energy balance in obese zzso rats were reversed by zzso replacement (1 zzso but the increased BAT activity was only partly restored to zzso zzso had only small effects on energy balance in lean zzso rats compared with zzso zzso lean controls but increased the acute zzso response to food and BAT zzso zzso zzso these effects were inhibited by replacement of zzso rats with zzso The results suggest that zzso in the zzso axis play a fundamental role in the development and maintenance of genetic zzso
