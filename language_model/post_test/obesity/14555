Foods with contrasting zzso index when incorporated into a zzso are able to zzso modify zzso and zzso However, little is known about whether this is dependent on the size of the zzso The purposes of this study were: zzso to determine if the differential impact on blood zzso and insulin responses induced by contrasting zzso foods is similar when provided in meals of different sizes, zzso zzso to determine the relationship between the total meal zzso load and the observed serum zzso and insulin zzso 

Twelve obese women zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso received 4 different meals in random zzso Two meals had a low zzso index zzso and two had a zzso index zzso Both meal types were given as two meal sizes with energy supply corresponding to zzso and zzso of predicted zzso zzso zzso Thus, meals with three different zzso loads zzso zzso and 22 zzso were zzso Blood samples were taken before and after each meal to determine zzso zzso zzso insulin and zzso zzso over a zzso zzso 

An almost zzso higher serum zzso and insulin incremental area under the curve zzso over 2 h for the zzso versus zzso index same sized meals was observed zzso zzso however, for the serum zzso response in small meals this was not significant zzso zzso zzso zzso meal zzso load was associated with 2 and 5 h serum zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso and insulin zzso zzso zzso p zzso incremental and total zzso In fact, when comparing the two meals with similar zzso load but differing zzso amount and type, very similar serum zzso and insulin responses were zzso No differences were observed for serum zzso acids and zzso profile in response to meal zzso zzso 

This study showed that foods of contrasting zzso index induced a zzso comparable difference in serum insulin response when provided in both small and large zzso The same was true for the serum zzso response but only in large zzso zzso load was useful in predicting the acute impact on blood zzso and insulin responses within the context of mixed zzso
