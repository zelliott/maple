To determine the relative zzso of specific zzso zzso analysis zzso prediction equations and zzso as zzso of zzso relevant general zzso 

zzso zzso men and women from the Third National Health and Nutrition zzso zzso zzso We examined the correlations between zzso and percentage body fat based on 51 different zzso zzso blood pressure, and blood levels of zzso zzso zzso cholesterol, and zzso which are known to reflect zzso while controlling for other zzso of these zzso zzso 

zzso consistently had one of the highest correlations across biological zzso and no zzso measure was zzso zzso body fat estimated from zzso was minimally zzso of the zzso markers independent of zzso 

These results suggest that zzso is not superior to zzso as a predictor of overall zzso in a general zzso
