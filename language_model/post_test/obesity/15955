zzso is associated with an increased prevalence of zzso especially in women, and appears to be more severe in the zzso This study aimed to determine if obese subjects have a specific asthma zzso 

zzso consecutive obese subjects zzso mass index zzso or zzso 30 zzso and 44 consecutive zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso all with zzso completed an asthma control zzso and underwent zzso challenge with symptom perception scores, and zzso induction for differential cell zzso zzso waist zzso and zzso ratio also were zzso 

Despite similar zzso flows, zzso response, airway responsiveness to zzso and symptom perception scores, asthma control was poorer in obese subjects than in zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso Total lung capacity zzso zzso zzso zzso reserve volume zzso zzso functional residual capacity zzso zzso and residual volume zzso zzso zzso were lower in obese subjects than in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso counts were similar in both groups, although there was an inverse correlation between zzso zzso and waist circumference and a trend for a similar relationship for zzso Blood serum zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were higher in obese subjects than in zzso zzso 

zzso people with asthma had poorer asthma control than zzso zzso despite similar symptoms zzso zzso and systemic inflammatory characteristics and the specific pattern of pulmonary function changes suggest a different zzso of asthma in these zzso
