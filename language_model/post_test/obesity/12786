To determine whether any zzso is independently related with parameters of body fat zzso and distribution in obese zzso 

zzso insulin and zzso levels zzso testosterone zzso free testosterone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sex hormone binding zzso zzso and the parameters of body fat zzso and distribution zzso mass index, zzso ratio, total body fat volume zzso visceral zzso tissue area zzso and subcutaneous zzso tissue area zzso were determined in a population of zzso obese zzso 

28 zzso obese women, recruited at the zzso University Hospital zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and SAT area were zzso by zzso zzso zzso levels were measured by zzso 

zzso showed an inverse correlation with zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and SAT zzso zzso P zzso zzso was zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and SAT zzso zzso p zzso T was found to be zzso related with zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso was positively correlated with zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso did not show significant associations with zzso zzso or any zzso zzso multiple zzso were performed for all zzso one of the zzso zzso was considered as the dependent variable for each analysis, and insulin, zzso SAT and all other zzso were entered into the zzso zzso zzso was the only hormone to show an independent association zzso with both SAT zzso zzso P zzso and zzso zzso zzso P zzso whereas zzso showed an independent positive correlation with SAT zzso zzso P zzso 

Among the zzso zzso seems to be the most sensitive to body fat zzso in zzso obese zzso
