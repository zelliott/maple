The zzso zzso zzso hormone zzso referred to here as zzso zzso extensive zzso processing, and its in zzso activity is short lived due to rapid zzso The zzso control of zzso maturation and zzso is incompletely zzso Here we have provided insight into zzso zzso through the generation and analysis of a zzso mouse strain with reduced body fat compared with zzso Using zzso zzso we identified a maximum of 6 coding zzso including that zzso zzso zzso in the donor zzso zzso zzso revealed a marked zzso effect on zzso zzso expression in brain zzso zzso studies using zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso removes the zzso zzso acid of zzso producing zzso which is not zzso We found that zzso was expressed in the zzso in zzso populations that send zzso to areas where zzso is released from zzso zzso The zzso of zzso activity by small zzso zzso zzso administered peripherally or centrally decreased food intake in both zzso and obese zzso Furthermore, zzso mice had elevated levels of zzso in the zzso and were zzso and shorter than the zzso controls on a regular zzso zzso they were also resistant to high-fat zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso is an important component of zzso signaling and weight maintenance via control of active zzso zzso
