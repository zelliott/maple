A clinical study of 62 patients with zzso zzso zzso has suggested 2 pathways in the zzso of the spinal zzso In the first pathway, the patients develop an initial zzso due to the loss of zzso muscle thus placing the intrinsic zzso spine in an unstable zzso The spine then develops a lateral curve zzso by pelvic zzso In the final form, zzso rotation of the spine and pelvis occurs to produce a severe zzso In the second zzso the intrinsic spine assumes the more stable position of zzso with a level zzso This position remains relatively unchanged during the period of wheelchair confinement even though muscle deterioration zzso A significant increase in the severity of the zzso occurs with age in those patients with unstable zzso None of the other factors examined affected the severity of the lateral zzso A spinal brace has been designed to keep the spine extended and the pelvis level while the patients sits in his zzso The purpose is to encourage the zzso progression of muscular deficiencies to follow the second zzso Various modifications of wheelchairs also may help to maintain spinal zzso
