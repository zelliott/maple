The role of the zzso system in the feeding effects of peripheral zzso zzso zzso and zzso was investigated using the zzso zzso mouse as a model of abnormal zzso zzso Furthermore, we examined whether the zzso expression of zzso protein in zzso mice results in complete zzso zzso by studying the effects of peripheral zzso hormone zzso and zzso on food zzso 

Adult zzso mice were studied in the zzso state zzso weeks) and obese state zzso zzso Animals received zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (2 zzso (all 24 h zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso controls received zzso zzso A separate cohort of zzso zzso zzso controls received the same zzso dose or zzso Food intake was measured at 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 h zzso and compared in all four zzso Plasma zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were measured using zzso zzso 

At 2 h zzso zzso reduced food intake in zzso and obese zzso mice, whereas zzso had no zzso Plasma zzso levels were significantly reduced in zzso and obese zzso mice compared to zzso zzso zzso administration of zzso and zzso acutely suppressed feeding zzso zzso in zzso and obese zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso and obese zzso mice to zzso suggests that the zzso system may not be essential for the zzso effects of this zzso zzso antagonism by zzso protein in zzso mice may be sufficient to block the effects of zzso but not zzso zzso zzso and zzso The mechanism underlying zzso resistance in zzso mice may result from antagonism of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso supporting a role for the zzso system in zzso zzso zzso
