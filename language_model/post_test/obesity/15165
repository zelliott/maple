Health behaviors are known risk factors for zzso cancer and are more common in low socioeconomic status zzso zzso We evaluated the extent to which behavioral risk factors and body mass index zzso explain zzso disparities in zzso cancer zzso overall and by tumor zzso 

We analyzed prospective National Institutes of zzso Diet and Health Study data on zzso zzso participants who were recruited in zzso from six US states and two metropolitan areas and followed through zzso zzso baseline data on risk factors for zzso cancer, including health behaviors, were obtained using zzso zzso was measured by zzso education and zzso zzso The outcome was primary incident invasive zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to estimate the association between zzso and risk of incident zzso cancer, with adjustment for age, sex, race and ethnicity, family history, and state of zzso The model estimates were used to derive percentage mediation by behavioral risk zzso zzso zzso confidence intervals were obtained through zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso participants developed zzso cancer during zzso zzso differences in prevalence of physical zzso zzso diet, smoking, and zzso weight each explained between zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the association between education and risk of zzso cancer and between zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the association between neighborhood zzso and risk of zzso zzso Health behaviors and zzso combined explained approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso of the association of education and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso of the association of neighborhood zzso with risk of zzso zzso The percentage explained by all factors and zzso combined was largest for right colon zzso and smallest for zzso zzso 

A substantial proportion of the socioeconomic disparity in risk of zzso zzso cancer, and particularly of right colon zzso may be attributable to the higher prevalence of adverse health behaviors in zzso zzso
