In zzso total zzso is not reduced to the degree predicted by low zzso levels, and free zzso levels are normal to zzso Total and free zzso may not reflect zzso biological activity because zzso cannot account for the zzso effects of zzso binding proteins on interactions between zzso and its zzso 

The aim of the study was to investigate the biological activity of zzso in zzso 

We conducted a zzso study at a General Clinical Research zzso 

Thirty-four healthy women (11 lean, 12 overweight, and 11 zzso of comparable age zzso mean, zzso zzso zzso zzso participated in the zzso 

There were no zzso 

We measured zzso zzso (as measured by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso using zzso pools of serum collected every 10 zzso for 24 zzso and zzso zzso and zzso 

Mean zzso zzso (R zzso zzso P zzso total zzso (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso levels were zzso associated with zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso levels were zzso Mean zzso zzso was similar in the groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso overall P zzso zzso Percentage zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was higher in obese subjects than both lean and overweight subjects zzso zzso zzso 

Despite low zzso zzso in obesity and decreasing zzso with increasing zzso zzso mean zzso zzso levels are not reduced in obese women and do not correlate with zzso or zzso zzso This argues against elevated zzso zzso as the zzso of reduced zzso zzso through a feedback mechanism in zzso
