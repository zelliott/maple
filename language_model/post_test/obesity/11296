zzso review with zzso 

To identify risk factors for zzso zzso of the knee, hip, and ankle, including joint injury, sport, physical activity, zzso and occupational activity, in all age zzso 

zzso is a significant health problem worldwide, affecting up to zzso of men and zzso of women over 60 years of zzso There has not been a comprehensive review examining modifiable physical risk factors associated with the onset of zzso This evidence is important to inform the zzso management of individuals following onset of zzso 

Twelve electronic databases were systematically zzso The studies selected met the following criteria: zzso original zzso zzso joint injury, sport activity, physical activity, zzso and/or occupational activity investigated as risk zzso zzso outcomes included zzso zzso knee, and/or zzso and zzso zzso component of study zzso The data extracted included study design, years of zzso study population, zzso definition, risk factors, and results zzso estimates reported or calculated where zzso The quality of evidence was assessed based on a modified version of the zzso and Black zzso 

Joint injury, zzso and occupational activity were associated with an increased risk of zzso of the knee and zzso Sport and physical activity produced inconsistent zzso Joint injury was identified as a significant risk factor for knee zzso zzso odds ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and hip zzso zzso odds ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso as was previous zzso with or without anterior cruciate ligament injury for knee zzso zzso odds ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso There is a paucity of research examining risk factors associated with ankle zzso this review identified only 2 studies with this zzso 

Joint injury, zzso and occupational activity are associated with an increased risk of knee and hip zzso Some findings remain inconclusive, including levels of physical activity and sport specificity in individuals who do not suffer an zzso Early identification of individuals at risk for zzso provides an opportunity for zzso management or other interventions to modify zzso zzso There is a need in the literature for additional high-quality studies, such as prospective cohort studies, that minimize potential bias in examining the relationship between physical risk factors and zzso
