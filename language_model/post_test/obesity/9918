Small daily positive energy imbalances of 200 to 800 zzso (about 50 to 200 zzso due to reduced resting energy expenditure zzso reduced zzso zzso or physical zzso are believed to zzso to zzso However, estimates of the magnitude of the weight gain often fail to account for concurrent changes in body composition and increases in maintenance energy requirements as weight increases and energy equilibrium is zzso Using previously reported data on body composition and zzso in women and the energy cost of tissue deposition, we used mathematical models to predict the theoretical effect of a persistent reduction in energy expenditure on long-term weight gain, assuming no adaptation in energy zzso The analyses indicate the following effects of a reduced level of energy expenditure in lean and obese zzso zzso zzso rises more slowly with increasing degrees of obesity due to a declining proportion of the more metabolically active zzso zzso so, for the same positive energy balance, a significantly greater weight gain is expected for obese than for lean women before energy equilibrium is zzso zzso due to the greater energy density of zzso zzso the time course of weight gain to achieve energy balance is longer for obese zzso in general, this is approximately five years for lean and ten years for obese zzso zzso the magnitude of weight gain of lean women in response to a reduced energy expenditure of 200 to 800 zzso is only about 3 to 15 zzso amounts insufficient to explain severe zzso
