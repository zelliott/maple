Whether obese and overweight stroke patients respond differently to intravenous zzso is zzso The purpose of this study is to determine the influence of obesity and risk components of zzso syndrome to stroke recovery in patients undergoing intravenous zzso 

Outcomes after zzso tissue zzso zzso treatment were compared between obese zzso mass index zzso zzso overweight zzso zzso zzso and normal weight zzso zzso zzso zzso The association between zzso risk components of the zzso syndrome, and dose of zzso tissue zzso zzso per zzso of body weight to stroke outcomes were assessed in a multivariable zzso 

A total of 169 patients zzso age 75 years; baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke zzso score zzso were zzso No differences in the frequency of symptomatic zzso zzso and poor functional recovery were observed among obese, overweight, and normal weight zzso A linear trend toward worse stroke recovery was observed in patients with a greater number of zzso risk components zzso for trend zzso By contrast, there were no significant associations between the number of risk components of zzso syndrome with respect to symptomatic zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso age, baseline stroke severity, and the number of risk components of the zzso syndrome accounted for zzso variation in functional recovery after intravenous zzso 

Acute stroke outcomes do not differ between obese and overweight patients undergoing intravenous zzso The number of zzso risk components contributes more significantly to functional recovery following intravenous zzso
