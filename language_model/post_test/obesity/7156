To study the relationships between zzso zzso zzso weight status, insulin, and insulin resistance in the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and insulin zzso insulin resistance index as zzso model assessment zzso body mass index zzso and percentage body fat based on zzso thickness zzso were determined in 42 obese zzso age 11 zzso and in 16 lean children of the same zzso The zzso model was used to calculate degree of insulin zzso Furthermore, the changes in zzso zzso insulin, and zzso in the course of 1 year were analyzed in the 42 obese children participating in an obesity zzso 

zzso zzso did not differ significantly between obese and lean zzso In multiple linear zzso zzso zzso was significantly related to insulin zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but not to zzso age, sex, zzso stage, zzso or percentage body zzso The 15 obese children with substantial weight reduction demonstrated significantly zzso zzso decreased zzso insulin, and zzso levels, whereas these parameters did not change in 27 obese children without substantial weight zzso Changes in zzso correlated significantly with changes in insulin zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but not with changes in zzso zzso or percentage of body zzso 

In children, zzso zzso zzso are independent of age, sex, and zzso zzso Although zzso did not differ between lean and obese children, weight loss was associated with decreasing zzso zzso as zzso levels were related to insulin zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso we zzso a relationship between zzso and insulin in the zzso zzso
