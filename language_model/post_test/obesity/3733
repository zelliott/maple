Factor analyses suggest that the structure underlying zzso syndrome is similar in adolescents and zzso However, adolescence is a period of intense zzso change, and therefore stability of the underlying zzso structure and clinical categorization based on zzso risk is zzso 

We analyzed data from zzso participants in the Princeton School District zzso a zzso study begun in zzso who were followed up for 3 zzso We performed factor analyses of 8 zzso risks at baseline and follow-up to assess stability of factor patterns and clinical categorization of zzso zzso zzso syndrome was defined using the current American Heart zzso Heart, zzso and Blood Institute definition for adults zzso a modified zzso definition used in prior pediatric zzso syndrome studies zzso zzso and the International Diabetes Federation zzso zzso We found that factor structures were essentially identical at both time zzso However, clinical categorization was not zzso zzso half of adolescents with baseline zzso syndrome lost the diagnosis at follow-up regardless of the definitions zzso pediatric zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso 38% to zzso In addition to loss of the diagnosis, new cases were zzso zzso zzso rates were as zzso pediatric zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso 

During adolescence, zzso risk factor zzso is zzso However, marked instability exists in the zzso diagnosis of zzso zzso This instability, which includes both gain and loss of the diagnosis, suggests that the syndrome has reduced clinical utility in adolescence and that zzso zzso zzso for youth may be zzso
