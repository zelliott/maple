zzso to the zzso environment during zzso can impact future zzso efficiency and zzso zzso During this study, we used a model of rabbits receiving an zzso diet zzso starting before zzso and extending until zzso Three months later, the body weight of zzso animals was significantly higher than that of controls and their zzso zzso displayed a precocious and abnormal development at zzso zzso zzso ducts were filled with dense products, while zzso structures invaded most of the fat zzso The proportion of zzso zzso was significantly higher in zzso zzso zzso which contained an abundant zzso of milk proteins and zzso In conclusion, an zzso diet started before zzso induced an accelerated development of the rabbit zzso zzso leading to an zzso of zzso products at zzso These results support the critical influence of nutrition on zzso growth and zzso which may be deleterious to zzso development and subsequent zzso
