zzso observed in obesity is associated with insulin resistance, diabetes and zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate zzso of zzso and its zzso zzso by zzso derived from subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso and visceral zzso tissue zzso in obese and non-obese zzso 

zzso samples of SAT and zzso and blood samples were obtained from 23 subjects (10 non-obese and 13 zzso undergoing zzso abdominal zzso Total zzso quantities and zzso zzso were measured in zzso media of zzso derived from SAT and zzso using zzso zzso zzso and zzso western zzso zzso 

Total zzso plasma levels were lower in obese than in non-obese subjects zzso zzso of total zzso in zzso tissue zzso zzso was lower in obese than in non-obese subjects in SAT zzso but not in zzso In both, SAT and zzso the most abundant zzso released into zzso media was the zzso weight zzso zzso Its relative proportion in relation to total zzso was higher in zzso media of zzso from both fat zzso when compared with plasma zzso The proportion of zzso zzso vs total zzso was higher in zzso than in SAT zzso in the group of non-obese individuals zzso in zzso vs zzso in zzso zzso whereas no difference between the two zzso was found in obese subjects zzso % in zzso vs zzso % in zzso 

zzso is associated with the decrease of total zzso zzso in zzso The profile of zzso zzso zzso by SAT and zzso zzso differs from that in zzso zzso of total zzso and zzso zzso of zzso are different in obese and non-obese subjects in relation to AT zzso
