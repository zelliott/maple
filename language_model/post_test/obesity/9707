We examined mouse models with altered zzso expression of zzso a protein residing in the zzso outer zzso to probe its impact on zzso function and subsequent cellular zzso We found that zzso of zzso enhances zzso zzso and storage, leading to an expansion of the mass of zzso zzso Despite the resulting massive zzso benign aspects of zzso tissue expansion prevail, and insulin sensitivity is zzso zzso we also found that zzso zzso zzso iron transport into the zzso and, because iron is a zzso component for electron zzso lowers the rate of zzso This effect is associated with a lower zzso membrane potential and lower levels of zzso oxygen zzso damage, along with increased production of zzso zzso a reduction in zzso expression enhances zzso respiratory capacity through enhanced iron content in the zzso ultimately corresponding to less weight gain on a high-fat zzso However, this reduction in zzso expression also causes heightened zzso stress and zzso zzso Thus, manipulation of zzso function by varying zzso expression markedly affects the dynamics of cellular and zzso zzso zzso
