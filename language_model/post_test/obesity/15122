zzso of the gut zzso by high-fat diet zzso has been implicated in the development of zzso It remains to be zzso whether the zzso shifts occur at the zzso level or whether they can be attributed to specific zzso zzso it is unclear to what extent the changes are zzso under normal zzso zzso zzso One group zzso zzso zzso of adult zzso mice was fed a zzso for 12 weeks until significant obesity and insulin resistance were observed, and then these mice were switched to NC feeding for 10 zzso Upon switching to NC zzso the zzso zzso observed during zzso consumption were significantly zzso The second group zzso zzso remained healthy under continuous NC zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso data showed continued structural segregation of zzso from zzso on zzso At 4 weeks after switching back to NC, the gut zzso in the zzso group had already moved back to the zzso space, and continued to progress along the same age trajectory and completely zzso with zzso after 10 zzso zzso analysis identified 77 key zzso responding to the dietary zzso zzso shifts of these zzso all reverted to zzso levels over zzso Some of these zzso exhibited robust age-related changes despite the dramatic abundance variations in response to dietary zzso These findings suggest that zzso structural changes of the gut zzso can be attributed to zzso zzso or diminution of specific zzso indicating the significant structural resilience of the gut zzso of adult mice to dietary zzso
