zzso of copper distribution in zzso and serum has been described in obese zzso In this prospective study, we evaluated the zzso level of copper by atomic zzso in a group of 32 obese zzso or zzso 30 zzso compared to a group of 32 healthy zzso We have noted an zzso of serum copper in obese with a middle level of 133 zzso significantly superior to the middle level of serum copper of healthy subjects, 108 zzso zzso zzso In another hand, we have noticed that the levels of serum zzso rise with the zzso In fact, zzso of the obese that have a zzso or zzso 40 zzso show a high concentration of serum copper although only zzso of obese with zzso zzso zzso show this high zzso This work must be completed by the determination of zzso levels in a larger group of obese in order to establish correlations between the serum zzso levels, the serum copper levels and the zzso
