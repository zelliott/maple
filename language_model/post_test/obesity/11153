African-American zzso women have earlier zzso on average than women of European ancestry zzso and earlier zzso is a risk factor for obesity and type 2 diabetes among other chronic zzso Identification of common genetic zzso associated with age at zzso has a potential value in pointing to the genetic pathways underlying chronic disease risk, yet comprehensive zzso studies of age at zzso are lacking for AA zzso In this study, we tested the zzso association of zzso age at zzso with common zzso zzso zzso in a total of 18 zzso AA women in 15 studies using an additive genetic linear zzso model, adjusting for year of birth and population stratification, followed by zzso weighted zzso zzso zzso Top zzso results were then tested in an independent sample of zzso women zzso zzso First, while no zzso passed the zzso P zzso zzso zzso threshold for significance in Stage 1, suggestive associations were found for zzso near zzso and zzso and conditional analysis identified two independent zzso zzso and zzso in or near zzso strengthening the support for this suggestive locus identified in zzso zzso zzso an investigation of zzso in 42 previously identified zzso zzso in zzso women demonstrated that 25 zzso of them contained zzso significantly associated with zzso in AA zzso The findings provide the first evidence of zzso zzso of zzso zzso identified to date, and suggest a number of novel biological links to zzso timing in AA zzso
