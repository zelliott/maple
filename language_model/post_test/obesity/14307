Previous studies have demonstrated that zzso zzso E zzso reduces zzso zzso formation in lean zzso zzso zzso zzso has also been demonstrated to play a role in zzso differentiation and zzso zzso Because the prevalence of obesity has grown to epidemic proportions, we sought to determine whether zzso zzso could impact zzso zzso formation or zzso tissue expansion and inflammation in obese zzso zzso To this end, we transplanted obese zzso zzso zzso mice with bone zzso from either zzso or zzso zzso There were no differences in body weight, total body zzso zzso or visceral fat pad mass between recipient zzso The presence of zzso had no impact on zzso tissue zzso content or inflammatory zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso demonstrated zzso lower plasma cholesterol zzso zzso and zzso lower plasma zzso levels zzso zzso by 12 zzso after transplantation even though zzso was present in plasma at zzso zzso of zzso zzso The reduced plasma lipids reflected a dramatic decrease in very low density zzso and a mild increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso area zzso lower in recipients of zzso zzso zzso zzso Similar results were seen in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, when bone zzso transplantation was performed in zzso zzso and zzso mice with zzso zzso recipients of zzso zzso had a zzso lower zzso area than controls zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso does not impact zzso tissue expansion or inflammatory zzso however, even very low levels of zzso zzso are capable of reducing plasma lipids and zzso zzso area in obese zzso
