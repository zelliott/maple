The significance of variation within the genes coding for three zzso zzso proteins in the zzso of zzso dependent diabetes zzso was assessed by zzso restriction zzso length zzso in an English Caucasian zzso Two zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso four at the zzso zzso zzso zzso locus and one at the zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso in a sample of diabetic and zzso zzso No significant differences in the zzso zzso or zzso zzso of the zzso at these three zzso were observed between the diabetic or zzso zzso No significant linkage zzso was observed between the two zzso zzso sites, whereas the four zzso sites at the zzso zzso one of which appears to be due to a zzso base pair DNA zzso were found to be in significant linkage zzso In order to study the possible role of zzso zzso gene zzso contributing to the development of zzso the body mass indexes were compared in the different zzso groups of diabetic and zzso zzso No differences in body mass index between zzso groups were found at the p zzso level of zzso
