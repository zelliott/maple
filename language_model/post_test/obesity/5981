Patients with insulin resistance zzso have a higher prevalence of zzso zzso In the present study, we present original data showing that patients with differentiated zzso zzso zzso also have a higher frequency of zzso 

Twenty women with DTC zzso 1, zzso and 20 zzso individuals zzso group, zzso were investigated for zzso zzso and zzso subjects were matched in pairs by age, zzso and body mass index zzso The diagnosis of zzso was made when the zzso model zzso of insulin resistance zzso index was higher than zzso According to the zzso 20 women (10 with DTC and 10 of the zzso had a zzso zzso whereas the other 20 had higher zzso values zzso and obese zzso 

zzso was present in the 50% of zzso but only in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso In the groups with lower zzso zzso we found zzso in zzso of zzso and no cases in the zzso whereas in those with zzso 25 the zzso was present in zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso There were no differences between the two zzso regarding the time in which the zzso tests were zzso zzso was present in zzso of patient with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We conclude that such a high prevalence of zzso would be an important risk factor for developing zzso as it is well known with some other zzso zzso
