Older people who increase or maintain their physical activity have lower mortality than those who remain zzso This could result from a lower body weight and a better functional status that allow to be more zzso However, this explanation would be unlikely if the benefits of physical activity on mortality were seen also in older people with obesity or functional zzso 

This study examined the association between change in zzso physical activity zzso and mortality in older adults, and whether this association varied with obesity and functional zzso 

Data were taken from a zzso follow-up study of zzso people representative of the Spanish population aged zzso zzso Changes in zzso from 2001 to 2003 were linked to zzso mortality from 2003 to zzso zzso were performed in 2010 with Cox models adjusted for the main zzso and were zzso by obesity and functional zzso 

Compared with people who were continually sedentary from 2001 to 2003, those who increased their zzso had zzso lower mortality zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso and those who were continually active had zzso lower mortality zzso zzso zzso zzso These results did not vary in analyses zzso by obesity and functional zzso 

zzso or maintaining zzso is associated with greater longevity in older adults, even those with obesity or functional zzso Given the high frequency of these disorders, the current results suggest that most older adults can benefit from an active zzso
