To delineate a zzso system, zzso reference zzso and zzso points, based on the distribution of body mass index zzso across a national reference population and designed for the assessment of the nutritional status of Brazilian children and zzso 

Data from zzso males and zzso females aged from 2 to 19 years, extracted from the National Nutrition and Health zzso zzso zzso were used to construct a reference zzso The zzso method was employed to calculate the zzso curve parameters and zzso functions were used to model these parameters against zzso The zzso values for zzso nutritional status as zzso overweight and obese were expressed as zzso and zzso values equivalent to zzso 25 and 30 zzso at 20 years, zzso 

zzso for the zzso M and S parameters were tabulated at zzso intervals for each zzso Using these values, a graph was plotted with nine zzso distribution reference zzso zzso values were presented that are equivalent to zzso of zzso 25 and 30 zzso at the start of zzso 

The zzso system presented here can be used for clinical and zzso zzso it is zzso similar to the majority of national zzso that have been presented to date and, zzso it offers a definition of zzso
