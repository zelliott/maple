We determined the effect of dietary fat and zzso on zzso fat zzso and urine parameters in a rat model of zzso gastric bypass zzso 

Diet induced obese zzso rats underwent sham surgery as controls zzso or zzso gastric bypass surgery zzso After recovery, rats had free access to a normal zzso high fat zzso diet with or without zzso zzso zzso for 5 weeks and then a normal zzso fat diet for 2 zzso zzso and urine were collected after each zzso zzso fat was determined by gas zzso and urine zzso were evaluated by zzso zzso 

Daily zzso fat zzso remained low in controls on either zzso However, zzso gastric bypass rats zzso a food quantity similar to that of controls but had zzso higher zzso fat zzso zzso zzso and heavier stools zzso zzso zzso Compared to controls, gastric bypass rats on the high fat diet with zzso zzso had a fivefold increase in urine zzso zzso zzso zzso while gastric bypass rats without zzso zzso had a twofold increase in urine calcium zzso zzso zzso dietary fat in gastric bypass rats with zzso zzso led to a 50% decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso decrease in urine calcium and a zzso U increase in urine pH zzso zzso 

In this zzso gastric bypass model high fat feeding resulted in zzso zzso and low urine zzso which were partially zzso by lowering the dietary fat and zzso zzso zzso gastric bypass rats on normal fat and no zzso diets zzso twice as much zzso as age zzso sham operated zzso Although zzso gastric bypass zzso appears primarily zzso by gut and diet, secondary causes of zzso from liver or other mechanisms deserve further zzso
