The intake of dietary fat above energy needs has contributed to the growing rates of obesity zzso The concept of disease development occurring in the fed state now has much support and zzso of zzso flux may occur due to poor handling of dietary fat in the immediate zzso zzso The present paper will review recent observations implicating zzso phase events in the control of zzso zzso zzso the impact of varying the composition of meals on subsequent fat zzso and the means by which dietary zzso carried in zzso can lead to elevated zzso zzso fatty acid zzso This discussion is followed by an evaluation of the data on quantitative meal fat zzso at the whole body level and an examination of dietary fat clearance to peripheral zzso - with particular attention paid to skeletal muscle and liver given the role of zzso zzso deposition in insulin zzso Estimates derived from data of zzso clearance show good agreement with clearance to the liver zzso zzso of meal fat in lean subjects and this number appears higher zzso in subjects with diabetes and fatty liver zzso Finally, we discuss new methods with which to study dietary fatty acid zzso in zzso Future research is needed to include a more comprehensive understanding of 1) the potential for differential zzso of saturated versus zzso fatty acids which might lead to meaningful energy deficit and whether this zzso varies based on insulin sensitivity, 2) whether zzso exists for zzso fatty acids within zzso zzso zzso pools, and 3) the role of reduced peripheral fatty acid clearance in the development of fatty liver zzso Further zzso in the zzso of dietary fat zzso and disposal will be central to the development of therapies designed to treat zzso zzso This article is part of a Special zzso entitled zzso zzso and zzso
