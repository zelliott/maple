The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of overweight and obesity among zzso adolescents using three different sets of zzso 

zzso prevalence zzso 

Intermediate and secondary schools in zzso 

The study included a zzso sample of zzso zzso students zzso males and zzso zzso between 12 and 17 y of zzso The sample was selected using zzso zzso random sampling zzso 

zzso zzso including weight, height and zzso and zzso zzso were taken on the zzso Age was verified against school zzso To minimize zzso error, weight and height were taken by one person while zzso was taken by two trained persons (one for each zzso 

The overall prevalence of obesity among zzso boys and girls was high, especially in zzso zzso was highest zzso in males and zzso in zzso when the WHO recommended criteria of zzso for age and zzso for age zzso were applied and lowest zzso in boys and zzso in zzso when the age and sex specific zzso zzso values of Cole et al were zzso Compared with those of WHO criteria, estimates of overweight and obesity prevalence obtained with Must et al and Cole et al were generally zzso 

Our data revealed a much higher prevalence rate of obesity in the zzso adolescent population than was previously reported, especially among zzso The zzso reference values of Must et al and that of Cole et al gave relatively similar estimates and appear to be more practical for use in surveys aimed at zzso the prevalence of overweight and obesity among adolescents than the WHO recommended composite zzso
