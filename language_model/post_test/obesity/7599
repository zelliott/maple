zzso and zzso colon zzso have been recognized as two different disease types in human zzso The environmental factors involved in the zzso of the zzso and zzso tumors also zzso The main objective of this study was to determine if zzso zzso tumors differ from each other if they are located in different regions of the zzso zzso zzso obese rats were injected with zzso zzso 10 zzso body zzso for 2 zzso The tumors appeared within 20 zzso The highest proportion of the tumors was in the zzso zzso and the number declined towards the zzso zzso A number of proteins previously reported to be altered in tumor tissue were assessed in the present study in tumors appearing in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso tumors had higher zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels than tumors of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso was decreased in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth zzso were higher in zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso zzso levels were similar in the tumor zzso however, the zzso was significantly higher in the zzso tumor than in the zzso zzso Our findings suggest that colon tumors induced by zzso in different zzso regions are different from each other with respect to differential expression of proteins and support the concept that these disease states could respond differently to zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, these findings support the concept that cancer preventive or therapeutic agents need to be evaluated for their effectiveness on zzso as well as on zzso zzso
