The zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso zzso and plasma calcium of genetically obese zzso rats is zzso In this study, we tested the zzso that there is an early occurrence of abnormalities in CT zzso by zzso zzso of these zzso Male genetically obese zzso zzso rats and their lean zzso were therefore studied from 30 days to 10 months of zzso zzso animals were characterized by zzso zzso approximately equal to 1 zzso already present at 30 days of zzso Increased zzso CT stores began at 6 weeks of age in fatty zzso Plasma CT levels were decreased in obese animals from 30 days to 10 weeks of age and were not different in leans and zzso 2 weeks later, but were higher at 10 months in fatty zzso Poly A + zzso were extracted from zzso zzso and subjected to translation zzso After zzso specific zzso were zzso and zzso by zzso A similar translation product with an apparent zzso zzso of 15,000 was specifically zzso with CT zzso in obese zzso and lean zzso rats at different zzso In zzso fatty rats, a 50% decrease in zzso CT zzso was observed in association with decreased plasma CT zzso In zzso fatty rats, the zzso CT zzso activity was unchanged or higher when compared to lean zzso and clearly higher in zzso fatty zzso The CT zzso levels measured by zzso or northern zzso zzso paralleled at each stage studied the CT zzso activity, determined by zzso It was concluded that in zzso conditions, plasma CT level variations during development reflect the zzso activity of C cells in genetically obese zzso The data presented in this study strengthen the point of an early occurrence of abnormalities in CT zzso activity and in plasma calcium of zzso zzso
