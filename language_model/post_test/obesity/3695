zzso zzso zzso is associated with an increased zzso where zzso seems to have a crucial role in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso of in zzso zzso generation zzso such as lag time, peak zzso and zzso zzso potential zzso that describe the time until zzso burst, the peak amount of zzso and the total amount of zzso generated, respectively as well as classical zzso markers were evaluated in 33 zzso patients compared to both a group of 28 patients matched for the features of zzso zzso zzso and 31 healthy zzso zzso and zzso patients had shorter lag time zzso higher peak and zzso zzso than healthy controls, though lag time was less shortened in zzso zzso respect to zzso zzso zzso time zzso was increased zzso in both zzso and zzso patients, while partial zzso time zzso was shorter zzso in zzso compared to both zzso and healthy group zzso Factor VIII zzso zzso zzso protein C and S were increased only in zzso patients zzso lag time, AT and zzso correlated to night zzso cortisol zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated zzso to urinary free cortisol zzso zzso zzso correlated zzso to lag time zzso zzso and positively to peak and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and diabetic patients had shorter lag time zzso zzso respectively), higher zzso zzso zzso zzso and peak zzso zzso zzso as well as a more prolonged zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso individuals had higher zzso zzso peak zzso and zzso zzso Our findings confirm a zzso state in both zzso and zzso patients, though lag time was less shortened in zzso The high levels of zzso zzso zzso could possibly represent a protective mechanism against zzso seen in zzso zzso
