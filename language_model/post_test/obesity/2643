To use hospitalization data from 2003 to determine whether prior findings, showing higher charges and longer zzso zzso for children with obesity versus those without, were stable over time and whether the magnitude of differences was consistent over a zzso zzso 

Using the 2000 and 2003 Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality zzso Kids zzso Database zzso we examined zzso for the top 4 zzso principal discharge diagnoses for children aged zzso years zzso pneumonia, affective disorders, and zzso classified as with or without obesity based on the presence of the International zzso of zzso Ninth zzso Clinical zzso zzso code zzso as a secondary zzso We compared mean charges for zzso with obesity listed as secondary diagnosis versus those zzso zzso are presented in 2003 zzso 

Among children's zzso in 2000 and 2003, zzso and zzso respectively, listed obesity as a secondary zzso In 2003, for all 4 diagnoses, adjusted mean hospital charges were statistically significantly higher and adjusted mean LOS was statistically significantly longer for zzso with obesity as a secondary diagnosis versus those zzso Additionally, the magnitude of the differences for both charges and LOS was generally somewhat greater in 2003 than in 2000 zzso zzso pneumonia zzso affective disorders zzso and zzso zzso although it did not achieve statistical significance zzso zzso 

These findings suggest a widening gap of incremental charges and LOS associated with obesity as a zzso This implies a financial imperative for further research to evaluate factors that contribute to greater resource zzso among obese zzso
