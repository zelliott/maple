zzso zzso levels and the zzso response to at least two among provocative stimuli such as zzso zzso zzso 150 zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso infusion during 30 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 60 zzso zzso have been evaluated in 43 children with zzso syndrome zzso 17 males and 26 zzso age zzso zzso 7 normal weight and 36 obese zzso in 25 normal short children zzso 17 males and 8 zzso zzso zzso and in 24 children with simple obesity zzso 14 zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso Both normal weight and obese zzso had mean zzso levels lower than those recorded in NC zzso and zzso zzso The zzso responses to zzso and zzso in NC were similar and higher than that to zzso zzso In zzso the zzso response to zzso was higher than that to zzso zzso which, in turn, was higher than that to zzso zzso these responses in zzso were lower than those in normal children zzso and similar to those in zzso In normal weight zzso the zzso responses to zzso and to zzso were similar and higher than to zzso zzso however, each provocative stimulus zzso a zzso rise lower than that in NC zzso In obese zzso as well as in zzso the zzso response to zzso was higher than that to zzso zzso which, in turn, was higher than that to zzso zzso all zzso responses in obese zzso and zzso were lower than those in NC zzso but similar to those in normal weight zzso In conclusion, patients with zzso show clear reduction of zzso levels as well as of the zzso responsiveness to provocative stimuli independently of body weight zzso These results strengthen the hypothesis that zzso syndrome is frequently zzso by zzso zzso
