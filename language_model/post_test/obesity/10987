We investigated the ability of an acute zzso challenge in zzso to deteriorate zzso control and insulin action in the obese zzso zzso a model of insulin resistance associated with zzso zzso In obese animals, the daily administration for 1 week of zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso zzso elevated zzso plasma zzso and zzso and markedly aggravated zzso zzso zzso without significantly affecting zzso zzso zzso suggesting exacerbated insulin zzso Intermediate effects on zzso in obese animals were determined with zzso treatment alone while zzso treatment alone had no zzso In contrast, none of the zzso treatments affected zzso insulin sensitive, lean zzso zzso Our data therefore demonstrate for the first time, a vulnerability to deterioration in insulin action in an established insulin resistant state following an environmental zzso zzso This may have relevance in the conversion of insulin resistance syndrome zzso to zzso dependent diabetes zzso zzso
