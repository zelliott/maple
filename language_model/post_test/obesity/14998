The recent substantial increase in the number of obese surgeries performed in Sweden has raised concerns about the budget zzso 

Our aim in this paper is to present an assessment of the zzso impact of different policies for surgical intervention for obese and overweight subjects from a zzso perspective in zzso 

The model simulates the annual expected treatment costs of obesity related diseases and surgery in patients of different sex, age and Body Mass Index zzso zzso evaluated are costs of surgery plus the excess treatment costs that an obese patient has over and above the treatment costs of a zzso zzso The diagnoses that are included for costs assessment are diabetes and cardiovascular disease since these diagnoses are the principal diagnoses associated with zzso Four different scenarios over the number of surgical operations performed each year are simulated and zzso zzso no surgical operation, zzso 3 zzso surgical operations in persons with zzso 40, zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso and zzso 5 zzso zzso to zzso zzso 

Comparing zzso 2 with zzso 1 results in a net budget impact of on average zzso 121 million per zzso or zzso 40 zzso per zzso This implies that 55 percent of the cost of surgery, set equal to zzso 90 zzso for each patient, has been offset by a reduction in the excess treatment costs of obesity related zzso zzso annual surgery from zzso to zzso the zzso increased to zzso By expanding annual surgery further from zzso to zzso and at the same time expanding the indication for surgery from zzso 40 to zzso 38, no zzso is zzso 

A zzso strategy for zzso surgery in Sweden should not expand indication, but rather increase the number of surgeries within the currently accepted zzso
