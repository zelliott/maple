zzso zzso initiated before and right after delivery and zzso 3 months after delivery tends to become zzso We intended to estimate the persistence of urinary zzso 6 months zzso and to zzso the different factors associated with zzso 

zzso study 6 months after delivery of women presenting urinary zzso symptoms in gestation or in the first 2 months of zzso The dependent variable was the persistence and the independent variables were grouped in zzso and zzso zzso ratio zzso were calculated with their confidence zzso at zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The variables that showed an important risk of persistence of zzso were used to perform a zzso model of zzso zzso 

The persistence of zzso 6 months after delivery was zzso zzso zzso zzso The risk of persistence increased with the zzso maneuver zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso not weight recovery zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso not zzso pelvic floor muscle exercises in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso appearance of zzso after delivery zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the weight of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso all of them explaining zzso of the zzso of zzso 

zzso of women with urinary zzso caused by zzso will continue to have it 6 months zzso An important part of this persistence is associated with some factors easy to zzso
