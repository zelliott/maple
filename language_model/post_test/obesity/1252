The impact of obesity on graft survival after zzso transplantation continues to be zzso We have reviewed our experiences with living donor and zzso transplantation in the current decade, focusing specifically on the impact of obesity on transplant zzso zzso body mass index zzso zzso was calculated for all adult zzso transplant recipients between January 1990 and December 1995 and was used to zzso patients as zzso moderately obese or zzso zzso The effect of the degree of obesity on early and late outcomes after zzso transplantation was zzso Three hundred and zzso recipients had zzso zzso zzso zzso or mild zzso 68 zzso zzso zzso zzso and 7 zzso over 40 zzso zzso There was no correlation between obesity and other demographic zzso zzso infections and delayed graft function occurred more commonly in moderately and zzso obese than in other zzso donor zzso zzso patients gained more weight after surgery and were given lower doses per zzso of zzso There was, however, no significant correlation between obesity and graft survival for either zzso or living donor zzso Although obese patients have an increased risk of delayed graft function with zzso donor zzso obesity has no discernible impact on either zzso or overall graft survival with zzso or living donor zzso The impact of moderate obesity on transplant outcome is modest and should not prevent these patients from receiving a zzso
