Although a number of studies have found an inverse association between body mass index zzso and risk of lung cancer, there is little information on this relation in African Americans, who experience a higher zzso of lung zzso 

We assessed the relation of zzso to zzso of lung cancer in the Black Women's Health zzso an ongoing prospective follow-up of zzso women in the zzso Cox zzso hazard models were used to estimate hazard ratios for various levels of zzso relative to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with adjustment for age, education, zzso of smoking, and other zzso Two other zzso measures, waist circumference zzso and zzso ratio zzso were also zzso A total of 323 primary lung cancer cases were identified from 1995 to zzso 

The hazard ratio zzso for zzso zzso 30 relative to zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso As expected, cigarette smoking was strongly associated with increased risk of lung zzso In analyses zzso by smoking status, the zzso for zzso zzso 30 relative to zzso zzso was zzso zzso among current smokers, zzso zzso among former smokers, and zzso zzso among never smokers zzso for interaction zzso zzso Control for zzso of smoking or age started smoking had little effect on the hazard zzso zzso and zzso were not materially associated with lung cancer zzso 

Our results indicate that high zzso is associated with a lower risk of lung cancer in African American women, particularly among current zzso
