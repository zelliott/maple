Increased zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling is strongly correlated with the degree of muscle adaptation following zzso zzso we compare the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso target of zzso zzso in the zzso anterior zzso muscles of lean and obese zzso rats following a bout of eccentric zzso Exercise increased zzso zzso zzso immediately after zzso and during zzso h zzso and 3 h zzso recovery in the lean zzso and at 3 h zzso in the obese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was elevated in the lean zzso immediately after exercise zzso but remained zzso in the obese zzso Exercise increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the lean but not the obese zzso These results suggest that insulin resistance is associated with zzso in the ability of muscle to activate zzso signaling following an acute bout of zzso
