zzso gas tensions and zzso zzso zzso zzso during a voluntary breath hold at functional residual capacity zzso were examined in 13 healthy seated zzso An excellent correlation zzso zzso zzso was found between the fall of zzso zzso tensions zzso zzso and body weight, expressed as the ratio of weight to height zzso zzso An even greater correlation zzso zzso zzso was found between delta zzso and the ratio of zzso time X zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased to 70 zzso in the obese group after just 15 s of zzso whereas this degree of zzso did not occur in the zzso until the breath hold was sustained for 30 zzso This variable rate of fall of zzso zzso during a breath hold can be ascribed to the changes of zzso consumption zzso and zzso associated with changing body zzso In the obese, zzso was twice as large as in the zzso thus accounting for the differences of zzso time needed to obtain the same zzso zzso zzso measured at the end of the breath hold was the same as that value predicted from the reduction of zzso This suggests that the fall of zzso zzso can entirely account for the observed fall of zzso zzso and that zzso zzso had not increased during the zzso zzso In patients with sleep zzso the ratio of zzso lung zzso may also be an important zzso of the severity of zzso zzso
