zzso sleep zzso is a common disorder whose prevalence is linked to an epidemic of obesity in Western zzso Sleep zzso is due to zzso episodes of upper airway obstruction during sleep that are caused by zzso in upper airway zzso during zzso zzso can be increased by underlying zzso zzso and/or disturbances in upper airway zzso control, both of which play key roles in the zzso of zzso sleep zzso zzso and particularly central zzso are potent risk factors for sleep zzso They can increase zzso zzso through mechanical effects on zzso soft zzso and lung volume, and through central nervous zzso signaling proteins zzso that may affect airway zzso zzso zzso molecular signaling pathways zzso differences in the distribution and zzso activity of zzso zzso These differences can produce zzso in the mechanical and neural control of upper airway zzso which determine sleep zzso zzso Although weight loss reduces upper airway zzso during sleep, it is not known whether its effects are zzso primarily by improvement in upper airway mechanical properties or zzso zzso A variety of zzso zzso and surgical approaches to weight loss may be of benefit to patients with sleep zzso through distinct effects on the mass and activity of regional zzso zzso zzso responses to specific weight loss strategies will provide critical insight into mechanisms linking obesity and sleep zzso and will help to zzso the zzso and molecular zzso of weight loss zzso
