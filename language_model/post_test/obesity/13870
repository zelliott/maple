To identify zzso variables related to children's body mass index zzso zzso at age 8 zzso 

A zzso design, with nine interviews per child from ages 2 to 8 zzso 

In all, 70 white children zzso zzso 33 zzso who were continuous participants since infancy in the zzso zzso Families were primarily middle and upper socioeconomic zzso 

At each interview, children's height and weight were measured, and mothers provided 3 days of the child's intake data (a zzso recall and 2 days of food zzso 

zzso used were zzso zzso repeated measures analysis of zzso and forward zzso zzso zzso at each interview was calculated and age of zzso rebound was zzso 

Children's zzso at 8 y was zzso predicted by age of zzso rebound and positively predicted by their zzso at 2 zzso Additionally, each model included one zzso dietary zzso mean protein and fat zzso recorded between 2 and 8 y were positive zzso of zzso at 8 zzso mean zzso intake over the same time period was zzso related to zzso at 8 zzso zzso values indicated that these zzso models predicted zzso of the zzso in zzso among zzso zzso of zzso of the children exceeded the zzso zzso zzso 

The results of this study show that factors in early life are associated with children's zzso at age 8 zzso
