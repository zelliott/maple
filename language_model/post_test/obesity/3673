The retrospective study was made to evaluate the fracture patterns at the zzso zzso zzso for which the long version of a standard zzso zzso nail zzso has been zzso The indication has been decided by the individual zzso 

Over a five year period 72 consecutive zzso cases of an acute fracture were identified and were included in the zzso Mean patient age was zzso zzso Gender ratio was zzso zzso of the patients fractured their zzso by a fall, the rest by a high zzso zzso We zzso patient zzso zzso score, zzso social status before accident, additional injuries affecting local soft zzso or other zzso zzso We zzso the expansion of the fractures, dividing the zzso into five zzso zzso zzso was zzso according to the standard zzso zzso (if zzso 

zzso were found in zzso of the zzso Almost all patients zzso had been living independently at home before the zzso zzso of patients had osteoporosis in their medical zzso Five patients zzso had a primary zzso of the zzso zzso Six fractures chosen for zzso fixation were clearly restricted to the zzso zzso The remaining 66 fractures were located in the zzso zzso zzso region zzso There were 5 zzso zzso Of the remaining 67 fractures affecting the zzso third of the zzso zzso zzso percent extended into the zzso zzso 98 percent of these fractures displayed spiral zzso 

zzso zzso zzso fractures are amazingly similar to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fracture types with different grades of zzso are absolutely zzso a great proportion of the fractures extend into the zzso head with growing tendency of displacement if located closer to the zzso zzso zzso traction of zzso and zzso muscle causes typical displacement if the fracture line runs in between their attachments zzso the term zzso zzso A distinct zzso system for zzso zzso zzso fractures seems meaningful and is zzso 

There is clear evidence of specific characteristics which differentiate zzso third zzso zzso fractures from those of zzso and zzso zzso They explain the specific problems of reduction and zzso If zzso they will lead to higher rates of therapeutic zzso
