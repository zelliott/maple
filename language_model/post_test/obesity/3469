Sugar intake may be zzso associated with chronic disease risk, either directly or by contributing to zzso However, evidence from zzso studies is mixed, in part due to the error and bias inherent in zzso measures of sugar zzso zzso zzso may clarify the relationship between sugar intake and chronic disease zzso We have recently validated a zzso of sugar intake in an Alaska Native zzso study population that incorporates red blood cell carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios in a zzso zzso This study tested associations of zzso estimates of sugar intake with body mass index zzso waist circumference zzso and a broad array of other zzso and zzso measures of chronic disease risk in zzso zzso 

In a zzso sample of 1076 zzso people, multiple linear zzso was used to examine associations of sugar intake with zzso zzso and other chronic disease risk zzso 

zzso estimates of sugar intake were not associated with zzso zzso or zzso zzso They were positively associated with blood pressure, zzso zzso and zzso and are zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso estimates of sugar intake were not associated with zzso but were adversely associated with other chronic disease risk factors in this zzso study zzso This first use of stable isotope markers of sugar intake may influence recommendations for sugar intake by zzso zzso however, zzso studies are required to understand associations with chronic disease zzso
