To examine the combined relationships between age, zzso and body mass index zzso and the specific source of chronic low back zzso 

zzso chart zzso 

University spine zzso 

Charts from zzso cases from zzso consecutive patients were reviewed and 157 independent cases from 153 patients who underwent definitive diagnostic injections were zzso 

zzso dual diagnostic facet joint blocks, zzso joint injections, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion hardware injections, zzso zzso 

zzso low back pain source was the primary outcome zzso zzso variables included age at initial zzso zzso and zzso 

Age, zzso and zzso were each significantly associated with the source of chronic low back pain, after controlling for the effects of each zzso zzso in age were associated with significant decreases in the odds of internal disc disruption zzso vs facet joint pain zzso zzso joint pain zzso and other sources and decreases in the odds of zzso and zzso vs other zzso Being female was associated with significant increases in the odds of zzso vs zzso zzso and other zzso Increased zzso was associated with significant increases in the odds of zzso vs zzso 

These findings suggest a significant relationship among zzso age, and zzso and structural causes of chronic low back zzso zzso zzso is more prevalent in young males while zzso is more prevalent in females with increased zzso Female gender and low zzso are associated with zzso
