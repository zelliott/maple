Increased supply of fatty acids to muscle and liver is zzso involved in the insulin resistance zzso Using a tissue zzso technique in zzso and zzso fatty zzso rats, we determined tissue zzso levels as a marker of zzso in zzso muscle zzso subcutaneous zzso zzso and visceral zzso tissue zzso as well as the reduction of plasma free fatty zzso zzso and zzso caused by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso and zzso rats, zzso significantly lowered zzso zzso levels in SAT, zzso and zzso Whereas in SAT and zzso the decrease in zzso zzso indicated zzso zzso this decrease in zzso was not caused by a direct effect of zzso on zzso zzso as demonstrated by the lack of zzso of the protein zzso A activity ratio in zzso In addition, no differences of the zzso dynamics of zzso zzso levels compared with zzso controls were measured by in zzso zzso excluding any zzso zzso zzso in zzso Treatment with zzso resulted in pronounced reductions of plasma free fatty zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, in zzso rats, zzso treatment caused an immediate improvement of peripheral insulin sensitivity measured by the zzso zzso clamp zzso
