The common zzso zzso in the zzso zzso mass and obesity zzso gene is consistently associated with an increased risk of zzso However, the knowledge of a potential zzso effect of the zzso gene on changes in body weight achieved by lifestyle intervention is zzso We examined whether the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso is associated with body weight and zzso and long-term weight changes in the Finnish Diabetes Prevention Study zzso Altogether, 522 zzso zzso years; zzso zzso subjects with impaired zzso tolerance zzso were zzso to control and lifestyle intervention zzso zzso zzso was zzso from 502 zzso At zzso those with the AA zzso had higher zzso than subjects with other zzso zzso zzso zzso The association was observed in women zzso zzso zzso but not in zzso During the zzso zzso the subjects with the AA zzso had consistently the highest zzso zzso zzso zzso in the entire study zzso The magnitude of weight reduction was greater in the intervention group, but the risk zzso did not modify weight change in either of the zzso Our results confirm the association between the common zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso setting and during the long-term lifestyle zzso We did not observe association between zzso zzso and the magnitude of weight reduction achieved by long-term lifestyle zzso Based on the results from the zzso it is unlikely that the common zzso of the zzso gene affects the success of lifestyle modification on weight zzso
