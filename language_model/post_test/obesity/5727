Six pregnant rats were made mildly zzso by zzso injection of zzso on d 5 of zzso Four control rats were injected with zzso zzso Thirty zzso born to experimental zzso who had increased birth weight zzso weight greater than zzso zzso of mean birth weight of zzso from control zzso maintained accelerated growth through 10 zzso of zzso At 10 zzso oral zzso tolerance tests showed higher zzso and insulin levels than the controls zzso zzso zzso In addition to the higher body weight, the experimental rats also had higher fat weight to body weight zzso zzso of zzso fat from obese males and zzso fat from obese females had higher zzso content with significantly larger cell size than the zzso of the zzso The zzso of zzso rats showed attenuated response to zzso zzso conversion to total zzso and fatty acid when compared with the responses seen in the zzso of the control zzso Interestingly, although the zzso zzso conversion to CO2 was similar in zzso and control zzso the response in the zzso female was blunted when compared with that of the control zzso zzso zzso binding capacities of the zzso rats were lower than those of the controls, which is consistent with a phenomenon of zzso However, the zzso affinities were higher in the experimental animals than in zzso zzso a zzso zzso may account for the zzso in zzso metabolism in the obese zzso In conclusion, the abnormal response to oral zzso loading in these experimental obese, zzso rats is due to peripheral tissue insulin resistance that is probably zzso in zzso
