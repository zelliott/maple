zzso between increased zzso and zzso vitamin storage and metabolism are poorly zzso To examine these associations, zzso or zzso dietary fat was fed to rats for 11 weeks and tissue vitamin A storage zzso Two levels of supplemental vitamin A were zzso At the end of the tenth week, zzso zzso was administered orally, and its zzso were followed for 1 week in serum and zzso zzso zzso analysis was applied to these zzso zzso total zzso zzso zzso were elevated in rats fed zzso compared with zzso dietary fat zzso zzso zzso The fractional transfer zzso zzso describing the movement of zzso from plasma to zzso stores was two times higher in the zzso compared with the zzso fat zzso zzso with the elevated zzso R in zzso fat fed rats, there was a zzso increase in the zzso representing zzso distribution from plasma to kidney in the zzso compared with zzso fat zzso Taken together with a fat main effect on zzso vitamin A, our data support the evidence that faster turnover of kidney R may help set the mechanism governing vitamin A tissue distribution during zzso zzso fed zzso versus zzso dietary fat zzso zzso R more zzso
