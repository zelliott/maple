zzso II zzso zzso zzso originally developed for zzso properties, have zzso effects including direct vascular zzso We tested the hypothesis that the zzso zzso would be effective against zzso and zzso complications of the zzso zzso syndrome using the obese, zzso zzso : zzso rat that exhibits zzso and zzso disease with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso male rats were treated with zzso (30 zzso incorporated into zzso from 12 to 25 weeks of zzso 

zzso treatment caused no change in food intake or body zzso zzso zzso control of the zzso : zzso rats was marginally improved, at the expense of increased plasma insulin levels ( approximately zzso zzso plasma zzso were marginally reduced ( approximately zzso while cholesterol zzso were zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were reduced along with severity of zzso zzso zzso dysfunction zzso zzso response to zzso stimulus and reduced zzso zzso was improved and frequency of zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso 

zzso reduces markers of inflammation and zzso status, improves zzso function and reduces zzso sclerosis and zzso zzso in a model of the zzso zzso Unlike pharmaceutical agents targeted on zzso dysfunction, zzso reduced zzso disease without major reduction of plasma lipids or zzso The protective effects appear to be secondary to unknown zzso mechanisms, probably involving signal zzso zzso zzso these would offer novel pharmaceutical approaches to protection against cardiovascular zzso
