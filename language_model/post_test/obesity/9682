In this study, we investigated whether cacao liquor zzso zzso zzso which consists of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and others, ameliorated zzso and obesity in zzso mice fed a control or high-fat diet for 13 zzso zzso suppressed high-fat zzso zzso zzso intolerance and fat zzso in white zzso zzso zzso also promoted zzso of zzso zzso 4 zzso and zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in the plasma membrane of skeletal muscle and brown zzso zzso zzso of zzso was also enhanced in the liver and white zzso zzso zzso zzso the gene and protein expression levels of zzso protein zzso in brown zzso tissue and zzso in skeletal zzso These results indicate that zzso is a beneficial food material for the prevention of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso expression in skeletal muscle and zzso tissue are involved in the molecular mechanisms by which zzso prevents zzso and zzso
