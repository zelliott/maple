zzso studies have shown an association between birth weight and future risk of type 2 diabetes, with individuals born either small or large for zzso age at increased zzso We sought to investigate the influence of birth weight on the relation between insulin sensitivity and zzso function in obese zzso 

A total of zzso zzso children zzso body mass zzso score, zzso zzso zzso aged zzso zzso zzso zzso were divided into three groups according to birth weight zzso 44 were small for zzso age zzso 161 were appropriate for zzso age zzso and 52 were large for zzso age zzso Participants underwent a zzso oral zzso tolerance test with zzso insulin, and zzso zzso zzso model of assessment for insulin resistance, zzso index, and disposition index were calculated to evaluate insulin sensitivity and zzso zzso zzso and insulin area under the curve zzso were also zzso zzso zzso was used to compare the three zzso 

zzso and zzso subjects had higher zzso model of assessment for insulin resistance than zzso subjects, but they zzso when oral zzso tolerance test response was zzso Indeed, zzso subjects showed higher zzso zzso and lower zzso and disposition zzso zzso zzso was not different between groups, but when singular time points were considered, zzso subjects had lower insulin levels at 30 zzso and higher insulin levels at 180 zzso 

zzso obese children fail to adequately compensate for their reduced insulin sensitivity, zzso deficit in early insulin response and reduced disposition index that results in higher zzso zzso Thus, zzso obese children show adverse zzso outcomes compared to zzso and zzso
