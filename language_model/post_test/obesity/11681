Active left zzso relaxation, assessed by zzso zzso relaxation time, is impaired in zzso There is little information on left zzso passive properties during zzso 

To evaluate left zzso late zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso interrogation of zzso inflow tract and pulmonary vein flow zzso were obtained from 47 zzso young obese subjects (11 zzso 36 zzso and 43 zzso young zzso volunteers (13 zzso 30 zzso of comparable zzso 

After controlling the effect of blood pressure and left zzso mass, zzso relaxation time was prolonged in obese subjects zzso zzso vs zzso zzso No difference was found in zzso peak early and late flow zzso zzso subjects exhibited prolonged pulmonary vein reverse flow zzso during zzso contraction zzso zzso and a higher difference or ratio between duration of pulmonary reverse flow and duration of zzso forward late flow (6 zzso 31 vs zzso zzso 39 zzso or zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso p zzso and p zzso zzso These differences were also confirmed after controlling blood pressure and left zzso zzso zzso estimated left zzso zzso pressure was higher in obese subjects than in controls zzso zzso At zzso analysis a higher body mass index was the sole predictor of prolonged difference between duration of pulmonary reverse flow and duration of zzso forward late flow zzso zzso zzso p zzso 

zzso is associated with prolonged left zzso active relaxation and abnormalities of filling pressure not zzso by the sole zzso inflow zzso zzso These latter abnormalities are consistent with the presence of early increased left zzso passive zzso
