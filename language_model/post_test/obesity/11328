Brown zzso tissue zzso burns fat to produce heat when the body is exposed to cold and plays a role in energy zzso Using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso we previously reported that BAT decreases with age and thereby zzso age-related zzso of body fat in zzso Thus, the recruitment of BAT may be effective for body fat zzso In this study, we examined the effects of repeated stimulation by cold and zzso zzso zzso zzso in healthy human subjects with low BAT zzso Acute cold exposure at zzso for 2 hours increased energy expenditure zzso zzso increments of zzso zzso strongly correlated with BAT activity independently of age and zzso zzso Daily zzso cold exposure at zzso for 6 weeks resulted in a parallel increase in BAT activity and zzso and a zzso decrease in body fat zzso Changes in BAT activity and body fat mass were zzso zzso Similarly, daily zzso of zzso for 6 weeks increased zzso These results demonstrate that human BAT can be recruited even in individuals with decreased BAT activity, thereby contributing to body fat zzso
