zzso and zzso illnesses are global zzso zzso the health of adults and zzso The purpose of the present work is to evaluate a genetically intact obese mouse model that more accurately reflects the impact of aging on zzso obesity and type 2 diabetes in zzso Male zzso mice consumed either a control diet or one in which zzso zzso were due to zzso beginning at 5-6 weeks of zzso Body weight and fat zzso were obtained and zzso performed at 15, 20, 30, and 40 weeks of zzso zzso chemistry, zzso gene expression of the liver, and zzso and zzso function were also zzso In concert with significant increases in percent body fat and weight, mice fed the high-fat versus control diet had significantly increased levels of serum zzso At ages 20 and 30 weeks, serum zzso was significantly higher in obese versus controls, while serum insulin levels zzso higher in obese mice at ages 30 and 40 zzso The effect of age exacerbated the effects of consuming a high-fat zzso In addition to being zzso and zzso zzso older obese mice exhibited elevated zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the liver, zzso with subsequent zzso zzso zzso zzso elevated serum zzso zzso and zzso and increased numbers of pancreatic zzso
