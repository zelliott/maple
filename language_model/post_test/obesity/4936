The zzso energy cost of walking is determined, to a large degree, by body mass, but it is not clear how body composition and mass distribution influence this zzso We tested the hypothesis that walking would be most expensive for obese women compared with obese men and zzso women and zzso Furthermore, we hypothesized that for all groups, preferred walking speed would zzso to the speed that minimized the gross energy cost per zzso We measured body zzso zzso oxygen consumption, and preferred walking speed of 39 (19 class II obese, 20 normal zzso women and zzso We also measured oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production while the subjects walked on a level treadmill at six speeds zzso zzso Both obesity and sex affected the net zzso rate zzso of zzso Net zzso rates of obese subjects were only approximately zzso greater zzso zzso than for zzso subjects, and net zzso rates for women were approximately zzso greater than for zzso The increase in net zzso rate at faster walking speeds was greatest in obese women compared with the other zzso zzso walking speed was not different across groups zzso zzso and was near the speed that minimized gross energy cost per zzso Surprisingly, mass distribution zzso zzso zzso was not related to net zzso rate, but body composition zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso studies of walking are needed to investigate whether obese individuals adopt novel energy saving mechanisms during zzso
