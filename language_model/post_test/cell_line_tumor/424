zzso of air bubbles is a serious obstacle to a successful operation of a long-term zzso systems using cell zzso We developed a zzso bubble trap that can be integrated with a zzso device to prevent air bubbles from entering the zzso It consists of two zzso zzso zzso a top layer providing barriers for blocking bubbles and a bottom layer providing alternative zzso zzso Rather than relying solely on the zzso of air bubbles, bubbles are physically trapped and prevented from entering a zzso zzso Two different modes of a bubble trap were zzso an independent module that is connected to the main zzso system by tubes, and a bubble trap integrated with a main zzso The bubble trap was tested for the efficiency of bubble capture, and for potential effects a bubble trap may have on fluid flow zzso The bubble trap was able to efficiently trap air bubbles of up to 10 zzso volume, and the presence of captured air bubbles did not cause zzso in the flow zzso The performance of the bubble trap in a long-term cell culture with medium zzso was examined by zzso a zzso cell line in a zzso cell culture zzso This bubble trap can be useful for enhancing the consistency of zzso zzso cell culture zzso
