A role for the copper zzso zzso in zzso of copper from the human breast into milk has previously not been reported, although it is known that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso copper zzso in the mouse zzso zzso We show here that zzso is expressed in zzso zzso cells in both the resting and zzso human breast, where it has a zzso zzso in resting zzso cells and a diffuse location in zzso zzso zzso protein was present in a different subset of zzso from those containing milk proteins and did not overlap with zzso zzso zzso except in the zzso region of zzso In the cultured human zzso line, zzso treatment with zzso hormones induced a zzso of zzso from a zzso region to a region zzso but not zzso with, the zzso plasma zzso zzso of zzso was copper dependent, suggesting that the zzso zzso of zzso was zzso through an increase in zzso zzso zzso copper zzso studies using polarized zzso cells that zzso zzso protein showed that this zzso zzso copper zzso from the zzso surface of the zzso In zzso our results are consistent with an important function of zzso in the zzso of copper from the human zzso zzso
