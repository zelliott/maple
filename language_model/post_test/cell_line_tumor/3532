The zzso type II zzso zzso gene is a putative tumor zzso gene that is frequently zzso in zzso colon zzso zzso colon zzso zzso is a member of the transforming growth factor zzso type II zzso zzso family and controls cell growth and zzso zzso proteins are major zzso zzso shared by zzso and zzso zzso however, additional shared zzso mechanisms remain to be zzso To discover novel mechanisms zzso the zzso zzso we restored zzso function by zzso zzso zzso zzso into a zzso colon cancer cell line carrying an zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso restoration on cell growth, zzso zzso and global molecular zzso was then zzso zzso cell growth was observed in zzso zzso relative to zzso zzso zzso Western zzso revealed higher expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso versus controls, suggesting cells deficient in zzso had impaired zzso zzso zzso differential expression analysis revealed substantial zzso zzso of genes implicated in the control of cell growth and zzso including the zzso protein zzso complex genes zzso zzso and zzso as well as the small zzso signal zzso family members, zzso zzso and zzso zzso of these genes is shared with zzso zzso This observed similarity between the zzso and zzso signaling systems suggests that zzso may serve as an alternative zzso of zzso zzso including zzso and that zzso zzso of zzso may contribute to zzso colon zzso via disruption of alternate zzso zzso zzso
