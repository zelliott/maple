The zzso group zzso gene zzso is required for the proliferation and zzso of normal and zzso stem zzso zzso of zzso zzso causes zzso transformation of zzso and plays essential role in zzso of zzso zzso Another zzso zzso zzso was implicated in zzso prostate and breast zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso is relevant for zzso zzso Whether an zzso role of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso may be extended beyond the leukemia and may affect progression of solid tumors as well remains zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an essential role in zzso prostate cancer, thus mechanistically linking the zzso of zzso zzso of stem cells, and prostate cancer zzso To characterize the functional status of the zzso zzso in zzso prostate cancer, we zzso advanced zzso and whole zzso technologies, gene and protein expression zzso stable zzso zzso and tissue zzso zzso analysis in relevant experimental and clinical zzso We demonstrate that in multiple experimental models of zzso prostate cancer both zzso and zzso genes are amplified and gene amplification is associated with increased expression of corresponding zzso and zzso For the first time, we provide images of human prostate zzso zzso precursor cells isolated from blood and shown to zzso both zzso and zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso hypothesis, increased zzso and zzso expression in zzso cancer cells is associated with elevated levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis and expression profiling experiments documented increased zzso and zzso expression in clinical prostate zzso samples and demonstrated that high levels of zzso and zzso expression are associated with markedly increased likelihood of therapy failure and disease zzso after radical zzso zzso analysis reveals that zzso of the zzso zzso is mechanistically linked with highly zzso behavior of human prostate zzso cells and is essential for in zzso growth and zzso of human prostate zzso We conclude that the results of experimental and clinical analyses indicate the important biological role of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso prostate zzso Our work suggests that the zzso zzso zzso is a common zzso event in zzso of zzso solid tumors and provides justification for development of small zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso as a novel therapeutic zzso for treatment of zzso prostate zzso
