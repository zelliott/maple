We exploit the optical and spatial features of zzso zzso to examine individual receptors on the plasma membrane of living zzso zzso were zzso in portions of the membrane projected into zzso zzso Using zzso zzso of green fluorescent protein incorporated into individual zzso the resulting spatial isolation was used to measure zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We also show that nicotine and zzso have differential effects on zzso zzso
