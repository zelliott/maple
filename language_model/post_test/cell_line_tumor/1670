In the current study, zzso zzso acid zzso modified hollow zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been prepared, in order to obtain a zzso zzso carrier with sustained drug release zzso The zzso process consisted of the preparation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by a two stage zzso zzso technique using zzso as zzso Following core zzso a zzso coating of the zzso was formed, after ring opening zzso of zzso zzso the zzso role to the active zzso groups of zzso The zzso drug zzso zzso was selected for the study of loading and release behavior of the coated zzso The loading capacity of the zzso modified zzso was found to be four times higher than that of the parent ones zzso compared to zzso This coated zzso carrier exhibited a moderate pH responsive drug release behavior due to the pH dependent water zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The in zzso zzso of both the parent and the zzso or empty modified hollow zzso has been also examined on zzso breast cancer zzso The results showed that although the empty zzso were moderately zzso the zzso zzso had more potent zzso effect than the free zzso zzso the prepared coated zzso are interesting drug delivery zzso
