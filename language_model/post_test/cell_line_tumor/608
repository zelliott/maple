zzso drugs that induce DNA damage are commonly used zzso chemotherapy agents for zzso zzso head and neck, zzso zzso stomach, and zzso zzso The inherent resistance of tumors to DNA damage often limits the therapeutic efficacy of these agents, such as zzso An enhanced DNA repair and zzso maintenance response by the zzso zzso complex is critical in driving this zzso We hypothesized therefore that the targeted impairment of native cellular zzso function could sensitize tumor cells to zzso To test this, we designed what we believe to be a novel zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso gene that significantly zzso zzso expression and markedly disrupted zzso function in human zzso cell zzso zzso A combination of zzso and zzso zzso therapy produced significant tumor zzso in zzso with a corresponding increase in DNA damage and zzso zzso In zzso human zzso cell cancer zzso in nude mice, this combination therapy caused dramatic tumor zzso with increased zzso Our findings suggest the use of targeted zzso disruption as what we believe to be a novel zzso approach for cancer therapy in the context of zzso This strategy is potentially zzso to several types of zzso tumors that demonstrate zzso and may positively impact the treatment of these zzso
