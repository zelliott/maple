zzso smoke zzso is a major cause of lung cancer and a contributor to the development of a wide range of other zzso There is an acute need to develop a methodology that can rapidly assess the potential zzso properties of the zzso agents present in zzso We recently reported that exposure of normal human zzso zzso cells zzso or zzso pulmonary zzso cells to zzso zzso the zzso of zzso through its zzso on zzso and zzso of zzso zzso on zzso zzso most likely in response to the formation of potentially zzso DNA zzso breaks zzso To obtain a more complete view of the DNA damage response zzso we explored the correlation between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso through its zzso on zzso and zzso of zzso on zzso in zzso and zzso cell exposed to zzso zzso analysis by laser scanning zzso made it possible to relate these zzso events, detected zzso with cell cycle zzso The zzso induction and increase in the extent of zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were seen in both cell zzso zzso and zzso were zzso approximately 1 h prior to zzso of zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was seen after 2 h following zzso zzso The zzso and zzso of zzso were essentially similar in both cell types, which provide justification for the use of zzso cells in the assessment of zzso of zzso in lieu of normal zzso zzso zzso The observation that zzso was more pronounced in zzso cells is consistent with the mechanism of induction of zzso occurring as a result of collision of replication zzso with primary zzso such as DNA zzso that can be caused by zzso zzso The zzso assessment of zzso zzso provides a means to estimate the zzso of zzso and to explore the mechanisms of the response as a function of cell cycle phase and cell zzso
