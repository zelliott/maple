zzso is a potent zzso of global zzso translation and protein zzso yet it zzso regulates zzso B zzso zzso translation, via an unknown zzso zzso zzso has a long zzso of 16 zzso suggesting zzso storage as zzso likely in the form of zzso zzso The availability of zzso zzso for translation may be regulated by the rate of release from zzso silenced zzso within zzso zzso called processing bodies zzso zzso In this report, we directly zzso zzso zzso zzso traffic and determined whether insulin zzso zzso zzso translation by entering zzso P zzso We assessed the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso (as a zzso with P body zzso markers using a strong interaction between the zzso zzso protein zzso and a sequence specific zzso zzso zzso We observed statistically significant increases in the zzso of zzso zzso into P bodies zzso h after insulin treatment (by zzso The movement of zzso zzso into zzso P bodies correlated with reduced zzso efficiency as assessed by zzso profiling and measurement of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was insensitive to insulin treatment, suggesting selective regulation of zzso zzso by zzso Overall, our data suggest that insulin may specifically silence zzso zzso translation by zzso its zzso into P bodies and reducing the size of zzso competent zzso zzso zzso control via traffic into zzso zzso zzso may be an important mechanism for controlling the rate of zzso synthesis and zzso zzso zzso
