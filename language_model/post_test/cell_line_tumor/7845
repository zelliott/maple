The zzso zzso is an important zzso of tumor cell proliferation and zzso Here, we investigated the zzso and zzso properties of zzso a novel zzso zzso in human melanoma zzso zzso effects were determined in a panel of melanoma cell lines with different genetic zzso zzso markedly inhibited zzso zzso and growth of both zzso zzso and zzso melanoma cell lines, with zzso in the zzso range even in the least responsive zzso Growth zzso was observed both in zzso and in zzso in zzso models, regardless of zzso zzso status, and was due to zzso cell cycle arrest and subsequent induction of zzso Cell cycle zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso regulators were modulated by zzso at the protein zzso Gene expression profiling revealed profound zzso of several genes involved in the negative control of zzso signaling and melanoma cell zzso suggesting alternative, potentially relevant mechanisms of zzso Finally, zzso inhibited the production of the zzso factors vascular zzso growth factor and zzso 8 at a zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso exerts potent zzso zzso and zzso activity in melanoma lines, regardless of their zzso zzso zzso zzso understanding of the molecular mechanisms of action of zzso zzso will likely translate into more effective treatment strategies for patients experiencing zzso zzso
