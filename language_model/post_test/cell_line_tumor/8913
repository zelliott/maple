The zzso zzso cell line has been proposed as a model cell line of human zzso zzso for induction studies via zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso We examined whether zzso zzso influences zzso induction of zzso zzso in the zzso cell zzso We found that zzso zzso and zzso suppresses zzso zzso in gene reporter zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso activity by zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso expression construct and treatment with zzso abolished the effect of zzso on zzso promoter construct in transient zzso gene reporter zzso zzso a zzso zzso suppressed the effect of zzso on zzso zzso of zzso responsive reporter zzso We also found that zzso stimulates both zzso and zzso degradation of zzso but not of zzso hydrocarbon zzso nuclear zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso In experiments with zzso zzso zzso and zzso we found that the degradation is not sensitive to zzso zzso in zzso We can conclude that zzso suppresses zzso zzso induction in zzso cells through the unique mechanism of zzso zzso which involves accelerated degradation of zzso
