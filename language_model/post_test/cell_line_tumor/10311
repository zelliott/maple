Cancer cells produce zzso as a tumor promoting zzso zzso zzso as a zzso small drug, is shown to suppress tumor growth by zzso multiple cancer enhancing activities of zzso including immune cell zzso zzso and protection against zzso zzso Thus, using zzso melanoma and zzso zzso breast cancer models, zzso injection of zzso significantly raised the levels of zzso zzso zzso and reduced zzso zzso cell content, reducing tumor zzso zzso treatment of tumors in zzso nude mice zzso in T cell zzso reduced zzso and slowed tumor growth by a third less than in zzso zzso zzso down zzso expression zzso in both cancer cell types significantly zzso tumor growth and the sensitivity of the zzso tumors to zzso was severely reduced, highlighting a specific role for zzso zzso cells were protected by zzso from zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso but zzso inhibited this zzso protective effect of zzso and reduced tube forming activity in zzso zzso We show for the first time that the single agent, zzso zzso prevents many tumor promoting effects of zzso on zzso immune zzso and protection against zzso stress, providing a potent and novel small zzso as an zzso zzso
