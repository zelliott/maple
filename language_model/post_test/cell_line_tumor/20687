zzso zzso zzso is an aggressive brain zzso fatal within 1 year from diagnosis in most patients despite intensive zzso zzso The migratory and microscopically invasive nature of zzso as well as its resistance to chemotherapy renders conventional therapies inadequate in its zzso Although zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to decrease the long-term survival and improve the zzso of zzso in zzso its role in zzso cellular migration has not been previously zzso In this study, we report for the first time a role for zzso zzso in brain tumor migration and show that zzso zzso profoundly zzso zzso migration and alters cellular zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso results in altered signaling through focal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and a transformation of zzso organization, suggesting both molecular and structural mechanisms for the zzso of zzso We also describe a novel and zzso method of zzso zzso zzso using a newly developed zzso zzso providing proof of principle for future evaluation of zzso zzso therapies in the treatment of zzso Previous findings implicating zzso signaling in zzso survival and chemotherapy resistance coupled with our discovery of the role of zzso zzso in zzso cellular migration support the development of novel zzso therapies for this devastating zzso
