A zzso zzso that could detect zzso and its zzso has been developed by the use of an established cell line grown as zzso to replace the current zzso zzso We used zzso cells and zzso was measured by the release of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the buffer added to treated cells zzso zzso A zzso increase in zzso activity in culture zzso was detected when zzso cells were exposed to zzso and its analogue zzso zzso The zzso response induced by zzso and zzso D was specific for this group of compounds, acting on zzso as it was prevented when cells were zzso with zzso The specificity of our zzso for zzso and its zzso was confirmed by the finding that zzso was not detected when zzso cells were exposed to unrelated toxins such as zzso zzso zzso acid, and zzso even in the case of compounds that elicit zzso responses under our experimental zzso Using extracts from biological materials after zzso with the zzso standard, we found a good correlation between zzso levels measured by our zzso zzso and the expected zzso Our zzso zzso detected zzso in naturally contaminated materials, but estimates were significantly higher than the zzso contents determined by zzso indicating that naturally contaminated materials contain biologically active zzso zzso We conclude that our zzso zzso based on the use of zzso cell zzso is a viable alternative to zzso methods for the determination of zzso and its zzso in contaminated zzso
