Loss of the fragile zzso zzso zzso protein has been documented in cervical cancer and zzso The goal of this study was to confirm the utility of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso evaluations of zzso as functionally relevant zzso of zzso zzso 

We studied matched DNA, zzso and protein from nine zzso cervical cancer cell zzso DNA markers spanning zzso were used to examine the extent of zzso deletions for each cell zzso 5 zzso island zzso of zzso was investigated by zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso transcripts were characterized by reverse zzso zzso Western zzso analysis and zzso were performed to characterize zzso protein zzso 

zzso deletions were found in six of nine cervical cancer cell lines, but only one had zzso deletions involving an zzso All nine lines had both zzso and zzso zzso according to zzso zzso Loss of zzso zzso transcripts were found in five of nine zzso By western zzso analysis, zzso protein expression was lost in five of nine lines, producing an exact correlation with zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso with zzso protein expression by western zzso in eight of nine cell zzso 

A perfect correlation was found between zzso zzso expression and western zzso zzso zzso for zzso protein expression and large zzso zzso deletions are representative zzso of zzso zzso By contrast, the zzso zzso zzso is not zzso with zzso gene zzso and we suggest caution in its use as a functionally relevant zzso for cervical zzso
