The zzso zzso zzso is highly regulated during development and in the adult, in response to zzso of membrane zzso zzso zzso Gene expression of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso in zzso zzso is known to be regulated by receptors that act through protein zzso C zzso or Ras zzso To investigate possible interactions between these two pathways before they zzso on zzso zzso we evaluated whether zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso required Ras for regulation of zzso expression in zzso zzso We found that long-term treatment with zzso which zzso zzso of zzso led to induction of both protein and message levels of zzso by zzso zzso This was dependent on zzso zzso but independent of the zzso factor zzso Moreover, this mechanism of action zzso the effects of zzso of the zzso domain of zzso zzso domain zzso I, which is part of the upstream mechanism for regulation of Ras zzso and a zzso zzso zzso of Ras also led to zzso and zzso zzso of zzso independent of zzso zzso as well as distinct zzso changes consistent with cell zzso and increased zzso activity shown by induction of expression of zzso zzso zzso 2 and zzso zzso Most interestingly, zzso of zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso led to significant increases in zzso message, possibly reflecting a zzso hierarchy during zzso Taken together, these studies suggest that zzso zzso and Ras are essential in regulation of zzso gene expression in zzso zzso
