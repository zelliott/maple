We newly cloned the gene zzso the human zzso zzso zzso zzso from the surgical tissue of a patient with zzso zzso This study was designed to generate zzso zzso zzso zzso for further exploration of its structure and zzso Mice were zzso with naked zzso DNA containing zzso domain of zzso zzso gene and zzso zzso zzso zzso were developed by the zzso of the zzso from mice zzso with zzso DNA to zzso myeloma cells in zzso Three zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso The specificity and sensitivity of zzso were assessed by indirect zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso showed that the three zzso belong to zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso reached was 5 zzso zzso - 1 zzso zzso and the affinity constant zzso of zzso ranged between zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was preliminarily applied to detection expression of zzso for seven tumor zzso including zzso zzso lung cancer, kidney cancer, zzso prostate cancer, breast cancer, and zzso by zzso zzso Our studies demonstrated that zzso of naked DNA containing zzso gene of target zzso and zzso target zzso and combined with in zzso zzso is an effective and simple method to raise zzso
