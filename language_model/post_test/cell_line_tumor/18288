We have zzso in a previous publication, that nontoxic zzso of zzso exert an zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso also interferes with the zzso of cholesterol and zzso We have now extended our studies to try to establish the molecular mechanism by which zzso zzso cholesterol zzso Using zzso zzso we determined the effect of zzso on cholesterol zzso the destiny of cholesterol from zzso zzso and the transport of cholesterol between the plasma membrane and the zzso zzso zzso levels and gene expression of the main proteins involved in cholesterol zzso were zzso by western zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells exposed to zzso showed an increase in cholesterol zzso when zzso but not zzso was used as a zzso The activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as the corresponding zzso zzso increased after 24 h of treatment with zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and further zzso of these zzso increased but the cholesterol zzso was reduced after 6 h of treatment with zzso zzso transport from the plasma membrane to the zzso zzso was impaired by zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso with the transport of cholesterol from the cell surface to the zzso zzso leading to a depletion of cholesterol in the zzso zzso and a deregulation of cholesterol zzso The zzso of cholesterol within the cell and the reduction in zzso synthesis produces an zzso in the zzso ratio that may well be responsible for the zzso activity exhibited by zzso in zzso zzso
