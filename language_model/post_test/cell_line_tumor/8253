zzso zzso zzso are thought to be of importance for the migratory ability of natural killer zzso zzso Their expression and production may influence the amount of zzso zzso cells and thereby any therapeutic zzso In this study, we sought to investigate the importance of zzso for human zzso zzso ability to degrade and migrate through the zzso zzso zzso The two human zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso migratory ability, zzso expression and production as well as their zzso appearance when cultured in the zzso equivalent zzso were zzso and zzso The zzso more migratory zzso cells were found to express zzso at a significantly higher degree when cultured in zzso and gave rise to a general disintegration of the zzso The zzso cells had a higher zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a significantly higher production of zzso compared to zzso zzso These differences could explain the substantial functional difference observed between the two cell lines with respect to migratory zzso In addition, the number of zzso invading zzso cells decreased significantly in the presence of the zzso inhibitor zzso demonstrating that zzso have a critical function in their zzso
