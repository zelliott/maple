The current techniques for zzso zzso zzso migration and invasion are mainly limited by the need to sacrifice the cells during the test zzso In this study, the vital dye AB zzso was used to zzso cell number and viability of zzso and zzso zzso cells, as well as their migration and invasion through zzso zzso 

AB was directly added to culture medium of incubated test and control zzso At various time zzso the zzso reaction, in which AB is reduced by the cells, was measured by zzso readings at 540 and 630 zzso For cell migration and invasion, cells were cultured onto zzso or zzso zzso zzso AB reduction of migrated cells was zzso to that of control cells to calculate percentages of zzso This model was also tested in the presence of a reported zzso transforming growth factor zzso zzso 

The curve of zzso reduction versus cell number was zzso with zzso and zzso zzso of Variations of zzso zzso zzso AB reduction increased with both seeding zzso and incubation time with zzso zzso treatment caused a modest decrease in AB reduction in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso treatment also decreased migration in zzso but not in zzso zzso 

AB zzso is a simple and reliable method for zzso zzso zzso migration and zzso
