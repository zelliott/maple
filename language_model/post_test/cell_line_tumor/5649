zzso A1 binds to zzso in a cooperative zzso zzso zzso A1 binding to an zzso zzso zzso at the 3' end of human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso 3, which is a zzso site, is followed by cooperative spreading in a zzso zzso As zzso A1 zzso toward the zzso end of the zzso it zzso binding of a zzso zzso protein to an zzso zzso zzso thereby zzso zzso at that zzso alternative 3' zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 and the preceding zzso of zzso zzso can fold into an elaborate zzso secondary structure in solution, which could potentially influence zzso A1 zzso We report here that zzso A1 binding and zzso repression can occur on an zzso zzso Moreover, zzso A1 can effectively unwind an zzso hairpin upon zzso zzso a bound zzso We further show that zzso A1 can also spread in a zzso direction, although when initial binding takes place in the middle of an zzso spreading zzso proceeds in a zzso zzso Finally, when two distant zzso sites are present on the same zzso they facilitate cooperative spreading of zzso A1 between the two zzso
