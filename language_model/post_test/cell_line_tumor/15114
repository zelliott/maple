zzso D zzso a zzso zzso that functions as a zzso zzso for duck zzso B virus, is frequently zzso in human zzso We have explored its expression pattern, clinical significance, and biological function of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was markedly elevated in zzso relative to adjacent zzso liver zzso as determined by quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction and Western zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso of 400 zzso zzso had high expression of zzso zzso zzso was significantly associated with serum levels of zzso B surface zzso and zzso B e zzso liver zzso pathological grade, and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso cells by zzso interference reduced cell zzso blocked the cell cycle at zzso phase, and increased zzso Many genes implicated in zzso regulation, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso by zzso zzso Thus zzso is frequently zzso in zzso and targeting zzso zzso zzso cell proliferation through induction of zzso zzso arrest and zzso thereby providing a potential therapeutic target for this zzso
