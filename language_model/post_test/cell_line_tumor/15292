zzso zzso of zzso islands not only associated with tumor zzso genes can lead to repression of gene zzso but also contribute to escape of the tumor from immune surveillance and contribute significantly to zzso In the present study, we studied the zzso of low zzso protein zzso gene and its regulation on protein expression in zzso from zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso patients and their neighboring normal zzso zzso and zzso genes promoter region zzso sequences were zzso in zzso cancer cell line zzso by zzso zzso and quantitative detection of zzso DNA from 30 pairs of zzso zzso and adjacent normal zzso by zzso zzso San Diego, CA, zzso and zzso and zzso protein expression were analyzed with zzso In zzso we identified 6 zzso sites zzso from all of 22 zzso sites of zzso zzso However, no zzso was found for zzso The analysis of the data resulted from the quantitative analysis of single zzso site zzso by zzso zzso platform, has shown that the zzso level between two groups zzso sites zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso significant differences between zzso and neighboring normal zzso The analysis of zzso level of whole target zzso zzso indicated that the zzso level of zzso was significant higher in zzso zzso zzso zzso than in neighboring normal zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso there was a tendency of decreasing the zzso proteins expression as the increasing the zzso level of zzso gene promoter regions zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso gene promoter zzso and protein zzso were correlated at high extent in zzso zzso patients, and may explain the zzso regulation on gene zzso
