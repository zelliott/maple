The zzso zzso zzso cancer cell line is also resistant to zzso and models the resistance zzso of relapsed zzso cancer patients after zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso array zzso was used to zzso the expression of 380 genes associated with chemotherapy resistance in zzso zzso zzso resistance in zzso is zzso by gene and protein zzso of zzso and the protein is functionally zzso zzso resistance was not reversed by zzso confirming that zzso is not a zzso zzso zzso resistance in zzso is zzso and is zzso in part by the zzso zzso and decreased zzso of zzso Total cellular zzso was not zzso However, the zzso activity of zzso and zzso were zzso The cellular zzso of copper zzso zzso changed from membrane associated in zzso to zzso in zzso This may mediate the previously reported zzso zzso There was decreased expression of the sodium zzso pump zzso zzso and zzso which all have been previously associated with platinum zzso defects in zzso cell zzso Cellular zzso of zzso was also altered in zzso shifting zzso compared to zzso zzso was also zzso at the gene and protein zzso The zzso of zzso in a resistant model developed with zzso is zzso This demonstrates that zzso can be zzso as a zzso stress response rather than as a specific response to a zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells may be zzso to relapsed zzso cancer patients treated with frontline zzso zzso
