The mature zzso zzso is derived from the zzso end of zzso Although zzso is zzso in some tumors, its specific roles in lung cancer cell zzso is still zzso To study its function, the authors examined the effects of zzso on zzso in lung cancer cells and investigated its probable regulatory zzso The authors showed that zzso expression was lower in different lung cancer cell lines than in Human zzso zzso zzso cells by quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction zzso In zzso experiments, the authors found that zzso suppressed proliferation and induced zzso in zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso and protein expression was increased by zzso zzso Moreover, blocking zzso zzso attenuated the effect of zzso on zzso In zzso experiments, zzso zzso zzso and protein expression was decreased by blocking zzso The effect of zzso inhibitor on zzso was also weakened by blocking zzso zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso zzso zzso via a zzso zzso in human lung cancer zzso These results provide new insight into the roles of the zzso family in lung zzso
