We compare the zzso uniformity and the associated effects of the spiral and zzso scanning patterns that are commonly used in an zzso zzso analyses and zzso simulations were first performed to zzso investigate the area zzso density in the spiral scanning zzso The results revealed the potential problem of manifest zzso due to the very high zzso density in the center of the spiral zzso Similar analyses of the zzso scanning pattern, which can be zzso implemented on the same zzso with no hardware zzso showed a more uniform zzso density with about an zzso reduction in the peak zzso zzso To underscore the benefit offered by the improved zzso zzso we conducted in zzso zzso zzso imaging of cultured cells stained with a zzso viability zzso using our zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both the spiral and the zzso scans were zzso Our experimental results showed that cells near the spiral scan center experienced obvious zzso whereas cells remained alive over the entire region under the zzso beam zzso confirming the predicted advantage offered by the zzso scan over this spiral scan in an zzso zzso
