zzso a zzso zzso zzso is highly expressed in zzso zzso and is recognized by the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso had shown excellent targeting to zzso cancer in several early phase clinical trials but being zzso the zzso full therapeutic potential could not be zzso To overcome this impediment we developed a humanized zzso version named zzso expressed in human zzso cells and cloned by limiting zzso In order to select a clone with high therapeutic potential clones were characterized using a series of zzso zzso flow zzso real-time surface zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and quantitative zzso Comparative analyses of zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the two zzso had similar specificity for zzso by flow zzso with a panel of 30 cell lines and maintained similar kinetic zzso zzso and high producer cell clones potentially suitable for use in manufacturing were zzso zzso zzso were assessed by zzso using a large panel of zzso including human zzso of zzso zzso kidney and breast zzso An assessment of its binding towards 33 normal human zzso was performed as zzso zzso showed selected strong zzso with the tested tumor types but little or no zzso with the normal zzso tested confirming its potential for targeted zzso zzso The remarkable zzso shown by zzso in zzso cells is a significant addition to the traits of stability and productivity displayed by the top clones of zzso zzso zzso toxicity functionality was confirmed in repeated zzso using cancer cell lines derived from zzso kidney and lung as zzso To explore use of this zzso in clinical trials, zzso production of zzso has been zzso As the next step of development, Phase I clinical trials are now planned for translation of zzso into the zzso
