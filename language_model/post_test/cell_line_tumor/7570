Gallic acid zzso a natural agent, is widely zzso in plants with a range of biological effects and has been of potential interest as zzso zzso However, its effects on zzso cell zzso are still zzso In the present study, the possible mechanisms of zzso zzso were explored in zzso cells, a human zzso cell zzso Our results showed that zzso inhibited cell viability zzso and zzso zzso examination of zzso cells exhibited the typical features of cell death, such as zzso up of the cells and cell zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso inhibited the migratory abilities of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso induction by zzso To determine the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso the expression levels zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined in zzso cells treated with zzso We found that zzso zzso the expression of the zzso protein zzso and zzso the expression of the zzso protein zzso and the zzso of zzso and zzso To identify the possible mechanisms, the changes of zzso expression were tested using the zzso zzso expression zzso It was observed that the zzso gene was zzso in treated zzso Taken together, these data show that zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell migration by zzso zzso in zzso zzso
