In humans, the zzso protein family is composed of 21 highly related low molecular weight zzso zzso zzso These proteins are known to have zzso zzso and zzso value in a variety of zzso but their small size and high sequence zzso present a challenging scenario for quantitative zzso zzso Here, we developed a zzso zzso selected reaction monitoring zzso zzso to specifically measure the zzso protein zzso family in cancer zzso Several zzso parameters associated with zzso zzso zzso were investigated to derive a method with optimal zzso We detected 11 zzso zzso across a panel of 9 colon and breast cancer cell zzso The quantitative potential of the zzso zzso for zzso discovery was demonstrated by studying the zzso cell lines zzso and zzso a cellular model of colon cancer zzso Our findings were shown to be in agreement with previously published zzso zzso level zzso for zzso genes in these cell zzso zzso of the zzso results using zzso zzso with those obtained using zzso labeled zzso standards demonstrated reliability of the zzso These data support the use of zzso to zzso zzso protein zzso as these are important players in a broad range of human zzso
