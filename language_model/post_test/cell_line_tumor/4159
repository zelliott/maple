zzso nerve injuries can be surgically repaired by zzso the zzso nerve zzso or, in case of larger zzso by the transplantation of an zzso nerve zzso To avoid donor site zzso the development of artificial implants is zzso zzso hollow zzso have been used for this purpose but are inferior to the zzso because they lack internal guidance cues for zzso cells and zzso zzso In this article, we describe the design of a three-dimensional zzso scaffold consisting of parallel fibers embedded in a collagen zzso For this purpose, an zzso device was developed to produce and manipulate a zzso array of aligned zzso zzso zzso This fiber array was then incorporated into zzso zzso tubes to serve as artificial nerve zzso Using primary cultures of embryonic chicken zzso root zzso we show that zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of our composite scaffold guide the direction of zzso cell migration and zzso zzso
