In a strategy to identify novel genes involved in zzso zzso by molecular characterization of zzso zzso zzso we identified the zzso zzso zzso a protein with an as yet undefined function, to be disrupted by a zzso zzso in a primary zzso zzso zzso comparative zzso zzso detected deletions involving zzso in around half of zzso cell lines and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso levels in human zzso demonstrated highest zzso expression in brain, reduced levels in all zzso cell lines and most zzso and similar levels in zzso and zzso cells by analysis of different zzso regions from zzso zzso zzso against zzso were generated and showed similar protein levels in zzso and zzso white matter of human brain, while levels were significantly reduced in zzso with zzso zzso By zzso of zzso cells, zzso zzso with zzso in focal zzso Physical interaction between zzso and zzso was demonstrated via zzso zzso in zzso zzso demonstrated a significant decrease in colony formation, migration and invasion capacity of zzso and zzso zzso cells carrying a zzso zzso deletion zzso expressing zzso compared with zzso zzso In an in zzso zzso zzso mouse model, zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso had a significantly reduced volume compared to zzso not expressing zzso In zzso the frequently deleted zzso gene encodes a novel focal zzso complex protein with zzso zzso function in zzso which we name zzso Since zzso genetic variation has been implicated in Alzheimer's disease, our data are also relevant for zzso
