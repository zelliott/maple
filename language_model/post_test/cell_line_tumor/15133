zzso zzso is generally treated as a cell surface marker found on zzso stem cells and tumor zzso cells, and its biological function remains zzso zzso modified rat zzso cell lines were generated by zzso gene delivery of human zzso into rat zzso zzso cells zzso zzso or by infection of zzso cells with control zzso zzso zzso zzso expression promoted the zzso ability of zzso spheres with an increase in the expression of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso target gene expression zzso zzso and zzso were increased in zzso zzso when compared to zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso cells effectively suppressed their zzso ability, indicating that these factors are involved in expanding the growth of zzso zzso An elevated expression of zzso protein 27 zzso was detected in zzso zzso A decline in the invasion of zzso zzso by zzso of zzso expression indicated the critical role of zzso in promoting cell migration of zzso zzso In zzso study further showed that zzso zzso formed aggressive tumors in zzso compared to zzso Exposure of zzso zzso to zzso zzso not only reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression in zzso but also inhibited their zzso in zzso The results show that zzso zzso cells with stable zzso expression enhanced their zzso properties with increased zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso action, which contribute to increased cell proliferation and migration of zzso zzso in zzso as well as progressive tumor formation in zzso
