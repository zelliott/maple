Treatment of zzso remains a challenge in zzso We investigated if treatment with neural stem cells engineered to express zzso TRAIL zzso alone or in combination with zzso zzso is a feasible therapeutic approach for experimental zzso zzso cells showed resistance to soluble TRAIL and zzso zzso alone, but responded well to their combined zzso In zzso with zzso zzso cells appeared to be more prone to zzso than to treatment with soluble zzso which was enhanced by zzso inhibitor zzso In zzso the survival of animals bearing zzso zzso zzso was significantly improved by zzso The addition of zzso further enhanced the efficacy of zzso treated group in one of examined tumor zzso These data demonstrate that therapy with zzso is a potent cell based approach for treatment of zzso Such an approach warrants further search for zzso capable of increasing sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso in zzso
