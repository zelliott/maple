Type 2 diabetes zzso zzso results from pancreatic beta cell failure in the setting of insulin zzso zzso zzso in the gene zzso the beta cell zzso factor pancreatic zzso zzso 1 zzso are associated with both zzso and maturity onset diabetes of the young zzso and low levels of zzso accompany beta cell dysfunction in experimental models of zzso and zzso Here, we find that zzso is required for zzso beta cell mass expansion in response to zzso insulin resistance through its roles in promoting beta cell survival and zzso zzso zzso beta cells show evidence of zzso zzso zzso stress both in the complex zzso milieu of high-fat feeding as well as in the setting of acutely reduced zzso expression in the zzso mouse zzso cell zzso Further, zzso zzso enhances beta cell zzso to zzso zzso zzso The results of high zzso expression zzso and zzso occupancy analyses reveal that zzso regulates a broad array of genes involved in diverse functions of the zzso including proper zzso bond formation, protein zzso and the unfolded protein zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso leads to a failure of beta cell compensation for insulin resistance at least in part by zzso critical functions of the zzso
