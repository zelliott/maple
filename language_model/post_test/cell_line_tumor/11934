To investigate the combined zzso activity in mice of zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso mice were implanted with zzso tumors expressing zzso zzso tumors were treated zzso with zzso zzso alone, zzso with zzso alone, or with the two agents zzso zzso was zzso with zzso and used to study the effect of zzso on its zzso by zzso zzso 

Using doses at which either agent alone caused stabilization of tumor growth, the combination was synergistic causing long-lasting complete zzso in many zzso In contrast, zzso was not observed when the same cells were treated with these agents in zzso zzso zzso of zzso was not affected by treatment with zzso 

The combination of zzso and zzso exerts a synergistic zzso effect in animals but not in cell zzso This effect is not secondary to increased tumor zzso of the zzso zzso could be due to improved zzso distribution within the tumor or could involve factors released by other cell types in the zzso
