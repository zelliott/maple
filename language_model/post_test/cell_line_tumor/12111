zzso spread to regional zzso zzso is one of the earliest events of tumor cell dissemination and presents a most significant zzso factor for predicting survival of cancer zzso zzso in zzso imaging of the spread of tumor cells through the zzso system can enhance our understanding of the zzso zzso zzso we describe the use of in zzso zzso zzso imaging to monitor the progression of zzso zzso zzso as well as the course of spontaneous zzso through the zzso system of zzso zzso human breast cancer tumors in severe combined zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cancer cells in the zzso zzso zzso was achieved using cells expressing high levels of red fluorescent zzso zzso imaging of these zzso zzso revealed the initial invasion of the tumor cells through the zzso system into the zzso zzso followed by intrusion into the zzso of the zzso zzso injected zzso in the tumor area enabled simultaneous tracking of zzso vessels, labeled in green, and zzso red cancer cells within these zzso Fast snapshots of spontaneously zzso cells in the zzso vessels monitored the movement of a few tumor cells and the development of zzso clustered at zzso vessel zzso zzso of high zzso fluid pressure zzso in the tumors and fast drainage rates of the zzso into the zzso zzso vessels suggested an zzso zzso into the zzso zzso This work presents unprecedented live zzso images that may help to clarify the steps occurring in the course of spontaneous zzso zzso
