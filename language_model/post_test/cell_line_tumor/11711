zzso has become a solicitous therapeutic target in zzso and clinical drug-resistant zzso Here, we evaluated whether or not zzso zzso and its zzso and zzso zzso repress the expression of the zzso zzso Among the test compounds, zzso zzso an zzso analogue of zzso significantly suppressed the expression of zzso and zzso inhibited cell proliferation and induced zzso in zzso cancer zzso Our results revealed that zzso reduced zzso expression through a zzso mechanism and involvement of zzso zzso zzso disrupted the association of zzso heat shock protein zzso with zzso resulting from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we found that zzso significantly enhanced the zzso efficacy of clinical drugs against zzso tumors and efficiently reduced zzso drug resistance in zzso and in zzso These findings suggest that zzso should be developed further as a novel zzso drug candidate for the treatment of drug-resistant zzso
