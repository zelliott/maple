We have conducted the first study to determine the diagnostic potential of the zzso intermediate zzso as compared to the zzso subset of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso These zzso populations were investigated by flow zzso in healthy volunteers zzso and in zzso zzso patients with localized zzso or zzso zzso zzso We further determined blood levels of zzso associated with zzso zzso The results revealed the intermediate zzso subset to be significantly elevated in zzso cancer patients and to show the highest zzso in localized zzso zzso zzso analysis identified intermediate zzso as a significant independent variable in cancer zzso With a zzso value at zzso zzso zzso of total zzso the diagnostic sensitivity and specificity ranged at zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso levels were elevated in localized cancer but did not differ significantly between groups and none of the zzso correlated with zzso zzso Of interest, in zzso analyses supported the observation that intermediate zzso were more zzso induced by primary as opposed to zzso cancer cells which may relate to the zzso milieu established in the advanced stage of zzso zzso In conclusion, intermediate zzso as compared to zzso zzso are a more sensitive diagnostic indicator of zzso zzso
