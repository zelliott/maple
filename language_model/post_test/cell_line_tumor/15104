To enhance limited drug penetration that zzso drug resistance and zzso within the zzso zzso we designed a zzso zzso loaded zzso zzso zzso zzso consisted with zzso zzso and low molecular weight zzso zzso zzso zzso The restoration of zzso charge on the zzso was achieved via zzso degradation by zzso which is zzso in zzso The size and surface charge of zzso zzso loaded with zzso zzso was zzso zzso and 0 zzso zzso The zzso was showed significant zzso in zzso cancer zzso The zzso value of zzso was 100 times less than that of free zzso The growth of zzso zzso in zzso mice was inhibited via intravenous injection of zzso Furthermore, the invasive distance and amount of zzso zzso within the deep tissue regions were increased two times than that of zzso zzso the zzso based drug delivery system could be useful for treatment of zzso zzso
