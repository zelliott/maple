High levels of zzso are a poor zzso factor in multiple human zzso and mostly correlate with low zzso zzso zzso is a bacterial zzso zzso with strong zzso zzso zzso of cell cycle blockade zzso one of its zzso actions but the mechanisms involved are zzso The aim of this study was to explore the role of the zzso axis in zzso zzso effect on human lung zzso zzso 

zzso effects on cell cycle progression and long-term cell proliferation of human lung zzso cells were characterized by flow zzso and colony formation zzso zzso zzso zzso and promoter activity analyses were performed for assessing zzso control, while zzso chase analysis evaluated protein zzso zzso was employed for zzso zzso 

zzso increased zzso expression mainly by stabilizing zzso through zzso repression of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso depletion restored the colony forming capacity of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso induced zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso as revealed by decreased zzso 9 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but zzso zzso failed to restore zzso expression in zzso zzso 

zzso repression of zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso are essential for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso Our findings further zzso the potential for developing zzso as a novel class of zzso zzso zzso
