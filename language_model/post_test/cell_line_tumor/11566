Advanced zzso cell zzso zzso is an invariably fatal zzso Currently, zzso zzso that target cell growth, zzso or zzso pathways represent the primary zzso interventions for this disease, but these zzso only delay tumor progression and are not zzso The zzso zzso showed the potential to provide lasting zzso in several phase zzso trials for advanced zzso but subsequent trials, including a zzso phase III study using zzso as a zzso for zzso were less zzso zzso these trials were designed to exploit the indirect zzso effects of zzso whereas its direct zzso zzso its ability to trigger programmed cell death in zzso mostly zzso Here, we show that the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso otherwise resistant zzso cells to direct zzso death by zzso zzso we show that zzso functions, at least in part, by zzso zzso zzso zzso In the absence of this zzso zzso triggers programmed necrosis (or zzso dependent on the zzso zzso When taken together with the observation that zzso signaling is elevated in zzso these results provide rationale for the combined use of zzso and zzso in the treatment of zzso zzso
