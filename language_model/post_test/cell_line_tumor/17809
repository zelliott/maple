zzso zzso between cycles of chemotherapy likely has a negative effect on clinical outcome in zzso cancer zzso Thus, avoiding zzso periods when tumor cells zzso by providing sustained chemotherapy regimens may improve clinical zzso We investigated the effect of sustained versus intermittent zzso administration on tumor zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso survival, and zzso were followed in zzso and zzso cells after equivalent exposure to intermittent and sustained levels of zzso In zzso tumor zzso in response to sustained and intermittent zzso therapy was investigated in an zzso zzso model of human zzso zzso zzso growth, zzso and zzso were evaluated at different intervals during and after the course of treatment using zzso zzso zzso and terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso labeling zzso zzso treatment significantly reduced survival in zzso in both cell lines, whereas an increase in zzso survival was observed in the intermittent group with each treatment zzso indicating a gradual acceleration in zzso zzso Similarly, in zzso sustained therapy resulted in a significant reduction of tumor growth and zzso zzso therapy resulted in increased tumor proliferation and no zzso The percentage of zzso tumor cells significantly increased in the sustained group, whereas no significant changes were seen in the control and intermittent zzso zzso administration of zzso significantly zzso both in zzso and in zzso tumor zzso rates, whereas sustained delivery inhibited tumor growth and zzso zzso administration of zzso may increase zzso and clinical response in zzso cancer by attenuating tumor zzso
