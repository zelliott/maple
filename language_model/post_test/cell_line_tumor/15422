Patients with human zzso zzso head and neck cancer zzso show significantly improved survival outcome compared with those with zzso zzso zzso Published data examining this difference offers conflicting results to zzso We systematically investigated the radiation sensitivity of all available validated zzso zzso cell lines and a series of zzso zzso cell lines using in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited greater intrinsic radiation sensitivity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso corresponding with a prolonged zzso zzso arrest and increased zzso following radiation exposure zzso change zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso A zzso zzso was used to compare gene expression 24 hours following radiation between zzso and zzso cell zzso Multiple genes in zzso zzso were zzso in zzso cells zzso score zzso including a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso Using immortalized human zzso zzso zzso cells, increased radiation sensitivity was seen in cell expressing zzso E6 despite the effect of E6 to degrade zzso This suggested that low levels of normally functioning zzso in zzso zzso cells could be activated by radiation, leading to cell zzso zzso with this, more complete zzso of zzso by zzso resulted in radiation zzso These results provide clear evidence, and a supporting zzso for increased radiation sensitivity in zzso zzso relative to zzso zzso This issue is under active investigation in a series of clinical trials attempting to zzso radiation (and zzso in selected patients with zzso zzso in light of their favorable overall survival zzso
