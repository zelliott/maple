zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso member of the zzso family, plays a crucial role in Multiple zzso zzso zzso and drug resistance, thus representing a promising therapeutic target in zzso A novel strategy to inhibit zzso activity is the induction of zzso zzso zzso Our own and other previous studies have demonstrated zzso generation of a zzso zzso fragment, zzso which zzso zzso cell proliferation and zzso Here, we show that similar to zzso the novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso and zzso induce the generation of zzso in zzso zzso Next, the molecular zzso downstream of zzso which mediate its zzso activity, were zzso Surprisingly, we observed nuclear zzso of drug-induced or zzso zzso zzso followed by elevated zzso and protein levels of zzso as well as enhanced zzso reporter zzso Moreover, drug-induced zzso activity was blocked after introducing a point zzso into the highly zzso zzso zzso site zzso but not zzso zzso zzso cell death was significantly decreased in zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso zzso with these data, treatment with zzso triggered zzso zzso followed by zzso in zzso but not zzso zzso embryonic zzso zzso zzso of a zzso carrying zzso into zzso zzso restored zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso reporter zzso Finally, our data indicate that drug-induced generation of a zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso may also be a novel therapeutic approach in other tumor zzso
