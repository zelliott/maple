zzso protein beta zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso factors that contribute to the regulation of a wide range of important cellular zzso The data in the present study document that zzso from the human zzso gene is induced in response to zzso zzso stress, such as zzso zzso or treatment of cells with zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso fragments linked to a zzso reporter gene demonstrated that the zzso promoter plays no major regulatory zzso Instead, by deletion analysis it was discovered that a zzso region, located at a zzso site that zzso to the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso an element that was required for the stress zzso zzso demonstrated that a zzso element located at zzso zzso zzso is responsible for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso mobility shift analysis revealed that proteins are bound to this element and that the amount of binding is increased following zzso zzso This element is zzso to a previously reported zzso unfolded protein response element that binds zzso zzso with those data, zzso of zzso caused an increase in zzso that was zzso by the zzso zzso unfolded protein response zzso
