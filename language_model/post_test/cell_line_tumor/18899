zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso known to markedly alter expression of major organic zzso zzso in zzso zzso However, its effects toward human zzso zzso remain poorly zzso zzso the present study was aimed at determining zzso effects on expression of organic zzso zzso in primary human zzso and highly differentiated human zzso zzso zzso Exposure to 1 zzso zzso was first shown to markedly repress zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso a major zzso zzso handling zzso zzso in both human zzso and zzso zzso It zzso reduced zzso protein levels and zzso cellular zzso of zzso in zzso zzso Other zzso such as the influx zzso organic zzso transporting zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso pumps zzso zzso protein zzso 2, zzso zzso and breast cancer resistance protein were also zzso at zzso levels in human zzso treated by zzso for 24 zzso and most of these zzso were similarly zzso in zzso zzso zzso the zzso also reduced zzso salt export pump zzso and zzso protein expression in human zzso zzso was further shown to activate the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in human zzso and zzso zzso however, chemical zzso of this zzso failed to counteract zzso effects of zzso toward zzso zzso zzso and zzso Taken together, these data indicate that zzso treatment reduced expression of major organic zzso zzso in human zzso cells in an zzso zzso Such zzso effects may likely participate in both zzso and zzso of zzso zzso pathways caused by inflammation in zzso
