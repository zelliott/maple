zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a nuclear zzso involved in regulation of zzso and zzso zzso wound healing and zzso zzso has been associated also with zzso Here we investigated the expression of zzso and components of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso cell lung cancer zzso We found increased expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in human zzso compared to normal zzso In zzso cell lines zzso zzso increased proliferation and survival, while zzso zzso reduced viability and increased zzso zzso zzso induced zzso and zzso transcription, suggesting the existence of zzso zzso promoting cell survival, inflammation and zzso These effects were seen only in high zzso expressing cells, while low expressing cells were less or not zzso The effects were also abolished by zzso zzso or incubation with a zzso zzso zzso of zzso was due to both binding of zzso to the zzso promoter and zzso zzso through a zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso with the zzso regulatory zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso these data indicate that zzso might be a central element in lung zzso controlling multiple pathways and representing a potential target for zzso zzso
