A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso recognizes zzso from zzso zzso and related mouse zzso but does not bind to zzso zzso with zzso and a zzso zzso zzso provides the first direct evidence that zzso protein is expressed from both zzso on a significant proportion of zzso cells from four different types of zzso hybrid zzso The observed level of zzso zzso expression zzso followed the product rule in both freshly isolated and cultured zzso zzso Surprisingly, the percentage of zzso cells expressing both zzso zzso could be dramatically increased in zzso and in zzso through zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells in an zzso but not zzso background were more likely to lyse zzso and Chinese zzso zzso tumor cells than zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso cells also proliferated to a higher degree in response to zzso than zzso cells expressing a zzso zzso in an zzso but not zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso has a lower affinity for zzso than zzso and the genetic background zzso the responsiveness of zzso cells bearing zzso zzso Other zzso receptors on the different zzso zzso cell zzso were zzso zzso possibly explaining the disparate responses of zzso zzso cells in different hybrid zzso These data indicate that the zzso zzso and zzso expression of divergent zzso zzso increases the range of zzso affinities and the functional potential in the total zzso cell population of zzso zzso
