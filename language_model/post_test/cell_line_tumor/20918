zzso zzso of the zzso signaling zzso is a hallmark of colon zzso We show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene is zzso by zzso D3 zzso in human colon cancer zzso This effect correlated with the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso early and transient binding of the vitamin D zzso zzso and the zzso zzso to the region adjacent to the zzso start site of zzso Additionally, we demonstrate that the zzso gene is a new downstream target of zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso was not detected in a series of 29 human normal zzso colon zzso but expression was zzso in all the matched zzso zzso zzso An inverse correlation existed between the expression of zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso expression increased the migration and invasion properties of colon cancer cells and zzso media zzso from zzso cells enhanced the capacity to migrate and form zzso zzso of human primary zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso is zzso in colon cancer and is associated with the acquisition of zzso properties by zzso zzso zzso zzso is a novel effect of zzso that may contribute to its zzso zzso
