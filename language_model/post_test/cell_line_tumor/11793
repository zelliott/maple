Renal cell zzso zzso is resistant to traditional cancer therapies such as radiation therapy and zzso The use of targeted therapies has improved the clinical outcomes of patients with zzso zzso However, most patients acquire resistance against targeted therapies over zzso We report that the combination of the novel zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso also known as zzso and the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso cell growth and zzso zzso in zzso zzso This combination activated zzso zzso and -9 and the zzso inhibitor zzso significantly reduced the zzso response to the treatment with zzso and zzso Moreover, the combined treatment induced zzso zzso oxygen species zzso and the radical scavenger zzso zzso blocked the zzso zzso and zzso induced by zzso and zzso The zzso with zzso and zzso markedly decreased zzso and the zzso inhibitor of zzso protein zzso protein levels, but zzso family members were not altered by the zzso zzso These zzso were restored by zzso zzso The transient zzso of zzso and zzso reduced the zzso response to the zzso zzso Additionally, zzso was significantly more effective than zzso another zzso zzso in the combination with zzso against zzso zzso Taken together, these results strongly suggest the combination of zzso and zzso to be a promising treatment for zzso
