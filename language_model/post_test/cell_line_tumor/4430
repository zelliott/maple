We describe the potential benefit of zzso in combination of zzso to treat pancreatic cancer in a zzso mouse zzso The effect of zzso on the level and activity of zzso was characterized using various zzso including reporter zzso quantitative zzso zzso and western zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso effect of zzso and zzso was evaluated in human pancreatic cancer cell lines and a zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso protein levels and activity to regulate its target gene expression through zzso degradation of zzso in human pancreatic cancer cell zzso zzso also reduced the zzso zzso levels and the expression of its downstream target zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso both zzso and zzso Our present study provides a strong zzso rationale to evaluate zzso targeting agents in combination with zzso to treat pancreatic zzso
