zzso zzso a zzso protein zzso is a potential zzso zzso and zzso of zzso have been found in several types of human tumors, including zzso zzso cell zzso zzso It has been demonstrated that cells zzso zzso are more resistant to zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanisms zzso these effects remain largely zzso In this report, we showed that zzso of zzso through stable zzso of zzso in human zzso zzso cells significantly promoted cell proliferation and inhibited zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells were substantially reduced after zzso or zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso substantially enhanced sensitivity to zzso or zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso Moreover, the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso the zzso effect on zzso zzso Taken together, these data provide evidence that zzso zzso promoting cell proliferation and zzso zzso suggesting a novel mechanism that is closely related to zzso zzso and zzso drugs resistance of zzso zzso
