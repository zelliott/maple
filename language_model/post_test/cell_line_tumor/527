New chemical zzso were zzso to label zzso They are based on the high affinity zzso zzso The zzso were zzso with zzso or zzso zzso as the zzso for zzso attachment to the zzso Besides labeling the zzso these aromatic zzso also greatly enhance the affinity of the zzso towards zzso due to the interaction of the zzso with two zzso zzso groups of the zzso The linkage between the sugar and the zzso was varied as an zzso an zzso and a zzso For the zzso and zzso zzso a versatile synthetic route towards a symmetrical zzso was zzso The new zzso were evaluated for their binding affinity of human zzso They were subsequently tested for their labeling efficiency, as well as specificity in the presence of a protein mixture and a human cancer cell zzso
