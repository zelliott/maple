Data on breast cancer resistance protein zzso zzso zzso expression in acute zzso leukemia zzso have been inconsistent, possibly due to use of different zzso in different zzso zzso zzso was studied by the zzso zzso chain reaction and zzso protein expression zzso zzso or zzso zzso with zzso and zzso and function zzso C zzso of zzso zzso by flow zzso in eight cell lines and in zzso blasts from 31 zzso zzso zzso zzso levels, zzso zzso and function correlated strongly in cell lines zzso r values, zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso sample zzso zzso levels were between those in parental zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells in all but one case, and zzso zzso had the zzso sequence at zzso zzso in zzso In zzso unlike in cell lines, zzso protein expression or function, when present, was only detected in small zzso zzso zzso and protein expression did not zzso nor did zzso with different zzso zzso and function did not correlate with zzso nor protein zzso zzso of zzso only in zzso and zzso among zzso zzso suggest complex biology of zzso in zzso and incomplete modeling by cell zzso
