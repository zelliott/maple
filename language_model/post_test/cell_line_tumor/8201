The zzso signaling zzso is activated in many zzso including glioblastoma, yet zzso zzso have largely failed to show efficacy in the zzso zzso promotes feedback zzso of zzso in some patients, potentially underlying clinical resistance and raising the need for alternative approaches to block zzso zzso zzso is a zzso checkpoint that zzso growth factor signaling with cellular zzso in part by zzso regulating zzso We used pharmacological and genetic approaches to determine whether zzso zzso could block zzso growth and cellular zzso and we examined the contribution of zzso signaling in determining response in zzso and in zzso The zzso zzso and activated zzso zzso inhibited zzso signaling and blocked the growth of zzso cells expressing the activated zzso zzso zzso Across a spectrum of zzso cancer cell lines, zzso was more effective than zzso at blocking tumor cell zzso despite less efficient zzso of zzso zzso zzso addition of the zzso products of cholesterol and fatty acid synthesis rescued the growth zzso effect of zzso whereas zzso of these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso thus demonstrating that zzso blocked tumor cell proliferation primarily through zzso of cholesterol and fatty acid zzso Most importantly, zzso treatment in mice significantly inhibited the growth and zzso (as measured by zzso zzso of zzso zzso engineered to express zzso but not their parental zzso These results suggest a mechanism by which zzso zzso the proliferation of zzso expressing zzso and point toward a potential therapeutic strategy for targeting zzso zzso
