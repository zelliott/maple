zzso zzso zzso zzso is a fatal disease with a very poor zzso survival zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that also acts as a surface zzso zzso We find that it is zzso in zzso and present on the cell surface of zzso cell zzso The clinical correlation of its expression with tumor status has been reported for lung and zzso zzso We have previously demonstrated that zzso from zzso patients contain zzso zzso to zzso The present work was intended to assess the ability of zzso to induce zzso T cell zzso We show that zzso zzso cells zzso specifically stimulate healthy zzso T cells to zzso zzso zzso and lyse zzso cells but not normal zzso In zzso zzso T cells inhibited the growth of zzso cells in zzso zzso In 8 out of 12 zzso patients with circulating zzso to zzso the existence of zzso T cells was also zzso Taken as a whole, these results indicate that zzso elicits a zzso integrated zzso and cellular zzso It is thus a promising and clinically relevant molecular target candidate for zzso approaches as new zzso to conventional treatments in pancreatic zzso
