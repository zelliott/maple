When the cell cycle becomes arrested, zzso zzso Target of zzso converts zzso arrest into zzso zzso zzso of zzso D1 is a universal marker of zzso along with zzso zzso zzso and loss of zzso potential zzso zzso the ability to zzso proliferation when the cell cycle is zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso although only partially decreases zzso zzso Here we show that in zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso completely prevented zzso D1 zzso making it zzso We also used zzso cells in which zzso zzso do not inhibit zzso In such cells, zzso by itself induced zzso that was remarkably zzso D1 zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso caused zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Both types of zzso were suppressed by zzso converting it into zzso zzso We confirmed that the inhibitor of zzso caused zzso D1 positive zzso in normal zzso cells, whereas zzso prevented zzso D1 zzso zzso of zzso D1 by zzso did not prevent other markers of zzso that are consistent with the lack of its effect on zzso Our data confirmed that a mere zzso of the cell cycle was sufficient to cause zzso providing zzso was active, and zzso of zzso partially inhibited zzso in a zzso zzso Second, hallmarks of zzso may be zzso and zzso zzso zzso a marker of zzso of zzso cells, did not necessarily determine other markers of zzso Third, zzso of zzso was sufficient to eliminate zzso zzso regardless of zzso
