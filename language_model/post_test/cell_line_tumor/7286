There is considerable evidence implicating the zzso zzso in the anabolic action of zzso and to date, all zzso and zzso peptides that stimulate zzso zzso are active in animal models of zzso We have tested two zzso truncated zzso zzso and a modified zzso zzso in in zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso zzso Each of the zzso truncated peptides was of low zzso potency in zzso of zzso binding and zzso zzso However, when we tested these peptides for functional response in zzso cells zzso zzso with a zzso zzso response element zzso reporter, the zzso truncated peptides were two to four times less potent than would be expected from their binding and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso although active, was approximately zzso less potent than zzso in a rat model of osteogenesis while zzso was zzso The relative lack of activity of these peptides in zzso suggests that while zzso of the zzso zzso may be important for the anabolic effect of zzso fragments, it is not, of itself, zzso of their in zzso zzso
