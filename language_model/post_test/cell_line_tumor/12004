Although zzso zzso has been implicated in certain zzso biological phenomena, other aspects of its function remain zzso Here we report zzso unknown mechanism by which zzso zzso increases radiation sensitivity by regulating the level of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso in lung zzso zzso zzso of human lung cells with zzso zzso zzso resulted in increased cell death and zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso rendered the cells more susceptible to DNA zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso was correlated with increased zzso zzso zzso B1 complex, and zzso Cell cycle synchronization clearly showed zzso of zzso zzso and zzso B1 in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by interference zzso revealed that zzso zzso regulated zzso of zzso B1 in a zzso manner, and confirmed that the increased zzso cells and cell death by zzso zzso were dependent upon zzso zzso zzso our data suggest that zzso zzso enhanced radiation sensitivity by overriding zzso zzso arrest through zzso zzso of zzso zzso
