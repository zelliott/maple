A novel zzso was isolated from the mushroom zzso zzso zzso zzso by affinity zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso after ammonium zzso zzso The zzso coding sequence zzso zzso was identified by performing a zzso search of the five zzso peptides identified by zzso against the translated zzso of zzso zzso The molecular mass of zzso was calculated to be zzso zzso from zzso which was consistent with the data calculated from the zzso acid zzso To zzso the zzso properties of zzso a zzso array composed of 465 zzso candidates was zzso and the result showed that zzso bound with high selectivity to terminal zzso zzso zzso and further analysis revealed that zzso bound to terminal zzso zzso zzso with higher affinity than previously well-known zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed further that zzso bound to zzso in a sequential manner with moderate zzso In the present study, we also evaluated the zzso activity of zzso The results showed that zzso could bind to the surface of zzso cells, leading to induced cell zzso in zzso Furthermore, zzso exerted an zzso effect via zzso of zzso growth and zzso of survival time of zzso mice in zzso
