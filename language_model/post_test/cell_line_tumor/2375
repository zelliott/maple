As part of our program to develop breast cancer specific therapeutic agents, we have zzso a zzso agent that is a zzso of the zzso zzso and the potent zzso zzso In this effort, we employed a modular assembly approach to prepare a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso with an zzso zzso zzso which could be coupled to a complementary zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso chemistry gave the final hybrid that was evaluated for selective zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso breast cancer cell zzso The results demonstrated that the presence of the zzso component in the hybrid compound was critical for selectivity and zzso in zzso human breast cancer cells as the hybrid was zzso more potent than zzso in zzso of cell proliferation and promoting cell zzso
