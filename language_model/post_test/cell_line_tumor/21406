zzso resistance zzso a major obstacle to successful cancer chemotherapy, may be induced by amplification of the zzso gene and zzso of the zzso zzso which acts as drug zzso pump decreasing zzso drug zzso In this study, an zzso zzso zzso was used to overcome zzso in a human zzso cell line, both in zzso and in zzso through zzso of zzso expression and zzso zzso Compared with the unmodified zzso zzso the zzso markedly inhibited zzso expression and zzso zzso With in zzso treatment with the zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso was increased zzso compared to treatment with zzso alone; by contrast, a zzso increase was observed when treated with zzso zzso In the in zzso studies, it was approximately zzso higher compared to the control group treatment with zzso alone and zzso higher than found with zzso The weight of tumors formed was markedly decreased after zzso treatment as compared to either treatments with zzso or zzso zzso Furthermore, treatment with combinations of the agents appeared to be well zzso These results suggest that a strategy using the zzso in combination with zzso drugs may comprise a powerful treatment for zzso
