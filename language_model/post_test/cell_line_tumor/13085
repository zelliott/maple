zzso a small zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and zzso activity, was evaluated for zzso and zzso zzso 

First, zzso in zzso activity on human zzso vein zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso were evaluated by zzso migration, and invasion zzso Second, zzso effect on zzso formation was evaluated ex zzso by chick zzso membrane zzso rat zzso rings zzso and with directed in zzso zzso zzso zzso Third, zzso zzso effect was determined in treatment of zzso mice with zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso of zzso in zzso human zzso and zzso were determined by zzso isolation for zzso 

At the zzso zzso concentration zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso and zzso proliferation and migration (all P zzso zzso At the zzso zzso zzso zzso also inhibited zzso invasion zzso zzso zzso but not zzso In the zzso and rat zzso ring zzso zzso at zzso zzso inhibited zzso formation zzso zzso zzso By zzso zzso at 1 zzso continuous delivered inhibited zzso formation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was well tolerated and inhibited the growth of subcutaneous zzso at 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso By zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso and zzso 

zzso demonstrated stimulation zzso zzso and zzso zzso
