The overall survival of patients with zzso zzso zzso remains poor, and the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso progression and aggressiveness are zzso Here, we report that increased expression of zzso zzso zzso or zzso in human zzso predicts poor survival and disease recurrence after zzso Patients with zzso who have large tumors, with vascular invasion and zzso or distant zzso expressed high levels of zzso zzso zzso tumors zzso zzso were featured by active zzso transition zzso and exhibited increased zzso associated with vascular zzso growth factor zzso whereas zzso zzso expression attenuated zzso and zzso of tumor zzso The zzso activates zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso signaling to promote zzso vascular zzso growth factor, and zzso 2 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso we detected a significant correlation between zzso expression and zzso levels in a cohort of zzso zzso and the combination of these two parameters is a more powerful predictor of poor zzso 

These results present novel zzso insight into a critical role of zzso in zzso progression and zzso
