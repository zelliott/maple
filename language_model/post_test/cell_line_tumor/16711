Both cellular transformation status and cell culture conditions affect fatty acid zzso zzso the incorporation and metabolism of zzso zzso zzso zzso and other zzso zzso fatty zzso were compared in colon cells zzso zzso zzso zzso Growth zzso by zzso in zzso cells was assessed via the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso 2, 5 and 6) was determined in zzso using zzso Analysis of cellular fatty acids revealed a zzso higher incorporation of zzso (40 and zzso in zzso cells compared to zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso fatty acids differed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were shown to convert zzso zzso acid zzso to zzso Moreover, zzso cells revealed no zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso caused stronger growth zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso cells represent a superior model to carry out zzso and zzso studies of zzso and zzso fatty acids compared to zzso zzso Nevertheless, further in-depth zzso and zzso analyses are required to confirm this zzso
