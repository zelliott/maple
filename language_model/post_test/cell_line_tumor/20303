zzso zzso zzso zzso are aggressive zzso of mature T zzso with zzso overall survival rates of only zzso zzso Improvement in outcomes has been stymied by poor understanding of the zzso and molecular zzso of zzso with a resulting paucity of molecular targets for zzso We developed zzso tools to identify zzso zzso using zzso next-generation sequencing analysis of zzso DNA libraries and applied these tools to 16 zzso patient tissue samples and 6 zzso cell zzso Thirteen zzso abnormalities were identified, of which 5 involved zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Among these abnormalities were novel zzso zzso zzso fusion proteins zzso to zzso a zzso zzso zzso that zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso were seen in 11 zzso of 190 zzso and were associated with inferior overall zzso they also were detected in 2 zzso of zzso diffuse large zzso zzso As zzso zzso are rare in zzso compared with other zzso our findings suggest that a constellation of alternate genetic abnormalities may contribute to disruption of zzso tumor zzso function in zzso
