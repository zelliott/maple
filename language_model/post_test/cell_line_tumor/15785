The cell fate determination factor zzso was cloned as a dominant inhibitor of the zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso The expression of zzso is lost in human breast cancer associated with poor zzso Breast zzso cells zzso may contribute to tumor progression and therapy zzso Here, zzso zzso was reduced in breast cancer cell lines with high expression of zzso markers and in patient samples of the zzso breast cancer zzso zzso of zzso reduced new tumor formation in serial zzso in zzso reduced zzso formation, and reduced the proportion of zzso breast tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso increased the breast zzso zzso zzso expression studies of zzso tumors demonstrated zzso zzso a molecular signature associated with stem cells zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso analysis identified zzso binding to the promoter of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso antagonized zzso repression of zzso zzso studies demonstrated zzso directly zzso the zzso and zzso promoters via a zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso in zzso and in zzso
