zzso of cell cycle control has serious effects on zzso tissue repair, and zzso We report here the zzso cell cycle arrest by zzso zzso a zzso zzso derived from activated zzso and its zzso When zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso and incubated for 24 zzso the S phase population decreased significantly with a slight increase in the zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso phase and zzso phase populations did not show marked zzso Three hours after zzso treatment, the zzso protein zzso was zzso especially at zzso and zzso both of which are important zzso sites for the zzso checkpoint zzso The zzso at zzso showed no apparent zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed no apparent zzso Moreover, the zzso activity that zzso zzso remained constant even after zzso zzso The protein zzso activity that zzso zzso showed a marginal zzso zzso when the zzso zzso was oxidized by zzso in zzso the oxidized zzso became difficult to be zzso by zzso especially at zzso and zzso but not at zzso zzso acid analysis of oxidized zzso showed zzso zzso to zzso zzso The zzso zzso cell proteins also showed a decrease in zzso These observations suggested that direct zzso zzso was the major cause of zzso cell cycle zzso In the presence of 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or activated zzso also induced a zzso cell cycle zzso As protein zzso zzso has been reported in inflammation and aging, cell cycle zzso by zzso zzso may occur in various pathological zzso
