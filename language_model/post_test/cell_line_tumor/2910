DNA zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is broadly used in detection of zzso zzso but is less so for zzso zzso because of its limited selectivity for low-level zzso We recently described zzso at lower zzso zzso zzso a method that zzso minority zzso selectively from zzso of zzso and zzso sequences during the zzso We demonstrate that combining zzso with zzso technology provides zzso zzso with the selectivity needed to detect low-level zzso zzso 

zzso zzso or common zzso zzso were designed to contain a zzso that matches the desired zzso approximately in the middle of the zzso The critical zzso temperature zzso of each zzso was then zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed in 2 steps: zzso at the zzso followed by zzso and extension at a single temperature zzso zzso The threshold cycle was used to identify zzso on the basis of serial zzso of zzso DNA into zzso DNA and to identify zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso leukemia viral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso identified zzso zzso within zzso zzso 8 zzso 273 zzso hot zzso and zzso zzso within the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso with a selectivity improvement of zzso to zzso over regular zzso zzso A second round of zzso zzso improved the selectivity by another zzso to zzso and enabled detection of 1 zzso in 2000 zzso zzso Use of zzso zzso allowed quantitative identification of low-level zzso and zzso zzso in colon tumor samples and in zzso lung cancer cell lines treated with zzso zzso 

The major improvement in selectivity provided by zzso enables the popular zzso zzso method to become a powerful tool for detecting low-level zzso in clinical zzso
