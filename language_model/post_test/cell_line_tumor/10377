zzso of the von zzso zzso gene are frequent in clear cell zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso abrogate the function of the zzso protein zzso whereas zzso zzso can have different zzso To identify those zzso zzso with functional consequences, we zzso zzso in 256 sporadic zzso and identified zzso different zzso zzso of which 65 were zzso zzso zzso and zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso were determined in zzso The majority of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were located in zzso 1 in the core of zzso whereas protein surface zzso in zzso 3 affected the interaction zzso of zzso B and zzso Their impact on zzso functionality was further investigated in zzso by zzso reintroducing zzso zzso zzso into a zzso zzso cell line and by monitoring the green fluorescent protein zzso signals after the zzso of a zzso zzso factor zzso expression zzso zzso functionality ranged from no effect to complete zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso and zzso selectively influenced zzso and zzso zzso In zzso we obtained three different groups of zzso zzso one with severe zzso of zzso a second without zzso effects on zzso but relevance for the interaction with zzso zzso B, and zzso zzso and a third with zzso functions comparable with wild zzso We therefore conclude that the specific impact of zzso zzso may help to distinguish between driver and passenger zzso and may explain responses of zzso patients to zzso zzso
