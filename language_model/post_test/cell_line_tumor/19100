The objective of this study was to identify pathways that regulate the zzso induced by free fatty acids zzso in human zzso cells zzso Gene expression profiles of zzso cells were obtained at three time points, after 24, 48, and 72 h of exposure to different types of zzso zzso fatty acid zzso was found to be zzso The pathways activated by the different zzso at the different time points were identified using global gene module map zzso zzso zzso exerted zzso regulation mainly within the first 24 zzso whereas saturated zzso zzso regulated energy production zzso such as the electron transport chain zzso and zzso acid cycle, within the first 24 zzso In the next 24 zzso zzso zzso 36 cell death relevant pathways and zzso several protective zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the final 24 zzso the zzso did not induce significant zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso induced zzso by first zzso zzso pathways in the initial 24 zzso resulting in changes to factors, such as zzso or signaling zzso which subsequently triggered cell death relevant pathways in the next 24 zzso The zzso and release of 27 zzso were measured to further zzso the zzso changes in the first 24 zzso It was determined that zzso bodies such as zzso and zzso were important in separating the toxic from the nontoxic zzso A zzso model was used to identify the genes relevant to these zzso Some of the genes identified to be important were zzso zzso It was found that zzso genes such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso were involved in zzso induced zzso
