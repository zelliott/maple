Cancer cells have elevated zzso zzso that is termed the Warburg zzso But several tumor cells, including zzso cells, also increase zzso zzso which is initiated by zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso targets zzso zzso and zzso expression of zzso zzso Here we show that in human zzso zzso cells the zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso promoter and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso release zzso zzso zzso cells growing in zzso decrease proliferation due to cell zzso in zzso zzso Nevertheless, cells get used to this new source of energy by increasing zzso zzso which zzso with an increase in zzso expression and its zzso to the nucleus, leading to a higher zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso show increase zzso zzso expression and zzso faster than control cells in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells impaired zzso use and zzso zzso dysfunction leading to cell zzso zzso zzso zzso decreases zzso zzso which zzso zzso consumption allowing zzso cells to use this alternative source of carbon and favoring their adaptation to the zzso zzso
