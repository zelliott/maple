zzso 1 zzso encodes full-length zzso and truncated zzso zzso with distinct 3' zzso zzso exerts zzso functions and is increased in breast cancer zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in higher level of zzso The 3' zzso of these two transcripts are distinct with zzso terminating at a premature stop zzso zzso zzso gained an advantage over zzso with regards to zzso This is due to the ability of zzso to interact with sequences within the 3' zzso of zzso but not zzso since the corresponding region is zzso zzso suppressed the translation of zzso in zzso and zzso resulting in increased zzso zzso zzso can induce the zzso of zzso However, our studies indicated that translation appeared to be independent of zzso production by the BC cells zzso This suggested that zzso and translation of zzso might be zzso The findings were validated in zzso zzso suppressed the growth of zzso in zzso nude zzso In total, increased zzso in zzso is due to enhanced zzso and suppressed translation of zzso by zzso to reduced tumor zzso In zzso we report on zzso as a method to further regulate the expression of a zzso zzso to promote zzso In addition, the findings have implications for therapy with zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso must be considered to improve the efficacy of current drugs to zzso
