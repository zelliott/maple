The zzso tumor zzso protein performs a number of cellular functions, ranging from the induction of cell cycle arrest and zzso to effects on DNA zzso zzso zzso activity with zzso zzso is a promising approach for treating zzso however, it is presently unclear how the in zzso application of zzso zzso impact the myriad processes orchestrated by zzso Since approximately half of all colon zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso are zzso we assessed the zzso activity of the zzso inhibitor zzso in the mouse zzso zzso colon cancer model, in which zzso remains wild zzso Using a cell line derived from an zzso zzso we found that four daily zzso to zzso induced persistent zzso stabilization and cell cycle arrest without significant zzso A zzso dosing schedule in zzso generated a similar response in colon zzso growth arrest without significantly increased zzso In adjacent normal colon zzso zzso treatment reduced both cell proliferation and zzso Surprisingly, zzso induced a transient DNA damage response in tumors but not in adjacent normal zzso zzso likewise induced a transient DNA damage response in human colon cancer cells in a zzso manner, and enhanced DNA strand breakage and cell death induced by zzso Our findings indicate that zzso zzso not only trigger growth arrest, but may also stimulate zzso reported ability to slow zzso zzso zzso The potential impact of zzso on DNA repair in tumors suggests that zzso zzso may significantly accentuate the zzso actions of certain therapeutic zzso
