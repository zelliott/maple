The potential zzso agent zzso zzso a zzso protein zzso zzso described as a zzso for the peripheral zzso zzso zzso zzso in some lines of human tumor zzso We investigated the effect of zzso in the zzso cell line, zzso zzso cells were treated with various zzso of zzso and changes in cell growth, the cell cycle, zzso and related parameters were zzso A zzso zzso showed that zzso cells were sensitive to the growth zzso effect of zzso In contrast, the zzso selective zzso zzso has a little effect on these zzso Cell cycle analysis indicated that exposure to zzso decreased the proportion of cells in the S phase and increased the proportion in the zzso zzso of the cell zzso zzso of zzso was confirmed by zzso V zzso of zzso zzso by the loss of zzso zzso potential, and by zzso directed against zzso from fragmented zzso This induction occurred in conjunction with the altered expression of genes related to cell growth, zzso zzso and zzso These results suggest that zzso may serve as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of zzso
