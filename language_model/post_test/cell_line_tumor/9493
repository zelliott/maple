zzso zzso zzso degradation of zzso zzso is thought to play an important role in invasion, zzso tumor growth, and zzso Several studies have demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso highly expressed in tumor cells, may be involved in the progression of zzso by regulating expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso In the present study we show that zzso is expressed in zzso derived from zzso zzso cancer cells and that zzso zzso may promote an zzso zzso in zzso cells in zzso zzso shed by human zzso zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso expressed different levels of zzso and zzso zzso activities of human zzso vein zzso cells zzso in a zzso fashion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso shed by zzso zzso cell line zzso I with low zzso expression had no significant effect on the development of zzso zzso in zzso The treatment of zzso cells with small interfering zzso against zzso suppressed the zzso potential of zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso zzso into the zzso I cell line enabled zzso zzso zzso to induce zzso and to promote zzso genes expression in zzso We therefore conclude that zzso shed by zzso cancer cells may induce zzso activities of zzso by a zzso zzso
