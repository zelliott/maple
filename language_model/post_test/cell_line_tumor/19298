zzso zzso of zzso cells prevents inflammatory and zzso responses to dying zzso We have previously shown that the blood zzso factor protein S stimulates zzso of zzso human B zzso cells by human zzso zzso In this study, we show that protein S must first undergo zzso zzso to stimulate zzso zzso of human protein S to zzso cells or to zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso of zzso zzso in protein zzso resulting in zzso zzso zzso and zzso that zzso bind to and activate the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso The zzso activity of protein S is eliminated when zzso zzso is zzso or when zzso is blocked with zzso zzso zzso S zzso is independent of zzso zzso The data suggest that zzso containing zzso serve as a scaffold for protein zzso S interactions and that the resulting zzso and zzso is required for the zzso activity of protein zzso In this way, zzso cells facilitate their own zzso by zzso The requirement for zzso modification of protein S can explain why this abundant blood protein does not zzso activate zzso in circulating zzso and tissue zzso
