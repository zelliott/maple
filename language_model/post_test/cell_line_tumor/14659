The search for new zzso agents is zzso reflecting the continuous emergence of zzso zzso Among the new agents are the zzso peptides zzso which have the potential to become a leading alternative to conventional zzso Studies for the mechanisms of action of the naturally occurring parent peptides can provide the structural and functional information needed for the development of effective new zzso zzso We therefore characterized zzso an zzso isolated from the skin of the South American paradoxical zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso organized to an zzso state in zzso solution, but that it zzso into zzso upon binding to zzso zzso even though it did not neutralize zzso in zzso zzso In addition, zzso assumed an zzso structure in the presence of biological zzso and formed pores in both bacterial and zzso zzso through which it entered the zzso and tightly bound to zzso Thus, the potent zzso activity of zzso likely results from both the formation of pores capable of collapsing the membrane potential and releasing zzso materials and its zzso of zzso synthesis through its binding to zzso
