zzso zzso zzso zzso is a rapidly zzso cutting edge technology for zzso zzso cancer diagnosis and staging, and patient zzso A zzso zzso zzso method, which can be applied to peptides to provide functional in zzso images, has been a long-standing challenge in PET zzso Over the past few years, we have sought a rapid and mild zzso method based on the zzso zzso of in zzso stable zzso zzso zzso Recent access to production levels of zzso led to a zzso at unprecedentedly high specific activities of zzso However, extending this method to labeling peptides as imaging agents has not been zzso 

In order to extend these results to a zzso of clinical interest in the context of zzso zzso we applied this new technology for labeling zzso measured its specific activity by standard curve analysis, and carried out a preliminary evaluation of its imaging zzso 

zzso was labeled in excellent zzso yields at exceptionally high specific activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images zzso by ex zzso zzso data with blocking controls show statistically significant albeit relatively low tumor zzso along with reasonably high zzso ratios zzso zzso zzso 

zzso exchange on a clinically useful zzso zzso leads to excellent zzso yields and exceptionally high specific activities while the zzso nature of the zzso prosthetic results in very rapid zzso Since rapid clearance of the radioactive zzso is generally desirable for zzso development, these results suggest new directions for varying zzso arm composition to slightly zzso clearance rather than enhancing zzso 

This work is the first to use production levels of zzso to directly label zzso at specific activities that are an order of magnitude higher than most reports and thereby increases the distribution window for zzso production and zzso
