zzso zzso binding protein 1) is an zzso protein involved in many zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso stability, and zzso zzso zzso is abundantly expressed in embryonic development, but its expression is silenced in most adult zzso zzso of the zzso gene has been reported in various human zzso In this study, we identified a detailed molecular mechanism of zzso zzso in breast cancer zzso We show that zzso a protein that functions in both cell zzso and transcription, specifically binds to the zzso promoter via a zzso zzso response element and activates its gene zzso zzso zzso is also closely correlated with nuclear zzso of zzso in human breast zzso We further demonstrate feedback regulation by finding that zzso physically associates with zzso zzso in zzso and increases its zzso These experiments suggest that in breast cancer cells, the expression of zzso and the expression of zzso are zzso zzso zzso mediates the zzso of the zzso zzso while zzso promotes the stability of zzso zzso
