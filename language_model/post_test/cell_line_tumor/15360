zzso zzso is zzso expressed in both zzso melanoma zzso and cultured melanoma zzso Our previous work showed that zzso could promote survival of zzso melanoma cells via its altered zzso In this study, we investigated the mechanisms responsible for these zzso zzso in melanoma zzso An zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso was constructed and zzso into human zzso melanoma cells zzso and zzso and the zzso molecular events and cellular changes were zzso As compared with the zzso group, cell proliferation was slowed down, and the growth zzso rates were zzso in zzso cells and zzso in zzso cells after zzso In addition, cell invasion capability was also zzso with a reduction of zzso in zzso cells and zzso in zzso zzso The percentage of zzso cells was found to zzso Meanwhile, in both cell lines, zzso protein zzso and rich in zzso zzso levels were zzso together with zzso of its upstream signaling zzso zzso Thus, the current results suggested that zzso expression of zzso zzso the zzso behaviors of human melanoma cells partially by decreasing the expression of zzso and zzso
