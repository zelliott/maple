Eleven zzso compounds containing a zzso zzso zzso were zzso and evaluated for their effects on cultured prostate cancer zzso cells, zzso cancer zzso cells, colon cancer zzso cells and lung cancer zzso zzso zzso effects of these compounds on the growth of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells were determined by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso blue exclusion zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso and zzso (see zzso and structures in zzso 1, 2) exhibited potent zzso effects on the growth of cultured zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso for these compounds was lower than zzso in all four cell zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso more active than zzso for zzso the growth of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells, zzso The zzso zzso compounds studied also zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso studies indicate that the effects of both zzso and zzso on zzso cells were associated with a decrease in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The present study indicates that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso may have useful effects on human cancer zzso
