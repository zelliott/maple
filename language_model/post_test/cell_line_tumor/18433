The cellular prion protein zzso is essential for the zzso and transmission of prion zzso Whereas the majority of zzso is bound to the cell membrane via a zzso zzso anchor, a zzso form of the protein has been zzso Here we show that zzso can be shed into the medium of human zzso zzso cells by both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso shedding of zzso was inhibited by a range of zzso zinc zzso zzso in a manner identical to the zzso shedding of the zzso precursor zzso indicating a zzso shedding zzso Like zzso precursor zzso this zinc zzso shedding of zzso could be zzso by zzso zzso zzso and by copper zzso The zzso zzso agents zzso and zzso promoted the shedding of zzso via a distinct mechanism that was not inhibited by zzso zzso zzso shedding of zzso is likely to occur via zzso zzso of the zzso anchor, since a zzso zzso zzso construct was not shed in response to zzso zzso zzso our data indicate that shedding of zzso can occur via both zzso zzso zzso of the protein and zzso zzso of the zzso anchor zzso
