The efficacy of zzso may be partly dependent on indirect effects, which can zzso zzso cells that are not directly zzso However, little is known of the influence of these effects in targeted zzso treatment of zzso We determined bystander responses generated by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically accumulates zzso zzso zzso that consisted of zzso of zzso cells, capable of the active zzso of zzso were zzso by treatment with 20 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Similarly, in nude mice, zzso of the growth of zzso zzso containing zzso zzso was observed after treatment with zzso To determine the effect of zzso zzso of zzso drugs, we compared the bystander effects resulting from the zzso concentration of zzso and zzso zzso linear energy transfer zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso LET zzso electron zzso zzso is incorporated in DNA whereas zzso accumulates in zzso zzso zzso exposed to media from zzso or zzso cells demonstrated a zzso relationship with respect to zzso cell zzso In contrast, cells receiving media from cultures treated with zzso or zzso exhibited zzso toxicity at low dose but elimination of zzso with increasing radiation dose zzso zzso survival zzso Therefore zzso emitting high LET radiation may elicit toxic or protective effects on zzso zzso cells at low and high dose zzso It is concluded that zzso bystander effects may depend on LET of the zzso particles but are independent of site of zzso concentration of zzso
