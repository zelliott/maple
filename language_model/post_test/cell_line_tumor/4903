zzso acid zzso acts via binding to specific G zzso receptors and has been implicated in the biology of breast zzso Here, we characterize zzso zzso expression patterns in common established breast cancer cell lines and their contribution to breast cancer cell zzso By measuring expression of the zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso with real-time quantitative zzso we show that the breast cancer cell lines tested can be clustered into three main groups: cells that predominantly express zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells that predominantly express zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a third group that shows comparable expression level of these two receptors zzso and zzso zzso expression was detected primarily in zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso to monitor dose response, we find that cells predominantly expressing zzso have a peak migration rate at 100 zzso zzso that drops off dramatically at 1 zzso zzso whereas cells predominantly expressing zzso show the peak migration rate at 1 zzso zzso which remains high at 10 zzso Using zzso cells, zzso small interfering zzso and zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso can mediate zzso cell migration and zzso of the small zzso zzso Using zzso small interfering zzso zzso expression of zzso and treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso cells, we further find that zzso and zzso cooperate to promote zzso zzso In zzso our results suggest that the expression of both zzso and zzso may contribute to zzso and may permit cells to respond zzso to a wider range of zzso zzso thus revealing a new aspect of zzso zzso
