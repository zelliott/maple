zzso simple and effective approaches to detect tumor markers will be critical for early diagnosis or zzso evaluation of prostate cancer zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso has been validated as an important tumor marker for prostate cancer progression including zzso and zzso As a type II membrane zzso zzso can be zzso zzso from the cell surface into zzso Early zzso can fuse with zzso bodies zzso to form and zzso zzso zzso into the zzso zzso zzso we tested whether some of the zzso zzso could be transferred to zzso as an zzso resource for zzso Using zzso zzso cells, the zzso zzso were collected and isolated from the cultured zzso The zzso structures of zzso were identified by electron zzso and zzso marker protein zzso and tumor zzso gene zzso were confirmed by western zzso zzso Our present data demonstrate that zzso can be enriched in zzso exhibiting a higher content of zzso and partial zzso in comparison to cellular zzso An zzso zzso zzso further confirmed that zzso zzso retains functional zzso zzso zzso our data may suggest a new role for zzso in prostate cancer zzso and provide opportunities for developing zzso approaches for diagnosis or prognosis of prostate zzso
