The zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso regulate zzso pathways and are activated by zzso zzso exchange factors zzso zzso which could be potential targets for zzso zzso We report that two zzso zzso zzso and zzso play synergistic roles in breast cancer by sustaining tumor growth, zzso and many of the steps involved in zzso zzso The involvement of zzso proteins in these processes did not correlate with zzso and zzso activity or cell migration, zzso the presence of additional biological zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso and zzso controlled a vast zzso program in breast cancer cells through mechanisms that were shared between the two zzso zzso or zzso Furthermore, the abundance of zzso transcripts was modulated by zzso and zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins that played zzso roles in primary zzso and zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso the transforming growth zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso It also contained gene signatures that predicted disease outcome in breast cancer zzso These results identify possible targets for treating breast cancer and lung zzso and provide a potential diagnostic tool for clinical zzso
