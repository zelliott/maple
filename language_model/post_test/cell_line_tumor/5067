To identify genetic events that characterize cancer zzso we conducted a comprehensive genetic evaluation of 161 primary breast zzso Similar to the zzso view of zzso gene amplification also shows zzso and zzso zzso in breast zzso The frequently amplified genes include the well-known zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas other known zzso that are zzso although less zzso include zzso zzso zzso and zzso More importantly, by honing in on minimally amplified regions containing three or fewer zzso we identified six new amplified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We found that both the zzso and zzso proteins showed higher expression in the zzso cell lines zzso and zzso than in their zzso zzso a normal immortalized zzso zzso cell zzso To study zzso roles of zzso we performed zzso experiments using a short hairpin zzso approach and found that depletion of zzso in zzso cells resulted in reduction of cell migration and invasion as well as suppression of zzso in mouse zzso zzso our zzso analysis showed the presence of zzso zzso in the zzso gene in a subset of tumors that also had DNA copy number increases in the zzso zzso suggesting an additive effect of zzso zzso zzso acid substitution and dosage increase from zzso Our gene amplification and zzso zzso analysis of breast primary tumors provides a coherent picture of genetic events, both corroborating and novel, offering insight into the genetic zzso of breast cancer zzso
