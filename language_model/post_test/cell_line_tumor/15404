The aim of this study was to develop and characterize a zzso drug delivery system zzso of zzso zzso oil zzso and transform the liquid zzso into solid zzso zzso studies of zzso and zzso phase zzso were used to identify the most efficient zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed to identify cell zzso zzso activity studies were also employed to evaluate the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso in liquid and zzso zzso rapidly formed fine zzso zzso with particle sizes zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso had a significant effect on cancer cells, and zzso activity studies showed remarkable zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso to have good zzso was successfully transformed into solid zzso by zzso onto zzso The studies of the release of the zzso zzso of liquid and zzso in zzso suggested that the release of zzso was enhanced by the zzso These studies revealed that the new zzso systems of liquid and zzso forms might be promising strategies for the oral delivery of the poorly zzso drug zzso
