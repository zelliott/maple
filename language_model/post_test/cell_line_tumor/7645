The human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an attractive therapeutic target for the treatment of zzso zzso Although zzso an zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso represents a significant therapeutic advancement in the treatment of zzso breast zzso responses to zzso have not been zzso zzso zzso of mechanisms of acquired therapeutic resistance to zzso therapies is of critical zzso 

Using a functional zzso zzso mapping strategy, along with targeted zzso zzso applied to a series of zzso pairs of zzso and resistant cell lines, we now report an unexpected mechanism of acquired resistance to zzso and similar zzso 

The signaling analysis revealed that whereas zzso was appropriately inhibited in zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso was incompletely zzso Using a targeted molecular zzso approach to interrogate the zzso molecular zzso of zzso zzso we found that zzso cells were no longer zzso addicted to zzso zzso as seen in the parental zzso cell lines, but instead were dependent on a zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso Two zzso zzso zzso could not overcome zzso zzso of zzso or reverse zzso zzso The ability to overcome zzso acquired therapeutic resistance to zzso was demonstrated through molecular zzso of zzso and treatment with the irreversible zzso zzso zzso which blocked zzso zzso of zzso and zzso resulting in zzso of resistant zzso In addition, whereas zzso reversed zzso zzso effects in parental zzso breast cancer cells, zzso was comparatively resistant to the effects of zzso in parental zzso Finally, we showed that zzso expression is an independent negative predictor of clinical outcome in zzso breast zzso providing potential clinical relevance to our zzso 

zzso analysis of acquired therapeutic resistance to zzso identified a new resistance mechanism based on incomplete and zzso zzso of zzso by zzso The selective pressure applied by incomplete zzso of the zzso drug target resulted in selection of zzso feedback that sustained zzso zzso in the face of constant exposure to the zzso zzso target zzso driven by a zzso zzso feedback loop may represent a broader mechanism of therapeutic resistance to zzso zzso and suggests adopting a different strategy for selecting more effective zzso to advance into the zzso
