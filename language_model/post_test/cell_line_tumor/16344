RON is a zzso related zzso zzso zzso zzso and its natural zzso is zzso stimulating protein zzso RON plays a very important role in the regulation of zzso Several studies have previously reported zzso of RON in a variety of zzso including lung and identified numerous RON alternate zzso forms that very likely contribute to tumor growth and zzso Here, we have analyzed the expression of total RON protein as well as its zzso form zzso in 175 archival lung tumor zzso zzso fixed zzso zzso samples that included zzso lung cancer zzso and small cell lung cancer zzso and their zzso zzso The frequency and intensity of RON protein expression was much higher in lung tumors of neuroendocrine origin such as zzso and in secondary tumors that zzso to zzso In addition, the majority of the expressed RON protein was zzso We also identified 62, and 30 zzso zzso of RON zzso zzso numbers are zzso and zzso using zzso isolated from pooled lung cancer cell lines and zzso A majority of the zzso cell lines expressed a 150 zzso band that corresponded to the RON zzso chain and 120 zzso band in the panel of zzso cell lines zzso RON was expressed on the cell surface in zzso cell zzso Finally, knock down of RON expression resulted in a significant loss in viability as well as zzso in lung cancer cells suggesting that RON is a potential therapeutic zzso
