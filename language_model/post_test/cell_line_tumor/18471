Exchange of the zzso zzso zzso at promoter target sites provides the only known system in which zzso factor cycling at a promoter is fast, occurring on a time scale of zzso The mechanism and function of this rapid exchange are zzso We provide evidence that zzso activity is required for rapid zzso exchange at a zzso We also show that zzso specifically zzso stabilize the binding of zzso to the promoter, complicating models in which the associated zzso zzso has been proposed to induce zzso zzso Our results are the first to connect zzso and zzso functions in setting the residence time of a zzso factor at a target zzso Moreover, our results reveal that longer zzso residence times are consistently associated with greater zzso zzso suggesting a new paradigm in which the rate of rapid exchange provides a means to tune zzso zzso
