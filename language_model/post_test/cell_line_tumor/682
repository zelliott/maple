The cell surface zzso zzso is zzso specific, and its expression is tightly zzso it is low or zzso in adult zzso but has been shown to be increased in many different zzso including zzso zzso zzso and colon zzso Studies have described zzso as a zzso zzso linked to poor zzso We have recently shown the feasibility of imaging zzso in zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso using the zzso zzso Here, we describe improved zzso imaging agents and test their efficacy in a mouse model with zzso zzso zzso The modified compounds maintained high affinity for zzso and zzso selectivity over related zzso (by zzso and showed significantly improved zzso binding in zzso zzso zzso binding versus zzso for zzso In zzso studies using either a melanoma cell line zzso zzso zzso or the zzso human pancreatic zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso revealed that the modified compounds showed significantly improved tumor zzso This, along with good clearance of zzso bound activity, particularly for the new zzso zzso resulted in improved PET zzso zzso and zzso zzso ratios of zzso and zzso respectively, were achieved at 4 zzso zzso zzso was superior to zzso zzso in imaging the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso and current zzso evaluation of zzso using zzso imaging has limited success, with most patients having zzso at time of zzso The fact that these tumors express zzso suggests that this probe has significant potential for the in zzso detection of this zzso thus having important implications for patient care and zzso
