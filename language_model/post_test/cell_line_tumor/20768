Human zzso alpha 1 zzso is an important zzso in the development and zzso of zzso competence in human, and many studies have reported the expression of this zzso In this study, we designed and zzso the zzso gene according to the zzso coli zzso usage preference and constructed a zzso zzso The latter was inserted into an zzso coli expression zzso zzso zzso and transformed into zzso coli zzso zzso After induction with zzso the zzso protein was successfully expressed in zzso coli then zzso by zzso to release the zzso zzso zzso and mass zzso confirmed that the zzso protein was zzso as zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso was analyzed by zzso proliferation and by zzso activity in two different tumor cell zzso This study provides a description of the preparation of a zzso zzso which may prove useful in future biomedical zzso
