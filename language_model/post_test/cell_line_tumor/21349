Early detection of prostate cancer is problematic due to the lack of a marker that has high diagnostic sensitivity and zzso The prostate specific zzso zzso test, in combination with digital zzso examination, is the gold standard for prostate cancer zzso However, this zzso suffers from low zzso zzso specific markers for clinically relevant prostate cancer are zzso Our objective was to zzso characterize the zzso media from three human prostate cancer cell lines of differing origin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso to identify zzso proteins that could serve as novel prostate cancer zzso Each cell line was cultured in zzso followed by a bottom-up analysis of the peptides by two-dimensional zzso and tandem mass zzso zzso zzso zzso of the proteins identified were classified as zzso and zzso zzso as zzso among which were known prostate cancer zzso such as zzso and zzso To select the most promising candidates for further investigation, tissue zzso biological function, disease association based on literature searches, and comparison of protein overlap with the zzso of seminal plasma and serum were zzso On the basis of this, four novel candidates, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 16, zzso 3 and zzso 2, were validated in the serum of patients with and without prostate zzso The proteins presented in this study represent a comprehensive sampling of the zzso and shed proteins expressed by prostate cancer cells, which may be useful as zzso zzso or zzso zzso markers for prostate zzso
