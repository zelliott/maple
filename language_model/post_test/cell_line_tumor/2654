Ground squirrels in hibernation zzso have been shown to have striking increases in global zzso on tissue zzso Here, we find evidence that global zzso is also involved in zzso tolerance in primary cortical zzso cultures (from rats and zzso and zzso human zzso zzso zzso cortical zzso zzso by zzso zzso deprivation zzso were less vulnerable to severe zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso maintained elevated zzso zzso levels (and, to a lesser extent those of zzso on western blots in contrast to zzso zzso Further, cortical zzso and zzso cells in which zzso zzso or zzso were zzso showed increased survival after severe zzso In contrast, cell cultures subjected to depletion of zzso zzso protein by zzso had reduced survival after exposure to this form of in zzso zzso and an attenuated protective response to zzso These findings suggest that maintenance of a globally elevated zzso (and maybe zzso zzso level as revealed by zzso zzso is a component of zzso zzso
