Human zzso zzso zzso zzso including the simple and the zzso zzso of the zzso where they can cause cancer and precursor zzso The molecular events leading from zzso zzso infections to zzso are poorly zzso There is evidence that progression is modulated by zzso mechanisms that control zzso gene zzso Here, we report the frequent zzso of zzso zzso in cell culture and in zzso DNA zzso is generally known to lead to zzso repression due to zzso zzso We investigated two cell lines derived from cervical zzso zzso zzso which contains one zzso zzso and different clones of zzso with 50 zzso zzso By restriction zzso we detected strong zzso of the zzso gene and absence of zzso of parts of the long control region zzso A zzso segment of the zzso zzso downstream of the zzso was deleted in both cell zzso zzso sequencing showed that in zzso cells and two zzso zzso 18 of the 19 zzso zzso in the zzso terminal part of the zzso gene were zzso whereas a third zzso clone had only eight zzso zzso groups, indicating changes of the zzso pattern after the establishment of the zzso cell zzso In the same four zzso none of the 12 zzso zzso that overlapped with the zzso and promoter was zzso In six zzso containing zzso and five zzso from zzso patients, most of the zzso zzso in the zzso gene were zzso There was complete or partial zzso respectively, of the zzso zzso in three of the zzso and lack of zzso in the remaining eight zzso The promoter sequences were zzso in three of the six zzso and four of the six zzso and zzso zzso Our data show that zzso cells efficiently target zzso zzso for DNA zzso which may affect late and early gene zzso
