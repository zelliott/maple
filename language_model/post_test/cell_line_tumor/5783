Multiple system zzso zzso is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by zzso zzso inclusions containing zzso zzso Since zzso plays an important role in cell zzso zzso i ) in zzso human zzso cells was analyzed by zzso zzso zzso of zzso increased the zzso level of zzso i ), and a higher zzso response to hydrogen zzso was further zzso The effect that zzso zzso caused zzso cells to be more vulnerable to hydrogen zzso was eliminated by zzso zzso zzso or transient zzso potential channels blocker zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso channel blocker zzso These findings suggest that the zzso of cellular zzso zzso caused by zzso under zzso stress may contribute to the zzso cell death in zzso
