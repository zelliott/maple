zzso cancer zzso to bone may be zzso by preferential proliferation of these cells in the zzso zzso We zzso that this preferential proliferation is zzso by zzso growth factors zzso and zzso To test our hypothesis, human prostate cancer cells, derived from both soft tissue zzso zzso zzso and bone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were treated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso IGF-1, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for 48 zzso and their growth responses were zzso The responses of soft zzso prostate cancer cell lines to bone zzso and zzso were zzso zzso cell growth was zzso by IGF-1 but was inhibited by zzso zzso cell growth was zzso with zzso zzso cancer cell lines derived from bone zzso also responded zzso to bone zzso and zzso zzso zzso the growth of zzso and zzso cell lines in a zzso zzso zzso and zzso both demonstrated variable effects on zzso prostate cancer cell zzso zzso inhibited proliferation of the zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that human prostate cancer cell lines derived from bone zzso may not respond zzso to zzso zzso and zzso
