Increased indoor air zzso of volatile organic compounds zzso have been shown to contribute to the risk of respiratory and allergic zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the inflammatory potential of single zzso and zzso using an in zzso zzso zzso zzso human lung zzso cells zzso were exposed to zzso (1 zzso via gas zzso After 20 h of exposure zzso and the release of the zzso molecules zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso Exposure of zzso cells to zzso zzso or zzso increased the zzso production within the indoor relevant concentration range zzso zzso higher zzso increased the zzso of zzso zzso of aromatic compounds caused comparable effects to the single compounds on zzso and zzso with a shift to lower concentration zzso Neither the zzso compounds zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso nor the mixture of these zzso showed any effects on zzso and zzso zzso zzso effects were not zzso These results show that aromatic, but no zzso compounds stimulate the release of zzso zzso from lung zzso zzso When aromatic compounds were mixed the sensitivity of lung cells to these compounds was zzso
