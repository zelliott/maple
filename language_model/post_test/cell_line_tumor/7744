Complex II zzso zzso zzso is a zzso respiratory chain zzso that is directly involved in the zzso zzso Complex II exerts a reverse reaction, zzso zzso zzso activity, in various species such as bacteria, zzso zzso and zzso but the existence of zzso activity in humans has not been previously zzso Here, we describe the detection of zzso activity in human cancer zzso The activity level was low, but zzso and it increased significantly when the cells were cultured under hypoxic and zzso zzso Treatment with zzso caused the zzso of zzso zzso zzso with a zzso increase in zzso activity, whereas zzso activity zzso On the other hand, treatment with protein zzso caused an increase in zzso activity and a decrease in zzso zzso These data suggest that modification of the zzso zzso regulates both the zzso and zzso activities of complex II and that the zzso of zzso might be important for maintaining zzso energy metabolism within the tumor zzso
