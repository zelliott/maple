A zzso chemical analysis which consists of zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in conjunction with zzso zzso was performed to identify the most biologically active compounds of the diesel exhaust particulate matters zzso on zzso zzso These zzso systems were suitable to estimate the zzso zzso zzso of pollutants present in low zzso in limited environmental samples, as is the case with zzso The results from zzso zzso showed that the aromatic and slightly polar fraction of zzso induced zzso damage and DNA breakage in a zzso zzso It was also revealed that zzso zzso may mainly contribute to the zzso effect of aromatic fraction via the zzso metabolism zzso In the aromatic zzso several zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso were detected by zzso and the complex mixture effect of this fraction was zzso in terms of its zzso equivalent concentration zzso which was zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso we confirmed that zzso zzso contained in aromatic fraction may be important zzso of the zzso of extracts of zzso by zzso the results obtained from a zzso cell zzso zzso
