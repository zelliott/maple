zzso related gene plays a critical role in bone loss induced by space zzso however the exact mechanism is zzso In this study, we aim to investigate the effect of zzso on the activity of alpha zzso collagen zzso gene promoter and the expression of zzso zzso zzso promoter was zzso by restriction zzso resulting in three DNA zzso The fragments were zzso with the enhanced green fluorescent protein report zzso and zzso into expression zzso zzso cells zzso by these zzso were screened by zzso and enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso positive colonies were isolated and cultured under zzso zzso zzso and zzso type I expression level were detected by zzso intensity analysis and zzso methods zzso The results showed that the expression of zzso and collagen type I was increased 24 zzso 48 h after the cells were cultured under zzso zzso illustrating that the activity of zzso promoter might be zzso In conclusion, zzso can zzso increase the expression of type I collagen by enhancing the activity of zzso promoter under short-term simulated zzso zzso
