zzso the molecular mechanisms of Alzheimer's disease zzso is a challenging zzso zzso due to the fact that the disease only occurs in the central nervous system of elderly zzso Thus, model systems simply do not accurately portray this cellular zzso While we cannot ask many zzso questions using the human brain as our test subject, cell culture techniques that have emerged at least provide us with the ability to pose fundamental zzso questions, which may ultimately lead to zzso outcomes for zzso In particular, the zzso zzso protein zzso that accumulates in zzso is found in normal zzso zzso these cells may allow us to address basic questions about zzso biology that would provide novel therapeutic strategies down the zzso Here, we describe several techniques to explore zzso cell biology using the zzso zzso Imaging system zzso zzso from zzso zzso We provide a detailed protocol on how to perform a zzso drug screening zzso called the zzso Western and follow-up these screens with standard Western analysis to confirm whether zzso are valid by more traditional zzso We provide some tips on where mistakes are most likely to occur, and we interpret our standard Western data, providing some zzso as to the composition of the zzso pattern that is typical for this enigmatic zzso
