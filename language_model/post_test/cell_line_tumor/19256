zzso melanoma zzso is the most common zzso tumor in zzso Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment, the survival rate of zzso has not increased in the last several zzso zzso 50% of patients will die as a consequence of zzso disease with the majority of zzso localized to the zzso Due to the lack of zzso in the eye, zzso dissemination is the zzso means by which zzso cells escape the primary zzso Our laboratory has recently demonstrated the presence of circulating zzso cells zzso in the blood using both animal models and clinical trails involving zzso zzso Current data suggests that all zzso patients will be positive for zzso after zzso Furthermore, some of the zzso changes that are necessary for zzso growth may occur while the cells are circulating in the zzso In this study, we evaluated the efficiency of a panel of zzso to zzso isolate zzso for the purpose of in zzso expansion and zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

In this study, five human zzso melanoma cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso with a panel of zzso against known melanoma cell surface zzso zzso with zzso zzso PAL zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso permitted the generation of a cell surface expression profile in these cell zzso The five human zzso cell lines and zzso zzso with zzso were subsequently spiked into human blood at zzso ranging from zzso zzso to 10 zzso zzso were zzso isolated at zzso as low as 10 zzso 

zzso isolation of all five human zzso cell lines tested at zzso down to 10 zzso human blood was achieved only when zzso were used in zzso zzso the zzso did not permit isolation of cells at zzso relevant zzso 

The zzso isolation method presented in this study can be used to isolate zzso at zzso relevant zzso and at sensitivities comparable to those seen in zzso chain reactions zzso In addition, our data suggests that our method is more efficient and reliable for the isolation of zzso in zzso than the methods currently zzso
