Success of zzso drug delivery is subject to development of optimal drug release strategies within defined space and time zzso zzso Recently, we reported a novel class of zzso zzso prepared from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso that efficiently released zzso zzso (a water soluble fluorescent zzso upon zzso zzso zzso To develop these zzso for in zzso applications, we have examined zzso of these zzso by visible light, and the effect of released zzso drugs on cellular zzso zzso zzso containing various ratios of zzso and zzso zzso were loaded with zzso zzso zzso or a chemotherapy drug, zzso zzso zzso zzso Our initial experiments showed that zzso laser treatment of zzso containing 10 or zzso zzso for zzso resulted in significant release of zzso Based on these results, we performed studies with zzso zzso First, zzso properties (including zzso size and zzso and zzso zzso efficiency of the zzso were zzso zzso the effect of zzso laser on zzso release, and cellular toxicity by released zzso were zzso Since zzso using the zzso mole ratio of zzso showed highest zzso of zzso these zzso were investigated zzso We report that zzso zzso retained about zzso of zzso zzso at zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso laser treatment resulted in zzso release from zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso containing zzso zzso and cells zzso and zzso resulted in at least 2-3 fold improved cell killing as compared to zzso zzso Taken together, the zzso zzso described here may provide a platform for future drug delivery zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating improved cell killing following zzso release of an zzso zzso agent from zzso zzso
