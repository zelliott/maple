zzso infection and zzso transformation trigger zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, a large proportion of the cells that must be recognized by the immune system are stressed zzso zzso respond to zzso stress by launching the unfolded protein response zzso The zzso regulates the two key processes that control major zzso complex class I zzso zzso zzso protein synthesis and zzso We therefore asked whether and how the zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso 

We evaluated the impact of the zzso on global zzso I expression and on presentation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso coding zzso egg zzso zzso protein zzso were stressed with zzso or exposed to zzso zzso zzso decreased surface expression of zzso I but did not affect zzso I zzso level nor the total amount of zzso zzso I zzso zzso zzso zzso presentation was due mainly to reduced supply of peptides zzso to an zzso of overall protein zzso zzso generation of zzso complexes was curtailed during zzso stress, illustrating how generation of zzso I zzso zzso is tightly coupled to ongoing protein zzso zzso the zzso decline of zzso zzso presentation was more severe when the protein source of peptides was localized in the zzso than in the zzso This difference was not due to changes in the translation rates of the precursor proteins but to increased stability of the zzso protein during zzso zzso 

Our results demonstrate that zzso stress zzso zzso zzso zzso and that it zzso regulates expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, this work illustrates how zzso stress, a typical feature of infected and zzso cells, can impinge on cues for zzso immune zzso
