zzso expression of zzso is associated with development and progression of various human zzso by regulating the translation of zzso and tumor zzso zzso In zzso cancer, these regulators complement the zzso zzso model of zzso and have the potential of becoming a novel class of tumor zzso and therapeutic zzso Using quantitative real-time zzso we measured the expression of zzso mature zzso in 40 zzso zzso and their paired normal zzso and identified 23 significantly zzso zzso We subsequently evaluated their association with clinical characteristics of the samples and presence of zzso in the molecular markers of zzso cancer zzso zzso levels of zzso were correlated with zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were associated with zzso in zzso zzso To investigate the downstream regulation of the zzso expressed zzso identified, we integrated putative zzso target predictions with the results of a zzso of seven public gene expression zzso of normal and tumor samples of zzso cancer zzso Many of the zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso mapped to targets involved in pathways related to zzso Here one promising candidate pair zzso and zzso was studied and functionally zzso We show that zzso can have a tumor zzso function in zzso cancer by directly zzso zzso zzso both at zzso and protein level and that zzso of zzso leads to zzso reduction of cell proliferation and zzso identifying the zzso zzso as one of the events that could enhance zzso cancer zzso
