To investigate the zzso effect of a specific small zzso interfering zzso zzso on cell proliferation and the expression of zzso in human gastric zzso cell line zzso 

To zzso zzso zzso a small interfering zzso targeting against zzso was zzso and zzso into zzso cells with zzso zzso The zzso of zzso expression at both zzso and protein levels were detected by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and Western zzso zzso Cell proliferation zzso rates were determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso zzso on cell cycle distribution and cell zzso was determined by flow zzso zzso 

zzso interference could efficiently suppress the zzso expression in zzso zzso At 48 h after zzso the expression zzso rate was zzso at zzso level detected by zzso and zzso at protein level by Western zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in significant zzso of tumor cell growth in zzso The cell proliferation zzso rates at 24, 48 and 72 h after zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso rate was zzso and the number of cells was increased in zzso phase from zzso to zzso and decreased in S and zzso phase at 48 h after zzso 

zzso of zzso results in significant zzso of tumor growth in zzso The zzso of zzso expression can induce zzso of zzso zzso The use of zzso zzso deserves further investigation as a novel approach to cancer zzso
