Evidence suggests that zzso through zzso zzso has a significant role in the development of gastrointestinal zzso We previously demonstrated the critical role of zzso differentiation zzso the essential zzso of zzso for induction of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso was suggested to play a key role in zzso cancer through the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso therefore, addressed the role of zzso in several parameters related to zzso namely cell proliferation and migration, using colon cancer cells zzso We found that zzso of zzso zzso a significantly greater proliferation and migration capacity to these zzso zzso proliferation and migration appeared independent of zzso activity but was reduced by zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as by pharmacological zzso of zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso zzso contributes to zzso aggressiveness via a zzso excessive zzso zzso Moreover, zzso expression levels were higher in tissue from patients with zzso cancer as compared with paired control zzso zzso Our data attest to a role of zzso activity in colon cancer zzso cell proliferation and migration, which may be important in the general correlation between innate immune response, chronic zzso and zzso
