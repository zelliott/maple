One of the crucial roles of tumor zzso zzso is to act as a barrier to drug zzso In this study, we analyzed the relationship between the formation of tumor zzso zzso and the efficiency of zzso zzso of zzso in human zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso zzso used in this study were nuclear zzso B zzso decoy, which might be a therapeutic tool for zzso zzso zzso formation was examined by particle exclusion zzso Cellular zzso of zzso zzso zzso decoy was evaluated by fluorescent zzso and flow zzso zzso of zzso decoy on cell viability and cell cycle arrest in zzso cells were determined by zzso zzso and flow zzso zzso zzso cells exhibited abundant zzso zzso with time compared with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso decoy decreased in zzso cells with time but not in zzso cells in both zzso and three-dimensional culture using zzso However, after zzso removal of zzso zzso the zzso markedly recovered in zzso zzso zzso decoy inhibited cell proliferation and induced zzso cell cycle arrest in zzso zzso These results suggest that abundant zzso zzso might disturb the zzso of zzso decoy, and modification of zzso zzso composition would increase the efficacy of zzso zzso treatment for zzso
