Based on experiments with cultured zzso the zzso regulators zzso and zzso are hypothesized to function as tumor zzso To investigate their in zzso role in zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso was crossed onto zzso and zzso zzso Due to zzso zzso zzso transgenic zzso or zzso fetal liver cells were used to zzso lethally zzso recipient zzso Surprisingly, no differences were seen in rate, zzso or severity of zzso with loss of zzso or zzso and zzso was not a critical zzso of zzso drug sensitivity of zzso zzso Moreover, loss of zzso did not promote zzso transformation of mouse zzso zzso Thus, zzso and zzso do not suppress zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
