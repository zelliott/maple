Although neurological manifestations associated with dengue infections have been reported in endemic countries, the viral or host characteristics determining the infection or zzso of nervous function have not been zzso In order to investigate zzso conditions related to central nervous system dengue virus zzso infection, we established a mouse model of zzso A zzso isolate was first adapted to zzso cells, later zzso in zzso mice brain, and finally, this zzso viral zzso was zzso zzso in zzso mice at different zzso days zzso zzso fatal encephalitis in 2 and 7 zzso mice but infected at 14 and 21 zzso mice zzso The younger mice presented encephalitis at the sixth day zzso with limb paralysis and zzso instability zzso with efficient viral replication in zzso In this mice model, we found activated zzso cells positive to viral zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells were also infected by the zzso virus in zzso mice, which showed generalized and local plasma leakage with zzso barrier zzso severe zzso These results suggest that there was a viral fitness change which led to zzso only in immune or neurological immature zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso cells may be related to zzso function or architecture found in susceptible zzso This experimental zzso model could help to have a better understanding of neurological manifestations occurring during severe cases of dengue zzso
