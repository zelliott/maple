Three zzso copper complexes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso The X-ray single zzso results indicated that the zzso zzso showed slightly distorted square pyramid coordination zzso and the zzso deviated from ideal zzso in all three zzso Based on the DNA binding studies, it was demonstrated that these three complexes exhibited weak DNA binding strengths, which were most likely groove binding zzso zzso zzso and zzso induced efficient DNA zzso in the dark without the addition of external zzso zzso or zzso In contrast, in the presence of reducing or zzso agents, the zzso activities increased more than zzso zzso investigations revealed the participation of zzso oxygen species, which can be trapped by zzso radical zzso and zzso zzso In the same experimental conditions, the free zzso and zzso did not display any DNA zzso zzso This result indicates that the complexes, rather than their zzso play a significant role in the zzso reaction process and that DNA zzso may be initiated in an zzso zzso The proposed mechanism was attributed to the in zzso zzso of molecular oxygen by the zzso of the copper zzso In the zzso zzso studies, the three zzso complexes exhibited an zzso activity against the zzso zzso and zzso tumor cell zzso The zzso cells treated with zzso complexes demonstrated marked changes in their nuclear zzso which were detected by zzso zzso nuclear zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Nuclear zzso zzso also was observed from alkaline zzso gel zzso zzso zzso
