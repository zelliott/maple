Since their invention in the late 1960s, glass zzso zzso zzso have been used extensively in dentistry but recently they have also been zzso in ear nose and throat zzso zzso Unfortunately, zzso a component of conventional zzso glasses, has been linked to poor bone zzso and zzso 

The aim of the research was to modify a commercial zzso glass composition by substituting zzso with zzso 

zzso with the following zzso compositions were zzso zzso zzso zzso Al or Fe, X zzso zzso The glasses were zzso using X-ray zzso zzso and X-ray powder zzso zzso zzso were prepared using a standard ratio of; 1 g of glass zzso zzso g of dried zzso zzso zzso g of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso formation was assessed using a zzso needle and in zzso zzso was investigated for novel cement zzso 

zzso revealed that the zzso glasses had zzso contamination from the zzso and also had undergone substantial zzso zzso zzso gave zzso that corresponded to zzso zzso zzso # zzso in all zzso zzso zzso zzso # zzso was identified in zzso containing zzso It was possible to zzso zzso from all of the zzso zzso zzso Good in zzso zzso was observed for the zzso zzso 

zzso glasses may be prepared by entirely replacing zzso with zzso zzso setting times appeared to be related to zzso zzso zzso zzso showed good in zzso zzso
