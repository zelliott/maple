zzso and zzso are important regulators of the female zzso zzso Recently, a novel zzso zzso named zzso has been identified and shown to be expressed in several human zzso However, only limited data on the expression of this novel zzso zzso in normal and pathological human zzso as well as and human zzso zzso cell lines zzso 

zzso specimens of normal, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were obtained at the course of an zzso zzso zzso and pathological zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso cells zzso and zzso were analyzed by using zzso and zzso 

zzso of the zzso zzso zzso could be demonstrated at the protein level by means of zzso evaluation and at the zzso level by zzso zzso zzso The zzso score for zzso did not show any significant differences between normal, zzso and zzso tissue in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso could further be demonstrated for the human zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso 

We demonstrated that zzso is expressed in normal and pathological human zzso zzso Although the precise role of this novel zzso zzso for human zzso development is quite zzso similarities with the zzso zzso and zzso suggest an involvement in zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso and tissue zzso under normal as well as zzso zzso Additionally, the human zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso zzso this zzso and therefore can be used as a cell culture model for further functional analysis of this zzso in human zzso zzso
