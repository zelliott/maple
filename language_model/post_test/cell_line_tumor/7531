Based on extensive zzso studies, the zzso zzso zzso zzso is currently applied to patients with zzso zzso in a phase zzso clinical trial zzso zzso zzso rates of about zzso in pediatric high-risk zzso zzso patients also indicate the need of new therapeutic zzso In order to prepare a future application of zzso zzso to zzso the present study zzso evaluates the zzso efficacy of zzso on zzso cells in zzso and characterizes cellular target genes involved in this zzso Six zzso cell lines were analyzed by whole zzso zzso zzso after treatment and the results were matched to known molecular and zzso risk zzso In contrast to zzso infant zzso and zzso in five out of six zzso cell lines zzso zzso infection and efficient viral replication could be zzso The zzso effects induced by zzso were observed at zzso below zzso zzso zzso zzso per cell indicating high zzso Gene expression patterns in the responsive zzso cell lines allowed the identification of candidate target genes zzso the zzso effects of zzso zzso induced zzso of key regulators of early zzso shown to zzso poor prognosis in zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso In zzso cell lines with zzso amplification of zzso expression of zzso was the single gene most significantly zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso may be a promising treatment approach for zzso since it targets genes of functional relevance and zzso cell death at very low zzso of input zzso
