zzso zzso a constituent of zzso vegetables, is highly effective in zzso protection against chemically induced zzso in animal zzso Here, we report that zzso inhibited proliferation of cultured zzso human prostate cancer cells by inducing zzso that was characterized by appearance of cells with zzso DNA content, formation of zzso zzso associated DNA fragments and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso -9 and zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso were blocked upon zzso of cells with pan zzso inhibitor zzso and specific zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting involvement of both zzso and zzso pathways in zzso cell zzso zzso administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso significantly inhibited growth of zzso zzso in nude zzso For instance, 10 days after starting therapy, the average tumor volumes in control and zzso mice were 170 zzso 13 and 80 zzso 14 zzso respectively, reflecting a zzso reduction in tumor volume due to zzso zzso To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first published report to document in zzso zzso activity of zzso in a tumor zzso zzso
