zzso are the most frequent primary tumors of the central nervous system, and their clinical prognosis remains very zzso Because of the characteristics of zzso gene therapy appears as a potentially relevant strategy for their zzso However, the inability of viral zzso to transfer the therapeutic genes to a significantly high number of tumor cells, due to their limited diffusion and distribution, remains a critical obstacle for their application treating zzso We have demonstrated that the zzso of growth arrest zzso zzso zzso cell arrest and zzso and eliminates zzso cells in zzso and when implanted in zzso To improve the therapeutic range of zzso we generated zzso zzso coding for a soluble form of zzso Here, we show that cells infected with this virus produce the zzso zzso that acting both in zzso and zzso manners, causes death of infected and neighbor cells, thus zzso enhancing the effect of zzso Furthermore, the administration of this zzso or cells expressing it, inhibit the growth of tumors zzso in zzso We present a gene therapy strategy that increases the effect of the therapeutic zzso by eliminating not just the infected cells that express zzso but neighbor zzso zzso
