We reported previously that derivatives of zzso zzso reverse zzso resistance zzso in zzso zzso positive zzso zzso Based on the results of a recent study using 25 zzso zzso with zzso zzso of various zzso we formulated the following design criteria for a zzso zzso to effectively reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso a massive zzso at the zzso position is crucial for zzso reversal zzso zzso zzso of the zzso at the zzso and zzso positions (from zzso to zzso increases the efficacy of a zzso to reverse zzso zzso zzso of the zzso at the zzso position (from H to zzso decreases the efficacy of a zzso to reverse zzso Based on these criteria, we zzso and tested for potency to reverse zzso a new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with prolonged zzso at the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso was obtained by zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso structural analyses proved the identity of the zzso zzso study showed that zzso is only slightly more toxic to zzso cells than zzso We found that both zzso and zzso were able to reverse zzso resistance of zzso cells, yet zzso was significantly more efficient in the reversal than zzso
