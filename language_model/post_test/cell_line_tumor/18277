In order to study the role of zzso protein in zzso zzso repair and zzso we zzso zzso interference strategy in zzso and in zzso with human tumor zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso for 48 h were zzso and several critical end points were zzso The radiation cell survival level was significantly reduced in zzso cells with zzso zzso when compared with zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA double strand break repair as measured by constant field zzso showed a clear zzso in cells with zzso zzso while little zzso was observed in cells with negative control zzso Our zzso experiments revealed a significant delay in zzso zzso formation in cells with zzso zzso when compared with the control zzso However, none of the zzso end joining proteins nor the zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso was affected in cells zzso with zzso zzso In addition, the combined treatment with radiation and zzso zzso in zzso model with zzso cells showed an efficient zzso of in zzso tumor zzso Our results demonstrate zzso of zzso leads to zzso mainly through the zzso of zzso zzso repair type zzso break zzso a possibility of using zzso zzso as an effective zzso in tumor zzso may zzso
