zzso of zzso in zzso strongly zzso to zzso outcome, but little is known of how the high zzso expression translates into an aggressive tumor zzso More aggressive zzso are generally immature and zzso of zzso zzso in cultured zzso cells and other zzso cell types has been reported to inhibit induced zzso suggesting a link between high zzso expression and an immature zzso However, we show here that zzso is expressed in human zzso of sympathetic chain zzso at fetal week zzso a zzso stage at which these zzso express a number of sympathetic zzso differentiation marker zzso zzso of 28 zzso tumor specimens and 27 cell lines for the expression of zzso and a panel of zzso differentiation marker genes did not reveal any correlation between zzso and marker gene expression zzso Finally, we tested five separate differentiation protocols and show that zzso zzso zzso cells with a zzso zzso derived from the zzso human zzso cell line zzso retain their capacity to differentiate despite zzso zzso zzso Our results show that high zzso expression and sympathetic differentiation are zzso and indirectly our findings lend support to previously published zzso zzso tumor data, which suggest that in single zzso copy zzso there is no direct correlation between a high cellular zzso protein content and aggressive tumor cell zzso
