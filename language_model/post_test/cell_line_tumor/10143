The zzso zzso zzso is a major zzso of zzso zzso and plays an emerging role in tumor zzso This study stresses the important role of zzso in tumor zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso on samples collected by laser zzso and zzso zzso with different zzso zzso zzso indicate that zzso is abundant in zzso cervical and zzso cancer zzso zzso growth factor I zzso and zzso growth factor zzso stimulate zzso recruitment from a presumably inactive zzso pool of zzso zzso and zzso to plasma membrane along zzso zzso that is significantly inhibited by zzso and zzso Throughout the trafficking process, zzso is incorporated into zzso zzso that function as a platform for the association between zzso and zzso zzso an zzso motor zzso zzso and zzso a membrane zzso zzso zzso at zzso of migratory cancer zzso zzso with zzso activity by either an inhibitor or a zzso zzso zzso profoundly suppressed the zzso membrane trafficking of zzso and the structural interaction between zzso and zzso near the cell zzso zzso cancer cell zzso was significantly attenuated by small interfering zzso targeting zzso and the residual zzso was much less sensitive to zzso or zzso zzso In the zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso with zzso or zzso indicating a likely in zzso stimulation of zzso function by growth zzso Thus, blockade of zzso trafficking and surface expression may provide a potential target for the prevention of zzso or zzso cancer zzso
