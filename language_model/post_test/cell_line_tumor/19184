The zzso inhibitor zzso zzso is known to trigger zzso zzso zzso stress via the zzso of obsolete and damaged zzso The selective zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso causes zzso stress through a different mechanism zzso by causing leakage of calcium from the zzso into the zzso Each of these two mechanisms has been implicated in the zzso effects of the respective zzso We therefore investigated whether the combination of these two drugs would lead to further increased zzso stress and would enhance their zzso zzso With the use of human zzso cell lines, we show that this is indeed the zzso When combined, zzso and zzso triggered elevated expression of the zzso stress markers zzso and zzso caused zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and greatly increased zzso cell zzso Small interfering zzso zzso of the protective zzso zzso zzso further zzso the tumor cells to killing by the drug zzso The contribution of zzso was independent of the zzso of zzso because a zzso analogue of this drug, zzso zzso faithfully and more zzso zzso these combination effects in zzso and in zzso Taken together, our results show that combining zzso with zzso or zzso very zzso triggers the zzso stress response and results in greatly increased zzso zzso We propose that this novel drug combination should receive further evaluation as a potentially effective zzso zzso
