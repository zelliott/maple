zzso zzso zzso a novel zzso agent zzso from the natural product zzso zzso has a unique mechanism of action involving zzso zzso formation, zzso arrest and induction of zzso 

This study zzso zzso pancreatic zzso to demonstrate zzso zzso activity using either a daily or intermittent dosing zzso Additionally, zzso and zzso were tested in zzso and in zzso to assess the zzso activity of the zzso 

Both dosing regimens of zzso demonstrated zzso activity against the zzso zzso Similar activity of zzso on the intermittent schedule was observed at lower total doses compared to the daily dosing zzso Furthermore, enhanced zzso activity was observed when zzso and zzso were combined compared to single agent zzso 

These results support further clinical characterization of intermittent zzso dosing schedules and suggest that zzso combined with zzso may have activity in patients with pancreatic zzso
