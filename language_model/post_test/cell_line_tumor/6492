We have recently reported that zzso of expression of major zzso complex zzso class I zzso in zzso and highly zzso zzso melanoma cells zzso their zzso capacities by zzso of zzso and functions of cell membrane receptors for growth factors zzso zzso et zzso J zzso zzso Our present study provides evidence that zzso of an zzso zzso class zzso gene in these cells also zzso the expression of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was also followed by a significant changed in the zzso activity of the zzso zzso We suggest that, in addition to providing a framework for proper presentation of zzso zzso zzso class I zzso may regulate the immune response by modulating the expression and function of other zzso whose products are essential for proper zzso processing and zzso
