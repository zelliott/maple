Cancer stem cells have recently been isolated from several different solid zzso In breast cancer, the zzso population is considered to comprise zzso zzso The identification of cancer stem cells has provided new targets for the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso viruses zzso are an effective strategy for killing breast cancer cells and treating breast tumors in zzso zzso Here, we examined the efficacy of the zzso zzso in killing breast cancer stem zzso Human breast cancer cell line zzso and human primary breast cancer cells were cultured in suspension under conditions conducive to the growth of stem zzso They generated zzso which had cancer stem cell zzso The proportion of zzso cells in these zzso exceeded zzso as determined by flow zzso The zzso were found to be highly zzso when implanted zzso in nude zzso zzso zzso contains the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of infected cells in zzso and in zzso showed the replication and spread of the zzso zzso was found to be highly zzso to the zzso population in zzso even when injected at low zzso of infection, and zzso treatment in zzso significantly inhibited tumor growth compared with mock zzso This study demonstrates that zzso is effective against breast cancer stem cells and could be a beneficial strategy for treating breast cancer zzso
