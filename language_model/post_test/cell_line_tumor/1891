The aim of this study was to establish a zzso zzso cell line zzso expressing zzso and green fluorescent protein for the generation of a zzso model of human zzso breast cancer zzso in nude zzso zzso zzso carrying zzso zzso zzso and zzso fusion genes were used to zzso the zzso human zzso cells in zzso After 8 weeks of zzso selection, zzso and zzso expression was determined using a zzso microscope and a zzso zzso zzso imaging system, zzso The zzso zzso invasion and wound healing zzso were performed to confirm whether cellular zzso invasion and migration were altered by zzso zzso zzso were zzso implanted into female zzso nude mice to test the sensitivity and stability of reporter gene zzso Growth of the tumors was monitored with the in zzso imaging system once a week until they were large enough for zzso The tumor zzso were zzso for zzso and cancer cells were harvested for zzso The zzso zzso cells could zzso express zzso and zzso and the zzso activity reached zzso zzso Meanwhile, no significant difference in biological activities was observed between the zzso zzso cells and parental zzso An zzso implanted tumor model of human zzso was successfully established in zzso nude zzso zzso may be ideal carriers for zzso genes due to their highly efficient zzso and stable zzso zzso The modified zzso cell line zzso expressing zzso could be zzso allowing for immediate and sensitive detection of zzso sites in nude zzso As the zzso and zzso combination are superior to single reporter genes in their ability to mark cells in zzso and in zzso these cells may provide a zzso convenient and sensitive platform for research on the mechanisms of zzso and the development of new zzso drugs for human zzso
