Although zzso zzso have shown considerable zzso zzso recent studies suggest zzso zzso induce zzso zzso There is a need to better define such effects to permit rational zzso of these zzso 

We have studied the effects of a range of zzso and synthetic zzso zzso on zzso growth arrest zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso in multiple prostate zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso and in a series of cell lines zzso zzso transitional cell zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and to a lesser extent zzso exhibited zzso effects on cell number; the selective zzso zzso zzso did not reverse these zzso zzso and zzso had no effect on zzso In addition, zzso induced zzso growth arrest whilst zzso induced zzso 

zzso and zzso inhibit growth of prostate and zzso zzso cell lines through different mechanisms and the effects of both agents are zzso
