The objective was to establish a pattern of tumor growth of the zzso model of zzso zzso in zzso rats via magnetic resonance imaging zzso for the subsequent zzso of tumor volume reduction due to magnetic zzso zzso 

Young male zzso rats weighing between 250 and 300 g were used for the zzso zzso After the rats were zzso (55 zzso zzso zzso and 11 zzso zzso zzso lineage zzso cells suspended in culture medium zzso cells in 10 zzso were zzso injected into the right frontal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the rats using a Hamilton zzso For the control group, the rats were injected with culture medium without zzso zzso scans were performed at 14, 21, and 28 d after the injection using a zzso T zzso scanner zzso zzso zzso The animals were zzso with 55 zzso zzso and 11 zzso zzso before being zzso zzso zzso were acquired using a standard spin echo sequence with the following zzso zzso time zzso zzso zzso zzso field of view zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso slice thickness zzso zzso zzso and slice separation zzso 0 zzso 

The zzso analysis enabled a clear zzso of the tumor mass, and it was possible to establish the tumor volume parameters on the various days that were zzso The volume at 14 d after induction was zzso zzso zzso zzso On days 21 and 28, the tumor volumes were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These results demonstrated that it is possible to evaluate the zzso model tumor volume in rats, which will allow for the future zzso and zzso of magnetic zzso zzso
