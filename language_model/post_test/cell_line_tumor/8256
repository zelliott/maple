zzso a new member of the ING zzso of zzso family of zzso zzso zzso has been found to be deleted or zzso in zzso breast zzso and head and neck zzso cell zzso The goal of the present study was to investigate whether the expression and alternative zzso of zzso transcripts are involved in the initiation and progression of stomach zzso zzso zzso and protein expression was examined in gastric zzso zzso and human gastric zzso cell lines by zzso real-time zzso tissue zzso zzso and western zzso zzso zzso in zzso transcripts were determined through sequence analysis of zzso zzso Our data showed that zzso zzso and protein were dramatically reduced in stomach zzso cell lines and zzso and significantly less in female than in male zzso We also found that reduced zzso zzso expression correlated with the stage of the zzso Interestingly, by sequence analysis, we discovered five novel zzso spliced zzso forms of zzso and zzso These zzso cause a zzso zzso and, eventually, deletion of the zzso or zzso domain contributing to the zzso of zzso and/or zzso complexes and, zzso altered gene expression in gastric zzso These results suggest that attenuated and zzso zzso expression may be involved in the initiation and progression of stomach zzso
