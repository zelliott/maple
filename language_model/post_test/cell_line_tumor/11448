The causes for zzso progression of zzso tumors and the reasons recurrence rates differ in women with different breast cancer zzso are zzso Here, we report novel mechanisms of tumor plasticity that are mandated by zzso factors and show that recurrence rates are not strictly due to zzso zzso Specifically, outgrowth of the same population of zzso tumors is accelerated in mice with zzso breast cancer zzso relative to those with zzso breast zzso zzso signals provided by overt zzso cause the formation of a zzso zzso enriched for zzso and zzso growth zzso zzso at distant zzso tumor zzso zzso of zzso and zzso enhances the expression of zzso factors associated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso therapy with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso prevents zzso zzso These results suggest that plasticity and recurrence rates can be dictated by host systemic factors and offer novel therapeutic potential for patients with zzso
