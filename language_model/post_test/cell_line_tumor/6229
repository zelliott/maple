A zzso zzso is zzso in many types of cancer cells, including breast cancer, and its zzso in tumor zzso has been studied on a very limited zzso zzso zzso is a zzso process with the last step in the process being formation of zzso tumor in zzso distant from the primary tumor zzso This step is the least zzso Here, we report that stable expression of zzso in zzso breast tumor cells reduces significantly the aggressiveness of tumor cell dissemination as a result of preventing zzso transition zzso of tumor cells in zzso Further, zzso directly suppresses the expression of the zzso factor zzso which is an important regulator of zzso However, when tumor cells are injected directly into the zzso zzso remarkably promotes zzso tumor formation in the zzso Analysis of gene expression profiling identified a group of genes that are associated with promoting zzso tumor formation in the zzso zzso most of these genes are zzso in zzso zzso Our findings provide new insight into how zzso zzso the development of tumor zzso This study suggests that the location of tumor cells zzso zzso is a critical zzso in zzso fat pads zzso prevents tumor zzso whereas in the lung zzso apparently maintains the zzso zzso of tumor cells that is critical for zzso tumor zzso
