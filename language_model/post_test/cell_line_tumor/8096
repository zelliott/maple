We report an extensive zzso relationship zzso of 78 compounds active against two pancreatic cancer cell zzso Our comprehensive evaluation of these compounds zzso zzso that allow us to evaluate which features of potent compounds play a key role in their zzso This is the first report of 19 new second-generation structures, where these new compounds were designed from the first generation of 59 zzso These 78 structures were tested for their zzso and this is the first report of their activity against two pancreatic cancer cell zzso Our results show that out of 78 compounds, three compounds are worth pursuing as zzso as they show potency of zzso in both cancer cell zzso These three compounds all have a common structural zzso two consecutive zzso acids and an zzso zzso Further, of these three compounds, two are second-generation structures, indicating that we can incorporate and zzso data from the first generation to design potency into the second zzso Finally, one analog is in the mid zzso range, and has the lowest zzso of any reported San A zzso These zzso share no structural zzso to current pancreatic cancer drugs, and are zzso at levels on par with existing drugs treating other zzso Thus, we have established zzso A as an excellent lead for killing multiple pancreatic cancer cell zzso
