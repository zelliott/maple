zzso growth factor zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso enhances and zzso zzso pancreatic cancer cell zzso Nothing is presently known about the expression and regulation of human zzso zzso The aim of this study was to identify regulators modulating the specific expression of human zzso and zzso 

zzso cells, cells zzso zzso zzso and cells harboring a zzso zzso D1 zzso expression zzso system were used as model zzso 

zzso and zzso were zzso in human pancreatic cancer cells, with zzso being the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression decreased at higher cell density, whereas zzso expression remained zzso zzso growth factor I and zzso growth factor induced expression of zzso without altering zzso In contrast, zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso induced zzso and reduced the expression of zzso zzso of one zzso did not alter the expression of the corresponding zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso known to be induced by zzso growth factor I, zzso growth factor, and zzso resulted in an zzso of zzso zzso whereas zzso expression was zzso 

This study demonstrated for the first time that zzso and zzso are zzso and that the zzso zzso zzso regulated by growth factors and zzso zzso
