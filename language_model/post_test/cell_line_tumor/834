To determine the modulating effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso human lung zzso and to assess the potential of zzso as a therapeutic zzso 

zzso cells of a zzso lung cancer cell lines zzso were zzso with a zzso expressing zzso zzso The zzso cell line, zzso was shown to express high levels of zzso zzso cells after being exposed to zzso zzso zzso zzso were examined for their surface zzso cell cycle, zzso and cell growth by flow zzso and zzso zzso 

The expression of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells was significantly increased, whereas that of zzso was zzso Cell proliferation was significantly inhibited by zzso with an zzso rate of zzso on day 5, but no change in cell zzso All of the changes disappeared after 48 h incubation with zzso More significant changes were observed in zzso cell lines which expressed high levels of zzso but the zzso zzso cells were unresponsive to zzso None of the 3 cell lines showed significant changes in zzso upon zzso zzso 

zzso if zzso in tumor cells, could be considered as a potential therapeutic zzso
