Most lung cancer patients have some resistance to and suffer from side effects of conventional zzso Thus, identification of a novel zzso drug with better target selectivity for lung cancer treatment is urgently zzso 

In order to investigate whether zzso a zzso of zzso can be a potential drug for lung cancer treatment, we examined its zzso mechanisms by flow zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso lung cancer cell lines, which are resistant to the conventional drug, zzso In addition, we identified the affected proteins by zzso and confirmed the selected proteins by Western zzso zzso We examined the interaction between zzso and potential target protein by molecular zzso 

Our results indicated that zzso had zzso (1 approximately 4 zzso zzso in all lung cancer cell lines tested 48 hours zzso zzso caused cell cycle zzso phase arrest and showed zzso early zzso via zzso zzso zzso Several proteins such as heat shock protein 27, 70, and 90, zzso zzso zzso A3, zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified by zzso and confirmed by Western zzso In addition, molecular modeling showed that zzso competes with zzso to bind to zzso protein zzso 

We identified for the first time that zzso zzso zzso protein zzso activity and causes zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso degradation, which is often zzso in lung zzso Our molecular and zzso results show the potential of zzso as an zzso drug for lung zzso
