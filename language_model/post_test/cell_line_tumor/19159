zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are documented for their role in zzso and/or repression of gene zzso Currently, it is believed that zzso zzso act at the zzso level to alter zzso dynamics through the zzso of zzso thereby resulting in zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso However, zzso repression of gene expression is not explained by this zzso Indeed, changes in the zzso status of discreet zzso zzso of zzso associated with genes zzso by zzso zzso have not been zzso zzso we carried out a systematic investigation of the changes in zzso zzso status at the promoter regions of two genes zzso affected by zzso to gain a better understanding of how changes in zzso zzso zzso to changes in zzso zzso
