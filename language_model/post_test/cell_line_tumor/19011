To suppress zzso and zzso gene expressions in human skin zzso zzso by means of zzso interference zzso 

zzso was performed in two directions to isolate the zzso expressed genes between human a zzso cell line zzso and a normal zzso cell line zzso zzso The zzso obtained from the final zzso zzso were directly inserted into zzso cloning zzso to establish a zzso zzso library of specifically or highly expressed genes in zzso zzso Northern dot zzso was performed to screen the truly zzso expressed zzso and 200 positive genes were randomly selected for zzso 

The zzso zzso libraries contained more than 1200 zzso and zzso positive clones were obtained using reverse Northern zzso zzso analysis of these clones identified 144 zzso expressed zzso including 67 zzso and 77 zzso zzso in which 14 novel zzso and 21 functionally unknown genes were zzso zzso analysis indicated the involvement of the zzso genes in cell growth, cell zzso and zzso 

Reliable zzso zzso libraries of human zzso have been constructed successfully with zzso The identification of the gene expression profile in zzso may help clarify the mechanism of zzso and development of zzso and also sheds light on new targets for zzso diagnosis and therapy of this zzso
