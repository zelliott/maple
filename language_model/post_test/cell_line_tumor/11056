zzso line zzso in zzso and zzso account for a large proportion of inherited breast and zzso zzso Both genes are involved in DNA repair by zzso zzso and are thought to play a vital role in maintaining zzso zzso A major drawback for long-term functional studies of zzso in general and zzso in particular has been a lack of representative human breast zzso cell zzso In the present study, we have established three cell lines from two patients harboring the zzso germ line founder zzso in the zzso zzso zzso cultures were established from cellular outgrowth of zzso tissue and subsequently zzso with a zzso construct containing the zzso E6 and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines were established from one patient referred to as zzso and zzso zzso In addition, one cell line was derived from zzso normal tissue from another patient referred to as zzso All three cell lines showed characteristics of breast zzso cells as evidenced by expression of breast zzso specific zzso zzso analysis showed marked zzso instability with zzso and frequent zzso zzso In conclusion, we have established three breast zzso cell lines from two patients carrying the zzso zzso zzso founder zzso These cell lines form the basis for further studies on zzso and zzso progression of breast cancer on a defined genetic zzso
