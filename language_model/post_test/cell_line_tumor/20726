The repair of zzso sites that arise in DNA from zzso zzso of the zzso bases from the zzso backbone and the action of DNA zzso on zzso zzso and zzso bases are critical to cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is responsible for the initial removal of zzso zzso as part of the base zzso repair zzso zzso of zzso activity is embryonic lethal in animals and is lethal in zzso Potential zzso of the repair function of zzso were identified based upon molecular modeling of the crystal structure of the zzso zzso We describe the characterization of several unique zzso zzso using two complementary zzso zzso The most active molecules all contain a zzso structure that is predicted from the modeling to anchor the compounds in the zzso site of the zzso The mechanism of action of the selected compounds was zzso by zzso and competition studies, which zzso in a specific case, direct interaction between the inhibitor and the active site of the zzso It is demonstrated that the zzso induce zzso increases in the zzso of zzso sites in cells at levels that correlate with their potency to inhibit zzso zzso zzso The inhibitor molecules also zzso by zzso the toxicity of a DNA zzso agent that creates zzso zzso The molecules represent a new class of zzso zzso that can be used to probe the biology of this critical zzso and to sensitize resistant tumor cells to the zzso of clinically used DNA damaging zzso zzso
