We have developed a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a novel device for zzso after surgical zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that is a gel at body temperature and a zzso at room zzso When a zzso zzso is injected into a target site, zzso zzso in zzso gel zzso at the injection site and do not diffuse across the entire brain zzso and thus, sustained drug release from the zzso zzso at the target site is zzso Using in zzso imaging, we confirmed that the zzso of zzso green zzso zzso exhibited a stronger zzso of zzso at the injection site 28 d after injection compared with that of zzso zzso The therapeutic effect zzso zzso was evaluated in a zzso rat zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso alone showed almost no effect on survival zzso 18 zzso surgical zzso zzso zzso Survival was prolonged after the treatment with a zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso (24 zzso The combination treatment of surgical tumor zzso and zzso showed almost the same therapeutic effect (24 zzso compared with zzso alone, while the combination treatment produced long term survivors zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso can be an effective candidate for localized and sustained long-term zzso zzso
