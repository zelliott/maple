The development of head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso involves the zzso of genetic and zzso zzso in zzso zzso together with the persistent zzso of zzso signaling zzso The zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso is a frequent event in zzso However, zzso mechanisms also contribute to the zzso of key zzso signaling routes, including signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso and zzso Indeed, the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells by zzso zzso such as zzso can result in the zzso zzso of zzso In this study, we explored the nature of the molecular mechanism underlying enhanced zzso zzso in zzso zzso We found that zzso cells display an increased activity of the zzso promoter, which is dependent on the presence of an intact zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso gene and protein zzso and decreased the release of multiple zzso Interestingly, interfering with zzso function also prevented the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso These findings demonstrate a zzso between the zzso and the zzso signaling systems, and support the emerging notion that zzso results from the zzso activity of a signaling zzso
