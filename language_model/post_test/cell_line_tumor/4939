zzso zzso controlled zzso systems provide a powerful and commonly used method for functional studies on the consequences of gene zzso However, whereas zzso delivery in tissue culture in zzso is relatively simple, the situation in zzso is more zzso Several methods of zzso delivery in zzso have been zzso in drinking water containing alcohol, in drinking water containing various zzso of zzso and in zzso Unfortunately there are no reports directly comparing the advantages and disadvantages of these diverse methods, and there is no generally accepted zzso We therefore compared four zzso methods of zzso delivery in zzso drinking water, by zzso as a zzso and in standard zzso To assess the delivery of zzso by these methods, we used a subcutaneous zzso model based on zzso zzso cells engineered for zzso expression of an activated zzso of zzso and the zzso reporter zzso Our results indicate that feed represents the most favorable method of zzso zzso
