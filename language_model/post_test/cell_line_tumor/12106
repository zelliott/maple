We showed that the zzso zzso factor zzso with zzso a zzso zzso which is zzso zzso in lung zzso This interaction occurred through the zzso domain of zzso and the zzso domain of zzso zzso of zzso in lung cancer cells stabilized zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso into cells induced zzso of zzso and subsequently resulted in reduced zzso zzso and protein zzso whereas zzso and zzso zzso zzso were defective in this zzso zzso zzso zzso and promoted its degradation through a zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso possessed greater invasive potential compared with cells expressing zzso zzso Increased invasion of cells with zzso zzso was partly due to zzso zzso as zzso interference zzso of zzso resulted in dramatic decrease of zzso zzso However, forced expression of zzso resulted in zzso of zzso markers and induction of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso stabilization due to zzso zzso could lead to zzso transition and greater lung cancer invasion zzso
