zzso storage diseases arise from a genetic zzso zzso in zzso zzso key zzso steps resulting in zzso of zzso within the zzso Treatment of several of these disorders has been achieved by zzso replacement therapy zzso in which a zzso version of the defective zzso is expressed in zzso and administered by zzso However, in many cases the zzso of the administered protein does not match that of the accumulated zzso due to the zzso clearance of the zzso from zzso resulting in poor or absent zzso clearance from some zzso To overcome this zzso we have evaluated several zzso targeting motifs to redirect zzso human zzso zzso to specific zzso A zzso zzso zzso chemistry was developed to achieve zzso zzso display with zzso zzso In zzso cell zzso was zzso dependent and independent of the normal zzso zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, despite increased plasma zzso and decreased liver zzso none of the zzso zzso showed significantly altered zzso in zzso zzso This suggests that these zzso targeting motifs are unlikely to provide substantial therapeutic benefit likely due to the complexity of factors affecting zzso and zzso
