zzso overload due to a zzso in the zzso zzso zzso copper zzso within zzso produces the zzso of Wilson zzso The overload of zzso with copper results in zzso liver cells and is accompanied by a high concentration of blood copper zzso That occurs to be the reason for increasing neurological copper zzso Although copper is linked to zzso there are no data on the direct copper related effects in human brain zzso 

To test the copper induced changes in protein zzso in human zzso like zzso 

We used zzso cells as model for human zzso zzso were treated with increasing zzso of zzso in zzso minimal essential zzso zzso at different time points we zzso cellular growth, cellular survival under copper treatment, the concentration of oxidized zzso in zzso in zzso as well as the zzso concentration and the concentration of oxidized proteins in zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

The viability of cells decreased with both increasing copper concentration and duration of zzso The concentration of oxidized proteins was directly correlated to the increase of copper concentration and duration of zzso 

These observations demonstrate the similarities between copper treatment and treatment with other commonly used zzso including hydrogen zzso Furthermore, the vulnerability of zzso towards copper exposure could be zzso zzso these data give further insights into understanding of copper zzso which in turn is important to reveal the exact pathological mechanism in copper related diseases such as Wilson zzso
