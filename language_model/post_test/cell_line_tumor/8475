zzso zzso complexes of the type zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 0, zzso 1, zzso 2, zzso and the zzso complex zzso zzso were zzso and fully characterized zzso and zzso Furthermore, the structure of 2 was determined by X-ray zzso zzso The biological potential of the neutral and zzso zzso complexes was tested in zzso against the cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Complex zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso coordinated containing a zzso zzso group, is the most active one zzso values of about 3 zzso thus, with activities comparable to zzso Complex 2 proved to have an even a higher zzso activity than zzso against zzso and zzso cell lines, used as a model system of highly zzso zzso with low sensitivity to conventional zzso such as zzso Additional experiments demonstrated that zzso and zzso cell death contribute to the drug's zzso zzso
