zzso is an important component in the treatment paradigm for breast zzso However, the resistance of cancer cells to zzso agents frequently results in the subsequent recurrence and zzso Identification of molecular markers to predict treatment outcome is therefore zzso The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether expression of circulating zzso zzso can predict clinical outcome in breast cancer patients treated with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso in blood serum prior to treatment were determined by quantitative zzso zzso in 56 breast cancer patients with invasive zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso zzso and zzso were performed in surgical samples to determine the effects of chemotherapy on cancer cell proliferation and zzso zzso Among the zzso tested, only zzso was significantly associated with therapeutic response, exhibiting higher expression level in zzso patients zzso zzso zzso In addition, breast zzso with high zzso expression had higher percentage of zzso cells and lower percentage of zzso cells in the corresponding surgical specimens obtained after zzso zzso Increased resistance to zzso drug was observed in zzso in breast cancer cells with zzso zzso zzso conversely, reducing zzso level zzso breast cancer cells to zzso Moreover, we demonstrated that the zzso was a direct target of zzso in breast cancer zzso 

These data suggest that circulating zzso expression is associated with zzso resistance of breast zzso This finding has important implications in the development of targeted zzso for overcoming zzso resistance in novel zzso zzso
