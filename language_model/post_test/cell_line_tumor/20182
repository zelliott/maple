To investigate whether the zzso zzso zzso a novel synthetic zzso zzso affects the growth of gastric cancer cells and its zzso 

A series of zzso zzso were prepared by zzso and zzso and human gastric cancer cell lines zzso and zzso cultured in zzso were treated with various zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The cell viability was measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso The cells were incubated by zzso at different zzso The growth zzso effects were evaluated using zzso and zzso zzso The distribution of the phase in cell cycle was analyzed using flow zzso analysis with zzso zzso zzso The expression of the zzso factor zzso box zzso zzso was analyzed by reverse zzso chain reaction and Western zzso The expression levels of zzso zzso zzso B and zzso protein were detected using Western zzso 

Nine of the zzso zzso had more effective zzso activity than zzso Among the tested zzso zzso possessed the strongest activity against zzso and zzso cells in zzso zzso significantly inhibited the cell viability and colony formation of zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso arrested the cell cycle in zzso zzso zzso decreased the expression of zzso and its downstream zzso such as zzso zzso zzso B, and increased zzso at protein zzso zzso of zzso by small interfering zzso before zzso treatment resulted in enhanced cell growth zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso attenuated zzso cell growth zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso the growth of human gastric cancer cells by zzso the zzso zzso
