zzso of the zzso activity of classical zzso fever virus zzso zzso zzso was previously shown to result in virus zzso zzso reduction of B cell numbers in the peripheral blood, a typical symptom of zzso infection in zzso was not detected on infection with the zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso J zzso 73, zzso The present report shows that this feature is restricted to this specific virus zzso and does not represent a general property of zzso zzso The effects induced by infection with two other zzso and zzso zzso zzso strains on the composition of peripheral blood cells have been further zzso For all zzso not only general zzso but also a reduction of different zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso Similar to the results with zzso no significant differences with regard to changes in cell number were determined for zzso zzso and zzso virus during the initial phase of zzso Later, the values returned to zzso levels for the zzso but stayed at low levels in the zzso zzso zzso A major difference was reflected in the virus load of the infected animals, which was dramatically higher for pigs infected with zzso zzso so that reduction of the virus load represents a further marker for zzso resulting from zzso zzso zzso was also zzso for the zzso zzso zzso which showed rapid zzso to the zzso sequence within the infected zzso The prevention of fatal disease after infection with zzso is apparently determined during the short time between infection and zzso as the virus zzso zzso from infected pigs was shown to be virulent when used for infection in a follow-up zzso zzso of zzso was also detected in tissue culture during passage on zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso transformed kidney zzso cells, whereas the zzso was stable when zzso or zzso cells were zzso
