zzso a major zzso of zzso zzso has been shown to inhibit prostate cancer growth and development, but the zzso basis for its zzso activity remains largely zzso zzso of zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling is critical for prostate cancer cell growth and zzso This study examined whether the growth zzso effect of zzso was related to changes in the zzso system in zzso prostate cancer zzso At nutritionally relevant zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso of zzso and its downstream zzso and zzso protein zzso regulated zzso signaling zzso zzso of zzso by zzso resulted in decreased zzso of its downstream targets, including zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also inhibited zzso D1 zzso As a result, zzso inhibited proliferation and migration of zzso zzso zzso of zzso by plasmids with zzso zzso against zzso zzso resulted in zzso of proliferation of zzso cells and cell numbers did not differ when the zzso groups zzso zzso with plasmids containing zzso against zzso zzso were treated or zzso with zzso These results suggest that zzso suppresses proliferation and migration of prostate cancer cells, at least zzso through zzso of zzso zzso The finding of this study provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms that zzso exerts against prostate zzso
