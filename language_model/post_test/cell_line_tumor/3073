Acute zzso leukemia zzso is the most frequently diagnosed adulthood zzso yet current therapies offer a cure rate of less than zzso This may be due in part to the fact that the zzso cells in zzso reside within the rare and highly primitive zzso zzso zzso cell zzso population that are often resistant to zzso zzso acid zzso a major component of fish oil, has previously been shown to inhibit the induction and progression of breast, prostate and colon cancer, and increase the therapeutic effects of numerous zzso often by enhancing zzso In the present studies, we investigated zzso effect on the primitive and zzso zzso cell line zzso to explore the potential of this fatty acid to serve as zzso therapy for zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso for 96 hours did not lead to maturation or cell cycle modification when compared to an zzso zzso control zzso zzso zzso However, zzso treatment of zzso cells resulted in a progressive loss of zzso DNA zzso and an increase in zzso V zzso demonstrating zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, expression of the zzso protein zzso was increased, with zzso skewing in the zzso ratio, providing a zzso explanation for the observed zzso increase in zzso Since we also show that zzso does not have a zzso effect on normal zzso our results suggest that zzso could potentially serve as an zzso zzso in the treatment of zzso zzso
