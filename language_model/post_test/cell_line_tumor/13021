In response to different environmental zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso global translation zzso with preferential translation of zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of the integrated stress response, a program of gene expression involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of additional zzso factors, such as zzso that can induce zzso Although zzso elicits zzso control in response to many different stress arrangements, there are selected zzso such as exposure to zzso zzso that do not increase zzso expression despite robust zzso In this study we addressed the underlying mechanism for variable expression of zzso in response to zzso during different stress conditions and the biological significance of omission of enhanced zzso zzso We show that in addition to zzso control, zzso expression is subject to zzso zzso Stress conditions such as zzso zzso stress induce both zzso and translation of zzso which together enhance expression of zzso and its target genes in response to zzso By contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso transcription, which diminishes zzso zzso available for translation during zzso zzso enhances cell survival in response to zzso zzso However, forced expression of zzso and its target gene zzso leads to increased sensitivity to zzso zzso This combination of zzso regulation and zzso control allows the zzso zzso zzso to selectively repress or activate key regulatory genes subject to preferential translation, providing the integrated stress response versatility to direct the zzso that is essential for maintaining the balance between stress zzso and zzso
