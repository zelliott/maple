The quantitative detection of zzso zzso acids including short zzso zzso in cells and zzso becomes increasingly zzso Here, we describe a method for the detection of zzso in extracts prepared from zzso cells, which is based on liquid zzso with a zzso probe followed by a zzso protection zzso The limit of detection of absolute amounts of zzso is in the order of zzso zzso This methodology is suited to zzso follow the spontaneous zzso of zzso by zzso cells, zzso without the use of carrier zzso This protocol may also be used to detect extremely low amounts of other kinds of short zzso zzso including zzso zzso
