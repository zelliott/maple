zzso binding proteins zzso specifically bind the zzso tail of zzso and have been shown to be important for zzso zzso translation zzso and zzso zzso Using a modified zzso zzso zzso we examined the effects of two zzso zzso by zzso and zzso on the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso of these two genes by zzso interference zzso effectively reduced zzso zzso by 70 to zzso without significantly changing zzso zzso or translation or the status of the zzso zzso We identified that both zzso binding proteins were associated with the zzso zzso complex, presumably through zzso zzso zzso of zzso caused a zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso inhibitor zzso increased zzso zzso up to zzso Low levels of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso increased zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso of these two proteins caused zzso effects, such as hypersensitivity to zzso and decreased zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso is essential for the formation of zzso zzso complexes and may play a role in zzso zzso zzso in the host zzso
