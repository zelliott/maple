zzso zzso zzso plays important roles in cell cycle regulation, zzso and DNA repair in different cell types including lung zzso There are different zzso zzso pathways in high and low zzso ability lung cancer zzso However, the exactly mechanism in the zzso is still zzso Here we found that zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso First, by using zzso differential display technique, zzso zzso zzso expression was found in all cell lines zzso of zzso zzso expression construct zzso wild type zzso zzso especially in highly zzso zzso lung cancer zzso Then, decreased expression of zzso zzso was further confirmed by Northern zzso and Western zzso zzso At last, knock down of zzso zzso by zzso inhibited cellular proliferation in zzso cell line with highly zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggested that zzso zzso may play roles in zzso induced zzso and it is also involved in regulation of cell zzso
