The most common cause of zzso deaths in North America is lung cancer, zzso of which is zzso cell lung cancer zzso Gene therapy is a promising approach, but has been hindered by lack of methods for zzso and zzso gene expression in zzso Human zzso zzso zzso zzso reporters can be used to follow gene expression in zzso using zzso with greater affinity for this zzso zzso can express zzso zzso which may interfere with zzso zzso We assessed whether a zzso reporter can serve as a reporter of gene transfer into zzso zzso zzso expression was assessed in zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso using zzso After infection with an zzso containing zzso zzso or control zzso expression was assessed by zzso techniques and binding to zzso zzso In zzso after magnetic resonance zzso imaging, zzso zzso tumors were injected with zzso or control virus zzso zzso under ultrasound zzso zzso injection of zzso 2 days later was followed by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into tumors was assessed in zzso using zzso MR and functional zzso images and ex zzso using excised zzso In human lung tumor samples zzso zzso expression was assessed using zzso All three zzso cell lines expressed different zzso zzso but none expressed zzso Upon zzso infection, zzso expression was seen in all three cell lines using zzso targeting the zzso domain or zzso targeting the zzso domain zzso zzso zzso tumors infected with zzso were clearly visible by zzso zzso expression was zzso by both in zzso and ex zzso zzso analysis and demonstrated greater zzso in tumors infected with zzso compared with control virus zzso zzso zzso found that zzso of zzso are negative for and zzso have low levels of zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso reporters can serve as reporters of gene transfer into zzso
