A novel zzso zzso referred to here as zzso was discovered in a zzso screen of chemical libraries against zzso zzso cells carrying autonomously replicating zzso zzso of zzso C virus zzso zzso was highly potent in blocking zzso zzso replication as measured by real-time reverse zzso and Western zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso series yielded a lead compound, zzso that was more potent and highly specific for zzso zzso with no significant zzso activity against a panel of zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso 1 zzso displayed markedly higher sensitivity to zzso treatment than a zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso was tested by a panel of zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso activities, and the data suggested that the compound had a therapeutic window close to zzso while its exact mechanism of action remained zzso We found that zzso was more effective than alpha zzso zzso at blocking zzso zzso replication in the zzso zzso In combination studies, zzso showed a weak synergistic effect with zzso but only additive effects with a zzso inhibitor and an zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso and related zzso compounds constitute a new class of zzso zzso that could potentially be developed as a treatment for zzso zzso
