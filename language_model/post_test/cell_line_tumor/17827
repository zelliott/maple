The zzso component of zzso zzso zzso is a key feature in developing zzso therapeutic agents that are highly active at well tolerated zzso For zzso zzso drug delivery, zzso are required that are highly stable in the systemic zzso yet allow for efficient drug release at the target zzso In this respect, zzso zzso technologies constitute a technological zzso since the zzso zzso in circulation ( zzso 1/2 approximately 7 zzso are much longer than earlier generation zzso that break down within 1-2 zzso The zzso zzso some of which contain zzso are appended to the zzso carriers through zzso zzso Here, we describe that use of a zzso zzso in place of the zzso zzso increases the plasma stability of resulting zzso zzso One such zzso zzso which is directed against the zzso zzso on zzso and zzso cell zzso was prepared containing a zzso zzso zzso between the drug zzso and the zzso carrier zzso There was no measurable systemic drug release from this zzso for 2 weeks zzso in zzso In order to assess the impact of improving zzso stability beyond zzso containing zzso a series of zzso and zzso zzso zzso were compared for zzso zzso drug delivery, and therapeutic efficacy in nude mice with zzso cell zzso zzso There were no statistically significant efficacy differences between sets of zzso and zzso containing zzso although the zzso zzso technology led to zzso higher zzso drug exposure over a 7 day period compared to the corresponding zzso zzso The mechanism of drug release from zzso likely involves a zzso reaction that takes place in zzso based on in zzso studies demonstrating that some of the released zzso zzso became zzso bound to zzso of serum zzso In zzso the data indicate that new zzso can be obtained with improved in zzso stability by replacing the zzso with an zzso but the resulting zzso had similar zzso and activity zzso
