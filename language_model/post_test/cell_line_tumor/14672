zzso cancer is one of the most aggressive human zzso with an increasing zzso zzso Despite an increase in the number of systemic treatments available for pancreatic cancer, the impact of therapy on the clinical course of the disease has been modest, zzso an urgent need for new therapeutic zzso Although selective zzso zzso have been demonstrated to have zzso effects, the mechanism of their effects is not clearly zzso Moreover, there have been no unbiased studies to identify novel molecular targets of zzso regarding pancreatic zzso Here we undertook a gene expression profiling study to identify novel molecular targets modulating the growth zzso effects of zzso on pancreatic cancer cell zzso Our zzso gene expression results showed that the growth zzso effect of zzso was accompanied with an zzso of zzso and zzso cell cycle regulation, zzso zzso zzso zzso hydrocarbon zzso and death zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we reported, for the first time, that the growth zzso effect of zzso is zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso in all cell zzso
