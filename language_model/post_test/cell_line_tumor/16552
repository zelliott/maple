zzso an oral zzso zzso was zzso by introducing the zzso of zzso at the zzso on the zzso ring of zzso Our goal in this study was to evaluate the efficacy of zzso on the growth of human zzso with zzso as zzso zzso were performed on human zzso cell lung cancer zzso and colon cancer zzso both in zzso and in zzso In zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited the growth of cancer cells as determined by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Further studies indicated that zzso induced the cancer cells to zzso showing zzso zzso and zzso of zzso In in zzso studies, we evaluated the efficacy of zzso in nude mice bearing human cancer zzso zzso effectively delayed the growth of zzso and zzso without significant loss of body zzso zzso analysis indicated that the high efficacy of zzso was associated with its ability to induce zzso as evidenced by increase of terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso zzso cells, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in tumor zzso zzso also increased zzso ratio in cancer zzso These biological activities of zzso were more potential than that of zzso Based on these in zzso and in zzso results, zzso is proposed as a potent oral zzso agent that may supplant the use of zzso in the zzso
