We describe the zzso activity of zzso a novel zzso heat shock protein 90 zzso zzso in zzso cell lung cancer zzso zzso 

The activity of zzso was compared with that of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso cell lines, and zzso and evaluated in an zzso zzso mouse lung zzso zzso 

zzso blocked the ability of zzso to bind to zzso zzso and disrupted the association of zzso with its zzso zzso more zzso than zzso In zzso defined zzso cell lines, zzso caused depletion of zzso zzso zzso zzso of downstream zzso zzso of proliferation and induction of zzso with zzso values ranging 2 to 30 zzso substantially lower than those required for zzso zzso zzso zzso was also approximately zzso more potent in zzso zzso zzso cells rendered zzso independent by expression of zzso and zzso zzso In mice bearing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was rapidly eliminated from plasma and normal zzso but was maintained in tumor with zzso zzso hours, supporting zzso dosing experiments, in which zzso produced greater tumor growth zzso than zzso However, after a single dose, zzso of zzso zzso occurred by 72 hours, zzso with reversal of zzso and zzso zzso zzso day dosing resulted in zzso zzso accompanied by more sustained zzso zzso zzso also showed activity against mouse lung zzso driven by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso has greater potency than zzso and potential efficacy against several zzso subsets, including those harboring zzso or zzso zzso
