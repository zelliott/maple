It has recently been found that the new class of zzso long zzso zzso zzso are zzso transcribed in the zzso zzso are a large family of zzso zzso and regulate many zzso zzso Growing evidence indicates that zzso may play an important functional role in cancer zzso Emerging data have shown that zzso are closely related to the occurrence and development of lung zzso However, the function and mechanism of zzso in lung cancer remain zzso Here, we investigated the role of a novel zzso in transformed human zzso zzso cells induced by zzso After establishing the transformed cell model using the zzso cell line in zzso we found that expression of zzso was high and changed during the transformation of zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression in zzso transformed zzso cells led to zzso of cell proliferation and colony formation, and increased zzso zzso dramatically promoted the ability of zzso cells to form colonies in zzso and develop tumors in nude zzso These findings revealed that zzso acts as an zzso in zzso transformed zzso cells induced by zzso The identification of zzso could provide new insight into the molecular mechanisms of chemical zzso
