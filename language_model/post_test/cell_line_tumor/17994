We screened various food components for their ability to inhibit zzso zzso zzso in tumor cells in zzso with the aim of finding novel zzso zzso did not change zzso zzso in the tumor cells, although the zzso derivatives zzso and zzso acid tended to promote zzso zzso zzso of these components with zzso were also not zzso In contrast, zzso E significantly promoted zzso influx into tumor cells and increased zzso concentration in tumor zzso Furthermore, combined zzso E significantly suppressed zzso zzso from tumor cells and was shown to maintain the zzso level in tumor zzso It was also confirmed that the combination of zzso E with zzso resulted in effective zzso for tumor cells in zzso Additionally, the combination of zzso E and zzso showed increased zzso when compared to each treatment zzso In zzso zzso alone treatment did not change the time course of tumor size or tumor weight of zzso zzso zzso compared to control zzso In contrast, the combination of zzso E with zzso resulted in decreased tumor size and tumor weight, compared to that in zzso alone group, indicating effective zzso zzso In conclusion, the combination of zzso E with zzso may be an effective tool with treated application in the cancer zzso
