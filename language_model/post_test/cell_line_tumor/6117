There is increasing evidence that cancer stem cells contribute to the initiation and propagation of many zzso zzso to find out and identify the zzso tumor zzso cells in Lewis lung cancer cell line zzso the expression of zzso was measured in LLC by flow zzso and observed by laser scanning zzso microscope zzso After the zzso LLC cell was isolated from LLC by magnetic cell zzso its properties were evaluated by their zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells were counted for zzso of the total number of zzso and zzso zzso cells were identified by zzso zzso LLC suspension cultured in a zzso zzso cell spheres expressed a high level of zzso The chemotherapy sensitivity to zzso of zzso LLC was lower than that of zzso zzso The expression of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso LLC was higher than that in zzso LLC zzso zzso zzso Most of zzso LLC cells were close to vascular zzso cells, zzso zzso around it was zzso The expression of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso LLC was higher than that in zzso LLC zzso zzso zzso the zzso density zzso of zzso zzso growing were higher than that of zzso zzso growing tumor tissue zzso zzso zzso The tumor size, volume, and zzso zzso in the lungs of zzso LLC was significantly higher than that in zzso LLC zzso zzso zzso Similarly, elevated expression of zzso and zzso was also positively associated with zzso zzso Our results demonstrated that zzso cells from Lewis lung zzso cell line exhibit cancer zzso stem cell zzso
