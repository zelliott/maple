Recently we reported that zzso the zzso zzso zzso gene reduced zzso expression that was associated with a profound zzso cell death in prostate cancer zzso In this study we further investigated zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cancer cell line zzso and its zzso zzso and zzso were used for cell proliferation zzso and zzso experiments in nude zzso zzso gene reporters driven by mouse or human zzso gene promoter were used to determine zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso were conducted to assess zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed to determine zzso interaction with zzso zzso zzso zzso of gene expression was examined using zzso zzso zzso 

In cultured prostate cancer zzso cells, zzso treatment significantly increased zzso expression at zzso and protein levels via an zzso zzso zzso analyses demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso and that the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso gene dramatically increased cell proliferation in zzso and promoted zzso tumor growth in zzso zzso gene profiling analysis revealed that zzso expression was significantly higher in zzso and zzso diseases compared to normal prostate zzso or primary zzso zzso zzso significantly increased the expression of zzso zzso which might be responsible for zzso cell proliferation and tumor zzso 

Taken together, our data strongly suggest that zzso stimulates zzso expression via the zzso and that increased zzso expression plays a versatile role in zzso progression of prostate zzso
