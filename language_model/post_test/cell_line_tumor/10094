Lung cancer remains a leading cause of cancer death among both men and women in the United zzso Treatment zzso available for this zzso are inadequate and thus new drugs with improved pharmacological profiles and superior therapeutic zzso are being continually zzso zzso constitute an emerging class of zzso agents that bind zzso but do not significantly alter the zzso ratio of zzso zzso a zzso member of this class of zzso agents, is more potent than the lead zzso zzso 

Here we report that zzso inhibited proliferation of a comprehensive panel of lung cancer cells with zzso ranging from zzso zzso In zzso human zzso cell lung cancer cells, the zzso activity was zzso through zzso of zzso progression by induction of a transient but robust zzso arrest accompanied by zzso of the zzso assembly zzso The zzso zzso cells then override the activated zzso checkpoint and zzso exit zzso without zzso resulting in zzso zzso zzso cells that either succumb directly to zzso or continue another round of the zzso The accumulated enormous DNA perhaps acts as zzso stress to trigger cell zzso zzso zzso cell death in zzso cells was associated with a decrease of the zzso ratio, zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso induced zzso of zzso expression over time of zzso zzso of zzso led to an increase of cell death zzso zzso caused decreased zzso 

These in zzso data suggest that zzso mediates zzso and zzso activity in zzso cell zzso lung cancer cells by zzso zzso progression and attenuating zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso The study provides evidence for the potential usefulness of zzso in chemotherapy of lung zzso
