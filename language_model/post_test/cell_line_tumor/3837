zzso a green method for the development of a novel zzso silver zzso zzso impregnated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The synthesis of zzso zzso NC is based on the zzso complex formation between zzso and zzso The composite NC is characterized by zzso zzso transmission electron zzso scanning electron zzso zzso zzso transform infrared zzso and X-ray zzso The zzso zzso in the NC are found to elicit zzso zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso cells at zzso of zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso The cell cycle analysis shows extensive DNA zzso zzso in zzso oxygen species level indicates induction of zzso stress in treated zzso zzso dysfunction in cell death is evident from the zzso of zzso membrane potential zzso zzso Fluorescence and zzso images of the treated cells reveal nuclear and zzso changes characteristic of zzso which is further confirmed by zzso zzso The induction of zzso at low concentration of zzso zzso present in zzso zzso NC in comparison with free zzso zzso makes it a promising tool for cancer zzso
