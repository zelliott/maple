zzso zzso growth zzso zzso 1 zzso a novel zzso is hypothesized to be associated with zzso zzso is expressed in zzso zzso zzso cells, but its function remains zzso To investigate the molecular effects of zzso on zzso cells, the zzso cell line zzso was zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso Our data demonstrated that zzso of zzso in zzso cells significantly enhanced the cellular zzso invasive ability, and tumor growth, when compared with both empty zzso control cells and parental zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso plays an important role in zzso invasion and tumor growth, and indicate that zzso may serve as a potential zzso for zzso zzso
