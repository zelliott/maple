The zzso of zzso extracts from rice cultures of 53 zzso zzso zzso which had been isolated from different host organisms in Northern Europe, Canada and zzso Zealand, was investigated in a rat zzso zzso zzso zzso kidney zzso zzso zzso lung zzso dog zzso zzso and a human zzso zzso zzso cell line using the zzso zzso mark zzso All extracts were screened for known zzso zzso using zzso liquid zzso with zzso array and mass zzso zzso and both known and unknown zzso were zzso Known zzso that were determined in the cultures include zzso zzso zzso zzso Y, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A and C, and zzso Multiple zzso analysis was used in order to relate zzso zzso to the zzso of the zzso Separate linear zzso models were constructed for each cell zzso Eleven different zzso zzso were related to the zzso ( zzso Out of these, nine zzso were zzso related to the zzso in only one of the five models, while two, namely zzso and zzso were significant contributors in three or four zzso models, zzso This paper describes how multiple zzso analysis may be applied for the assignment of zzso to the constituents of a zzso zzso
