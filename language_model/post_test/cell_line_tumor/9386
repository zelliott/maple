zzso zzso disease zzso is a serious complication of solid organ and bone zzso transplantation and is closely associated with zzso virus zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso zzso directly zzso the in zzso and in zzso proliferation of zzso B zzso cell lines zzso derived from patients with zzso by arresting cells in the zzso phase of the cell zzso The aim of this study is to zzso the mechanism by which zzso causes cell cycle arrest in zzso B zzso 

zzso were cultured without or with zzso (10 zzso and zzso cell cycle proteins were analyzed by zzso and zzso zzso zzso complexes were zzso and incubated with zzso protein zzso zzso zzso activity of the complex was determined by Western zzso with zzso zzso 

We show that zzso decreased both zzso zzso and zzso D3 protein zzso Furthermore, zzso decreased the protein levels of zzso dependent zzso 4 zzso and increased the expression of the zzso inhibitor zzso In contrast, expression of the zzso inhibitor zzso was markedly inhibited by zzso in the zzso Finally, in zzso zzso zzso revealed that downstream zzso of zzso by zzso complexes was also decreased by zzso 

The results presented here zzso key targets of zzso cell cycle arrest, provide insight into the growth pathways of zzso zzso zzso and demonstrate the potential for zzso as a therapeutic option in the treatment of zzso and other zzso zzso
