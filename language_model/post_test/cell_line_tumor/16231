The second zzso zzso zzso zzso formed by the zzso family of zzso promotes cellular growth, zzso and survival, in large part by zzso the protein zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso generates zzso as well as water soluble zzso zzso zzso deletion reduces growth zzso zzso signaling and cell proliferation caused uniquely by loss of its zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso prevents zzso zzso and zzso Thus, growth factor stimulation of zzso signaling involves zzso generation through the sequential zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso As zzso zzso inhibit zzso zzso zzso appears to act as a molecular switch, zzso or stimulating zzso via its zzso zzso zzso or zzso activities, zzso Drugs regulating zzso may have therapeutic relevance in influencing cell zzso
