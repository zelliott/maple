zzso zzso is one of the most aggressive tumors that occur in zzso Although zzso such as zzso have been shown to be involved in the aggressiveness of the disease, the identification of new biological markers is still zzso The induction of differentiation is one of the strategies used in the treatment of zzso zzso zzso are components of the nuclear zzso and are involved in zzso We studied the role of zzso zzso in the differentiation and progression of zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells blocked zzso zzso zzso preventing zzso outgrowth and the expression of neural zzso The zzso zzso profile and the zzso analysis of zzso cells confirmed the zzso of differentiation and demonstrated an increase of zzso genes and molecules resulting in zzso zzso and increasing the drug resistance of the zzso The more aggressive zzso acquired by zzso cells was also maintained in zzso after injection into nude zzso A preliminary zzso analysis of zzso zzso expression in nine primary stages human zzso indicated that this protein is poorly expressed in most of these zzso 

We demonstrated for the first time in zzso cells that zzso zzso plays a central role in the zzso and that the loss of this protein gave rise to a more aggressive tumor zzso
