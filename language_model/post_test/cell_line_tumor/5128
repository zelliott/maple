The zzso zzso Snail and zzso contribute to cancer progression by zzso zzso transition zzso which results in tumor cell invasion and zzso We extend this current understanding to demonstrate their involvement in the development of resistance to radiation and zzso The process is orchestrated through the acquisition of a novel subset of gene targets that is zzso under conditions of stress, effectively zzso zzso zzso while another subset of targets continues to mediate zzso zzso activities are zzso by a concurrent zzso of specific genes resulting in the acquisition of stem zzso zzso Such cells are bestowed with three critical capabilities, namely zzso resistance to zzso zzso and a zzso program, that together define the functionality and survival of zzso cancer stem zzso zzso provides a mechanism of escape to a new, less adverse zzso resistance to zzso ensures cell survival in conditions of stress in the primary zzso whereas acquisition of zzso ensures generation of the critical tumor mass required for progression of zzso to zzso Our findings, besides achieving considerable expansion of the inventory of direct genes targets, more zzso demonstrate that such elegant cooperative zzso of gene regulation zzso by Snail and zzso is critical for a cancer cell to acquire stem cell characteristics toward resisting zzso or zzso cellular stress, and this may be a zzso aspect of aggressive cancer zzso
