Keeping in view the fact that molecular basis of zzso zzso zzso is poorly zzso we attempted to explore the small interfering zzso zzso zzso zzso gene regulation using zzso zzso cell line as archetype cellular zzso Such a study revealed that zzso cells possess zzso higher expression of zzso gene coupled with zzso higher activity of zzso zzso III than that observed in normal human zzso zzso derived from zzso cells had the inherent capacity to suppress zzso gene expression in normal cells but not in native zzso Based on these findings we have proposed a novel zzso zzso gene regulation zzso that may be responsible for zzso
