Free zzso have been implicated in the action of many zzso zzso Here we tested the hypothesis that zzso and other zzso drugs, such as zzso zzso and methotrexate, induce an increase in zzso zzso levels as part of the zzso defense against free radical production under these zzso treatments in cancer cell zzso zzso treatment induced both free radical production and an increase in zzso zzso levels in all the cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso form levels were particularly zzso zzso zzso levels were associated with zzso of zzso genes zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso At the zzso level, zzso protein expression levels were also zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso zzso increase, and enhanced zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso zzso increase is implicated in the cellular defense under chemotherapy treatment and may contribute to cell zzso
