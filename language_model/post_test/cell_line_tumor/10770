zzso particles zzso consist of zzso proteins from viruses and have been shown to be usable as carriers of protein and zzso zzso for immune zzso In this study, we have produced and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso carrying the entire human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for their potential use for immune therapy in a mouse model zzso zzso mice zzso with zzso were only marginally protected against outgrowth of a zzso zzso To improve protection, zzso were zzso with zzso zzso either alone or loaded onto zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso loaded onto zzso in the presence of zzso was shown to efficiently protect mice from tumor zzso In addition, cellular and zzso immune responses after zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells were demonstrated, but no zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso loaded with zzso induced an zzso lower zzso of zzso zzso than vaccination with zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso of zzso mice with zzso loaded onto zzso and zzso with zzso zzso an efficient zzso tumor protective immune response, including both zzso and zzso cells with a low induction of zzso zzso
