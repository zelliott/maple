The zzso represent the most common primary zzso brain zzso however, little is known about the molecular zzso of these zzso Recent research reveals that the zzso and development of zzso have a close relation to the zzso of several zzso and the zzso of tumor zzso zzso Whether the zzso finger zzso zzso a newly discovered zzso plays a role in zzso zzso is zzso The present study investigates the expression levels of zzso zzso in zzso samples and zzso brain samples and its function in the human zzso cell line zzso 

zzso was used to ascertain the expression of zzso zzso in the zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso expression levels of 35 pathological confirmed zzso samples zzso I - 4 cases, Grade II - 13 cases, Grade III - 11 cases, and Grade IV - 7 zzso and five zzso brain tissue samples were analyzed by real-time quantitative zzso By zzso interference zzso with the zzso zzso system, the expression of zzso was inhibited in the human zzso zzso cell line zzso The effects of zzso on cell proliferation were assessed by zzso and cell cycle and cell zzso were assessed by zzso 

The zzso zzso is expressed in the five zzso cell lines, and its expression level is significantly higher in zzso tissue than in zzso brain zzso By zzso of zzso zzso zzso cell proliferation was inhibited and cell zzso zzso At the same time, S stage cells lessened and zzso stage cells zzso 

The zzso gene is highly expressed in zzso tissue and zzso cell zzso It plays an important role in zzso cell zzso zzso and cell zzso
