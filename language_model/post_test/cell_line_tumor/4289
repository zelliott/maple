zzso zzso inhibitor zzso is an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso currently under clinical zzso Here, we report the synergistic activity of zzso in combination with zzso inhibitor zzso in killing zzso pancreatic cancer and cancer stem zzso Treatment of pancreatic cancer zzso cells with zzso alone inhibited zzso growth and moderately induced zzso zzso However, zzso caused extensive zzso in zzso cells through zzso of aurora zzso B activity, independent of RON zzso In contrast, zzso cancer stem cells were highly resistant to zzso growth zzso and zzso The effect of zzso on induction of cancer stem cell zzso was also zzso zzso zzso features a zzso cell population with zzso zzso content in both zzso and cancer stem zzso These cells also showed decreased sensitivity toward zzso by increased survival of zzso values in response to zzso zzso methotrexate, zzso and zzso Among a panel of chemical zzso that target different signaling zzso we found that zzso in combination with zzso inhibitor zzso exerted synergistic effects on zzso and cancer stem zzso More than zzso of zzso and cancer stem cells lost their viability when both zzso were zzso Specifically, zzso in combination with zzso of zzso but not zzso was responsible for the observed zzso Our findings demonstrate that zzso at therapeutic doses exerts zzso activities on pancreatic cancer cells but also zzso zzso insensitive to zzso Combination of zzso with zzso achieves the zzso zzso effect on pancreatic cancer and cancer stem zzso
