zzso an herbal preparation used in traditional Chinese medicine, has been used to treat cancer in China for zzso We investigated the zzso effects of zzso and their mechanisms in mice that had been zzso with zzso 

zzso 180 zzso Lewis lung zzso and zzso cells were implanted in zzso mice, zzso mice, and zzso nude mice, zzso zzso was administered to zzso of these zzso The tumor weight and size were zzso Cell cycle analysis and T zzso zzso were determined by flow zzso The activity of zzso cells and zzso was tested using zzso zzso on zzso cells and zzso cells, respectively, and the activity of zzso was tested with an zzso zzso cell proliferation zzso zzso zzso was monitored by measuring electric zzso and the levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in blood were measured by zzso and zzso zzso 

The results showed that zzso inhibited tumor growth in zzso mice and arrested the cell proliferation in the zzso phase and reduced the portion of cells in S and zzso phase for zzso zzso zzso increased the activity of zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso production and activity, and regulated T zzso zzso zzso inhibited the Lewis lung zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso the balance between zzso and zzso 

All these findings demonstrated that zzso has an zzso effect in zzso The mechanism may be related to immune regulation and zzso zzso
