The zzso zzso displays a large degree of zzso in the expression of a number of zzso mechanisms following DNA damage that, among others, involves increased expression of several zzso genes through zzso zzso and zzso cellular contexts contribute to the complexity of the regulation of zzso hence different genes may show a zzso and zzso specificity with regard to the regulation of cell death and act in concert or show zzso with one and zzso We used zzso technology to assess the effect of multiple zzso of documented zzso zzso target genes zzso in the zzso cancer cell line zzso and generated mice deficient in both of the zzso and intrinsic zzso genes zzso and zzso following treatment with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were induced by zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells in a zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso activity in zzso cells following treatment were suppressed by zzso expression of the zzso in the zzso as well as the intrinsic zzso To our surprise, zzso any of the zzso zzso with zzso did not further inhibit zzso zzso activity whereas zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso did, suggesting that these genes act downstream or in zzso with zzso This was supported by our in zzso zzso since zzso and zzso were equally efficient in protecting cells of the zzso from zzso zzso zzso but less effective compared with zzso zzso zzso To our surprise, zzso zzso mice did not show additive protection from zzso zzso in any of the investigated zzso Our data indicates that the intrinsic zzso may rely on zzso signals to promote cell death in a zzso and zzso manner following DNA zzso Furthermore, zzso must rely on mechanisms independent of zzso and zzso to initiate zzso following zzso in the zzso and zzso in zzso
