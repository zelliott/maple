zzso are reported to increase the risk of more aggressive zzso zzso positive, zzso zzso positive zzso zzso breast zzso in zzso zzso Using an in zzso rat model of zzso zzso + zzso cancer, we show that tumors arising in the presence of zzso and zzso exhibit increased proliferation and decreased nuclear expression of the cell cycle inhibitor zzso compared with tumors growing in the presence of zzso zzso In human zzso breast cancer cells, zzso increased proliferation and decreased nuclear zzso zzso The decrease of nuclear zzso protein was dependent on zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso increased proliferation and decreased nuclear zzso expression were observed in invasive breast zzso compared with zzso in zzso These results suggest that zzso specifically regulates zzso zzso of zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso pathways can provide useful therapeutic targets for treatment of more aggressive zzso zzso breast zzso
