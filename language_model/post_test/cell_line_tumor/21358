We have applied zzso zzso to study the association preferences of G protein beta and gamma zzso in living zzso zzso zzso multiple zzso of beta and gamma zzso most of which can form zzso Although many zzso complexes exhibit similar properties when zzso in zzso systems, knockout experiments in zzso suggest that individual zzso have unique zzso zzso makes it possible to correlate zzso complex formation with functionality in intact cells by comparing the amounts of fluorescent zzso complexes with their abilities to zzso zzso zzso The relative predominance of specific zzso complexes in zzso is not zzso To address this issue, zzso zzso can determine the association preferences of beta and gamma zzso by simultaneously visualizing the two fluorescent complexes formed when beta or gamma zzso fused to zzso terminal fragments of yellow fluorescent protein zzso and zzso fluorescent protein zzso compete to interact with limiting amounts of a common gamma or beta zzso respectively, fused to a zzso terminal zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso also makes it possible to determine the roles of interacting proteins in the zzso targeting of complexes, study the formation of protein complexes that are unstable under isolation conditions, determine the roles of zzso proteins in regulating the association preferences of interacting zzso and zzso dynamic events affecting multiple protein zzso These approaches can be applied to studying the assembly and functions of a wide variety of protein complexes in the context of a living zzso
