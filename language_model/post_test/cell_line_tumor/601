To investigate the zzso effect of zzso zzso gene therapy on zzso zzso zzso combined with local zzso utilizing zzso zzso 

zzso zzso promoter and fusion gene of zzso were cloned into zzso zzso zzso thus obtaining zzso zzso of zzso zzso using restriction zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso DNA were prepared by the method of zzso and evaporation of organic zzso and the surface shape of zzso was observed by transmission electron zzso Human zzso cells of the lines zzso and zzso were cultured and zzso with the zzso zzso utilizing the zzso Following zzso induction at 37 degrees C, 39 degrees C, 41 degrees C, 43 degrees C, and 45 degrees C for 30 zzso the expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso was detected by zzso microscope and flow zzso The concentration of zzso protein in the zzso was tested by zzso and the growth zzso on the zzso and zzso cells was tested by zzso zzso zzso nude mice were zzso with zzso cells and then randomly divided into 2 groups to undergo zzso injection of zzso zzso or not zzso zzso zzso Mice were used as controls without zzso zzso Four weeks the mice were killed to observe the tumor zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso were of round or elliptical shape 90 approximately 120 zzso in zzso The efficiency of gene zzso zzso by zzso was about zzso The expression of zzso gene in the zzso cells was zzso along with the increase of temperature, peaked at 43 degrees C (with the zzso expression level zzso times as that at 37 degrees zzso The concentration of zzso protein in the zzso of the 43 degrees C group was zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly higher than that of the 37 degrees C group zzso zzso 10) zzso zzso results indicated that zzso inhibited the growth of zzso cells with a zzso rate of zzso at the time point of 72 h in the 43 degrees C group, however, it did not show influence on zzso cells no matter what was the temperature The tumor zzso rate in the mice of zzso with zzso induction group was zzso significantly higher than that of the 37 degrees C group zzso P zzso zzso 

Low temperature zzso induction enhances the expression and zzso of zzso in zzso cells zzso by zzso and zzso the growth of zzso zzso zzso
