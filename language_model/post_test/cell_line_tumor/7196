zzso cells represent a distinct lineage of T cells that zzso a zzso zzso T cell zzso zzso and natural killer zzso zzso Although the zzso of zzso cells is characteristically zzso to zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso for these cells have not been zzso We show that a zzso zzso of previously unknown function, zzso zzso is recognized both by mouse and human zzso zzso zzso generation of zzso zzso in mice lacking zzso b results in severe zzso cell zzso suggesting that this zzso also mediates development of zzso cells in the zzso We suggest that expression of zzso in peripheral zzso may be involved in controlling zzso cell responses to infections and zzso and in zzso
