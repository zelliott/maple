The zzso zzso of the rat pancreatic zzso zzso expresses a set of membrane zzso the combination of which has not been detected on zzso tumor zzso zzso it became of interest whether these molecules function independently or may associate and exert specialized functions as membrane zzso zzso of zzso containing membrane complexes in mild zzso revealed an association with the zzso zzso zzso I, zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso associate selectively with zzso zzso zzso but not with the zzso standard zzso zzso The complexes are found in zzso membrane zzso zzso which are dissolved by stringent detergents, but the complexes are not destroyed by zzso zzso treatment, which implies that complex formation does not depend on a zzso zzso However, a zzso impact on zzso and zzso zzso as well as on resistance towards zzso essentially depended on the location in zzso Thus, zzso functions may well be brought about by complex formation of zzso with zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso Because zzso zzso functions strictly depended on the zzso zzso zzso or zzso molecules zzso with the complex are likely located in zzso
