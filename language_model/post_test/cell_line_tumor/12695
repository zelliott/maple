To construct zzso zzso zzso and to evaluate the effect of zzso on the proliferation and zzso of gastric cancer zzso cells in zzso 

Full sequence of zzso zzso was amplified from normal gastric tissue samples by zzso and cloned into zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso were performed to detect expression levels of zzso in zzso zzso The effects of zzso zzso on cell proliferation was measured by zzso zzso and zzso was detected by flow zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was successfully zzso The expressions of zzso in zzso cells, including zzso and protein levels, were significantly increased after stable zzso which resulted in cell proliferation and zzso effect induced by zzso 

The zzso of zzso can promote cell proliferation and reduce cell zzso when induced by zzso in gastric cancer zzso
