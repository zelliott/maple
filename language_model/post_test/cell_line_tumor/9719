zzso is a prostate tumor zzso belonging to the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso family members often possess a stretch of zzso zzso enriched in zzso zzso zzso the zzso domain zzso in the flexible, zzso region zzso to the zzso zzso between the zzso region of zzso and its zzso affect protein stability and DNA zzso CD zzso measuring the zzso unfolding of zzso zzso showed a 2 degrees C zzso stabilization of the HD by the zzso region containing the zzso domain zzso zzso CD of zzso of various zzso peptides with a construct containing just the HD showed that the zzso domain and the following region, the zzso interacting zzso motif zzso zzso was necessary for this zzso zzso of the zzso domain is known to slow zzso degradation of zzso in prostate cells, and zzso zzso was used to measure and map the interaction of the HD with zzso and zzso forms of the zzso zzso The interaction with the zzso zzso zzso was considerably stronger zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in large chemical shift zzso for zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso as well as a 2 degrees C increase in the HD zzso stability compared to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso site zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso were 4 degrees C more stable than HD zzso Using zzso theory, effective zzso for interactions between zzso connected by flexible zzso are predicted to be in the zzso range, and thus, the weak zzso interactions observed here could conceivably zzso or compete with stronger, zzso interactions with the zzso zzso
