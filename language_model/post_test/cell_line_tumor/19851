zzso or zzso inflammation plays a role in the development of many types of cancer including prostate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a small zzso protein of zzso zzso Recently, it has been shown that normal prostate zzso zzso cells produce lower amounts of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and higher amounts of zzso zzso zzso zzso as compared to prostate cancer cells zzso and zzso zzso we studied the effects of zzso of zzso in human prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso with zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels were determined by zzso conventional and quantitative real-time zzso and zzso cell sorting zzso The expression of zzso was markedly enhanced in the zzso cells at zzso and protein levels in the zzso zzso of zzso inhibited cell proliferation of the zzso cells by zzso in zzso medium zzso zzso in zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso zzso expression was significantly induced by the zzso of zzso as determined by zzso and zzso These results indicated that zzso inhibited zzso cell proliferation and decreased zzso production by zzso of zzso zzso zzso may be potentially useful in the treatment of prostate zzso
