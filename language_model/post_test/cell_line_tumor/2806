During last few decades a considerable number of data has emerged supporting the hypothesis that central nervous system might monitor and zzso tumor zzso This assumption is based on two facts: zzso immune system plays a crucial role in the development and progression of zzso zzso immune and nervous systems communicate tightly and zzso The aim of present study was to zzso whether tumor growth may induce zzso changes in brain structures that are involved in the response to immune zzso 

Using zzso zzso we investigated whether the advanced stage of cancer, induced by a single zzso injection of zzso zzso cells to male zzso rats, could activate zzso expression in the nucleus of the solitary tract zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and also activate some of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso cell groups and zzso zzso zzso 

Twenty eight days after the initiation of tumor process we found increased zzso expression in zzso A1 zzso cells, zzso as well as in the zzso zzso zzso and accessory zzso zzso These structures are involved in the transmission of signals related to immune challenges within the brain and zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

The data obtained are supporting the view that the information on peripheral tumor development might be transmitted to the zzso However, further studies are necessary to be performed to reveal whether our findings can be attributed to specific effect of cancer or whether observed changes in the activity of zzso and zzso zzso zzso processes that only accompany the cancer zzso
