zzso zzso is widely zzso in the clinical treatment of many forms of zzso However, the drug has a short plasma zzso and causes toxic effects on normal zzso zzso zzso with carriers is a possible way to alter these zzso zzso Our aim was to zzso zzso zzso zzso using carriers with molecular weights zzso ranging from 10 zzso to 500 zzso Their in zzso and in zzso properties were compared with free zzso The in zzso studies revealed that zzso zzso had zzso to zzso lower zzso effects against zzso cell lines compared to free zzso There was a negative relationship between the zzso of the carrier and the zzso effect of the respective zzso The data obtained in a mouse leukemia zzso in zzso model suggested that a lower in zzso zzso effect of the zzso does not result in diminished zzso activity in zzso The toxicity of the zzso was greater in comparison with the parent drug and tended to rise with increasing zzso However, no superiority over free zzso in terms of an zzso effect was zzso In particular, the zzso zzso based on the zzso with zzso 10 zzso showed a comparable zzso effect with an even lower toxicity than that of free zzso The data suggest that at least the toxicity of zzso is dependent on the zzso of the zzso This fact should be taken into account when designing new zzso zzso zzso
