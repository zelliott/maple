zzso of zzso isolated from zzso zzso strain zzso zzso bacteria by zzso at 30 W during 2 h are tested for magnetic zzso treatment of zzso These chains are composed of zzso which are bound to each other by a filament made of zzso When they are incubated in the presence of cancer cells and exposed to an alternating magnetic field of frequency 198 zzso and average magnetic field strength of 20 or 30 zzso they produce efficient zzso of cancer cell zzso This behavior is explained by a high cellular zzso a good stability in solution and a zzso distribution of the zzso zzso which enables efficient zzso When the chains are heated during 5 h at zzso in the presence of zzso zzso the filament binding the zzso together is zzso and individual zzso are zzso By contrast to the chains of zzso the individual zzso are prone to zzso are not stable in solution and do not produce efficient zzso of cancer cell proliferation under application of an alternating magnetic zzso
