The zzso zzso zzso zzso are members of the zzso protein zzso family and have been implicated in zzso One zzso in particular, zzso has been shown to be frequently activated in primary brain tumors, to enhance several zzso zzso and to increase tumor formation in zzso As zzso is frequently activated in zzso cell lung zzso zzso we investigated the role of the zzso zzso in zzso formation by examining its expression in primary tumors and by modulating its expression in cultured cell zzso We discovered that zzso of the tested primary zzso tumors had zzso higher zzso protein and two- to zzso higher zzso zzso expression than normal lung control zzso To determine the importance of zzso in zzso zzso we reduced zzso expression in multiple zzso cell lines using short hairpin zzso Cell lines deficient in zzso had decreased cellular growth and zzso growth, and the tumors were zzso smaller in zzso To zzso the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso growth, we analyzed the zzso zzso signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso Our data demonstrates for the first time that zzso can regulate the zzso activity of zzso by zzso the zzso zzso thereby regulating the expression of zzso zzso such as zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso or zzso restored the zzso of the zzso cells, demonstrating that zzso is important for zzso zzso Our studies reveal a novel mechanism in which zzso of zzso is zzso by a zzso active zzso zzso zzso
