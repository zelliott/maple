zzso zzso formed with zzso DNA zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit effective zzso escaping properties based on zzso of zzso side chains with decreasing zzso which improves their zzso efficiency and thus are promising candidates for local in zzso gene zzso Here, zzso zzso zzso were further improved as in zzso systemic zzso by introduction of cholesterol zzso into the zzso of zzso to obtain zzso Introduction of the cholesterol resulted in enhanced association of block zzso with zzso which led to increased stability in zzso medium and also in the blood stream after systemic injection compared to zzso zzso The synergistic effect between enhanced zzso association with zzso and increased zzso stability of zzso zzso zzso led to high in zzso gene transfer even at relatively low zzso due to efficient cellular zzso and effective zzso escape of block zzso and zzso Finally, zzso zzso achieved significant suppression of tumor growth following intravenous injection into mice bearing a subcutaneous pancreatic tumor using therapeutic zzso zzso an zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso can be effective systemic gene zzso for treatment of solid zzso
