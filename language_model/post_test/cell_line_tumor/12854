zzso of action and resistance of zzso zzso zzso zzso are not well zzso A gene expression analysis performed in a phase 1 trial of zzso in leukemia indicated that zzso of genes involved in zzso defense was associated with clinical zzso We hypothesized that zzso mechanisms may be involved in resistance to zzso therapy in zzso Here we confirmed zzso of a series of antioxidants in a zzso leukemia cell line zzso zzso induced zzso oxygen species zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in leukemia zzso An increase in zzso resulted in zzso of nuclear factor zzso factor 2 from zzso to nucleus, leading to zzso of zzso zzso including a majority of zzso zzso as a cellular protective zzso zzso of zzso zzso a natural compound capable of depleting cellular zzso significantly enhanced the zzso of zzso in leukemia cell lines and primary leukemia cells by zzso the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso plays an important role in action of zzso and that combination with a zzso compound increases sensitivity to zzso and also overcomes zzso zzso Such a combination strategy may be an effective therapeutic regimen and have potential clinical application in zzso
