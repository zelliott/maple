The aim of the present study was to investigate the reversing effect of zzso A zzso on zzso zzso zzso resistance zzso in human breast zzso zzso zzso 

After zzso drugs zzso or zzso used alone or in combination with zzso cell proliferation was evaluated by zzso zzso zzso and cell cycle distribution by flow zzso zzso was used to detect zzso gene zzso and the Western zzso zzso was used to assess zzso expression and the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was detected by terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso function was evaluated by the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso detected by flow zzso 

We found the zzso doses of LA significantly enhanced zzso or zzso induced zzso arrest and zzso These effects were consistent with the ability of LA to inhibit zzso zzso Moreover, LA dramatically enhanced the zzso zzso ability to reverse drug zzso 

LA has the potential to be developed as a novel zzso zzso Furthermore, the combination of LA and zzso might represent a more sufficient but less toxic zzso zzso
