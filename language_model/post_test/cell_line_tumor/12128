zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein that regulates the potent zzso and zzso effects of zzso and zzso and exerts zzso independent of modulating zzso zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that in solution, zzso binds constituent proteins of the zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and collagen and is present in zzso deposited by zzso in zzso however, binding of zzso to zzso has not been zzso nor has its function in this environment been zzso In this study, we show that zzso binds to zzso deposited by human breast zzso and cancer cells and zzso human zzso zzso and zzso blocked binding of zzso to zzso when added with the binding protein but were unable to zzso zzso already bound to the zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso with approximately zzso reduced affinity compared with zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso basic domain of zzso zzso resulted in markedly reduced binding to zzso compared with zzso zzso whereas zzso of the adjacent consensus zzso domain zzso had relatively little zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso of breast zzso cells was increased by approximately zzso and zzso of the signaling zzso intermediate zzso zzso was enhanced greater than zzso These results indicate a previously zzso and potentially important role for zzso in the zzso zzso
