zzso of prostate cancer zzso relies on zzso zzso zzso zzso but zzso events that zzso the lethal zzso remain zzso Recently, an indirect mechanism of zzso action in which effects of zzso on zzso cells are zzso by zzso Response Factor zzso has been zzso This is the first mode of zzso action to be associated with aggressive zzso and disease zzso The manner in which zzso zzso activity controls aggressive zzso cell behavior is zzso Here, the contribution of two representative zzso zzso genes that are zzso zzso 2 zzso or zzso zzso 1 zzso in clinical zzso specimens is zzso zzso and zzso dependency of zzso and zzso expression was verified using synthetic and natural zzso zzso and small interfering zzso targeting zzso or zzso and evaluating the zzso of zzso induction and zzso binding to zzso and zzso expressed regulatory gene regions in zzso zzso model systems that mimic the transition from zzso to zzso zzso Small interfering zzso deregulation of zzso or zzso expression did not affect zzso cell proliferation or zzso but had marked effects on zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso Loss of zzso induced cellular zzso and increased zzso cell migration, whereas zzso of zzso led to cell zzso and blunted zzso cell zzso Changes in cell migration did not involve zzso transition but correlated with altered zzso zzso Taken together, individual zzso zzso target genes affect zzso cell behavior by modulating cell migration, which may have implications for therapeutic intervention downstream of zzso and zzso
