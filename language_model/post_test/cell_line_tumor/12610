zzso zzso lack adequate zzso and it has been long established that zzso commonly exhibit zzso and that zzso is a factor contributing towards resistance to zzso To develop computer models and make predictions about the affects of zzso zzso on treatment outcome, quantitative zzso zzso and zzso data from in zzso systems is zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the timing and degree of zzso during zzso in a human head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso mouse model zzso Mice were zzso using a novel restraining system and exposed zzso in 3 or 5 zzso zzso up to a maximum of 40 zzso zzso pressures of oxygen zzso zzso were recorded at six time points throughout the 2 week course of zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso receiving zzso zzso did not exhibit an increase in zzso However, the mean zzso after 2 weeks of accelerated zzso zzso (40 zzso was significantly increased ( zzso compared to the mean zzso of zzso not receiving the full schedule zzso zzso These results lead to the conclusion of an average zzso onset time of 2 weeks in this group of zzso A relatively large range of zzso values measured at each dose point in the study indicate a large zzso variation in zzso among the zzso Data from this experimental work will be used to define the range of zzso onset times implemented in a zzso Carlo computer model, simulating hypoxic head and neck cancer growth and zzso
