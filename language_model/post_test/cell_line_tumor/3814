zzso a potential zzso agent against solid tumors has been restricted from its oral use due to poor water zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso The present study was aimed to improve the oral zzso of zzso through development of zzso zzso consisting of zzso 90 as internal phase with zzso 20 as zzso with water as an external zzso zzso were selected from the zzso region of zzso phase zzso formulated by zzso zzso zzso The developed zzso has been characterized by its zzso stability, zzso zzso size, zzso potential, zzso where in zzso release was evaluated through zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso stability with low zzso zzso oil droplets in water with low zzso zzso The shelf life of the zzso zzso was found to be approximately zzso zzso Increased zzso through the zzso cell zzso and decreased zzso is great advantageous for zzso zzso The effects of zzso zzso on breast cancer cell zzso zzso and DNA fragmentation were analyzed in zzso which showed significant zzso and decreased zzso values in zzso group which may be due to enhanced zzso of zzso through the oil zzso Moreover, the absolute oral zzso and sustained release profile of the zzso zzso evaluated in mouse model was found to improve up to zzso The concentration of zzso in mice plasma was determined by our validated zzso zzso By reviewing the significant outcome of the present investigation based on stability study, zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso profile it may be concluded that the oral zzso has got encouraging advantages over the presently available zzso of this zzso zzso zzso
