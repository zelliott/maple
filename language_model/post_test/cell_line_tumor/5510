zzso zzso is a key zzso for collagen on the zzso zzso It is a member of the zzso zzso and is uniquely expressed on the surface of zzso where it is assembled with the zzso zzso zzso motif zzso zzso We have previously reported the generation of a zzso model of zzso zzso that revealed profound defects in zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso following zzso to zzso Beyond the zzso zzso zzso receptors are emerging as significant participants in zzso and zzso 

In the current study, we have evaluated a role for zzso zzso in primary tumor growth and experimental zzso 

zzso tumor induction and experimental zzso zzso were performed using zzso zzso animals and tumor cells derived from the zzso mouse strain in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Using either a Lewis lung zzso zzso or melanoma zzso cell line, we observed an approximately 50% reduction in the number of visible tumor zzso in zzso mice as compared with control zzso zzso Additional studies were performed to compare the size of zzso implanted tumor cells, that is, primary tumor zzso Here, we observed no noticeable size difference when comparing the presence or absence of zzso zzso 

The results demonstrate that the presence of zzso zzso zzso experimental tumor zzso but does not contribute to the growth of primary zzso
