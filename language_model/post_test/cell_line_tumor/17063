The zzso at zzso spans the zzso gene and is one of the most highly expressed common fragile sites observed when DNA replication is zzso by zzso Several lines of evidence suggest that fragile sites are regions of DNA that are unusually sensitive to interference during zzso We have determined that the zzso zzso replicate in a zzso fashion and that replication of these sequences occurs primarily in late S phase extending into zzso zzso Exposure to zzso an inhibitor of DNA zzso zzso results in a modest increase in cells with replication of zzso sequences in early S zzso This may represent initiation of replication in early S phase coupled with slow replication zzso or, zzso these cells may have passed through zzso entered the zzso phase of the next cell cycle, and initiated zzso Our results support a model in which common fragile sites are sequences that may initiate replication in zzso S phase but are slow to complete zzso and the zzso breaks and gaps observed in zzso cells result from zzso zzso
