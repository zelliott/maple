To evaluate the potential of zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso cancer cell targeting and zzso 

PA was incorporated in zzso zzso zzso zzso at varying zzso The zzso were evaluated for PA content by zzso A stable zzso was selected based on size and zzso potential zzso A zzso of cancer cells and zzso zzso cells was used to determine the specificity of PA zzso zzso In zzso zzso of the zzso zzso towards various cancer cell lines was investigated using a cell viability zzso To zzso the mechanism of action of cell death in zzso the effect of various zzso zzso and metal zzso on zzso zzso was zzso The in zzso zzso activity of PA zzso was studied in female zzso mice bearing a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

PA zzso associated zzso with various cancer cells compared to zzso cells in zzso PA zzso exhibited zzso activity in cancer cell lines both in zzso and in zzso The mechanism of cell death was due primarily to generation of zzso oxygen species zzso 

The zzso activity of PA zzso associated with its enhanced cancer cell binding and subsequent generation of zzso
