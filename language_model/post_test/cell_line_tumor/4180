zzso serum zzso zzso levels may be correlated with a zzso expression pattern in parental tumor tissue and reflect the clinical evolution of zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso is associated with the acquisition of zzso characteristics zzso tumor cell zzso migration, invasion, zzso and zzso thus, we determined their utility as serum zzso for aggressive breast cancer zzso or zzso zzso and inflammatory breast cancer zzso 

In this prospective study, we measured zzso zzso and zzso levels using quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction in the serum of 113 breast cancer patients and determined their association with zzso factors and clinical zzso Thirty healthy donors with no history of cancer were enrolled as zzso 

Patients with zzso zzso breast cancer had higher serum zzso median levels than patients with zzso zzso disease zzso whereas patients with zzso zzso breast cancer had higher serum zzso median levels than patients with zzso zzso disease zzso There were no significant differences in serum zzso median levels between zzso and zzso groups, regardless of the presence of zzso High serum zzso levels were associated with zzso zzso Patients with zzso zzso had significantly higher serum zzso median levels than patients with zzso zzso zzso Finally, high serum zzso levels were associated with longer zzso survival time zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and longer overall survival time zzso not reached zzso zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso 

High levels of zzso and zzso were present in the serum of patients with zzso and zzso zzso breast cancer, zzso High levels of serum zzso may represent a zzso for zzso that is zzso for favorable clinical outcome in patients with zzso zzso zzso
