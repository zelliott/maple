zzso of zzso nuclear zzso zzso is significantly zzso in zzso clear cell zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso however, remains zzso It has been recognized that zzso of specific gene promoters is involved in zzso gene expression in zzso In the present study, zzso zzso were examined whether there was a correlation between the zzso and expression status of zzso using combined zzso restriction analysis zzso zzso and zzso In 2 CCC cell lines, zzso of zzso zzso island strongly correlated with zzso zzso at both the zzso and protein zzso In archival surgical zzso 20 of 20 zzso were zzso positive for zzso whereas none of 20 zzso zzso zzso or 12 normal zzso were positive for zzso By zzso zzso of zzso zzso island was less frequently detected in zzso (8 of 20, zzso than zzso (18 of 20, zzso or normal zzso (12 of 12, zzso zzso zzso zzso which was confirmed by zzso In addition, zzso zzso correlated with a high zzso zzso score in zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso of the zzso zzso island zzso in the zzso zzso in zzso zzso
