Human male germ cell tumors zzso arise from zzso primordial germ cells zzso a stage in which extensive zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit zzso and are highly sensitive to zzso zzso The molecular basis of germ cell zzso zzso zzso and exquisite treatment response is poorly zzso 

To assess the role and mechanism of promoter zzso we analyzed zzso islands of 21 gene promoters by zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We found zzso of the zzso demonstrating zzso in one or more gene promoters whereas zzso showed a zzso of zzso therefore identifying distinct zzso patterns in the two major zzso of zzso DNA repair genes zzso zzso and zzso and a zzso zzso gene zzso were frequently zzso in the zzso The promoter zzso was associated with gene zzso in most zzso zzso and zzso of gene expression occurred upon treatment with zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso 

Our results, therefore, suggest a potential role for zzso modification of critical tumor zzso genes in pathways relevant to zzso zzso zzso and treatment zzso
