zzso zzso has an extremely poor zzso The use of appropriate in zzso models is essential in devising methods to improve treatment zzso 

A pancreatic zzso model based on tumor injection into the pancreatic head was compared with a pancreatic tail injection model in zzso zzso The zzso pancreatic zzso cell line zzso dispersed in zzso was used for tumor zzso 

zzso developed in all animals in both zzso zzso size was more consistent within the pancreatic tail group at 20 days following zzso with no evidence of zzso zzso Animals in the pancreatic head injection group showed signs of reduced health by 20 days following injection and developed zzso zzso liver zzso were noted in some of these animals at this time zzso The overall survival of animals at 40 days following tumor induction was significantly lower in the pancreatic head injection group zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Multiple liver zzso were noted in five of 10 zzso animals in the head injection group, without evidence of zzso zzso In the pancreatic tail injection group, 18 of 20 zzso animals had multiple zzso zzso and nine of 20 zzso animals had evidence of isolated liver zzso zzso in both regions of the zzso had similar zzso zzso with a dense zzso zzso at the interface between the tumor and the normal zzso 

zzso head and tail zzso cancer models produce consistent tumors, but the patterns of tumor spread and survival differ according to the site of zzso
