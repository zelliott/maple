Using zzso and zzso zzso methods, quantitative cellular zzso of zzso an zzso and zzso agent from zzso zzso was calculated in two types of normal zzso zzso zzso and zzso and two tumor cell zzso zzso and zzso Both the zzso and zzso intensity of zzso were significantly higher in tumor cells compared to the normal zzso A linear dependency on the zzso was observed with treatment concentration of zzso Using laser zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was monitored and the results indicated that zzso is located both in the cell membrane and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells supported the differential distribution of zzso in zzso zzso and nuclear compartments of cell with maximum zzso in the zzso zzso studies in different cell lines indicated that the toxicity of zzso increased with increasing zzso
