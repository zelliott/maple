zzso zzso is a member of the natural zzso zzso zzso family that is expressed on activated human zzso zzso We dissected structural attributes of zzso to determine their contributions to zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that surface expression and zzso cell zzso by zzso is zzso through zzso association with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Physical linkage to zzso requires zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso domain of zzso also contains a sequence that matches the zzso zzso zzso motif zzso zzso By expressing a zzso zzso in an zzso cell line, we found that this zzso motif from zzso lacks zzso capacity in a redirected zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was efficiently zzso in the zzso zzso upon treating the cells with zzso but it was unable to recruit zzso negative zzso zzso We also generated zzso cell lines expressing zzso zzso or zzso to zzso zzso zzso versions of zzso and compared their capacities to induce zzso marker zzso promote zzso production, or stimulate target cell zzso We did not detect any zzso reduction or enhancement of zzso cell zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, the zzso zzso sequence did not provide a zzso site for the zzso zzso zzso nor did it zzso zzso zzso In zzso all zzso properties and surface expression of zzso are zzso through its association with zzso and the putative zzso in the zzso zzso domain does not appear to zzso zzso zzso
