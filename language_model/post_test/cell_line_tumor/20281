Emerging evidence demonstrates that cancer stem cells zzso are the critical drivers of tumor progression and zzso The zzso zzso may play a crucial role in zzso zzso of cancer by regulating zzso A previous study showed that zzso and zzso play an important role in regulating bone zzso of prostate cancer zzso but the exact mechanism of regulation of bone zzso of zzso is not fully zzso In this study, we found that zzso of zzso and zzso inhibited the cell viability and colony formation of zzso cells from zzso bone zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso suppressed tumor sphere formation and expression of zzso markers and zzso factors including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The study further found that zzso and zzso inhibit bone invasion and zzso of zzso cells in zzso zzso these findings demonstrate that zzso and zzso inhibit zzso properties of zzso cells and suggest that zzso and zzso may play a significant role in the bone zzso progression of zzso by regulating zzso zzso
