Administration of expanded zzso zzso in association with zzso chemotherapy is effective in some patients with advanced zzso zzso However, obtaining zzso and subsequent expansion is labor zzso making it zzso for broad clinical zzso zzso transplantation may have zzso efficacy because of a graft zzso tumor zzso The disappointing tumor control observed zzso suggests that adoptive zzso using zzso cells will be essential for sustained zzso 

zzso cell lines were grown from two patients with advanced zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression was obtained in the tumor lines using a zzso zzso for gene zzso zzso melanoma and controls were cultured with zzso cells from zzso sibling zzso 

zzso of zzso and zzso particularly the former, promoted marked expansion of zzso from zzso sibling zzso zzso of up to zzso after 4 weeks of culture was zzso zzso from cultures zzso with zzso demonstrated zzso against zzso melanoma zzso specific zzso at an zzso ratio of zzso Although expanded zzso were predominantly zzso zzso was greatest in the zzso smaller zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso (but not zzso on exposure to zzso zzso melanoma zzso 

Our strategy generates a large number of zzso zzso from zzso siblings using a zzso culture zzso zzso expanded in this way offer an alternative to zzso zzso for zzso cellular zzso after stem cell transplantation in young zzso
