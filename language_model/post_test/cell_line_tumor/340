zzso treatment has previously been reported to promote the differentiation of zzso cells probably through the production of zzso zzso resulting in the enhancement of zzso zzso zzso factor zzso gene zzso which is considered to contribute to the survival, zzso and plasticity of zzso cells in the brain and hence has been suggested to improve mood disorders and other symptoms in depressive zzso Based on these previous zzso the effects on zzso cells of zzso zzso zzso zzso which are known as agents promoting cell zzso were examined using rat zzso zzso cells as a model for in zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso sodium zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso gene zzso and their zzso effects on zzso gene expression were inhibited by treatment of these cells with zzso an inhibitor of the zzso producing zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso gene zzso the enhancement of which could be abolished by the zzso of zzso zzso production in the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso may be able to promote the differentiation of rat zzso zzso cells through the production of zzso zzso resulting in the enhancement of zzso zzso gene expression as a consequence of promoting their zzso indicating the possibility that differentiated zzso cells may be implicated in preserving the integrity of neural networks as well as improving the function of zzso cells in the zzso
