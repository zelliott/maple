We developed an zzso strategy that zzso gene expression and clinical outcomes as a means to identify novel candidate zzso operative in breast zzso This analysis, followed by functional zzso resulted in the identification of zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso protein as a novel driver of zzso properties in breast zzso 

Through zzso zzso Cox zzso hazards zzso was used to analyze the correlation between gene expression and distant zzso survival zzso of patients in 14 independent breast cancer zzso zzso emerged as a top candidate gene robustly associated with poor patient zzso zzso zzso zzso and forced zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso molecular mechanisms of zzso action in breast cancer progression and shed light on the clinical breast cancer zzso relevant to zzso zzso 

zzso was expressed at highest levels in tumors associated with worse zzso including zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso B zzso High nuclear zzso protein was associated with zzso zzso advanced grade, and poor differentiation in tissue zzso zzso of zzso patients that received zzso zzso indicated that zzso is zzso of poor outcome in zzso zzso In breast cancer cell lines, loss of zzso consistently resulted in suppressed proliferation but not zzso whereas forced stable zzso increased zzso In addition, zzso of zzso in invasive cell lines, such as zzso decreased zzso and invasion, whereas zzso in zzso cells slightly promoted zzso but did not zzso invasive zzso zzso analysis showed that the most significant zzso changes occurred in zzso genes and genes of the zzso zzso zzso High proliferation was characterized by zzso high zzso E protein zzso The inverse relation of zzso expression with zzso could be zzso to the breast cancer zzso suggesting that zzso may affect similar pathways in primary breast zzso 

zzso is a novel zzso of tumor aggressiveness with functional implications in breast cancer growth and zzso
