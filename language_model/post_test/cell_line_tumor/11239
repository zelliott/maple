Since zzso could be zzso by cells naturally and target at a specific cellular location as zzso the extraction of zzso proteins from living cells for large-scale analysis by zzso seems to be zzso zzso zzso acid associated proteins zzso take the crucial position during biological processes in maintaining and regulating gene structure and gene related behaviors, yet there are still challenges during the global investigation of zzso zzso especially from living zzso In this work, a strategy to extract zzso proteins from living cells with the magnetic carbon zzso zzso as an zzso probe is developed, to achieve the high zzso analysis of zzso from living human zzso zzso cells with a mass zzso zzso zzso Due to the specific zzso zzso of the magnetic carbon zzso around zzso and its strong interaction with zzso zzso the highly efficient extraction was realized for cellular zzso from living cells, with the capability of identifying zzso zzso zzso from only zzso 10,000 living zzso This method exhibited potential applications in dynamic and in zzso analysis of zzso zzso
