zzso zzso zzso mediate changes in zzso zzso and are important in the regulation of gene zzso zzso are involved in cell cycle progression and zzso and their deregulation is associated with several zzso zzso zzso have emerged recently as promising zzso zzso One such agent, zzso zzso acid, is a potent inhibitor of zzso that causes growth arrest, zzso and/or zzso of many tumor types in zzso and in zzso Because of its low zzso zzso zzso acid is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of zzso zzso zzso induce the expression of zzso of genes in cultured zzso In this study, we show that low zzso zzso of zzso zzso acid induce the expression of zzso in human zzso cancer zzso The expression of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso increase in zzso acid levels, growth zzso zzso and zzso observed with these zzso Furthermore, specific zzso of zzso significantly reduced the zzso zzso zzso zzso These novel findings are the first demonstration of a zzso link between the induction of zzso by a zzso inhibitor and zzso in cancer zzso This result has important implications for the study of zzso zzso acid and other zzso zzso in the prevention and therapy of zzso cancer and supports future investigations of the mechanisms by which zzso zzso zzso zzso
