The ability of zzso zzso to invade zzso zzso is a major zzso zzso of this zzso however, the mechanism of invasion is not understood in zzso zzso breakdown of zzso the major protein in zzso cell zzso has been proposed as a mechanism of invasion of certain bacteria in the oral zzso The objectives of this study were zzso to assess whether zzso zzso degrades zzso expressed by oral zzso cells in zzso zzso to compare the abilities of strains with different invasive zzso to degrade this zzso and zzso to investigate zzso zzso factors responsible for zzso zzso We found that while zzso gene expression was not altered, zzso was zzso zzso during the interaction of oral zzso cells with zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso degradation of zzso was completely inhibited in the presence of zzso zzso Using a three-dimensional model of the human oral zzso we found that zzso was zzso in localized areas of tissue invasion by zzso zzso An zzso zzso strain was deficient in degradation of zzso and this finding suggested that zzso may depend on zzso for zzso Indeed, reverse zzso data indicated that expression of the zzso zzso and zzso genes is severely reduced in the zzso zzso These zzso genes are functional zzso targets, because engineered expression of zzso in the zzso strain restored zzso degradation and invasion in the zzso zzso Our data support the hypothesis that there is a mechanism by which zzso zzso invades zzso zzso by promoting the zzso degradation of zzso in zzso zzso zzso
