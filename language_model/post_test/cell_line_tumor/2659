zzso approaches using zzso and zzso cells are under constant scrutiny to design novel therapies for the treatment of zzso These strategies are hampered by the lack of efficient and economical large-scale production methods for zzso zzso Here we describe the propagation of large amounts of a unique population of zzso zzso T cells, which we termed tumor killer T cells zzso because of their potent and broad zzso cell zzso With this zzso strategy, zzso from peripheral blood zzso cells are generated within a short period of time using a pulse with a stimulating cell line followed by continuous growth in zzso medium supplemented with a mixture of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and functional profiling did not allow a zzso of zzso to any thus far defined zzso of T zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso kill a panel of tumor targets of diverse tissue origin while leaving normal cells zzso zzso experiments revealed that zzso killing was, to a significant extent, zzso by tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso and was independent of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso have a high potential as a novel tool in the adoptive zzso of zzso
