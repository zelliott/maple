zzso function of a novel zzso protein was examined by using the zzso zzso zzso zzso because it was originally cloned due to its ability to bind zzso a zzso of zzso zzso of which zzso is the other zzso In a zzso experiment, zzso was shown to increase the zzso zzso activity due to its zzso sites, as verified by both the absence of zzso effect on the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the presence of zzso zzso between zzso and zzso Most significantly, the zzso zzso was shown to be mobilized into the nucleus when it was zzso with the nuclear zzso This mobilized nuclear zzso could then zzso with the nuclear zzso to bind to its target DNA site with a high zzso Furthermore, in our zzso and zzso zzso experiments, zzso was found to be bound to the resulting zzso zzso in a form of zzso complex and to remain in that zzso complex even when zzso bound to its target DNA site such as zzso zzso
