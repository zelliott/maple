A new tool for DNA transfer to fish cell lines such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and rainbow trout zzso zzso has been zzso by testing commercially available zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso zzso zzso were selected amongst the most active and then low toxicity zzso zzso zzso around 15 zzso were obtained by gel zzso zzso to increase zzso their initial in zzso zzso zzso The zzso and plasmids coding for reporter genes were first used to zzso variable values for best expression by zzso with zzso low toxicity zzso while both zzso and a zzso coding for the zzso G gene of the fish zzso viral zzso zzso virus zzso were then used to demonstrate some of their practical zzso Due to its relatively low price, defined chemical composition and zzso low toxicity zzso zzso might be used for numerous applications for all those studying fish cell zzso in zzso as well as in zzso
