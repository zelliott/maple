zzso is a key process in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso checkpoint proteins has been implicated as a cause of zzso in zzso We have previously reported that zzso a member of the zzso modifier family of zzso is zzso in several gastrointestinal and zzso zzso Here we show that zzso interacts with zzso a zzso checkpoint zzso during zzso zzso we show that zzso of zzso at the zzso during the zzso stage of the cell cycle was greatly reduced in zzso zzso Furthermore, compared with parental zzso cells, fewer zzso cells were observed after double zzso zzso cells were released into zzso for more than 4 zzso Nonetheless, when these double zzso cells were released into media, a similar number of zzso parental and zzso zzso cells was observed throughout the zzso time zzso Additionally, more zzso zzso cells escape zzso controls and are zzso compared with parental zzso zzso we observed a higher degree of zzso in zzso number in cells zzso zzso zzso our data suggest that high levels of zzso protein in cells lead to increased zzso zzso and zzso instability, and this effect is zzso by an zzso zzso phase and the reduction in the zzso zzso of zzso during the zzso stage of the cell zzso
