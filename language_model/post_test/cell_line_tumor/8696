zzso are specialized plasma membrane zzso implicated in cellular functions such as migration, zzso and zzso zzso and zzso I and transcript release factor zzso are essential for zzso zzso zzso is zzso and zzso in prostate tumors and promotes aggressiveness and zzso In contrast, a lack of zzso expression is reported in prostate cancer, and zzso zzso expression in prostate cancer cells zzso tumor growth and zzso We zzso manipulated zzso expression in three prostate cancer cell lines, namely the zzso positive cells zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso cells, to evaluate zzso and zzso functions of zzso We show that the zzso medium of zzso prostate cancer cells decreases zzso zzso migration and differentiation in zzso and ex zzso This can occur independently from zzso expression and zzso or zzso formation, since the zzso effects of zzso were detected in zzso zzso zzso Additionally, zzso expression in zzso cells significantly decreased blood and zzso vessel zzso in zzso tumors in zzso Our results suggest that the absence of zzso in prostate cancer cells contributes significantly to zzso progression and zzso by promoting the zzso and zzso potential of the cancer cells, and this could be exploited for zzso
