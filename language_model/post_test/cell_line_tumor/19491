To investigate the in zzso expression profile of zzso zzso zzso in normal and zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso 

zzso from zzso zzso of the human zzso tract were zzso for the expression of zzso by zzso zzso expression was strong in zzso zzso zzso pancreatic zzso cells and zzso but generally weak or negative in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was found in a high percentage of zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but rarely in gastric zzso zzso and not at all in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to zzso zzso in zzso SCC and zzso cells, suggesting that zzso expression may be biologically important in some zzso zzso 

Distribution of zzso expression is markedly diverse among zzso of the human zzso zzso The general lack of zzso in zzso contrasts with the high percentage of zzso and zzso expressing zzso and, along with the generation of zzso by zzso warrants prospective study of the effects of steroids on these zzso
