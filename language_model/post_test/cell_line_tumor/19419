The zzso zzso membrane protein 1 zzso of zzso virus zzso without a zzso drives proliferation of zzso B zzso Its levels vary in cells of zzso populations by more than zzso which leads to multiple distinct activities of the zzso At intermediate levels it drives zzso and at high levels it zzso general protein synthesis by inducing zzso of zzso initiation factor zzso zzso We have found that zzso activates zzso to induce zzso of zzso which zzso zzso zzso factor 4 zzso zzso zzso in turn, zzso zzso own zzso zzso activates not only zzso but also zzso requiring zzso 1 zzso and zzso 3 pathways of the unfolded protein response zzso zzso expression levels of zzso induced a zzso increase in zzso activity, as measured by its zzso of zzso These infected B cells zzso zzso independent of the levels of zzso indicating that only a threshold level of zzso is required for the zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso of the zzso is a normal event in a zzso of zzso expression that leads both to zzso and zzso functions and regulates the physiology of zzso B cells in zzso unexpected zzso
