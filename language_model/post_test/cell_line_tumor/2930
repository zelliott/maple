zzso protein zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso signaling pathways that regulate cell fate zzso They generate a wide range of signal zzso including graded and digital zzso In T cells, zzso zzso is digital in response to zzso zzso however, whether other receptors on T cells that lead to zzso zzso are graded or digital is zzso Here we evaluate zzso zzso in T cells at the zzso zzso We show that T cells responded digitally to stimulation with zzso zzso cells, whereas they responded in a graded manner to the zzso zzso demonstrating that the system output of the zzso module is highly plastic and determined by components upstream of the zzso zzso These findings also confirm that different zzso system zzso are used by T cells to control discrete biological zzso zzso proteins are essential for proper zzso signaling and function as they physically assemble multiple components and regulators of zzso zzso We found that the scaffold protein zzso regulated the threshold required for zzso zzso in T cells without affecting the nature of the zzso We conclude that zzso plays a central role in determining the sensitivity of zzso responses and is thus well positioned as a key control zzso
