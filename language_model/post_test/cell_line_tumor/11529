The use of zzso replicating bacteria as zzso agents is one of the innovative approaches for the treatment of zzso The capability of zzso to disperse within tumors and hence to delay tumor growth was zzso when combined with zzso This work is warranted to zzso the underlying mechanism of zzso effects by the combination therapy of zzso and zzso The presence of functional gap junctions is highly relevant for the success of zzso Following zzso treatment, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso 43 zzso expressions were zzso Moreover, zzso significantly enhanced gap zzso communication zzso as revealed by the fluorescent dye scrape loading zzso To study the zzso underlying these zzso effects, we found that zzso induced a significant increase in zzso protein zzso zzso signaling zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was prevented by treatment of cells with the zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor or zzso zzso N terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso had an zzso effect on zzso and resulted in a reduction of cell death after zzso and zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso of zzso in tumor sites leads to increase zzso gap junction communication and enhances the combination of zzso and zzso therapeutic zzso
