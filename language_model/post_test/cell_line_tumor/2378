zzso zzso is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso a zzso zzso that activates zzso The objectives of these studies were to characterize the disposition of zzso in zzso species and to determine the relationship of zzso plasma zzso to efficacy in zzso mouse zzso zzso The clearance zzso of zzso was moderate in mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and monkey zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in dog was low zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The volume of distribution across species was large, zzso to zzso body zzso zzso ranged from 4 to 13 zzso zzso binding in zzso zzso dog, zzso and human was high, with percentage zzso 1 to zzso zzso zzso was rapidly and extensively distributed to zzso however, low zzso were observed in the zzso In rats and dogs, zzso was well absorbed zzso zzso zzso The majority of zzso zzso was recovered in the zzso of rat zzso and dog zzso The zzso and volume of distribution of zzso in human, predicted by zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The predicted zzso was 39 zzso To characterize the relationship between plasma concentration of zzso and tumor growth zzso zzso modeling was applied using an indirect response zzso The zzso value for tumor growth zzso in zzso zzso was estimated to be zzso zzso and the predicted clinical zzso dose was zzso zzso Taken together, these data are useful in assessing the disposition of zzso and where available, comparisons with human data were zzso
