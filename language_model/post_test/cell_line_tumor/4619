zzso cells are known to kill tumor cells and produce zzso zzso that lead to the generation of zzso zzso Many studies have used zzso class zzso tumor cells and/or zzso that induce zzso cell zzso In this study, the focus was on zzso zzso cells that express zzso class I as a model to study zzso cell responses to tumors that do not directly stimulate zzso cell zzso When zzso tumor cells that expressed a truncated version of zzso or zzso cells alone, were injected into mice that were depleted of zzso cells, the mice developed an increased number of zzso zzso increased zzso responses, and a higher amount of zzso presentation in draining zzso compared with mice with intact zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso cells can inhibit the development of effective zzso immunity in the absence of signals that trigger zzso cell zzso
