zzso relationships of zzso peptides mimicking the zzso structure of the zzso zzso at zzso zzso of the zzso zzso are zzso zzso peptides containing the arm head of the zzso loop showed zzso activity toward the zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides containing a zzso sequence of the zzso arm showed clear zzso effects on the zzso in zzso and efficiently suppressed the proliferation of zzso cells, which abundantly express the zzso zzso on their zzso The effects at a specific zzso site of the loop structure were expected to enhance the interactions with the zzso
