zzso the first line zzso of colon cancer, zzso damage to tumors via induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is an important zzso member of zzso family and regulated mainly by zzso Here we investigated the role of zzso in zzso zzso and the potential zzso We showed that zzso zzso expression in a zzso and zzso manner and suppression of zzso expression by stable zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso in colon cancer zzso By zzso the function of zzso we further demonstrated that the induction was zzso We also found that zzso could zzso zzso and suppression of zzso activity by its specific inhibitor zzso and dominant negative zzso zzso enhanced the zzso zzso expression and zzso in a zzso zzso Taken together, our data suggest that zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso and the induction could be both zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso expression and zzso in zzso colon cancer cells could be regulated partly by zzso zzso Identification of the molecular components involved in regulating the cellular sensitivity to zzso may provide potential targets for development of novel compounds that may be useful in enhancement of zzso zzso in zzso deficient colon zzso
