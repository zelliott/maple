The zzso zzso belongs to the family of zzso proteins that function as zzso recognition factors for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso to the zzso complex zzso the zzso of zzso molecules to the bound zzso resulting in zzso and rapid degradation by the 26 S zzso Using zzso as bait in a zzso zzso screen, we have identified zzso as a novel zzso for zzso zzso belongs to the family of zzso zzso and specifically zzso zzso a zzso zzso that is induced by cellular zzso such as type 1 zzso zzso zzso damage, and bacterial zzso zzso was originally identified as an zzso gene in zzso mice expressing an acute zzso leukemia fusion zzso zzso as well as in melanoma cell lines treated with zzso The zzso of zzso knockout mice includes shortened life span, hypersensitivity to zzso and zzso damage, suggesting that tight regulation of zzso zzso is critical for normal cellular zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso is zzso in zzso and accumulates in cells treated with zzso zzso We also show that zzso promotes zzso zzso and degradation, resulting in higher levels of zzso zzso In zzso mouse cells, levels of zzso are consistently zzso whereas levels of zzso zzso are zzso Our results demonstrate that the zzso is involved in controlling zzso protein levels and may therefore play an important role in modulating type 1 zzso zzso
