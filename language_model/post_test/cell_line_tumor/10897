Scientific evidence indicates that zzso zzso in the form of zzso can affect cell zzso zzso of zzso on cell growth depend on several factors including composition of zzso zzso zzso and type of cells zzso Because zzso cells such as zzso and zzso are natural targets of zzso zzso delivery of drugs to zzso cellular activity of these cells is of zzso We explored the effects of zzso zzso composed of soy bean zzso zzso as the main zzso component on zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso lipids and cholesterol were also zzso In addition, we investigated whether zzso zzso would exert any interaction on cell growth with zzso a drug with known zzso zzso We found that PC in the form of zzso zzso had intrinsic zzso activity on zzso cells at zzso of 200 zzso and up without any appreciable zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso at 10 zzso increased growth zzso activity of PC zzso zzso at 30 zzso did not have any effect on cell growth, except for zzso composed of PC and zzso where growth zzso was negated in the presence of zzso zzso effect on cell growth was seen with certain zzso compositions when zzso zzso of zzso was zzso The results of this study suggest that the effects of zzso lipids on cell growth should be taken into consideration when zzso zzso are to be used as drug delivery systems, especially when the targets are cells with zzso zzso
