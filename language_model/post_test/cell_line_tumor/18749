zzso plays a critical role in cell cycle zzso especially at the zzso transition, zzso through its control of several cell cycle regulator zzso The zzso gene is located on a region of zzso zzso that is commonly overrepresented in lung zzso The present study aimed to evaluate zzso abnormalities and their zzso value in zzso cell lung cancer zzso 

In total 16 zzso cell lines and zzso primary tumors were included in studies to measure zzso relative gene copy number, zzso zzso and protein zzso The tumors were also evaluated for zzso protein expression level and zzso zzso These values were correlated with the clinical and pathological features of the zzso 

zzso relative gene copy number aberrations were found in 88 and zzso of zzso cell lines and primary tumors, zzso zzso was especially common among zzso cell zzso zzso Both gene copy overrepresentation zzso and loss zzso were found in zzso zzso relative gene copy number was significantly correlated with zzso and protein levels, but none of these were correlated with zzso protein zzso Neither high zzso protein expression nor zzso zzso was zzso zzso In zzso with zzso zzso however, high zzso protein expression was a significant independent poor zzso zzso 

There appears to be a synergistic interaction between high zzso protein expression and zzso zzso with negative impact on the survival of zzso zzso
