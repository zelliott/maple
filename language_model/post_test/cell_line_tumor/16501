zzso and zzso B are expressed primarily by activated zzso zzso T cells, natural killer cells, and natural killer T zzso and function together to induce zzso of target zzso Typically, these proteins are not expressed in tumor zzso In the present study, we established the zzso expression of zzso and zzso B by the zzso and zzso prostate cancer zzso cell lines with reverse zzso zzso chain reaction, zzso Western zzso or a combination of zzso The combination of radiation and zzso zzso zzso decreased survival of zzso because, at least in part, of increased zzso We further demonstrated that treatment with zzso zzso the expression of both zzso and zzso B, whereas treatment with zzso zzso the expression of zzso B, but not that of zzso Combined zzso treatment of zzso cells further increased the expression of both zzso and zzso B compared with zzso or zzso zzso Thus, increased zzso of prostate cancer cells induced by zzso correlated with zzso of zzso and zzso B, demonstrating a possible mechanism for tumor zzso These findings might be helpful in devising new strategies for treating zzso
