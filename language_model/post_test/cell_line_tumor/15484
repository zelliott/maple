zzso tumors are relatively resistant to treatment due to their zzso nature, drug resistance, and tendency for zzso Recent studies suggest that a zzso of cancer cells is responsible for the zzso zzso These cells are considered as cancer stem cells zzso Although a number of molecules have been identified in different cancer cells as markers for cancer stem cells, no promising markers are currently available for zzso zzso zzso In this study, two clones of zzso cell lines were functionally characterized as control or zzso cells, based on properties including zzso formation, drug resistance, and tumor zzso Furthermore, their protein expression profiles were investigated by zzso tags for relative and absolute zzso zzso and a total of zzso proteins were identified and zzso from the combined zzso 50 proteins exhibited at least zzso differences between these two zzso These 50 proteins were analyzed by zzso and were found to be associated with liver zzso zzso zzso zzso and liver zzso They were also components of zzso zzso immune responses, and zzso zzso Among these zzso the expressions of zzso zzso and zzso were verified in several zzso cell lines, and their expressions were correlated with zzso in zzso cell zzso The functional significance of zzso and zzso were also investigated and zzso
