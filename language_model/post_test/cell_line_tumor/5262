Acquisition of resistance to tamoxifen is a critical therapeutic problem in breast cancer zzso zzso transition zzso where cells undergo a zzso switch from a polarized zzso zzso to a highly zzso zzso zzso is associated with invasion and zzso of cancer zzso Here, we found that zzso zzso cells had undergone zzso as evidenced by zzso cell shape, zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso as well as increased Snail zzso activity and protein zzso Given the roles of zzso zzso zzso zzso and nuclear factor zzso in zzso zzso deregulation during zzso we examined the role of these signaling pathways in the zzso of zzso zzso Both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso reporter activity were increased in zzso cells, as was zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso depleted on zzso ten zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso was zzso in zzso cells, and Snail zzso and the expression of zzso markers could be decreased by zzso zzso zzso These results imply that zzso zzso in zzso cells is involved in the zzso process via zzso and/or zzso Snail zzso and suggest the potential involvement of zzso in zzso during breast cancer zzso
