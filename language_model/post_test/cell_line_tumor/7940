zzso a zzso factor of the basic zzso class, is reported to regulate cancer zzso It is known to induce zzso transition zzso In this study, we evaluated the expression of twist and its effect on cell migration in zzso zzso zzso 

We examined twist expression using zzso in 20 tissue samples of zzso zzso and assessed twist expression in zzso cell lines by zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso twist expression was created by introducing a twist construct in the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso twist expression was blocked by twist zzso in the zzso zzso cell zzso We studied zzso related zzso zzso zzso and zzso by Western zzso zzso Cell proliferation was measured by zzso zzso and cell migration was measured by in zzso wound healing zzso We used zzso zzso zzso to zzso focal zzso 

We detected strong and intermediate twist expression in 7 of 20 tumor samples, and no significant twist expression was found in the zzso zzso zzso In addition, we detected twist expression in zzso zzso and zzso cells, but not in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells demonstrated enhanced cell zzso but twist expression did not affect cell zzso Twist expression induced zzso transition together with related zzso zzso zzso zzso contact was reduced significantly in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells demonstrated a reduction in cell migration by 50, 40 and zzso zzso
