zzso exert many important effects in bone, a tissue that contains both zzso receptors alpha and beta zzso and zzso To compare the actions of these zzso we generated zzso human zzso cells zzso expressing zzso or zzso at levels comparable with those in zzso and we characterized their response to zzso zzso over time using zzso zzso zzso to determine the expression of approximately 12,000 zzso followed by quantitative zzso zzso of the regulation of selected zzso Of the approximately 100 regulated genes we identified, some were zzso by zzso equally through zzso and zzso whereas others were selectively zzso via zzso or zzso The zzso genes showed three distinct zzso patterns of expression over the zzso time course zzso Of the functional categories of the zzso zzso most numerous were those zzso zzso and factors associated with immune response, signal zzso and cell migration and zzso regulation, indicating that zzso can exert effects on multiple pathways in these zzso cell zzso Of note, zzso zzso several genes associated with cell zzso selectively via zzso in keeping with the selective zzso enhancement of the zzso of zzso zzso On genes regulated equally by zzso via zzso or zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression via zzso These studies indicate both common as well as distinct target genes for these two zzso and identify many novel genes not previously known to be under zzso zzso
