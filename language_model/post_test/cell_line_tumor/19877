The zzso zzso protein zzso mediates cellular zzso of various zzso and cellular resistance to heavy zzso Previously we reported that zzso mediates resistance to mercury exposure and possible mechanism zzso zzso expression after mercury zzso This study was designed to investigate the role of zzso oxygen species zzso and zzso on the resistance of zzso cells to zzso zzso The zzso zzso cells zzso cells showed less scavenging activity to zzso induced by mercury while no difference in the zzso zzso levels between zzso and zzso zzso Mercury induced the zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso in zzso zzso The specific inhibitor for zzso zzso and zzso and zzso decreased the production of zzso and therefore resistance of zzso cells against mercury zzso These results suggest that induction of zzso and downstream zzso zzso and zzso were involved in the resistance of cells to mercury by expression zzso in zzso zzso
