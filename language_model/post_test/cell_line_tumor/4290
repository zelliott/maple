zzso clinical resistance to zzso a selective zzso zzso arises frequently after short-term zzso Because inhibitions of targets in the zzso zzso result in zzso zzso arrest, zzso cancer cells are expected to escape this zzso arrest and progress to the subsequent zzso zzso We hypothesized that a combined therapy using zzso with a zzso phase blocking agent will trap resistant cells and overcome zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, we first determined the combination index zzso values of our novel zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso on parental human zzso and zzso melanoma cell lines to be zzso and zzso respectively, suggesting strong zzso for the zzso We then developed an zzso zzso with significant acquired resistance to zzso and confirmed the strong synergistic zzso Next, we studied the potential mechanisms of overcoming zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed that the combination of zzso and zzso zzso arrested cells in the zzso phase, and significantly increased zzso in both parental zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis revealed that the combination treatment effectively reduced the level of zzso and total zzso activated the zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso but had no significant influence on the level of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, in zzso zzso of zzso with zzso showed strong synergistic efficacy in the zzso zzso model in nude zzso Overall, these results offer a rational combination strategy to significantly enhance the therapeutic benefit in patients with melanoma who inevitably become resistant to current zzso zzso
