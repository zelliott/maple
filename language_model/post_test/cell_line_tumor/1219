A high dietary intake of plant foods is thought to contribute to the prevention of zzso zzso in humans and zzso as part of such a diet are considered to contribute to those protective zzso zzso is a major dietary zzso consumed with a diet rich in onions, tea, and zzso We used zzso human colon cancer cells and investigated the effects of zzso on zzso zzso and differentiation as processes shown to be zzso during cancer zzso To identify the cellular targets of zzso action, two-dimensional gel zzso was performed and proteins altered in expression level after zzso exposure of cells were identified by mass zzso of zzso fragments generated by zzso zzso zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso cells with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell differentiation based on surface expression of alkaline zzso was enhanced zzso and the activity of the zzso zzso zzso increased zzso Those effects were associated with the regulation of zzso proteins and zzso shown to both play a crucial role in the process of zzso zzso zzso zzso were found as regulated as well and various proteins involved in zzso metabolism and in gene regulation showed altered zzso expression levels upon zzso treatment of zzso In conclusion, zzso alters the levels of a variety of proteins involved in growth, zzso and zzso of colon cancer zzso Their identification as molecular targets of zzso may explain the zzso activities of this zzso
