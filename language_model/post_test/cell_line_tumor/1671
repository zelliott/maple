zzso a zzso analogue of zzso can act as a zzso of an zzso agent zzso after being zzso by zzso zzso We recently demonstrated that the emulsion containing zzso as an inner oil phase possesses a potent zzso zzso zzso we sought to develop zzso emulsion as a carrier of zzso a zzso soluble drug with zzso zzso Combined treatment of human zzso colon cancer cells with free zzso plus zzso emulsion inhibited the cellular proliferation more effectively than that of each drug alone, suggesting the possibility of zzso emulsion as a potential zzso zzso The mean zzso size of zzso tended to increase as the zzso content in emulsion increases and the concentration of zzso loaded in zzso was affected by zzso content and the initial amount of zzso but not by the total amount of zzso zzso The concentration of zzso required to inhibit the growth of zzso and zzso cancer cells by 50% was zzso and zzso lowered by loading zzso in zzso zzso compared with free zzso These data suggest that the zzso activity of zzso was enhanced by loading in zzso zzso probably due to the zzso capacity and zzso activity of zzso zzso
