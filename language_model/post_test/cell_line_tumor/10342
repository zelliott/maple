zzso zzso was added to zzso zzso zzso and the zzso complexes were zzso by zzso The zzso complexes were then zzso by zzso and diffusion zzso zzso and zzso The amount of drug bound was found to increase in proportion with zzso size: zzso 22 zzso molecules per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 94, which represent only a fraction of the available binding sites on each zzso zzso 58, 42 and zzso zzso Drug release studies showed that some drug remains bound to the zzso even after prolonged incubation with zzso at temperatures of zzso for over a week zzso of drug released 18, 30, 35 and zzso zzso zzso of the drug was found to decrease the radius of the zzso Finally, the effect of the zzso on drug zzso was determined using in zzso zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso cancer cell zzso The free zzso display no zzso whilst the zzso complexes showed moderate zzso In zzso activity was examined using an zzso zzso zzso zzso at its maximum tolerated dose of 6 zzso reduced zzso size by zzso compared to an zzso control zzso The zzso zzso complex was administered at two doses (6 and 8 zzso equivalent of zzso Both were well tolerated by the zzso The lower dose displayed comparable activity to zzso with a zzso volume reduction of zzso but the higher dose was significantly more active than free zzso with a zzso reduction of zzso
