We present here a novel probe, zzso for the evaluation of the cellular level of reduced zzso Using different cell lines and zzso agents we show that a decrease in the level of reduced zzso zzso with well-known zzso markers such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso The cell population to be investigated is added to the zzso stain zzso which immediately permeates the cell membrane and zzso with zzso zzso forming a fluorescent zzso zzso of the cell zzso directly after zzso (without zzso can then be used to determine the population's cellular zzso level at the single cell zzso Based on the results presented here, we suggest that measurement of changes in the level of free zzso should be added to the list of zzso which may be investigated in order to detect zzso
