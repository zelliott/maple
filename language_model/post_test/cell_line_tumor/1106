In order to better understand the function of zzso zzso zzso zzso from snake zzso expressed sequence tags zzso that code for zzso zzso were isolated from a zzso library prepared from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso The complete zzso sequence zzso zzso named zzso encodes the zzso zzso which includes a signal zzso and the mature protein with 16 and 122 zzso acid zzso zzso Multiple comparison of both the zzso and respective deduced zzso acid sequence with zzso and protein sequences from databases revealed that the full-length zzso identified zzso zzso is related to an zzso zzso sharing zzso within the range zzso with zzso zzso from snake zzso Moreover, zzso analysis of zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso from several pit zzso zzso showed close evolutionary relationships among zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso The molecular modeling showed structural similarity with other zzso class II zzso from snake zzso The native protein zzso a nontoxic zzso zzso directly isolated from zzso zzso snake zzso was zzso and submitted to various zzso zzso displayed high zzso activity and induced zzso zzso zzso zzso induced by this zzso was inhibited by zzso and zzso thus suggesting involvement of the zzso zzso zzso showed zzso activity upon human plasma and inhibited zzso zzso zzso induced by collagen or zzso In addition, it displayed zzso activity against zzso coli and zzso zzso and zzso effect upon breast zzso as well as upon human leukemia T and zzso zzso zzso Following chemical modification with zzso zzso total loss of the zzso and pharmacological activities were zzso This is the first report on the isolation and identification of a zzso zzso a complete zzso zzso from zzso zzso exhibiting zzso and zzso zzso
