The transition from zzso cancer cells to zzso cancer cells is mainly accompanied by the increased expression of zzso resistance 1 zzso We found that zzso X protein zzso increases the zzso activity and protein level of zzso in a zzso cell line, zzso In addition, zzso zzso made zzso cells more resistant to zzso zzso stabilized zzso zzso zzso and induced the nuclear zzso of zzso zzso gene analyses showed that zzso increased the reporter activity in the cells zzso with the reporter containing zzso gene zzso Moreover, the zzso reporter gene activity was significantly inhibited by zzso zzso but not by zzso of zzso dominant negative zzso These results imply that zzso increases the zzso zzso activity through the zzso zzso of the zzso gene with zzso zzso and suggest zzso for the therapeutic target of zzso zzso
