zzso in tumor tissue are thought to interact with tumor cells directly and/or indirectly and to have important roles in tumor invasion and zzso To characterize the zzso of zzso zzso in pulmonary zzso we established short-term zzso cell lines from both normal zzso and zzso zzso obtained from the same patients and compared the gene expression zzso Four sets of zzso cell lines zzso cell lines in total) were used in the zzso Total zzso was extracted from each cell line and zzso with 550 zzso zzso zzso on a zzso filter zzso Five zzso genes and 12 zzso genes zzso of 17 zzso were detected in the zzso cell lines from the tumor zzso compared with those from normal zzso Using real-time quantitative zzso methods, the expression profile of each gene was zzso five zzso one zzso zzso and four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Furthermore, the protein expression levels of the five genes in the zzso and normal zzso were examined zzso and the zzso of zzso and the zzso of zzso in zzso tissue were confirmed in zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso in pulmonary zzso are zzso different from zzso in normal zzso zzso
