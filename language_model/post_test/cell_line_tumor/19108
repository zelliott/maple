zzso zzso has been reported to be associated with suppressed zzso invasion and zzso of several types of zzso but its mechanism of action remains zzso In our previous study, zzso acids A, B, C and N were isolated from a new strain of zzso and all of them were found to have potential zzso activity on zzso zzso zzso cells by suppressing the zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, the zzso acid B zzso was used to explore its mechanisms underlying zzso expression of zzso zzso The results showed that the zzso suppressed zzso zzso activity in a zzso zzso zzso The suppression of zzso zzso expression of zzso cells by zzso was through zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The treatment of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso to zzso cells could result in a synergistic reduction on the zzso expression along with an zzso on cell zzso Moreover, zzso also strongly inhibited zzso nuclear zzso B zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso activities of zzso cells in zzso zzso A zzso zzso on protein levels of zzso zzso and zzso in nuclear by zzso treatment was further zzso In conclusion, we demonstrated that the zzso effects of the zzso on the zzso zzso cells might be through zzso the zzso of zzso and reducing zzso and zzso zzso activities, leading to zzso of zzso zzso
