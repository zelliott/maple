The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso has been reported to be a zzso zzso with increased expression in a number of zzso We reported previously that zzso was highly expressed in human gastric zzso zzso of zzso led to spontaneous zzso and zzso proliferation of human gastric cancer cells in zzso and in zzso However, how does zzso regulate these processes is zzso Here we performed zzso and zzso analyses to investigate possible pathways involved in zzso zzso zzso in gastric cancer zzso Our results showed that zzso of zzso inhibited zzso activity by reducing zzso of zzso at zzso and zzso at zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso and zzso its DNA binding zzso Furthermore, zzso the zzso revealed that growth arrest DNA damage zzso gene zzso zzso a direct zzso target zzso played a critical role in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso via zzso of zzso zzso Taken together, these data revealed a novel pathway, the zzso signal pathway, played an important role in zzso zzso zzso of gastric cancer zzso This study sheds new light on the role of zzso in zzso and the possible use of zzso targeting strategy in the treatment of gastric zzso
