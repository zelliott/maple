zzso an active component isolated from zzso zzso has been reported to have zzso zzso In this study, we compared the signal zzso pathways between zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso initiated zzso zzso changes, but DNA fragmentation was found in zzso zzso cells but not in zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso However, the zzso inhibitor zzso only increased zzso zzso cell zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso cells but not in the zzso groups, and the zzso inhibitor zzso failed to inhibit zzso zzso These results showed that only zzso zzso cell death required zzso degradation in a zzso independent zzso In addition, zzso increased the ratio of zzso protein zzso but zzso did zzso zzso induced zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso triggered only zzso zzso We also investigated the effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso and found that zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and its upstream protein zzso zzso These results indicated that although zzso promoted zzso zzso zzso a great difference existed between the signal pathways through which zzso zzso cell zzso
