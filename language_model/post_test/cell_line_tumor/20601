zzso levels of zzso against zzso in the zzso virus zzso zzso phase are important zzso markers for zzso zzso zzso zzso Several lifestyle factors, including smoking, have also been associated with zzso zzso We hypothesized that some specific lifestyle factors induce transformation of zzso from the zzso to the zzso stage and contribute to zzso zzso 

We conducted a zzso study using data from male case patients zzso zzso zzso and control subjects zzso zzso zzso living in zzso Province, an area in China at high risk for zzso to study potential zzso risk factors and zzso zzso Two independent healthy male populations from a second high-risk area zzso zzso zzso and a low-risk area zzso zzso zzso were also included in the analysis of potential zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso were performed to investigate the effect of cigarette smoke extract on zzso zzso in two zzso cell zzso All statistical tests were zzso 

Smoking was associated with an increased risk of zzso among the zzso participants with zzso and 40 or more zzso vs never smokers zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso Smoking was the only factor linked to zzso zzso among the expanded control group and the independent low-risk zzso In zzso experiments showed that cigarette smoke extract promoted zzso zzso induced the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and increased zzso expression levels of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso 

Smoking is not only associated with zzso risk in individuals from China but is also associated with zzso zzso in healthy males and is involved in zzso zzso
