Our objective was to define the relationships between tumor zzso of zzso and zzso an analogue which does not bind insulin growth zzso zzso binding proteins zzso zzso and the level of IGF-1 zzso zzso expression on human breast cancer zzso zzso in zzso mice, as well as the feasibility for tumor zzso A second objective was to correlate zzso (and zzso zzso with the zzso of zzso in the zzso of zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The tumor and normal tissue zzso of zzso and zzso were determined at 4 h zzso in mice implanted zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso human BC zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso of IGF-1 zzso zzso or zzso (2 or 25 zzso was zzso The relationship between tumor zzso of zzso and zzso density was zzso zzso imaging was performed on mice with zzso tumors injected with zzso The surviving fraction of BC cells exposed to zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso (1 zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso (1 or 5 zzso was zzso 

zzso was specifically taken up by zzso zzso tumor zzso was decreased twofold when zzso with IGF-1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso decreased kidney zzso of zzso up to twofold and increased circulating zzso zzso There was a strong linear correlation zzso between the tumor zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso ranged from zzso zzso for zzso to zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso tumors were zzso by zzso Resistance of BC cells to zzso was directly associated with zzso zzso despite zzso of zzso The resistance of zzso cells could be partially reversed by zzso or zzso 

Imaging of zzso expression using zzso may be useful for identifying zzso tumors in BC patients that are resistant to zzso through this zzso
