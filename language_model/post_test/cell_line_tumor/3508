zzso of zzso E is believed to be a critical factor promoting cell entry into the zzso and cell zzso Indeed, normal zzso cells and most tumor cell lines are characterized by the existence of a minimal zzso E threshold level in the zzso and only those cells expressing zzso E over this threshold enter into the zzso of the cell zzso However, through studying clinical tumor tissue zzso we recently observed that some cancer cells can enter into the zzso with minimal levels of zzso E zzso In an effort to establish an in zzso cell model system for studying the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, we treated zzso zzso leukemia cells with 50 zzso caffeine and found that the levels of zzso E expression were decreased markedly in these cells following 2 to zzso exposure to zzso Quite unexpectedly, we observed that the percentage of the cells progressing through the zzso increased despite the reduced levels of zzso zzso as analyzed for the cellular DNA zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and incorporation of zzso In fact, these cells entered into the zzso with a level of zzso E well below the threshold level for zzso cells, thus suggesting that lower levels of zzso E expression are associated with cell proliferation under certain zzso We speculate that caffeine may enhance zzso cell entrance into the zzso through zzso of zzso which in turn activates zzso protein zzso zzso including zzso and drives the cell cycle zzso while degradation of zzso E by the zzso zzso may account for the decreased levels of zzso E in these zzso Our findings from both the zzso cell line and patients' cancer zzso may help decipher the mystery of the deregulation of cell cycle progression and zzso in some zzso zzso
