During zzso the recruitment of zzso proteins to the zzso occurs in a defined zzso The protein zzso zzso zzso to the zzso very early during zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso and finally zzso Using zzso zzso we have investigated whether this order of binding reflects a level of dependency in human zzso zzso Specifically, we show that zzso plays a key role in the assembly of checkpoint proteins at the zzso being required for the subsequent zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso In contrast to studies in zzso we also show that zzso is not required for zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso increases the number of cells with lagging zzso at zzso suggesting that zzso plays a role in zzso zzso However, repression of zzso does not appear to compromise zzso checkpoint function either during normal zzso or in response to zzso zzso This raises the possibility that, in the absence of zzso other mechanisms contribute to zzso checkpoint zzso
