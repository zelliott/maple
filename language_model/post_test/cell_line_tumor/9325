The initial zzso of cancer cell zzso to zzso requires investigation to establish an effective strategy against zzso zzso In zzso observation of pulmonary zzso at an extremely early stage is of particular importance, and it is desirable from a clinical perspective to use an animal model with a normal immune zzso zzso cells labeled with green fluorescent protein were injected into the liver zzso of Fischer zzso male rats and the lungs were observed using real-time zzso laser scanning zzso from 3 to 10 weeks after zzso zzso at the single cell level was observed throughout this period, but the number of pulmonary zzso did not increase significantly with zzso The largest zzso was 300 zzso in diameter, and the mean size of the zzso did not increase with zzso There were two types of zzso in terms of zzso round and linear zzso with the latter resembling the pulmonary zzso The precise location of each pulmonary zzso was revealed by zzso orange zzso We could observe a single cancer cell and a small cancer mass in zzso and zzso locations in zzso and we found zzso cancer cells both inside and outside of zzso Most of the pulmonary zzso stayed dormant as a single cell or a cancer mass of less than 100 zzso in diameter until 10 weeks after zzso injection into the zzso
