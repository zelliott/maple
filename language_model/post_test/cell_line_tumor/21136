zzso human zzso zzso could be important risk factors for breast zzso and zzso Based on this hypothesis, we recently studied the effect of zzso zzso of high-risk zzso type 16 in two zzso human breast cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso we reported that zzso converts these cell lines to invasive zzso This is accompanied by an zzso of zzso which is an important regulator of breast zzso In this investigation, we examined the presence of high-risk zzso zzso 18, 31, 33 and zzso and the expression of their E6 zzso as well as their correlation with zzso gene zzso using zzso chain reaction zzso and tissue zzso zzso analysis, respectively, in a cohort of 113 Syrian breast cancer zzso We found that high-risk zzso types 16, 18, 31, 33 and 35 are present in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of our samples, respectively, which represent invasive breast zzso Overall, 69 zzso of the 113 samples are zzso zzso among these specimens 24 zzso zzso are zzso with more than one zzso zzso Furthermore, we report that the expression of the E6 zzso of these high-risk zzso is correlated with zzso zzso in the majority of invasive breast cancer tissue zzso Our data suggest that high-risk zzso infections are associated with human breast cancer progression in Syrian zzso
