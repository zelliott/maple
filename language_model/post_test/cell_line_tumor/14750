An experimental Portland cement was manufactured with pure raw materials under controlled laboratory zzso The aim of this study was to compare the chemical zzso physical properties, and zzso of zzso manufactured Portland cement with those of mineral zzso zzso zzso and Portland zzso 

The composition of the zzso was determined by scanning electron zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis zzso The setting time and zzso strength were zzso The zzso was evaluated by using zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso revealed the experimental Portland cement to have a similar composition to Portland zzso The setting time of the experimental Portland cement was significantly shorter than that of zzso and Portland zzso The zzso strength of the experimental Portland cement was lower than that of zzso and Portland zzso The experimental Portland cement showed a similar zzso to zzso 

The experimental Portland cement might be considered as a possible substitute for zzso in clinical usage after further zzso
