zzso outgrowth involves various molecular mechanisms generating complex brain zzso These mechanisms have been linked to plasticity and learning and are thought to be zzso in zzso zzso The zzso factor zzso regulates a subset of genes zzso zzso outgrowth zzso We demonstrate here the zzso of zzso expression in a mouse zzso cell zzso This zzso induced a clear increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction showed deregulation of the candidate genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso These genes are bona fide candidates known to be involved in zzso and zzso zzso This approach could be adapted to zzso techniques for determination of the zzso zzso outgrowth gene zzso
