zzso imaging agents that allow both nuclear and optical imaging after a single injection would be advantageous in certain zzso In this study, we zzso and characterized a zzso zzso zzso zzso and compared nuclear and optical images obtained with this zzso 

zzso composed of both the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and the zzso zzso fluorescent dye zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The probe was characterized with regard to in zzso biological activity and in zzso zzso and the ability to target zzso zzso zzso of mice injected with the zzso probe were zzso both by gamma zzso and zzso zzso optical zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso inhibited the zzso of melanoma zzso cells to zzso surface with the similar biological zzso Both zzso and zzso had significantly higher zzso in zzso zzso melanoma than in zzso zzso melanoma at zzso h after their zzso zzso comparison of images obtained using zzso revealed that in living mice, both optical imaging and gamma zzso enabled zzso detection of the bound probe to zzso tumors, with optical images providing improved resolution and sensitive detection of the superficial zzso and gamma images providing sensitive detection of deeper zzso 

The zzso imaging probe zzso was found to specifically bind to zzso in melanoma tumor zzso zzso both nuclear and optical imaging with a single imaging probe may facilitate translation of zzso zzso optical imaging into clinical zzso
