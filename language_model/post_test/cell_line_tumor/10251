The human zzso zzso which encodes the zzso and zzso zzso contains 5 zzso zzso with zzso zzso a 117 zzso zzso zzso that is known to be processed to yield a zzso zzso and/or a zzso zzso mature zzso which possess biological activities in multiple zzso However, the zzso gene also encodes additional peptides through alternative zzso or zzso zzso Indeed, we previously identified a spliced zzso zzso zzso in mouse zzso which is regulated in a zzso manner by zzso status and may thus be of biological zzso Here, we have characterized a new human zzso zzso that contains zzso zzso zzso 1, and zzso and lacks zzso This human zzso zzso would zzso a new zzso that zzso the first zzso of zzso (including the zzso zzso zzso but has a different zzso zzso zzso of zzso was detected in 22 human zzso and its levels were positively correlated with those of zzso zzso p zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso suggesting that zzso could be a primary zzso for zzso in human zzso Interestingly, levels of zzso zzso expression in breast cancer samples were zzso higher than those of normal zzso zzso and showed a strong correlation in breast tumors with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso (a zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso but not with zzso or zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso increased zzso proliferation of zzso breast cancer zzso Taken together, our results provide evidence that zzso is a novel element of the zzso family with a potential zzso role in breast zzso
