The importance of zzso and context in regulation of zzso genes is well zzso DNA exposure to or the zzso from zzso detects differences in higher order zzso structure in intact cells without disturbing cellular or tissue zzso To investigate the relationship between zzso organization and tumor zzso we used an established three-dimensional zzso in which normal and zzso human breast cells can be easily distinguished by the zzso of the structures they make zzso versus zzso zzso We show that these zzso can be distinguished also by sensitivity to zzso zzso in which the zzso cells resist zzso relative to zzso zzso Treatment of zzso breast cancer cells in three-dimensional culture with zzso zzso or a zzso zzso inhibitor not only reverted their zzso from zzso to polar zzso structures but also enhanced zzso sensitivity to zzso By using different zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso and shift in DNA organization act through a zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso produced the same zzso These experiments underscore the concept that zzso the tumor zzso can alter the organization of tumor cells and demonstrate that architecture and global zzso organization are coupled and highly zzso
