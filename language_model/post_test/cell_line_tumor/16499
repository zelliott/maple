The zzso of zzso zzso zzso one of the fundamental components of the human active zzso has been shown to be closely associated with human zzso However, the mechanism of its zzso regulation has not been zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate the regulatory elements for the zzso regulation of zzso in zzso zzso zzso To characterize the zzso promoter and identify regulatory zzso we cloned zzso zzso of the zzso region of the zzso gene from immortalized normal zzso zzso cells zzso zzso analysis established a minimal region zzso involved in the regulation of human zzso promoter zzso Through zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso we found that the zzso zzso factors could bind to the zzso promoter zzso and zzso and that they regulated zzso promoter zzso in human zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso were highly expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso by small interfering zzso or zzso of zzso and zzso activity by zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso and zzso bind to the zzso minimal promoter and function as a regulator of the zzso of zzso in human zzso zzso
