zzso D3 zzso is the biological active form of vitamin zzso Its zzso capacities make it a potential drug to treat diseases such as zzso The clinical use of zzso as an zzso agent is hampered by its zzso zzso zzso structural zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso have been developed with zzso zzso This study aims to distinct the molecular activities of zzso and zzso and identify possible differences in gene zzso 

Total zzso was extracted from zzso breast cancer cells treated with zzso or zzso and was used for zzso zzso 

The experiments revealed that zzso zzso the same genes as zzso but the induction level of the individual genes is zzso zzso analysis did not reveal genes that were exclusively regulated by zzso 

The zzso vitamin D analog zzso zzso the same set of genes as zzso but the level of induction of the individual genes is zzso
