zzso cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States, and new drugs to treat the disease are zzso zzso cancer cells are highly zzso and exhibit resistance to zzso Small molecules that can restore sensitivity to zzso or reduce zzso would have therapeutic potential against this zzso zzso A is an zzso isolated from marine sponges that was suspected to have zzso activity against the zzso activated zzso zzso zzso Because of this, the effects of zzso A were studied in pancreatic cancer zzso 

zzso cells were treated for 48 h in the presence of various zzso of zzso A and their zzso zzso cell invasion and zzso to zzso were zzso 

zzso A decreased single cell formation, zzso cell migration and restored the zzso of the cells to zzso zzso in zzso zzso Its mechanism of action remains unknown, as zzso A does not inhibit zzso 

zzso A appears to have a formerly zzso activity in blocking tumor cell invasion as well as in restoring cancer cell zzso to zzso in zzso and therefore has the potential to be used as an zzso to existing cancer zzso
