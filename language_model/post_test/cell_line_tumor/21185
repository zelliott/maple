zzso represent one of the most important zzso bacterial groups of the zzso zzso The binding of zzso to species of zzso has been recently zzso To further explore the interaction between zzso and zzso we investigated the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in the degradation of zzso zzso Our experimental data demonstrate that the recruitment of zzso on the bacterial cell surface and its subsequent conversion into zzso by zzso zzso zzso provide zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso activity effective in degradation of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso The ability of zzso to intervene in the host zzso system may contribute to zzso colonization of the host gastrointestinal zzso
