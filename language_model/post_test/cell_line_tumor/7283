To investigate if the zzso of zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso alters the zzso of zzso complexes in cultured tumor cells and hence increases zzso drug zzso 

An average of zzso zzso molecules per zzso were zzso either by using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell surface binding and competition experiments with zzso for zzso binding were studied to demonstrate that zzso maintain specificity of the zzso To determine the degradation of zzso in zzso zzso cultured tumor cells were zzso for 15 zzso with zzso and chased for 2 h at 37 degrees C in the presence of excess zzso zzso The chase medium was subjected to zzso zzso to separate the intact and zzso zzso To investigate if the zzso of zzso zzso the zzso release of the drug from the zzso form, zzso zzso was zzso to zzso zzso and its zzso activity was compared with zzso zzso in human colon zzso zzso cells, human breast zzso zzso cells, zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells, and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso degradation of zzso was higher than that of zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was lower than that of zzso in both tumor cell zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso cells was higher than that in zzso zzso cells, whereas the zzso was almost identical in both the resistant and zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso induced by zzso zzso binding alters the zzso trafficking of zzso complexes, zzso them out of the recycling pathway, and targets them to zzso degradation in cultured tumor zzso The zzso of zzso zzso the zzso release of the drug from the zzso zzso zzso zzso is more effective than zzso as a zzso zzso agent in tumor cells, as well as in zzso transport deficient zzso zzso zzso are potentially effective zzso carriers for zzso delivery of zzso zzso
