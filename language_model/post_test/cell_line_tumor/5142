Previous studies indicate that green tea extract may inhibit breast cancer progression by blocking zzso although the molecular mechanisms are not well zzso We demonstrate that administration of zzso E zzso zzso a standardized green tea zzso inhibited zzso breast cancer and human zzso zzso zzso zzso cell migration and the expression of vascular zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso 9 zzso In addition, Poly E inhibited zzso zzso in zzso We also demonstrate that Poly E blocked signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso signaling by suppressing zzso zzso gene zzso via zzso sequence zzso elements and downstream zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso active zzso significantly reduced the zzso effect of Poly E on cell migration and zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, these observations indicate that green tea extract zzso zzso partly through the disruption of zzso zzso of zzso including zzso
