zzso zzso is a commonly prescribed mood zzso However, emerging evidence indicates that zzso administration may cause zzso symptoms of zzso and cognitive decline zzso in some manic zzso The mechanism of this phenomenon is zzso In this study, we used human zzso zzso cells as a zzso model to investigate the effects of zzso on zzso outgrowth and zzso zzso Data showed that the treatment with zzso at therapeutic plasma levels zzso zzso significantly reduced cell proliferation from day 4 through day 6, and zzso outgrowth length from day 1 through day zzso zzso zzso had no effect on cell proliferation of human zzso zzso cells but zzso nerve growth factor zzso zzso outgrowth from rat zzso zzso zzso In parallel to these zzso in human zzso cells, both zzso and protein levels of zzso 160 zzso were significantly reduced, starting at day 2 and day 3, respectively, by the zzso The zzso of zzso outgrowth by zzso was completely reversed 2 days after zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso protein levels also rebounded to control levels after zzso zzso zzso application significantly alleviated the zzso of zzso outgrowth by zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso expression was involved in the zzso and the reversal of zzso outgrowth in human zzso zzso
