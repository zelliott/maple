zzso zzso zzso is a key component of signal zzso in zzso In natural killer zzso cells, zzso is pivotal for cellular zzso however, it is not known which steps of the zzso machinery it zzso We found that zzso zzso cells formed zzso with target cells and polarized the zzso center, but failed to zzso zzso zzso due to defective calcium zzso zzso zzso was completely zzso in zzso cells, regardless of whether targets expressed zzso zzso missed self major zzso complex zzso class I, or whether zzso cells were zzso with zzso and zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was specific to zzso zzso because release of zzso on stimulation with zzso was zzso zzso mice could not reject zzso class zzso zzso cells nor could they control zzso infection, but they effectively contained zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso of zzso zzso but not cellular polarization toward targets, depends on zzso calcium rise during zzso cell zzso In zzso zzso regulates selective zzso of innate immunity because it is essential for zzso cell responses to zzso and zzso infected cells but not to bacterial zzso
