zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in cancer cells but has little effect on normal zzso However, many cancer cell types are resistant to zzso zzso limiting the clinical utility of TRAIL as an zzso zzso We previously reported that the suppression of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of breast cancer cells, which frequently express high levels of zzso In the present study, we examined the effect of zzso zzso suppression of zzso on the resistance of breast cancer cells to zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso 

zzso zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso D, and zzso cells to zzso zzso by zzso the expression of TRAIL death receptors 4 and 5 zzso and zzso and zzso the TRAIL decoy zzso 2 zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso activated the stress zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso subsequently stabilizing and increasing the zzso activity of zzso by zzso it at zzso it also enhanced the expression and activity of DNA zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and TRAIL zzso were blocked by a zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso plays an important role in the zzso zzso of zzso However, zzso zzso also zzso zzso in the zzso cell lines zzso and zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso treatment led to zzso promoter zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso consistent with the observed zzso of zzso Treatment of the cells with a zzso agent or zzso inhibitor prevented the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of both zzso and zzso In in zzso experiments using nude mice, zzso zzso caused zzso zzso zzso to undergo zzso cell death, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and TRAIL efficiently suppressed tumor growth in these zzso 

zzso suppression by zzso might be exploited to overcome zzso in zzso
