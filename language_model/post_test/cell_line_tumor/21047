Two approaches have been developed to construct plasmids that mediate zzso interference to inhibit the replication and expression of zzso in zzso zzso The overlapping zzso extension and restriction zzso were used to generate DNA fragments zzso designed zzso based on sequences of zzso C of zzso zzso The zzso derived zzso were constructed to develop zzso based zzso delivery systems termed zzso There were significant reductions in the expression of zzso and zzso between cells zzso with zzso and control groups (as to zzso P zzso zzso zzso and zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso DNA copies were reduced from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso copies with or without zzso These results suggested that zzso delivery by zzso plasmids harboring zzso zzso DNA zzso of interest generated either by overlapping zzso extension or restriction zzso could inhibit expressions of viral proteins and reduce viral zzso The zzso derived plasmids might be a useful zzso delivery system in zzso zzso In addition, we found zzso based on stealth zzso was a potent zzso target of zzso zzso
