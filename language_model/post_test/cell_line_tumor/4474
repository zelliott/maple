The zzso is considered to be a potential target for cancer zzso zzso a novel zzso agent, has been found to have zzso effects on various cancer zzso To date, its pharmacological mechanisms are still zzso The goal of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms of zzso on the zzso human lung zzso cell zzso For this, we used a wide variety of in zzso zzso The zzso signaling pathways including DNA damage sensing and response zzso cell cycle regulatory zzso and some key zzso involved in zzso were evaluated in this zzso Our study suggested that zzso induced cell cycle arrest at the zzso phase and triggers programming cell death on zzso human lung cancer cells, whose effects are modulated through the zzso of the zzso pathway, the zzso of zzso B1 zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso our results indicated that zzso may have therapeutic potential as a chemotherapy for zzso lung zzso
