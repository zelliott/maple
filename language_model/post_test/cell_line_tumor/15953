The assembly of soluble proteins into ordered zzso zzso with zzso structure is an essential event of many human zzso The zzso undergoing zzso are generally small in zzso To explore if the small size is a primary zzso for the formation of zzso under pathological conditions we have created two databases of zzso forming zzso and zzso deposits in human diseases, zzso The size zzso of the two protein populations are well zzso with the systems forming zzso deposits appearing significantly zzso We have then investigated the propensity of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso to form zzso zzso in zzso This size is intermediate between the size zzso of zzso and zzso forming zzso zzso was induced under conditions known to be most effective for zzso formation by normally zzso zzso zzso low pH with zzso zzso pH zzso with zzso In both situations zzso zzso very rapidly into species with significant zzso structure, as detected using circular zzso and X-ray zzso but a weak zzso T and zzso red zzso Moreover, atomic force zzso indicated a zzso distinct from typical zzso zzso Both types of zzso were zzso to human zzso cells, as indicated by the zzso zzso This analysis indicates that large proteins have a high tendency to form toxic zzso but low propensity to form regular zzso in zzso and that such a behavior is zzso determined by the size of the zzso as suggested by the in zzso analysis of our sample zzso
