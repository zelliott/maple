zzso is a rare, slow growing zzso tumor arising from remnants of the fetal zzso Surgery is the first choice for zzso treatment, followed by zzso although zzso complications remain zzso zzso of the disease occurs frequently due to the anatomy of the tumor location and violation of the tumor margins at the initial zzso Currently, there are no effective drugs available for patients with zzso Due to the rarity of the disease, there is limited opportunity to test agents in clinical trials and no concerted effort to develop agents for zzso in the pharmaceutical zzso To rapidly and efficiently identify small molecules that inhibit zzso cell growth, we screened the zzso zzso Collection zzso containing approximately zzso clinically approved and zzso drugs at 15 different zzso in zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso We identified a group of drugs including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that inhibited zzso cell growth, with zzso from 10 to 370 zzso in zzso cells, but less zzso in zzso zzso Most of these drugs also induced zzso zzso activity with a similar rank order as the zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed similar zzso effect on cell lines and 3 primary zzso cell zzso The combination treatment of zzso with zzso I and II zzso increased the therapeutic potency in zzso and zzso primary zzso Our results provide information useful for repurposing currently approved drugs for zzso and potential approach of combination zzso
