The effect of heat treatment on the mechanical properties of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso has been zzso In the case of zzso zzso the presence of zzso phase in the zzso has a greater effect on strength and zzso than the presence of secondary zzso zzso The zzso zzso shows higher zzso and zzso strength than the zzso zzso due to the formation of hard zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso However, the zzso free zzso offers higher zzso than the zzso containing zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso increases the strength of the zzso zzso when zzso zzso are present in the zzso However, the zzso zzso have no substantial influence on the strength of the zzso zzso when zzso phase in the zzso is replaced by the zzso zzso The elastic zzso of the zzso samples shows a very small variation with different heat treatment zzso The zzso zzso samples containing zzso and zzso zzso show higher elastic zzso than the samples containing zzso and zzso zzso The elastic zzso of the zzso zzso is higher than that of the zzso zzso due to the formation of high zzso zzso particles in the zzso Both the zzso show better cell zzso and spreading than the control material zzso However, the zzso free zzso shows better cell attachment than the zzso containing zzso
