zzso are zzso that are released from various cells into the zzso zzso It has been reported that the components within zzso vary according to the type of zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the zzso family proteins zzso zzso and zzso as useful collection markers of zzso derived from the three zzso cancer zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso In addition, we aimed to detect the zzso zzso and natural zzso zzso within the zzso zzso from the three zzso cell zzso Furthermore, we examined whether zzso containing their zzso were transferred into the zzso cell line zzso and lung cancer cell line zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso from the three zzso cell zzso This result indicates that zzso can be a collection marker of zzso derived from the three zzso cell zzso When the zzso species within zzso derived from the three zzso cell lines were zzso the zzso of zzso genes such as zzso and zzso the zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso and the natural zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso We discovered their natural zzso zzso within zzso for the first time in the present zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso derived from the zzso cell lines were taken up into zzso and zzso zzso These findings indicate that the zzso zzso enclosed within zzso are zzso to the outside, and zzso derived from the zzso cell lines are transferred into zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, we reveal that zzso derived from the zzso cell lines contain zzso zzso and natural zzso zzso and can be delivered into zzso and zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso can shuttle between cells, and may be involved in the regulation of gene expression in recipient zzso
