zzso cancer is a leading cause of death from cancer in American men and zzso the main cause of zzso To better understand the disease and accelerate development of new therapies, in zzso models that reflect different disease stages are zzso A family of cell lines that mimics multiple steps in cancer development and tumor progression has been developed in our laboratory from the parent, zzso zzso cell line by transformation with zzso zzso The zzso cell lines mimic multiple steps in tumor progression where zzso is the most zzso cell zzso zzso cells form zzso in the lungs of zzso male, nude mice after intravenous zzso Two new cell lines, zzso and zzso showing more zzso characteristics than the parent zzso cell line, were derived from tumors after subcutaneous injection of zzso cells into nude zzso The zzso and zzso cell lines show an increase in zzso growth and invasive ability as compared to the parent zzso zzso While the parent zzso cells express barely zzso levels, the new cell lines produce high levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels of zzso By zzso all three cell lines were positive for zzso zzso and zzso These cell lines, having the same zzso represent additional steps in the zzso process of tumor progression and provide novel and useful cell models for studies on tumor progression and for drug development for the treatment of prostate zzso
