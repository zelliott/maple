zzso of zzso may be a promising therapeutic approach in cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induce zzso in various cancer zzso However, the molecular mechanism remains to be zzso The present study was undertaken to determine the precise mechanism of cell death induced by zzso a synthetic zzso gamma zzso in zzso human zzso zzso zzso resulted in a zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso Similar results were obtained with zzso another synthetic zzso gamma zzso zzso induced zzso oxygen species zzso generation and zzso cell death was prevented by the zzso zzso suggesting an important role of zzso generation in the zzso cell zzso The cell death induced by zzso was inhibited by the zzso gamma zzso zzso Although zzso treatment caused a transient zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso cell death was not affected by zzso of these zzso zzso caused a loss of zzso membrane potential and its effect was prevented by zzso and zzso The specific inhibitor of zzso zzso and the general zzso inhibitor zzso did not exert the protective effect against the zzso cell death and zzso activity also was not altered by zzso The zzso cell death was accompanied by zzso of zzso and zzso but not by release of zzso zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that zzso of zzso and zzso may play an active role in zzso a zzso and zzso zzso cell death induced by zzso in zzso human zzso zzso These data may provide a novel insight into potential therapeutic strategies for treatment of zzso
