zzso distribution analysis zzso has been used to explore the plasma membrane fluidity of zzso cancer cells zzso zzso zzso and also to characterize the influence of various membrane agents present in the zzso zzso zzso is a recent zzso technique, based on zzso correlation zzso zzso well suited to retrieve local organization of cell zzso The method was conducted on a large number of living cells, which enabled us to get a detailed overview of plasma membrane zzso and plasma membrane zzso between the cells of the same zzso Thus, we clearly reveal the higher zzso of plasma membrane in zzso cancer cells in comparison with the zzso ones zzso sensitive zzso We also display distinct modifications related to a membrane fluidity zzso zzso alcohol, and two zzso of zzso resistance, zzso and zzso A relation between the distribution of the zzso values and the modification of membrane lateral zzso is zzso
