zzso of protein zzso G zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso has become of considerable interest as a novel molecular approach for the induction of zzso in cancer zzso This study was conducted to investigate the role of zzso zzso in the regulation of cell growth in human breast cancer cell lines zzso and zzso The expression levels of zzso zzso were also examined using real-time reverse zzso zzso chain zzso No differences in the gene expression of zzso zzso were observed between zzso and zzso zzso To investigate the effects of zzso zzso on the regulation of cell growth, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso was assessed with the zzso zzso zzso zzso cell cycle analysis and zzso activity zzso Treatment of zzso and zzso cells with zzso resulted in a zzso cell growth zzso and zzso whereas neither zzso nor zzso zzso had any effect on the cell zzso The role of zzso in the zzso of cell growth was confirmed using zzso and zzso zzso The present study is the first to demonstrate the involvement of zzso in the zzso of cell growth and induction of zzso in breast cancer zzso
