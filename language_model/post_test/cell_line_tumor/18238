zzso zzso zzso is functionally expressed in some human cancer cell lines and might be a candidate molecular target for detection of zzso in zzso using zzso The aim of the present study was to establish a novel zzso technology using a PET zzso targeted to zzso zzso We also compared the zzso with zzso focusing on the specificity of their zzso between tumor and inflammatory zzso 

A zzso PET zzso zzso zzso was injected zzso into zzso mice transplanted with human zzso zzso and gastric cancer zzso The distribution patterns of zzso and zzso in the zzso mice, and in mice with inflammatory zzso were assessed by imaging with a zzso zzso imaging system zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were also zzso The expression levels of zzso and zzso zzso proteins in tumor zzso and inflammatory tissue were examined by zzso zzso The zzso zzso expression levels of zzso in 58 available cancer cell lines were zzso by means of real-time zzso chain zzso 

All 3 tumor zzso were well zzso with the zzso after injection of zzso zzso of zzso in those zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso concentration ratios of zzso increased in a zzso manner and were much higher than zzso Most of the zzso found in the tumor tissue was recovered as the intact zzso These results indicated that zzso was taken up by the zzso in tumor zzso It is noteworthy that zzso was minimally present in inflammatory zzso that expressed no zzso or zzso zzso whereas zzso was highly zzso with the values of the selectivity index being zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso and zzso respectively, of the cancer cell lines examined in the present zzso 

The present study indicates that zzso is a promising zzso agent and is superior to zzso for distinguishing between tumors and inflammatory zzso Because zzso were zzso expressed in various types of tumor cells zzso zzso could be useful for the detection of many types of zzso
