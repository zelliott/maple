zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by linking signals from the zzso family zzso to changes in zzso zzso Recent studies have shown an important role for zzso signaling in tumor cell invasion through regulating zzso zzso In this study, we investigate the role of zzso in zzso zzso trafficking of zzso We analyzed by zzso zzso zzso the cellular distribution of zzso proteins and the zzso of an zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso in zzso zzso We found in these cells an abnormal dispersed zzso of zzso stained for zzso and zzso D throughout the zzso The small zzso structures that stained for these zzso proteins were redistributed to the periphery of the zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso further demonstrated that these zzso did not zzso with the zzso zzso an early zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso did not zzso with early zzso labeled with zzso Texas zzso These results indicate that there is no mixing between dispersed zzso and early zzso in the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso resulted in a marked zzso in the zzso zzso of Texas zzso zzso in comparison with zzso zzso At 30 zzso after zzso most of the Texas zzso zzso overlapped with zzso late zzso in zzso cells, whereas in zzso zzso only a small fraction of zzso zzso zzso with zzso structures in the zzso zzso Taken together, the findings presented in this paper suggest that zzso has a role in regulating zzso trafficking of zzso and zzso in invasive tumor zzso
