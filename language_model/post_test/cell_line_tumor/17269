zzso protein 3 zzso is a zzso protein with zzso properties and its regulation by factors promoting zzso may be important for protection of, for instance, zzso in states of zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated regulatory pathways for zzso expression zzso by the zzso hormone zzso growth factor type 1 zzso in human zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis and zzso showed that treatment with 10 zzso IGF-1 increased the zzso zzso levels zzso after 5 zzso zzso with the zzso 3 zzso inhibitor zzso prohibited zzso induction of both zzso zzso and protein in a zzso manner, with a complete zzso at 1 zzso as shown by zzso and western zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso or zzso inhibitor zzso also decreased the zzso zzso expression at 10 zzso however, this concentration only partly inhibited the protein zzso We conclude that IGF-1 enhanced zzso expression at zzso level, primarily through the zzso zzso and partly through the zzso zzso zzso
