Resistance of zzso melanoma cells to zzso zzso is among the mechanisms by which they escape immune zzso However, the mechanisms contributing to their resistance are not completely zzso and it is still unclear whether zzso zzso family proteins play a role in this zzso In this study, we report that treatment of zzso melanoma cell lines with zzso a general inhibitor of de zzso protein zzso zzso them to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso to zzso zzso is associated with a rapid zzso of zzso protein levels, but not that of zzso or zzso zzso zzso in these melanoma cell lines with specific small interfering zzso was sufficient to sensitize them to both zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso expression of zzso in a zzso melanoma cell line zzso the cells from zzso zzso Our results further show that the expression of zzso in melanoma cells is regulated by the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and not by zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso of zzso signaling with the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor or by expressing a dominant negative form of zzso zzso zzso also zzso resistant melanoma cells to zzso zzso zzso Thus, our study identifies zzso protein zzso as an important survival signaling zzso in the resistance of melanoma cells to zzso zzso and suggests that its targeting may contribute to the elimination of melanoma tumors by the immune zzso
