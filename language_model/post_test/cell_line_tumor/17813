The main mode of progression of zzso cancer is zzso zzso and its zzso may lead to improved zzso zzso and zzso zzso deleted on zzso 10 zzso reportedly zzso the zzso migration, and invasion of cancer zzso The purpose of this study is to explore the possibility of zzso gene therapy for zzso zzso We zzso the zzso cancer cell line zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso cell zzso with zzso or zzso zzso zzso After selection, zzso cells zzso and control cells zzso were zzso zzso implanted zzso into nude mice was examined for the change in tumor diameter and the number of new blood zzso Mice with zzso zzso tumors created by zzso zzso of the same cells were examined for changes in body weight and abdominal circumference and for survival zzso The growth of zzso zzso was significantly lower than that of control zzso zzso zzso Compared with controls, mice with zzso zzso zzso showed significantly smaller increases in the body weight and abdominal circumference zzso zzso zzso and a significantly longer survival time zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration in the zzso of zzso was about half that of controls zzso zzso zzso The number of new blood vessels in zzso was significantly smaller than that in controls zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso suppressed tumor growth and zzso dissemination of zzso zzso cancer cells and prolonged the survival time of the mice with zzso zzso zzso zzso gene therapy could have therapeutic potential for zzso cancer and exerts some of this effect by zzso zzso
