The zzso zzso factor 5 zzso is highly expressed in many kinds of tumors including zzso and breast zzso but its expression in zzso zzso zzso has not been zzso Here, we show that zzso is highly expressed in the majority of zzso zzso cancer samples zzso as compared with benign zzso tumor zzso zzso and normal zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso expression significantly correlated with advanced clinical stage ( zzso and poor differentiation of zzso zzso zzso ( zzso Previous studies suggested that zzso is required for the survival of cancer cells, but the mechanisms by which zzso regulates genes and promotes cell survival are not zzso Our data additionally demonstrated that interference with the function of zzso could markedly increase the zzso of zzso cancer cells and identified zzso leukemia zzso as an zzso zzso zzso These findings may provide potential therapeutic application in zzso zzso zzso
