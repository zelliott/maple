zzso is a highly zzso zzso found in young zzso Although children with high-risk zzso respond to chemotherapy, relapses are zzso On account of poor treatment outcome, new treatment strategies are constantly sought for zzso zzso zzso are potentially novel substances for treatment of zzso In this study, we have treated two zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso with the zzso analogue zzso zzso zzso zzso was the most sensitive cell line, in which zzso treatment resulted in an zzso of cell proliferation and an induction of cell zzso The cell death induced by zzso treatment was zzso as evidenced by zzso of zzso 3 and induction of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso treatment only resulted in a slight zzso of cell proliferation in zzso zzso There were several possible causes for the lower sensitivity to zzso treatment in the latter cell line when compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso depletion was more extensive in zzso cells than in zzso zzso This was partly because of a higher induction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the cell line zzso The zzso zzso depletion was also caused by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells contained a higher level of the zzso protein zzso which was further increased after zzso zzso In contrast, zzso treatment resulted in a decreased zzso level in zzso zzso
