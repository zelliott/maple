zzso zzso is a zzso zzso modification found in higher zzso However, little is known about zzso zzso zzso Here, we describe a sensitive zzso approach based on zzso quantitative mass zzso for the identification of zzso proteins induced under different cellular stress zzso While confirming the majority of known zzso zzso our screen identifies numerous additional zzso zzso zzso zzso validation of zzso proteins confirms that our methodology targets zzso zzso Nuclear proteins encompassing zzso acid binding properties are prominently zzso upon zzso stress, consistent with the nuclear zzso of zzso and zzso zzso differences in proteins becoming zzso upon various zzso insults are observed, exemplified by the zzso of zzso factors zzso and zzso under zzso zzso zzso imaging reveals that zzso affects the nuclear zzso of zzso and zzso demonstrating the potential of our approach to uncover zzso unappreciated processes being controlled by specific zzso zzso
