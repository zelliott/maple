zzso is a membrane protein that is potentially involved in human zzso zzso by zzso zzso cell zzso between zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso expression by maternal cells may be induced by the zzso that zzso human zzso zzso zzso Because the process of tumor zzso resembles that of zzso invasion and proliferation during zzso zzso we hypothesized that zzso zzso that zzso zzso express zzso thus becoming aggressive zzso zzso We screened zzso zzso specimens of 158 patients with zzso germ cell tumor by zzso using zzso zzso This screening identified zzso specimens with the zzso 39 of 91 zzso in stage I, 14 of 24 zzso in stage II, and 41 of 43 zzso in stage III zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso expression positively zzso with clinical zzso zzso zzso was found in all of the cases zzso of zzso with lung zzso The levels of serum zzso were significantly higher in the patients with zzso tumors than those with zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso To determine whether zzso promotes aggressiveness of the cell, zzso human zzso cell line zzso was zzso zzso with a zzso expression zzso containing zzso zzso In zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso cells are more invasive than zzso cells, whereas there are no differences between zzso and zzso in their proliferation zzso Upon zzso zzso to zzso nude mice, zzso cells exhibited zzso zzso in all of the mice zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso produced no zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest strongly that zzso enhances zzso of the cells and promotes zzso of zzso germ cell zzso
