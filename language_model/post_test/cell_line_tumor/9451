The aim of this study was to characterize the immune response of patients affected by zzso cell zzso zzso 

zzso zzso lines were established by zzso transfer of the large zzso of zzso into fresh zzso zzso zzso T cell zzso were generated by zzso zzso of patients' zzso with zzso zzso zzso 

This protocol led to the induction of zzso T cell clones zzso against the zzso zzso but not against zzso cell zzso However, some of these zzso recognize normal zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso cell lines and colon and zzso cell lung zzso but not zzso and zzso lines, without evidence of shared classical zzso class I zzso zzso Further characterization performed on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that neither expression of zzso zzso nor zzso correlated with the T zzso zzso Moreover, zzso expression by target cells was not required to achieve interaction of zzso zzso In agreement with this zzso the zzso activity of zzso was not inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso expression was not affected by zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso while partially inhibited by zzso could not be abolished by zzso zzso Moreover, growth and expansion of zzso was sustained only by T cell interaction with zzso zzso zzso unspecific zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso did not allow T cell zzso These results demonstrated the existence of an zzso T cell population, recognizing zzso zzso cells through an zzso zzso zzso
