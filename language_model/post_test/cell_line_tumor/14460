A major challenge confronting the further advancement of using molecular zzso zzso to small molecular weight zzso in the clinic is the development of zzso that would allow for the zzso release of a free zzso only after cell zzso Development of zzso that would allow for the rapid real-time zzso of zzso zzso zzso and cargo release in cells and animals would greatly help in their zzso In this chapter, we describe a imaging method that zzso measures zzso zzso zzso and cargo release in real-time in both cell culture and animal zzso
