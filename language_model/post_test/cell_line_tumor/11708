Fluorescent and zzso tools are commonly used to study the dynamics of cancer progression and zzso in zzso zzso have become essential tools to study biological zzso However, few can sustain zzso long enough during long-term zzso In the present study, we focused on a series of new zzso zzso known as zzso which emit strong zzso in zzso zzso and can be readily modified using the zzso zzso zzso zzso chemical modifications of zzso groups can improve zzso zzso reduce zzso and prolong zzso zzso in contrast to conventional fluorescent zzso these zzso show promise for long-term monitoring of biological zzso In the present study, we conducted long-term observations of tumor growth and zzso using a zzso zzso as a novel fluorescent zzso For this purpose, we studied the zzso melanoma cell line zzso which zzso at a high zzso We compared the characteristics of the zzso probe with the commercially available fluorescent dye zzso and fluorescent protein zzso zzso cells were labeled with these fluorescent zzso and zzso implanted into nude zzso The zzso zzso by zzso was detected more than five weeks after zzso without causing zzso harmful effects on tumor zzso By contrast, zzso of cells labeled with zzso could not be detected at this same zzso Furthermore, zzso but not zzso cells, were also detected in lung zzso These results indicate that labeling cells with zzso zzso can significantly extend the time course of in zzso studies on tumor cell zzso
