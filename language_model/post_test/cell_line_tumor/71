To further identify the breast zzso cell line zzso zzso expressing the suicide gene zzso observe its growing zzso and establish an animal model of implanted breast zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso gene and breast zzso cell line zzso zzso expressing the zzso gene were zzso Breast zzso cells of the lines zzso and zzso were zzso and observed by zzso zzso Growth curve was zzso zzso DNA of zzso cells was zzso and amplified by zzso with zzso and zzso zzso as zzso zzso gel zzso was used to identify the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso cells were zzso zzso at bilateral roots of zzso of female zzso nude mice zzso The growth of tumor was observed every zzso 

zzso showed zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso but not in the zzso zzso The numbers of growing zzso cells on days 3, and 7 were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, not significantly different from those of the zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, both P zzso zzso The time needed for tumor formation after the zzso of zzso cells was zzso zzso zzso zzso not significantly different from that of the zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The tumor size 19 days after zzso of the zzso cells was zzso zzso zzso zzso not significantly different from that of the zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

The zzso cells have integrated the zzso gene without changing its growing zzso An animal model of implanted breast cancer has been successfully zzso The zzso and zzso subcutaneous zzso offer the foundation for further study of gene imaging and gene zzso
