zzso zzso promoting zzso zzso known as a zzso protein zzso is a zzso zzso protein with a zzso function of stabilizing cellular zzso zzso Whether zzso involves in the normal functions of zzso or the zzso of prion disease remains zzso Here, we proposed the data that zzso formed molecular complex with zzso We also investigated its influence on the zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso in zzso its zzso against the disruption of zzso structures and zzso of zzso zzso in cells, and its zzso in the brains of zzso experimental zzso 

Using pull-down and zzso zzso distinct molecular interaction between zzso and zzso were identified and the segment of zzso spanning zzso zzso and the segment of zzso spanning zzso zzso were mapped as the regions responsible for protein zzso zzso experiments found that zzso increased the zzso of full-length zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso electron zzso and zzso T zzso zzso showed that zzso enhanced zzso formation of synthetic zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso in the cultured cells did not obviously change the zzso networks observed by a zzso zzso zzso and cell growth features measured by zzso tests, but significantly antagonized the disruption of zzso structures and rescued the zzso caused by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, Western blots identified that the levels of the zzso zzso in the brains of zzso experimental zzso were significantly zzso 

Those data highlight zzso may work as a protective factor for cells against the damage effects of the zzso of abnormal forms of zzso besides its function as an agent for dynamic stabilization of zzso zzso
