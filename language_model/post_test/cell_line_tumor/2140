The role of X zzso inhibitor of zzso protein zzso factor 1 zzso in zzso zzso has been reported but the underlying mechanism remains zzso The present study was designed to examine the putative interaction between zzso and zzso and the functional importance of this interaction in regulation of zzso in human gastric and colon cancer zzso We first identified zzso as a novel target gene of zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and demonstrated that zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso at both zzso and protein levels, which acted mostly under the condition of high expression of zzso and was associated with the physical interaction between zzso and the zzso zzso We also found that the zzso of zzso led to zzso of zzso zzso via zzso modification in cells with or without DNA damage, which resulting in zzso nuclear zzso and its increased zzso activity and enhancing zzso zzso These findings suggest that a potential novel feedback loop exists between zzso and zzso zzso
