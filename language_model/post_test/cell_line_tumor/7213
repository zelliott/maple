zzso encodes the structural protein zzso which has a crucial role in the zzso barrier of the zzso zzso zzso or deregulation of zzso are associated with a variety of zzso diseases, including the Finnish type zzso zzso zzso This study analyzed a potential regulation of zzso by the zzso tumor zzso zzso Using an zzso zzso zzso cell line, it is shown that upon zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso becomes highly zzso zzso studies demonstrate that zzso can activate the zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis identify a zzso responsive element in the zzso promoter, which is required for the binding of zzso zzso zzso or deletion of this zzso responsive element completely abolished zzso of the zzso promoter by zzso Moreover, transgenic analysis demonstrates the requirement of the identified binding site to direct zzso expression of a reporter gene in transgenic mice, thus confirming the importance of this site for the regulation of zzso in zzso Finally, it is shown that zzso expression is lowest in zzso of mice that lack specifically the zzso zzso zzso but in comparison with zzso zzso it is also reduced in animals with disruption of the zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these data identify zzso as a direct zzso target for zzso and underline the importance of zzso as a key regulator in zzso zzso
