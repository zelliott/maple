The synthesis of a novel series of potent zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is described that contain a zzso capping group and a zzso unit that binds in the active zzso In zzso zzso for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso by the zzso zzso gave respective zzso values of zzso 85, 12, and 4100 zzso exhibiting class I selectivity and potent zzso of zzso Both zzso and zzso rings are shown to be effective replacements for the zzso ring present in many other zzso previously reported, an example of each ring system at 1 zzso causing an increase in zzso zzso zzso in the human cell lines zzso and zzso and an increase in cell death consistent with induction of zzso zzso of the growth of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines by zzso was observed, with respective zzso values of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
