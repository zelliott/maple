Ewing zzso is a rare zzso occurring in childhood and adolescence which has a prognosis of about 50% long-term zzso survival, depending on risk factors such as tumor volume, initial zzso at the time of diagnosis and tumor response to zzso zzso In order to tailor therapy to the individual patient, new zzso factors need to be zzso In this study, we showed that zzso and zzso D kill Ewing tumor cells zzso cell line) mainly via a zzso zzso Both drugs induced a significant zzso zzso which can be detected with a new zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that induction of cell death and zzso zzso is zzso by similar concentration ranges of both zzso In addition to the cell line, zzso zzso was also shown during zzso stimulation of freshly isolated cells from tumor zzso In conclusion, zzso D and zzso zzso zzso zzso in a Ewing tumor cell line and in freshly isolated tumor cells, causing drug-induced cell zzso Thus, determination of zzso zzso might be a suitable method for drug sensitivity testing in patients with Ewing tumors before initiating zzso This zzso could therefore help zzso therapy in future tumor zzso
