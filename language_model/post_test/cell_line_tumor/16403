To explore the role of zzso signaling zzso in invasive zzso zzso transitional cell zzso 

The expressions of zzso zzso and zzso were detected in 36 cases of invasive zzso zzso and 10 cases of normal zzso samples by real-time zzso chain reaction zzso and Western zzso Then zzso zzso and its blank zzso zzso were zzso into zzso cell zzso And the expressions of three zzso target genes were measured by real-time zzso and Western zzso Furthermore, cell zzso cell zzso and cell cycle were analyzed respectively by zzso zzso and flow zzso 

Compared with normal zzso samples, the higher levels of both zzso and protein of zzso and zzso were detected in invasive zzso zzso while there was a lower expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso expression levels of zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso folds respectively higher than those of normal zzso In zzso zzso cell, the expression of zzso was zzso folds higher than that of the blank zzso control group while the expression of zzso declined to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso obviously promoted cell proliferation in zzso cell zzso zzso zzso 

zzso gene may function as an zzso by regulating zzso in invasive zzso and its zzso zzso promotes cell zzso
