Bone zzso proteins zzso are members of the zzso zzso of signaling molecules and have previously been shown to be associated with the biological behavior of zzso However, to date the effects and molecular mechanisms of zzso on zzso progression are zzso We performed real-time zzso and western zzso analysis to characterize the zzso expression of zzso in zzso cell zzso We used a zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso to zzso zzso cell lines with relatively low zzso zzso expression to determine the functional relevance of zzso zzso to zzso cell growth and migration zzso and zzso and further investigated the expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso As a result, zzso cell proliferation and migration were significantly diminished by zzso indicated by zzso and zzso zzso and cell zzso was markedly zzso indicated by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso When zzso expression was zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso in zzso zzso In addition, the tumor volumes in zzso and zzso subcutaneous nude mouse models treated with zzso were significantly smaller compared to those of the zzso zzso These results suggested that the enhanced expression of zzso in zzso cells by zzso exerted zzso effects on growth and migration of zzso cells possibly via blockade of the zzso signaling zzso
