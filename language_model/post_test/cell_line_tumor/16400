To explore the zzso effect of zzso zzso and related mechanism induced by zzso in zzso and provide laboratory rationales for the clinical treatment of zzso of zzso with zzso in the zzso 

zzso cells were cultured to zzso phase and transferred to zzso zzso There were a series of zzso concentration zzso 100, 10, 1, zzso and 0 zzso and cultured for 24, 48 and 72 zzso After the addition of zzso zzso for 2 h at each time point, optical density values were obtained from the cell growth zzso zzso depending on time and drug concentration and the half growth zzso concentration zzso values zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso (1 zzso for 0, 24, 48 and 72 h zzso Then flow zzso zzso was used to detect zzso zzso cell line was treated with zzso for 24 and 48 h to extract the total zzso The zzso expressions of zzso zzso bid, zzso and zzso gene at the time point of 48 h and the zzso zzso expression at 24 h were detected by reverse zzso zzso The protein expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected at each time point with Western zzso zzso 

zzso cell line showed significant growth zzso effect depending on time and zzso And the 24, 48, 72 h zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells stained zzso and zzso examined by zzso demonstrated that the proportion of zzso positive cells gradually increased with time zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso all P zzso zzso And the results of real-time fluorescent zzso proved that zzso decreased the expression of zzso gene obviously (24 zzso zzso zzso zzso 48 zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso both P zzso zzso but had little effects on the gene expressions of zzso bid, zzso and zzso The Western zzso results further confirmed that the protein expressions of zzso and zzso decreased with time while zzso and zzso zzso showed no obvious zzso But zzso zzso increased zzso 

zzso displays significant zzso effects in zzso cell zzso The mechanism may be the direct zzso of zzso through the zzso of zzso And the zzso zzso is probably not regulated by zzso zzso
