The aim of this study was to study the expression of zzso gene and zzso in its promoter region in the lung cancer and to investigate the relationship between zzso of the zzso gene and DNA zzso of the zzso promoter region in lung cancer cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used to examine the zzso expression in specimens from 3 lung cancer cell lines and 16 lung cancer patients zzso zzso and adjacent normal zzso MSP was used to analyze the zzso status of the zzso promoter zzso We also investigated the role of restoring zzso expression by using a DNA zzso zzso zzso in suppressing invasion of lung cancer cell zzso No expression of the zzso gene was detected in the 3 lung cancer cell zzso In the 16 lung cancer patient samples, zzso expression was significantly lower in the tumor zzso than that in their adjacent normal zzso ( zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso protein expression showed that in the lung cancer zzso zzso protein expression was also significantly lower than that in their adjacent normal zzso In the two lung cancer cell lines zzso zzso that lack the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso agent zzso treatment was able to reactivate the zzso gene zzso but not zzso In conclusion, zzso leads to zzso of the zzso gene in human lung zzso cell zzso zzso of the zzso promoter and loss of zzso expression in lung cancer cell lines are independent zzso zzso may be a potential tumor zzso in human lung zzso
