Ethanol and zzso radiation exposure are independently known to cause tissue damage through various zzso The zzso and zzso metabolism of ethanol, the latter via the zzso zzso zzso zzso produces free zzso which zzso cellular zzso zzso zzso radiation exposure has been shown to induce zzso zzso DNA damage, protein zzso and zzso zzso It was zzso that cells zzso by ethanol will be susceptible to additional zzso such as by radiation through increased zzso zzso In this investigation, cultured liver cells zzso human zzso liver zzso were exposed to ethanol, followed by zzso zzso The zzso status of the cells was evaluated by an array of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were measured by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were determined zzso zzso was evaluated by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The data showed that combined treatment with ethanol and radiation resulted in the lowest levels of zzso and highest zzso level compared with the zzso The zzso activity was lower in the combined exposure groups, when compared with the single agent exposure groups, and the zzso zzso activity was the highest in the combined exposure groups and lowest in the zzso These findings suggest that a combination of ethanol and zzso radiation results in greater toxicity in zzso through elevated zzso zzso
