zzso insulin action plays a major role in the zzso of type 2 diabetes, a chronic zzso disorder which zzso a tremendous burden to morbidity and mortality zzso zzso the molecular mechanisms underlying insulin resistance would improve setting up preventive and treatment strategies of type 2 zzso zzso of zzso an zzso zzso zzso causes impaired insulin signaling and action in cultured human liver zzso In addition, zzso zzso levels are zzso in liver of spontaneously insulin zzso diabetic zzso zzso To investigate the role of zzso in human zzso we measured zzso zzso expression levels in peripheral whole blood cells of 84 non-obese and 46 obese zzso individuals as well as of 98 obese patients with type 2 zzso We also measured zzso zzso expression in human zzso cells cultured under different zzso zzso In zzso studies indicated that zzso zzso levels were significantly reduced from non obese control to obese non diabetic and to obese diabetic individuals ( zzso In zzso studies showed that zzso zzso levels was reduced in zzso cells exposed to high zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso zzso as compared to cells exposed to low zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, our data indicate that zzso is zzso in patients with type 2 diabetes and suggest that this association is, at least partly, secondary to zzso Further studies are needed to understand whether zzso zzso plays a zzso role in maintaining and/or zzso the zzso abnormalities of diabetic zzso
