B cell differentiation is controlled by a complex network of zzso zzso zzso How zzso to this network alter B cell fate remains poorly zzso Here we show that classical zzso zzso tumor cells, which originate from mature B cells, have lost the B cell zzso as a result of zzso expression of zzso zzso The B zzso zzso factor program was disrupted by zzso of the zzso proteins zzso and zzso Both factors antagonized the function of the B zzso zzso factor zzso As a result, expression of genes specific to B cells was lost and expression of genes not normally associated with the B lineage was zzso These data demonstrate the plasticity of mature human zzso cells and offer an explanation for the unique classical zzso zzso zzso
