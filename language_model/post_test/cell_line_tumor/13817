The tumor zzso zzso regulates gene transcription, DNA damage response, zzso and cancer development, but its role in melanoma is zzso In this study, we investigated the expression pattern of zzso in melanoma and assessed its zzso zzso Using tissue zzso consisting of zzso cases of zzso zzso for the training set and 247 for the validation zzso and 105 cases of zzso we found that zzso expression was significantly reduced in zzso melanoma compared to common zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and primary melanoma zzso zzso survival curve and zzso Cox zzso analyses showed that reduced zzso expression was associated with a poorer zzso zzso survival in primary melanoma zzso and zzso melanoma patients zzso zzso Cox zzso analyses indicated that zzso expression was an independent zzso marker for primary zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso wound healing zzso showed that enforced zzso expression inhibited but zzso zzso enhanced melanoma cell migration, suggesting that zzso might regulate melanoma zzso Finally, we showed that zzso of zzso in melanoma cells resulted in significantly increased zzso Our data indicate that zzso may serve as a potential zzso for melanoma patient outcome as well as a potential therapeutic zzso
