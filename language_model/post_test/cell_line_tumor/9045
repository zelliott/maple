zzso and cancer cells develop resistance to more than one agent as a consequence of being exposed to ineffective levels of the agent for a prolonged period of zzso The resistance of these cells is zzso by zzso zzso pumps that have the ability to zzso a large variety of unrelated zzso This review discusses the main types of zzso resistant zzso zzso systems of bacteria and cancer cells, and shows the similarity of specific zzso systems between them with respect to given agents that inhibit zzso thus rendering these cells once more susceptible to agents to which they had developed zzso
