zzso of circulating melanoma cells zzso for zzso status can provide a strategy for zzso serial zzso monitoring in patients receiving zzso zzso We aimed to establish a method for zzso zzso analysis at zzso level and we applied it in a cohort of zzso zzso 

We established a sensitive method for detection of zzso zzso at zzso 600 in whole blood samples of patients with melanoma, positive for presence of zzso The method based on selective zzso of zzso sequences by taking the advantage of the presence of a zzso zzso restriction site located at the site of zzso 

In a serial dilution experiment zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso the method allowed to detect zzso zzso till a dilution of zzso zzso blood zzso samples resulting positive for zzso and matched tissue specimens from 21 different zzso stage IV melanoma patients were zzso A zzso zzso correspondence between zzso status in tissue and zzso specimens was zzso In a patient (whose melanoma showed to bear the zzso zzso zzso in blood, but not at tissue zzso our analysis showed that blood samples with zzso evidence for zzso were zzso for zzso status under zzso conditions, suggestive of zzso of zzso 

The method reported here represents a rapid approach for determination of zzso status in the blood of patients with zzso
