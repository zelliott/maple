zzso zzso zzso the most widely used human tumor marker, is a heavily zzso protein zzso by a wide range of zzso It has been indicated that zzso might be a useful target for human zzso zzso zzso zzso for research as well as clinical trials demands a continuous source of zzso protein zzso In a zzso research program to provide a reliable source for large production of zzso we converted the zzso zzso zzso into a zzso protein by zzso zzso We made the zzso zzso protein by introducing a new stop zzso at 99 zzso upstream of the original stop zzso in zzso zzso by zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso especially those destined for administration to human trials is zzso zzso To produce zzso with the same zzso pattern and zzso as the native zzso expressed by human tumors in zzso the truncated zzso zzso which does not zzso the last zzso zzso acid zzso domain was zzso into zzso a human colon zzso cell line by the calcium zzso zzso zzso zzso were selected and zzso zzso zzso from the cells was verified by analysis of the zzso culture zzso for zzso zzso As determined by zzso 16 zzso of zzso zzso was zzso per 106 zzso within 48 zzso an increase over 40 times relative to the zzso zzso The size of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso in our experiment is identical to that of reference zzso zzso from tumors and is fully zzso It seems that the zzso zzso does not affect zzso zzso in zzso zzso It is predicted that human cancer zzso using zzso zzso expressed in this system would be more effective than the commercial protein which is usually prepared from bacterial or other zzso expression zzso
