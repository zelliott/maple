zzso zzso zzso is a zzso disease despite its seemingly uniform zzso zzso of The Cancer Genome zzso zzso gene expression data has unveiled the existence of distinct gene expression signature underlying discrete zzso zzso Recent conflicting findings proposed that zzso zzso exclusively regulates zzso growth or invasion but not zzso We showed that zzso of zzso by zzso decoy zzso in a zzso cell line resembling the zzso zzso of zzso reduces its growth, invasion and zzso while promoting zzso in zzso In an zzso human zzso mouse model, zzso of zzso diminishes the zzso zzso and growth of the zzso zzso zzso cells in the brain and significantly prolonged survival of zzso zzso We demonstrated that the zzso nature of zzso was due to its suppression of multiple tumor zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In particular, zzso zzso experiments identified zzso zzso zzso and zzso as invasion regulatory genes in our zzso zzso zzso zzso By interrogating the zzso we noted that zzso of many direct targets of zzso was associated with significantly poorer patient zzso Thus, our study zzso a novel role for zzso in regulating zzso and suggests that zzso may be a zzso regulator of zzso
