Although more than 20 putative members have been assigned to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso family, their zzso and biological roles, with the exception of the zzso are not fully zzso In this article, we show that zzso members, such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso interact with zzso an important regulator of zzso through their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso class II zzso zzso zzso locus protein from zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso Among such zzso zzso had a strong affinity to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso interference resulted in zzso of the zzso process under zzso conditions and upon invasive bacterial infections, leading to enhancement of the zzso zzso process of group A zzso zzso recruited to the zzso membrane zzso containing group A zzso and zzso zzso from zzso suggesting that zzso senses bacterial infection and permits the initiation of zzso zzso zzso In addition to a role as a negative regulator of the zzso process, zzso physically associates with the class C zzso zzso complex, thereby zzso regulating maturation of the zzso and zzso zzso these results provide novel evidence that zzso and possibly other members of the zzso family, plays a crucial role in zzso of the zzso and its maturation by the association with regulatory zzso such as zzso and the class C zzso zzso zzso
