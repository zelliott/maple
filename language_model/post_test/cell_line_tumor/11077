Identification of large numbers of proteins from complex biological samples is a continuing challenge in the area of quantitative zzso We introduce here a simple and reliable zzso mass tagging technique using our recently developed solid phase mass tagging zzso When coupled with two-dimensional liquid zzso zzso zzso trap mass zzso zzso this method allows enhanced protein identification when tested on samples from zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso coli zzso grown to either zzso or stationary phase, and the membrane zzso from established breast cancer cell lines zzso and zzso were used as model systems in these zzso In both experiments, the numbers of total identified proteins are at least twice the numbers identified from a single tagging zzso The sample complexity can be effectively reduced with corresponding increases in protein identification using the zzso zzso The strategy described here represents a potentially powerful technique for large-scale qualitative and quantitative zzso zzso
