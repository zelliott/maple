zzso C virus zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is a component of the replication complex associated with various cellular zzso It has been reported that G protein zzso zzso 2 zzso is a potential zzso factor, as identified in a zzso zzso screens of human zzso library using viral proteins as zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrated the interaction between zzso and zzso in zzso cells by zzso analysis and found that both zzso and zzso expressed zzso zzso with zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso study demonstrated that zzso I of zzso and zzso domain of zzso are responsible for the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cell lines suppressed the replication of zzso zzso which can be rescued by the expression of an zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso enhanced the association of zzso with a zzso cellular factor, human zzso membrane zzso protein A zzso while zzso of zzso disrupted interaction between zzso and zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso acts as a bridge between zzso and zzso and is required for efficient zzso zzso
