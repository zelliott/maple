zzso stretch is frequently observed in the zzso Both zzso stretch and zzso stretch can induce cell death and zzso trafficking, but zzso zzso zzso cell zzso functions are much less responsive to zzso than to zzso zzso zzso zzso under zzso stretch may be partly zzso 

The aim of this study was to explore the zzso zzso and functional changes under zzso stretch zzso 

We used zzso cells as a model of zzso type II zzso We assessed zzso content and cell viability by zzso zzso at various zzso zzso and time zzso Specifically, we used scanning electron zzso to explore the possible biological mechanisms used by zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso Finally, we measured zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein by real-time zzso and Western zzso to evaluate cellular zzso zzso 

The results showed that the magnitude of zzso stretch was the primary zzso of zzso cell death and zzso organization, but an extended duration of high zzso zzso zzso change in surface zzso had no cumulative effects on cell death and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso under zzso stretch conditions may explain this interesting phenomenon zzso After cell zzso zzso alpha expression in zzso cells was influenced not only by stretch magnitude but also by stretch zzso 

Under zzso stretch conditions, zzso cells undergo zzso and functional zzso They can survive stress failure from zzso by zzso their body to zzso the zzso During this complex course of zzso cellular function was partly zzso
