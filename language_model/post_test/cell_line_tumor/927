Growth zzso by transforming growth factor zzso 1 has been attributed to the induction of zzso zzso zzso among which zzso plays a major role in many biological zzso In the present study, two new zzso zzso for the induction of zzso by zzso 1 were identified in a human zzso zzso cell line zzso expressing zzso zzso After addition of zzso 1 to zzso cells, a marked increase of the zzso expression preceded the zzso of DNA zzso zzso of zzso regulatory factor zzso a known zzso factor for zzso promoter, was elevated just before or in parallel with the increase of zzso zzso of zzso zzso inhibited the increase in zzso in zzso cells treated with zzso 1 and partially released the cells from the growth arrest by zzso zzso zzso of zzso a member of the zzso zzso protein family, also markedly increased after addition of zzso zzso zzso protein was zzso to and accumulated in zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells, where zzso was zzso zzso When a zzso zzso protein was introduced into zzso of zzso cells, DNA synthesis was markedly inhibited in a zzso manner in the absence of zzso zzso Prior zzso of zzso small interfering zzso efficiently blocked decrease of DNA synthesis in zzso cells caused by zzso or zzso 1 and markedly inhibited expression of zzso protein in the zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso mediate growth zzso by zzso 1 via induction of zzso
