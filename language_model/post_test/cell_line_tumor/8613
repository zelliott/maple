zzso is widely presented in foods and produced through the degradation of zzso and zzso reaction during heat treatment of foods containing reducing zzso and zzso acids in an acid zzso However, controversial conclusions on the biological effects of zzso have been drawn in previous zzso zzso the main aim of this study was to investigate the zzso and zzso activities of zzso The zzso acid zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso were performed to evaluate the zzso capacity of zzso The results showed that zzso exhibited novel zzso activity by scavenging the zzso and zzso free zzso and inhibited the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso In the zzso zzso the reduction of zzso and zzso contents and the increase in zzso activities of zzso zzso and zzso were found in zzso zzso with zzso which demonstrated that zzso could prevent the zzso from the source to protect the zzso The zzso changes of zzso was also verified by observation using atomic force zzso The zzso effect of zzso on human cancer cell proliferation was investigated by zzso zzso flow zzso analysis, and the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The results showed that zzso displayed higher zzso activity on human melanoma zzso cells than other cell zzso Further investigation on the action mechanisms revealed that zzso could induce zzso cell zzso and zzso cell cycle zzso The zzso cell zzso that zzso induced was characterized by a zzso and zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso could be developed as a novel natural zzso with potential applications in cancer zzso
