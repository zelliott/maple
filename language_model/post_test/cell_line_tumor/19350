zzso are major regulators of prostate cell growth and zzso In the human zzso zzso are zzso in the form of zzso zzso zzso These zzso are formed by the two human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso X zzso is a zzso acid sensor controlling zzso and/or zzso cholesterol, zzso and zzso zzso In the present study, we report the expression of zzso in normal and cancer prostate zzso cells, and we demonstrate that its zzso by zzso acid or zzso zzso interferes with the levels of zzso and zzso zzso and protein in prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso also causes a drastic reduction of zzso zzso in these zzso These results point out zzso of zzso as negative regulators of zzso zzso expression in the zzso Finally, the zzso zzso zzso which is also an zzso of zzso zzso reduces the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso and zzso in an zzso manner in zzso zzso In conclusion, the present study identifies for the first time the zzso of zzso as important regulators of zzso metabolism in human prostate cancer zzso
