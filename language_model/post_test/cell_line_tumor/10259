The fragile zzso zzso zzso gene is a candidate tumor zzso zzso Recent studies have found that zzso protein is lost in zzso system zzso However, there is limited information on the effect of zzso on zzso and the regulation functions on zzso D1 in zzso 

zzso expression plasmids zzso the zzso gene were constructed and zzso into three groups in which zzso cells were also zzso We observed the proliferation of zzso by using the zzso method and flow zzso zzso zzso ability was then determined via zzso chamber zzso In addition, to examine whether zzso zzso and protein expression were correlated with zzso D1 zzso we used real-time zzso and western zzso 

The zzso zzso was decreased significantly ( zzso according to zzso showing that proliferation had been inhibited and the zzso ratio after zzso had increased significantly ( zzso The amount of cells which passed the filter in the zzso chamber was significantly less ( zzso The expression of zzso D1 zzso and the protein was decreased from the original cell line ( zzso 

The results suggest that increased zzso gene activity can promote zzso of zzso and reduce the expression level of zzso zzso
