Recently, we isolated a subset of zzso from zzso zzso that we designated zzso and demonstrated that it induced zzso zzso in cells via G zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso However, active components responsible for zzso zzso and the corresponding zzso were zzso Active zzso for zzso zzso of zzso were analyzed by liquid zzso zzso mass zzso and zzso mass zzso zzso The corresponding zzso investigated through gene expression zzso We found that zzso contains zzso zzso and other zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso major zzso protein and zzso storage proteins are protein components of zzso zzso induced zzso zzso in zzso rat zzso cells zzso with human zzso receptors with high affinity in order of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso action in cells expressing zzso or zzso zzso of binding sites in the zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso zzso acted via zzso toxin zzso and zzso G zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso had no effects on other receptors zzso In human zzso vein zzso cells zzso zzso zzso cell proliferation and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso migration and zzso zzso In zzso cells zzso induced zzso changes, which were blocked by zzso zzso zzso zzso contains zzso zzso zzso in complexes with zzso proteins and could be useful in the development of drugs targeting zzso zzso
