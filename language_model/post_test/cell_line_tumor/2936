zzso of zzso D zzso 1 or zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso The same results were found with zzso inactive zzso of zzso zzso indicating that the zzso activity of zzso is not required for zzso zzso zzso zzso with this, zzso did not alter zzso zzso The reduction in zzso activity in zzso zzso cells was due to reduced protein level, but not zzso level, of the zzso zzso This zzso zzso degradation was zzso by zzso machinery, but zzso zzso and zzso were not involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso cells, especially in the zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso inhibited zzso zzso which is known to be important for zzso zzso In zzso the current data indicate that zzso zzso can zzso zzso activity through the acceleration of zzso degradation by zzso zzso
