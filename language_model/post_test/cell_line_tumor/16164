We previously reported that the zzso zzso zzso positively regulates proliferation in zzso by stabilizing zzso a zzso zzso for zzso To explore whether this role of zzso extends to other cellular systems, we tested the effects of zzso of zzso in several human prostate and breast models, including zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso inhibited proliferation in prostate cancer zzso zzso and zzso cells, which was similar to the pattern established in zzso in that it was due to decreased progression from zzso to S phase and associated with a stabilization of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso However, in contrast to previous findings in zzso the stabilization of zzso upon zzso depletion was not associated with changes in the levels of the zzso zzso zzso could also regulate the growth of immortalized zzso breast zzso cells through a similar zzso This regulatory pattern was lost, though, in breast cancer zzso and zzso cells and in prostate zzso zzso zzso Of interest, the transformation of zzso through zzso of an zzso form of Ras disrupted the zzso regulation of cell growth and of levels of zzso and zzso Thus, the cell context appears zzso for the ability of zzso to regulate cell proliferation and zzso zzso This may occur through both zzso dependent and independent zzso Moreover, a complete loss of zzso function on cell growth may arise as a result of zzso transformation of zzso
