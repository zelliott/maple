zzso of zzso double minute 2 zzso expression is thought to be a zzso of resistance to zzso gene therapy for zzso Previous studies have revealed that zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation through direct binding to zzso In addition, zzso expressed zzso was reported to interact with zzso in both the nucleus and zzso by which zzso indirectly inhibited zzso zzso Based on the known molecular properties of the zzso zzso it was speculated that zzso of zzso may protect zzso zzso protein from zzso zzso and, thus, improve the effect of delivering therapeutic zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, we constructed a zzso zzso zzso expressing both the zzso and zzso genes zzso and compared its zzso activity in human gastric cancer with that of a single gene zzso for zzso zzso In the in zzso and in zzso experiments, we observed that treatment with zzso resulted in a stronger zzso response compared to that obtained using zzso Moreover, the zzso response of the zzso zzso was obtained not only in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso but also in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso which were initially resistant to zzso gene transfer, indicating that zzso of zzso also expanded the utility of zzso gene zzso Furthermore, in an zzso nude mouse model of human gastric cancer, we found that the survival benefit was greater after zzso treatment than after zzso Taken together, the data presented here demonstrate that zzso of zzso enhances the therapeutic efficacy of zzso zzso gene transfer in models of human gastric cancer and support the use of this strategy for cancer zzso
