zzso melanoma zzso with drugs such as zzso zzso or zzso zzso are associated with significant toxicity and low efficacy zzso These facts reinforce the need for development of novel agents or zzso zzso zzso is a small zzso orally zzso well tolerated and currently under clinical trials as an zzso zzso Our aim was to investigate a possible zzso therapeutic strategy using zzso and zzso on human zzso melanoma cells and its underlying zzso zzso was evaluated using zzso reduction, zzso zzso leakage and neutral red zzso zzso for different zzso and combinations of both agents, at 24 and 48 zzso zzso was also assessed using zzso zzso and through the evaluation of zzso 8, 9, and 3 zzso We demonstrated, for the first time, that combination of zzso and zzso significantly increases zzso for clinically relevant zzso This combination seems to act zzso in zzso membrane integrity, but also causing zzso and zzso zzso When using the lowest zzso concentration (10 zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso overall zzso effects and zzso signs of zzso All combinations studied enhanced zzso 8, 9, and 3 activities, suggesting the involvement of both intrinsic and zzso zzso zzso The possibility that zzso zzso by zzso alone or in combination with zzso involves zzso zzso zzso was discarded and results confirmed that zzso stress is only involved in zzso after treatment with zzso zzso Being melanoma a very zzso cancer, this combination seems to hold promise as a new therapeutic strategy for zzso
