zzso gene product plays a role in cell transformation and tumor progression in human breast, zzso zzso and prostate zzso zzso expression was evaluated in a series of 76 surgically zzso zzso cell lung zzso to investigate its clinical zzso zzso is scarcely zzso in normal zzso whereas in the initial stages of cell zzso it becomes consistently expressed with evident zzso in zzso zzso zzso and in associated zzso zzso zzso zzso can be detected both in the zzso and less commonly in the zzso the zzso location zzso with tumor zzso with zzso zzso being most prevalent in zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso being associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso Nuclear import and export signals are present in the zzso coding zzso zzso the different zzso location of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso correlated with tumor grade zzso zzso zzso when considering only the zzso a stronger association was found zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein evaluation in lung cancer cell lines confirmed the expression of the gene and the dual zzso location of the protein in lung zzso The data here reported suggest that, in zzso cell lung zzso zzso may be an indicator of cell zzso thus having important zzso and clinical zzso
