To identify zzso relevant zzso zzso target genes in prostate cancer cells, we have established zzso zzso zzso cell lines expressing either zzso its zzso counterpart zzso or zzso zzso zzso analyses of these cells revealed that vascular zzso growth factor zzso was zzso expressed in the engineered zzso zzso of zzso by zzso likely contributes to kidney zzso during development and zzso zzso such as zzso are associated with the zzso syndrome zzso characterized by zzso zzso Recent zzso studies have demonstrated that the zzso zzso binds zzso promoter sequences and zzso regulates zzso reporter zzso However, regulation of zzso is complex, involving both zzso and zzso zzso This study examined the ability of hormone and zzso D treatment to alter zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso prostate cancer zzso The rationale of this study was based on a previous finding that enhancement of zzso expression in zzso cells occurred only in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso One possible explanation for these results was that zzso stabilized zzso zzso so that it accumulated to higher zzso This hypothesis was tested by treating engineered zzso cells with zzso D zzso zzso and then measuring zzso zzso levels by quantitative real-time zzso The combined effects of zzso or zzso and hormone were tested in these message stability zzso and also in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The results indicated that zzso is unable to regulate zzso zzso or stabilize zzso zzso in zzso prostate cancer zzso However our observations are also consistent with zzso zzso having both zzso and zzso effects on zzso zzso levels in the presence of zzso These studies of zzso regulation by zzso and zzso by zzso suggest an important role for zzso in both normal and zzso zzso
