zzso is an zzso drug commonly used to treat type 2 zzso The aim of the study was to determine whether zzso regulates zzso zzso through the orphan nuclear zzso small zzso partner zzso zzso 

We assessed the regulation of zzso zzso gene expression by Northern zzso analysis with zzso and zzso containing a zzso active form of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and evaluated zzso zzso and zzso promoter activities via transient zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso using zzso zzso was conducted to characterize the zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene expression in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production was measured in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso gene expression was induced by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene expression was abolished by zzso containing the dominant negative form of zzso zzso as well as by compound zzso zzso inhibited zzso nuclear zzso zzso promoter activity of zzso and zzso and the zzso was blocked with zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso by zzso containing zzso zzso inhibited zzso repression of zzso zzso zzso gene zzso Furthermore, oral administration of zzso increased zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso decreased blood zzso levels and zzso zzso gene expression in zzso zzso 

We have concluded that zzso zzso zzso zzso through zzso regulation of zzso
