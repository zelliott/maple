The fusion protein zzso consists of the zzso domain of the zzso human tissue factor zzso tissue factor, zzso and the zzso zzso zzso a zzso of the surface protein zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso cells of tumor zzso zzso zzso activates blood zzso within tumor zzso resulting in tumor vessel zzso and subsequent tumor growth zzso The zzso mechanism of the zzso therapy approach was verified by zzso the reduced tumor zzso with zzso zzso the reduced relative tumor blood volume by zzso iron zzso magnetic resonance imaging, and by in zzso of zzso bleeding with fluorescent zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso within the tumor was proven by visualizing the distribution of the zzso protein by zzso zzso zzso zzso Use of these zzso vascular and molecular imaging tools helped to assess the therapeutic effect even at real time and to detect zzso tumors directly after the first zzso zzso This emphasizes the importance of imaging within clinical studies with zzso The imaging techniques as used here have zzso within a wider scope of therapeutic regimes interfering with tumor zzso Some even are useful to obtain zzso zzso in personalized cancer zzso
