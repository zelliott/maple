Numerous zzso and nuclear proteins involved in zzso DNA zzso protein translation, or iron zzso depend on zzso zzso zzso yet their assembly is poorly zzso Here, we identify and characterize human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as components of the zzso zzso protein assembly zzso zzso zzso associates with either zzso or zzso and the zzso factor zzso The zzso complex binds to and zzso assembly of most zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso specifically matures iron regulatory protein 1 zzso which is critical for cellular iron zzso Surprisingly, a second layer of iron regulation involves the stabilization of zzso by zzso binding or upon depletion of zzso or zzso even though zzso lacks an zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso assist different branches of zzso protein assembly and intimately link this process to cellular iron regulation via zzso zzso cluster maturation and zzso zzso
