zzso is a licensing factor for DNA zzso the function of which is tightly controlled to maintain zzso zzso Previous studies have indicated that the cell zzso degradation of zzso is triggered at S phase to prevent zzso In this study, we found that zzso is zzso upon DNA damage induced by either zzso treatment or zzso zzso Although the zzso degradation of zzso was zzso the zzso degradation of zzso was zzso This indicates that the cells treated with zzso zzso the checkpoint pathway, which differs from that triggered by zzso A recent study has suggested that zzso is zzso zzso and zzso at the zzso boundary in the normal cell zzso Treatment with zzso a zzso zzso inhibited the degradation of zzso and resulted in the zzso of the zzso form of zzso after zzso zzso In the case of zzso treatment, zzso of zzso induced the recruitment of zzso to a zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of zzso after zzso treatment zzso the zzso of DNA zzso These results indicate that zzso is a target zzso of the cell cycle checkpoint in zzso DNA zzso
