In several types of cancer, zzso of zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso tumor cell growth and zzso zzso Previous reports demonstrated that this zzso promotes growth, survival, and chemotherapy resistance in zzso cell and small cell lung cancer zzso But the importance of zzso signaling has not been explored in pulmonary zzso In this study, our objective was to establish the role of the zzso signal zzso zzso in pulmonary zzso zzso 

Human pulmonary zzso zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso to 100 zzso a well-known zzso zzso or zzso with zzso small interfering zzso (75 zzso Cellular proliferation was measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso for up to 8 zzso Western zzso analysis was performed for expression of active, zzso zzso zzso total zzso zzso and the neuroendocrine markers zzso A and zzso zzso 

Treatment of zzso cells with zzso significantly reduced tumor cell growth zzso Similarly, zzso small interfering zzso zzso led to diminished tumor cell proliferation zzso A zzso decrease in zzso A and zzso zzso production was observed with both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was reduced at all time points by transient zzso small interfering zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso plays a role in both tumor cell growth and neuroendocrine hormone zzso in human pulmonary zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso or a downstream zzso of this zzso may provide therapeutic approaches for patients with pulmonary zzso zzso
