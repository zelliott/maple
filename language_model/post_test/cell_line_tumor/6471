zzso zzso zzso although rare, is one of the leading causes of zzso deaths in children, with tumors essentially zzso to existing zzso We have identified zzso to be a potential therapeutic target in zzso due to gene amplification and high levels of zzso expression in some tumor samples, as well as zzso zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso To evaluate the therapeutic potential of strategies targeting the zzso we have carried out in zzso and in zzso zzso studies using the specific zzso inhibitor zzso A modest zzso effect was seen in zzso with zzso values of 5 to 6 zzso and concurrent zzso of zzso zzso zzso targeting of zzso with short interfering zzso decreased cell zzso diminished downstream signaling through zzso zzso zzso and induced zzso arrest, effects zzso by zzso both in the absence and presence of zzso zzso of zzso zzso were observed after treatment with zzso by expression profiling and Western zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, suggesting zzso of an alternative zzso zzso Treatment of zzso with the zzso inhibitor zzso showed additional effects targeting the zzso protein zzso pathway, and zzso of the zzso inhibitor zzso with zzso resulted in a highly synergistic interaction in zzso and increased efficacy after 14 days therapy in zzso compared with either agent zzso These data provide evidence that zzso of zzso in combination with other targeted agents, may be a useful and novel therapeutic strategy in zzso
