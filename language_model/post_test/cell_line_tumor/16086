zzso zzso is known to induce zzso in several types of cancer zzso However, little is known about its activity in zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the zzso properties of zzso zzso in zzso human zzso cancer zzso cells in zzso We used a variety of methods to measure cell zzso the resistance index zzso of zzso cellular zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso expression and zzso and the zzso expression of several genes implicated in drug resistance including zzso zzso zzso repair zzso gene 1 zzso zzso resistance zzso lung resistance protein zzso and zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso cells and caused significant zzso Western zzso revealed that zzso zzso also increased zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso After treatment by zzso zzso for 48 zzso the zzso of zzso and the zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso were all significantly zzso Furthermore, blockade of zzso signal zzso decreased zzso cell rates and dramatically elevated the zzso expression of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso We therefore conclude that zzso zzso zzso zzso and reduces zzso resistance in zzso cells and thus causes significant growth zzso zzso This mechanism appears to involve zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
