The aim of the present study was to evaluate the underlying zzso mechanisms of zzso a major biologically active component of zzso zzso in human breast zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso zzso extract by zzso gel column zzso and its chemical structure was identified via zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited cell growth in zzso and zzso zzso zzso induced zzso DNA zzso formation of zzso bodies, nuclear zzso and a DNA zzso in zzso zzso zzso triggered the zzso of zzso family zzso zzso caused zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso bid zzso and release of zzso c and zzso In addition, zzso decreased the expression of zzso zzso protein and increased expression of zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso the proliferation of zzso cells through induction of zzso which is zzso by a zzso zzso zzso
