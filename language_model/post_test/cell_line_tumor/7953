One of the hallmarks of zzso is zzso zzso linked to zzso of zzso zzso zzso like zzso loss of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso growth zzso zzso Since the zzso tumor zzso zzso is zzso in most human zzso due to gene zzso or defective zzso zzso zzso we now investigated in human zzso zzso breast zzso zzso cells, whether single treatment with the zzso zzso pharmacological inhibitor zzso transient zzso zzso interference or stable zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso loss of surface zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso function increased zzso of zzso and zzso zzso However, all these effects were much more pronounced in cells zzso zzso with the dominant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which also showed loss of zzso zzso and extensive zzso zzso zzso these results support the notion that the zzso zzso zzso exerts a gain of zzso function by promoting disruption of zzso zzso contacts and zzso of proliferation zzso Our data suggests that zzso shape and growth control are zzso affected depending on how zzso zzso function is impaired and whether partial or full tumor zzso activity is zzso
