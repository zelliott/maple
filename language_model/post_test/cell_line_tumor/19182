We describe here the regulation of zzso expression and side population zzso abundance in zzso human breast cancer zzso The level of zzso zzso and protein were increased in zzso zzso SP relative to zzso cells, and incubation with an zzso inhibitor or zzso short interfering zzso eliminated the zzso zzso The zzso zzso SP could generate a zzso population containing both SP and zzso cells in zzso In zzso zzso experiments showed that the zzso zzso SP has an increased ability to colonize the mouse zzso zzso zzso the zzso SP was depleted by a transforming growth zzso zzso zzso transition zzso and this effect was associated with a strong zzso of zzso gene zzso and an increased sensitivity to zzso zzso expression and SP abundance were restored upon the removal of transforming growth zzso and zzso of the cells to an zzso zzso zzso of zzso also reduced SP zzso but this effect was not accompanied by the loss of zzso zzso or zzso We conclude that zzso expression in zzso cells is regulated during an zzso and that the zzso effect reflects zzso regulation of zzso function by zzso as well as zzso repression of the zzso zzso
