We previously reported that zzso zzso zzso induced various types of cell death, depending on the target cancer cell zzso We investigated here what type of cell death is induced by zzso zzso in two human oral zzso cell zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso produced few zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso positive zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso cells, respectively, but failed to activate zzso zzso and zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso induced the formation of zzso zzso zzso by zzso orange zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso When zzso and zzso cells that had been zzso with expression zzso zzso the zzso protein 1 light chain 3 zzso gene fused to green fluorescent protein zzso were treated with zzso zzso fusion protein was accumulated as zzso dots in zzso zzso with zzso an inhibitor of zzso partially inhibited the zzso of zzso the formation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso may induce zzso cell death in zzso and zzso cells following the early stage of necrosis or zzso zzso
