zzso is a rare zzso of zzso The zzso of adequate cell models has limited our understanding of this zzso Here we describe and characterize a new human liver tumor cell line, zzso derived from an aggressive childhood zzso 

zzso cells were established using primary tumor zzso from a 5-year-old Caucasian female zzso This cell line has been maintained for more than 34 months and over 20 zzso and was characterized by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and molecular sequence zzso 

zzso were confirmed to originate from parental tumor cells, zzso zzso and express zzso markers and zzso zzso cells were able to form colonies in soft zzso zzso was demonstrated by induction of solid tumors after zzso capsule injection in zzso zzso zzso cells demonstrated a highly zzso zzso and a whole zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso imbalances in every zzso zzso analysis demonstrated loss of zzso at zzso zzso as is typical of zzso zzso Both zzso cells and the primary tumor contain a deletion of zzso zzso in zzso as has been seen in other zzso zzso The cell line expressed zzso protein in both full-length and partially deleted forms, and expressed zzso protein characteristic of zzso No zzso was detected in the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

This cell line, zzso is a valuable resource for the study of childhood liver cancer and may potentially provide a tool in the development of new zzso
