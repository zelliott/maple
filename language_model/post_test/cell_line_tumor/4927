zzso are a group of natural products from marine origin that can accumulate in shellfish and zzso zzso Recently, novel zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso have been zzso Their toxic potential towards experimental animals has been evaluated however their interaction with cellular systems is almost zzso This is the first report showing zzso the biological activity of zzso and zzso on zzso zzso and zzso of living cells and zzso the zzso activity relationship for this family of toxic zzso 

Fluorescent zzso was zzso to zzso and zzso any modification in zzso zzso Fluorescence values were obtained with zzso zzso and cells were zzso through zzso zzso For zzso evaluations, zzso zzso and zzso zzso was also zzso 

Data showed that zzso triggered a remarkable zzso effect on zzso zzso and also modifications in the shape of zzso In contrast, zzso did not evidence the same zzso 

Our findings point out that zzso the zzso zzso is a common target for zzso zzso and zzso but not for zzso and zzso this difference in activity is related to the presence or absence of an intact zzso ring in their zzso
