The intention of this study is to describe the impact and underlying potential basis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso phenomenon in patients with zzso prostate cancer zzso treated with zzso zzso 

We zzso identified 74 consecutive patients who received zzso chemotherapy at our zzso Patients were evaluated based on modified criteria from the zzso zzso Working Group regarding survival and zzso Additionally, two zzso zzso zzso derived from patients with advanced disease were analyzed for zzso zzso zzso 

The 74 patients were zzso into four groups: response, partial response, zzso zzso zzso and zzso Median survival in the zzso group zzso was 20 months and did not differ from the response group zzso The zzso group showed a maximum zzso zzso from baseline between zzso and zzso (between three and six weeks) followed by zzso decline zzso from the baseline level in seven of the eight zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso displayed a zzso and zzso increase in zzso activity by zzso and a zzso and zzso increase by zzso compared to the zzso zzso 

A considerable portion of zzso patients experience an initial zzso zzso under systemic zzso In this study, occurrence of zzso phenomenon did not impact zzso zzso should be continued a minimum of six weeks before removing patients from a zzso zzso We showed evidence that zzso with zzso and/or zzso itself can induce an initial zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso
