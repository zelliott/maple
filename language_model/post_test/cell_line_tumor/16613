zzso zzso is the front-line standard chemotherapy used for the treatment of pancreatic zzso however, zzso to zzso remains the major obstacle to the successful control of this zzso Both the expression levels and activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso are important features of zzso and/or cancer stem cell properties in multiple types of human zzso As one of the intrinsic properties of cancer stem cells is drug resistance, in this study, we examined the correlation between the level and activity of zzso zzso and zzso resistance in the zzso zzso cell line that contains high expression levels and activity of zzso We used small interfering zzso zzso to zzso zzso and investigate its potential role in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso markedly reduced zzso expression and activity and inhibited cell zzso Moreover, the combination of zzso and zzso significantly decreased cell zzso increased zzso cell death and increased the zzso of cells at the zzso compared to the zzso Our data also demonstrated that zzso expression and activity were significantly higher in the zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso compared to the parental zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso In the zzso zzso cells, the combination of zzso and zzso also showed a significant decrease in cell viability and an increase in zzso cell death, emphasizing the importance of zzso in both intrinsic and acquired zzso zzso This potentially powerful combination treatment of zzso and zzso warrants further investigation as an effective therapeutic regimen to overcome the resistance of pancreatic cancer to zzso
