The zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso is active against zzso zzso zzso lung cancer zzso however acquired resistance invariably develops over zzso zzso zzso have previously been implicated in only a third of resistant zzso We sought to evaluate alternative mechanisms of resistance and zzso strategies to overcome these in a cell line driven by zzso 

We selected the zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso zzso and derived resistant zzso that were able to grow in the presence of 1 zzso zzso These were analyzed for zzso zzso sensitivity to zzso in combination with other zzso and for zzso of alternative zzso zzso 

All zzso zzso resistant zzso clones lacked amplification or zzso in the zzso domain of zzso To evaluate if possible alternative zzso functioned as zzso tracks for downstream signaling zzso in these resistance cells, we performed of zzso zzso zzso array that demonstrated that zzso clones had higher zzso signals than zzso cells before and after exposure to zzso A functional approach of dual zzso zzso (with zzso with zzso zzso zzso was used as a secondary screen for possible zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were able to inhibit the growth of zzso zzso zzso confirming zzso zzso as a mechanism of zzso The removal of zzso from the culture media zzso zzso cells to zzso 

We identified zzso of zzso as a mechanism of resistance to zzso in zzso models of zzso zzso zzso If zzso zzso is confirmed as a zzso mechanism of zzso zzso resistance in zzso tumors, the use of zzso plus zzso zzso could be explored for this important cohort of zzso
