zzso are discussed as potent zzso due to efficient transfer of zzso zzso and zzso in selective zzso However, therapeutic zzso application requires knowledge on target structures to avoid undue zzso Previous work suggesting zzso zzso complexes to be involved in target cell zzso we aimed to control this hypothesis and to define target cell zzso zzso are rich in zzso that associate besides other molecules with zzso zzso of zzso zzso from rat tumor lines that differ only with respect to zzso and zzso revealed zzso of zzso associations, but also few preferential interactions like that of zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso These minor differences in zzso zzso strongly influence target cell selection in zzso and in zzso efficient zzso being seen in zzso cells and solid zzso zzso expressing the zzso complex are most readily taken up by zzso and zzso cells, zzso serving as a major zzso zzso of zzso was confirmed with zzso from an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso from the parental line, the latter zzso targeted zzso cells and in zzso the zzso zzso zzso experiments provided strong evidence that zzso occurs in zzso membrane zzso This is the first report on the zzso zzso web contributing to target cell selection such that predictions can be made on potential targets, which will facilitate tailoring zzso for drug zzso
