zzso zzso have been suggested as potential zzso agents in many clinical zzso Recent evidence indicates that zzso zzso zzso zzso bearing a different mechanism from that of traditional zzso zzso would be appropriate candidates for new zzso drug zzso In the present study, we describe the zzso zzso of zzso regulatory particles zzso zzso by zzso a zzso zzso analog zzso in our zzso Although zzso zzso zzso were reported to act as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso instead induced a rapid and marked zzso of zzso proteins without zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast to its parent compound, zzso which is a zzso zzso zzso zzso serves as an irreversible zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso resulting in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso protein zzso In addition, in a zzso zzso model of human lung cancer zzso treatment with zzso suppresses tumor growth in a manner associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso are novel zzso zzso zzso with great potential for zzso drug zzso
