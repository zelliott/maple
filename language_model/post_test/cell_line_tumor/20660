zzso signaling controls cellular differentiation and zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso signaling plays an important role in the zzso and progression of a growing number of zzso zzso We investigated the effect of zzso zzso on human zzso zzso zzso In five human zzso cell lines, it was found that zzso had relatively high while zzso relatively low expression of zzso and the activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso of active zzso region of zzso zzso into zzso zzso cells enhanced cell growth and zzso including zzso single cell colony formation, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso also promoted zzso cell cycle zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso of zzso or by zzso inhibitor zzso in zzso zzso cells decreased cell growth capability and blocked cell cycle zzso Moreover, it was found that suppression of zzso zzso induced zzso cell zzso as demonstrated by zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso promotes human zzso cell growth and zzso which may contribute to the progression of this type of zzso zzso
