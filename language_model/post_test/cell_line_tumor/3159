Cancer invasion is an outcome of interactions of the cancer and the host zzso It is now becoming increasingly clear that zzso hormones have a huge influence on such zzso in various types of zzso zzso is known to aggravate the aggressiveness of the zzso cancer whereas zzso seems to act as a negative zzso Insight into the mode of zzso hormonal actions could come from the studies of its regulation of the zzso interactions between the zzso cancer and the normal zzso cells during the cancer zzso In this context, we report here that zzso promotes the zzso cancer invasion by inducing zzso interactions between the cancer and the zzso cells, zzso zzso stimulates tumor necrosis zzso expression from the zzso cancer cells, which, in turn, zzso the zzso expression of zzso growth factor zzso zzso the enhanced zzso zzso zzso invasion characteristic of the zzso cancer zzso Additionally, we demonstrate a close correlation of the invasion of zzso cancer cells with the expression and zzso of zzso zzso as well as the zzso of focal zzso zzso as the consequences of zzso zzso Thus, understanding of zzso interactions of cancer cells with host zzso cells can yield new insight into the architecture and function of cancer invasion and zzso leading to a development of a new cancer therapeutic zzso
