Novel zzso zzso zzso and their copper, zzso and palladium complexes are structurally characterized and reported along with the single crystal X-ray structures of three zzso and one zzso zzso All compounds were evaluated for their zzso potential against Triple zzso Breast Cancer zzso cells which have poor prognosis and no effective drugs to treat zzso All compounds exhibited zzso activity against these zzso Among the metal complexes zzso zzso active copper complexes were found to be more zzso The possible mechanism for such enhanced activity can be attributed to the generation of zzso stress, which was amenable for targeting through metal zzso
