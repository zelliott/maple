To investigate the role of the improved zzso zzso in prediction of intrinsic drug resistance of liver zzso 

The convenient zzso zzso was innovated to test the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso used alone or in zzso on 30 specimens of primary liver cancer without zzso All of the 30 zzso zzso were assembled in a zzso The used terminal zzso of drugs were one zzso those of the plasma peak zzso calculated by using the liver cancer cells of the line zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso resistant protein zzso lung zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and 2 kinds of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected by zzso 

Sixteen of the 30 specimens zzso were drug-resistant and 14 of the 30 specimens zzso were zzso The sequence of drug zzso was in the order of combination chemotherapy, zzso zzso and zzso The positive rate of zzso in the drug-resistant group was zzso significantly higher than that of the zzso group zzso P zzso zzso 

An improved zzso zzso has been developed that is more scientific and worth spreading zzso zzso drug resistance of liver cancer is zzso zzso is a good zzso marker in intrinsic drug resistance of liver zzso
