It is a well-established fact that zzso zzso a large family of integral membrane proteins involved in cell zzso fusion and zzso associate extensively with one another and with other zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we present results strongly suggesting that zzso zzso are fundamental units within larger zzso zzso Evidence for zzso zzso zzso was obtained using several cell lines, utilizing the following four zzso zzso spontaneous zzso via zzso zzso bonds, zzso use of a zzso zzso zzso agent, zzso use of an zzso zzso zzso agent, and zzso zzso zzso via direct zzso zzso bridging between zzso zzso zzso zzso In the last case, incubation of cells with the zzso inhibitor zzso exposed zzso zzso zzso thus effectively promoting zzso zzso to stabilize zzso Similar to zzso other zzso zzso and zzso also showed a tendency to zzso zzso zzso were assembled from newly zzso proteins in the zzso as evidenced by zzso and zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso appeared on the cell surface and participated in typical zzso zzso interactions with other zzso Whereas zzso were the zzso zzso species, we also observed some zzso complexes zzso zzso or zzso and a much lower level of zzso between different zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, our results strongly suggest that zzso zzso formed in the zzso and present at the cell surface, serve as building blocks for the assembly of larger, zzso zzso protein zzso
