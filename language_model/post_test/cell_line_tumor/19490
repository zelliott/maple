A zzso gene carrier, calcium zzso zzso zzso was evaluated for efficient in zzso and in zzso delivery of small interfering zzso zzso targeting vascular zzso growth zzso zzso The chemically zzso zzso zzso has a 58 zzso diameter and zzso zzso positive surface zzso It is capable of forming a zzso zzso complex and transferring DNA into targeted cells with high zzso efficiency while effectively protecting the zzso DNA from zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso complex has no obvious zzso for zzso cells, while a zzso complex exhibited measurable zzso zzso cells zzso with a zzso zzso via zzso zzso exhibit significantly reduced zzso expression as measured by real-time zzso and zzso zzso zzso whereas no decrease in zzso expression is observed in cells treated by control zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso zzso via zzso zzso also dramatically suppresses tumor zzso tumor growth and regional zzso zzso in subcutaneous zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso expression in a subcutaneous zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso cells was confirmed by real-time zzso as compared to zzso We conclude that zzso zzso is a novel and zzso system for effective delivery of zzso for cancer gene zzso
