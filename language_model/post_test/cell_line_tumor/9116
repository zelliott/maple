The aim of the present study was to assess the zzso effect of a defective zzso that expresses soluble vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso zzso on human tongue zzso zzso cell zzso that had been zzso in nude zzso In zzso zzso cells zzso soluble zzso zzso after infection with zzso and the zzso medium from zzso zzso cells seemed to inhibit zzso proliferation of human zzso vein zzso zzso The combined effects of zzso gene therapy and zzso chemotherapy was then studied in well-established zzso zzso The concentration of zzso in serum reached a peak 8 days after zzso injection of zzso In these tumors, zzso zzso injections had only a small zzso Interestingly, when the cells were also exposed to zzso chemotherapy, significantly higher ( zzso and possibly zzso zzso effects were observed that were highly correlated to a marked reduction in zzso zzso and an increase in zzso zzso Together, these data emphasize the potential of combining an zzso gene therapy strategy with a destructive approach directed against the tumor cells to fight human tongue zzso
