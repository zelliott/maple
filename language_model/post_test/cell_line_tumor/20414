zzso E virus zzso is an important but extremely zzso human zzso zzso 1 and 2 are restricted to humans, whereas zzso 3 and 4 are zzso infecting both humans and zzso This report zzso for the first time, the successful rescue of infectious zzso in zzso and in zzso from cloned zzso of a zzso 4 human zzso zzso zzso The complete zzso sequence of the zzso virus was determined and a full-length zzso clone zzso was zzso zzso zzso transcripts from the zzso clone were replication competent in zzso cells and infectious in zzso zzso Pigs zzso zzso with capped zzso transcripts from zzso developed an active infection, as evidenced by zzso virus shedding and zzso indicating the successful rescue of infectious zzso 4 zzso and zzso infection of pigs by a zzso 4 human zzso To demonstrate the utility of the zzso 4 zzso infectious clone and to evaluate the potential viral zzso for species zzso four zzso zzso clones were constructed by swapping various zzso regions between zzso 1 and 4, and zzso 1 and zzso All four zzso clones were replication competent in zzso cells, but only the two zzso with sequences swapped between zzso 1 and 4 human zzso produced viruses capable of infecting zzso zzso None of the four zzso was able to establish a robust infection in zzso The availability of a zzso 4 zzso infectious clone zzso an opportunity to delineate the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso infection in the zzso
