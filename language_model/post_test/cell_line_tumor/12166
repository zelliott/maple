We have previously reported that the zzso zzso stimulating hormone zzso has zzso effects in human zzso zzso zzso To determine the molecular mechanisms underlying such effects, we investigated the changes in gene expression profile induced by the zzso analog zzso zzso zzso zzso in a human zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso technique revealed changes in expression of genes involved in cell growth, zzso signal zzso and zzso In particular, zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso two zzso considered of paramount importance for cell proliferation and zzso Further, zzso exerted a favorable zzso regulation of certain zzso and their signaling zzso Finally, zzso treatment was associated with a prominent zzso of zzso a zzso with zzso zzso The data indicate that the influences of zzso extend beyond the established zzso effects in normal cells to include cell cycle regulatory properties in zzso zzso
