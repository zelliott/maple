To investigate the zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on proliferation and migration of human gastric cancer zzso 

Single zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso 21, and zzso were designed and zzso into zzso a gastric cancer cell line, to target the activity of these zzso Their expression was analyzed using zzso zzso and effects of zzso on human gastric cancer cells were determined using the following two zzso zzso zzso for cell proliferation and zzso for zzso 

In the zzso cell proliferation zzso zzso zzso was selected as the preferred concentration of zzso and incubation time was 72 zzso Under these experimental conditions, zzso demonstrated better suppression of the expression of zzso zzso zzso in gastric cancer cells than that of single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was also clearly decreased as compared to those in zzso and blank control groups zzso zzso 4 zzso 54 zzso 3, P zzso 28 zzso 4 zzso 59 zzso 4, P zzso zzso 

zzso can specifically inhibit the expression of multiple zzso and effectively antagonize proliferation and migration of gastric cancer cells promoted by zzso
