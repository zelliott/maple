zzso cancer causes more deaths than any other type of female zzso zzso The development of new therapeutic approaches is required due to the low survival rate using routine zzso The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of the gene zzso of zzso complex zzso zzso on cell viability and tumor growth in zzso zzso zzso was used to characterize the expression of zzso in human zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso was employed to zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso and zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso incorporation zzso colony formation zzso cell cycle analysis and tumor zzso in nude mice were performed to determine the effects of zzso zzso on cell viability and tumor growth zzso and zzso The data showed that the expression of zzso in human zzso cancer zzso correlated with the level of tumor zzso The zzso of zzso in zzso cancer cells significantly inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation zzso and led to cell cycle arrest in the zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso cancer tumor growth in zzso nude zzso Our findings reveal that the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso may be useful in the treatment of human zzso zzso
