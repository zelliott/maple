It has previously been reported that the patient response to zzso depends on the presence of zzso within the zzso domain of zzso growth factor zzso zzso or the expression of its truncated form, zzso zzso III zzso The focus of this study was to determine if these zzso are present within the zzso zzso and zzso domain of zzso in zzso zzso 

The zzso domain found within zzso 18 to 21 of the zzso from 11 zzso cancer cell lines and 75 patient tumors were subjected to automated zzso zzso expression was determined by zzso using a zzso zzso tissue zzso and its expression was subsequently verified by reverse zzso zzso real-time zzso and Western zzso analysis, using an zzso zzso cell line and zzso tumors as positive zzso 

Our analysis failed to detect zzso within the zzso zzso domain of zzso in the 11 cell lines and 75 patients zzso The initial analysis of zzso expression by zzso revealed that at least 50% of the patient tumors expressed zzso in a zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso reports exist, however, regarding the extent of zzso expression in zzso zzso to the specificity of the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso we sought to validate this observation by reverse zzso zzso real-time zzso and Western zzso zzso In these zzso none of the samples were positive for zzso except for control zzso and zzso 

When our results are taken together, we conclude that zzso within the zzso zzso domain and expression of zzso are rare events in zzso zzso The present study has clinical implications in selecting zzso zzso zzso for the therapy of zzso zzso
