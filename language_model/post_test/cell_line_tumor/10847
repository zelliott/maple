zzso is a preferential small zzso zzso of zzso and has potential to become a novel and effective zzso zzso The rational development of zzso for zzso zzso applications would be advanced by zzso relevant in zzso zzso studies with zzso investigations conducted in large zzso models possessing similar metabolism and physiology as zzso In the present study, we investigated whether zzso and exposure zzso of zzso that induce zzso in zzso cell lines in zzso can be achievable in healthy dogs through a constant rate infusion zzso intravenous delivery zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso with subsequent zzso was determined in a panel of zzso zzso cells in zzso The zzso of zzso administered orally or zzso was studied in 6 healthy dogs using a crossover zzso The feasibility of maintaining steady state plasma concentration of zzso for 24 or 48 h that paralleled in zzso zzso zzso was investigated in 4 healthy zzso In zzso zzso induced zzso in zzso cell lines in a zzso and zzso zzso The oral zzso of zzso was relatively low and highly variable zzso zzso zzso The achievement and maintenance of predicted zzso zzso zzso in normal dogs was safely attained via intravenous zzso lasting for 24 or 48 h in zzso Using the dog as a large zzso model, zzso can be safely administered as an intravenous zzso while achieving predicted in zzso zzso zzso
