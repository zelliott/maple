In order to investigate the mechanisms by which zzso vitamin D3 zzso stimulates the differentiation of human zzso we cultured zzso which is a human zzso cell line, in the presence or absence of zzso and/or zzso acid zzso zzso zzso a zzso vitamin C zzso The cell growth rate was decreased by the presence of zzso in the culture zzso Type I collagen synthesis and alkaline zzso zzso activity, which are markers of early stage zzso zzso were zzso by the presence of zzso as well as by that of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso had a synergistic effect on the collagen synthesis and zzso activity of the zzso zzso of collagen synthesis by the addition of zzso of collagen synthesis to the medium attenuated the zzso effect of zzso and zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso of the cells with zzso zzso for zzso decreased the expression level of zzso zzso in addition to that of zzso On the other hand, zzso activity was significantly increased, and the growth rate was zzso when the cells were cultured on type I zzso zzso These effects were not seen when the cells were cultured on dishes coated with zzso zzso zzso also increased the zzso levels for zzso and zzso which are zzso factors critical for zzso zzso as well as those of differentiation markers such as zzso type zzso zzso (the gene for the zzso chain of type I zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso human zzso and human bone zzso zzso stem cells zzso showed quite similar responses to zzso These results indicate that zzso gene expression of type I collagen and that mature type I collagen produced in the presence of zzso zzso mediates at least a part of the zzso effects of zzso zzso and zzso on the differentiation of these human zzso zzso zzso of zzso for zzso and zzso were increased, but the level of zzso was zzso by the expression of zzso in zzso zzso These results also suggest that zzso controls the growth and differentiation of human zzso cells by regulating the gene expression of zzso zzso factors as well as that of type I zzso and that the zzso of both signals is essential for zzso to express full activity toward the differentiation of human zzso
