The aim of this work was to investigate the effect of various zzso methods on surface characteristics and zzso of zzso zzso with pure zzso as a comparison, including steam zzso zzso zzso zzso oxide steam zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dry heat zzso zzso and zzso zzso ray radiation zzso zzso zzso The surface zzso were performed by environmental scanning electron zzso zzso X-ray zzso X-ray zzso zzso grazing zzso X-ray zzso water contact angle and surface free energy zzso whereas the zzso and zzso were evaluated by cellular adhesive experiment, zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results showed that the five zzso processes caused more changes on the surface of zzso zzso than that on the surface of pure zzso The zzso zzso caused the most obvious changes on the surface of the pure zzso and the zzso zzso made the largest zzso on the zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso processes could cause increases on surface free energy for both pure zzso and zzso zzso while the other three zzso processes reduced the surface free zzso The zzso and zzso zzso processes caused the least zzso on the cell zzso on pure zzso surface, whereas the zzso zzso performed the greatest impact on the cell zzso on the zzso zzso zzso The zzso percentage of pure zzso and zzso zzso were reduced by zzso zzso meanwhile the other four zzso processes increased their zzso percentages significantly, especially for the zzso zzso
