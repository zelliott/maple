A zzso zzso zzso containing zzso reporter gene was zzso with different molecular weights of zzso zzso Mouse zzso cell line zzso was zzso by these zzso DNA complexes, and zzso 2000 was used as zzso Forty-eight hours after zzso the activity of zzso and radioactive count of cell zzso were zzso It was found that zzso especially low molecular weight species, had a surprising ability to deliver DNA into cells, since the radioactive count of cells zzso by zzso complexes was even two times that of cells zzso by zzso zzso But the zzso activity of zzso complexes was much lower compared to that of zzso zzso zzso which could degrade zzso in specific mode was transported into zzso cells by zzso zzso prior to gene zzso Then these zzso cells were zzso by zzso zzso The results indicated that zzso activity in these cells increased markedly to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nearly zzso as that of cells zzso by zzso This zzso protocol was also applied to zzso mouse zzso zzso mouse zzso and zzso human zzso cell lines, and an increased gene expression level was observed without zzso It is thought that the incorporated zzso could aid in zzso degradation, which would promote gene zzso consequently increasing gene zzso
