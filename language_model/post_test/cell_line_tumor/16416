This study examined the clinical significance of zzso and the expression level of its potential downstream target fatty acid zzso zzso in zzso clear cell zzso zzso and evaluated the zzso zzso as a potential therapeutic zzso 

zzso and zzso expression and zzso gene amplification were assessed in zzso zzso by zzso zzso in zzso zzso and clinical data collected by a retrospective chart zzso zzso a zzso zzso was used to assess whether this zzso represented a therapeutic target in zzso 

High zzso expression was most frequent in clear cell zzso zzso zzso gene amplification was identified in none of the 58 zzso The frequency of zzso gene amplification was significantly higher in the high-grade zzso zzso than in the clear cell zzso ( zzso zzso expression was significantly correlated with zzso expression in both zzso samples and zzso cell zzso Either high zzso expression or high zzso expression significantly correlated with shorter zzso and overall survival zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso using zzso decreased zzso expression in zzso cell zzso zzso growth zzso was observed in zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso when compared with the response in zzso cells without zzso zzso 

These findings indicate that zzso zzso is critical to the growth and survival of a subset of zzso The zzso zzso by the zzso zzso depends on the expression status of the targeted cell zzso zzso zzso zzso therapy may benefit selected zzso zzso
