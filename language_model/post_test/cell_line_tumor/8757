We demonstrate an optical strategy using zzso zzso of zzso skin zzso window chamber models to image zzso zzso and vascular zzso in zzso zzso zzso was zzso using a fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso using the differential zzso properties of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This study was carried out on two sibling zzso zzso zzso lines, zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso tumors was lowest when rates of delivery and clearance were zzso indicating zzso zzso in poorly zzso tumor zzso For increasing rates of delivery that were still lower than the zzso consumption rate (as measured in zzso both zzso zzso and the clearance rate from the tumor zzso When the rate of delivery of zzso exceeded the zzso consumption rate, zzso zzso decreased with any further increase in rate of delivery, but the clearance rate continued to zzso This inflection point was not observed in the zzso tumors due to an absence of low delivery rates close to the zzso consumption zzso In the zzso tumors, zzso zzso increased with increasing rates of delivery at low rates of zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso in tumors is influenced by the rates of delivery and clearance of the zzso The rates of delivery and clearance are, in turn, dependent on vascular zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso as well as vascular zzso is essential to make an informed assessment of zzso demand of a zzso
