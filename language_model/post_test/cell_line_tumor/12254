Most zzso zzso zzso in sporadic zzso zzso zzso are zzso by zzso class switch zzso zzso yet all tumors express zzso suggesting an incomplete or exclusively zzso zzso zzso We studied the exact zzso of both the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso by applying a combination of low- and high-resolution methods zzso zzso DNA fiber zzso long-distance zzso and Southern zzso on 16 zzso zzso class switch events involving the zzso zzso zzso were not zzso Thirteen cases had zzso zzso in or nearby zzso switch zzso sites, including five at zzso three at zzso and five at zzso All eight zzso with a zzso at zzso or zzso were perfectly zzso without deletion of zzso or other zzso zzso Internal zzso deletions claimed to be a marker for zzso activity and implicated in stabilization of zzso expression were found in zzso but did not correlate with downstream zzso zzso This study shows that switch zzso in sporadic zzso are exclusively resolved by a zzso zzso mechanism involving only one switch zzso
