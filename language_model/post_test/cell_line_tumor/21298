The present study investigated the possible synergistic zzso effect of a novel combination of zzso E zzso a standardized green tea zzso zzso and zzso zzso name zzso in a mouse zzso model and in human lung cancer zzso and zzso cell zzso 

Female zzso mice were given two weekly zzso injections of zzso zzso zzso total zzso 1 week later, mice were treated with zzso zzso or zzso in drinking zzso zzso zzso or 400 zzso in zzso or zzso zzso plus zzso zzso zzso for 16 zzso The interaction of these two agents was also studied in human lung cancer zzso and zzso zzso 

The individual agents, zzso or zzso were not effective in zzso lung zzso The zzso combination of zzso and zzso however, significantly reduced both the tumor zzso and tumor burden (by zzso and zzso respectively, P zzso zzso zzso analysis of the interaction of the two agents indicated that the combination zzso decreased tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor burden zzso zzso zzso The zzso was associated with enhanced zzso and suppressed zzso cell leukemia 1 zzso level in zzso as determined by zzso and Western zzso Treatment with combinations of zzso and zzso also zzso decreased the number of viable zzso and zzso cells as determined by zzso zzso This synergistic effect was associated with increased zzso as determined by the terminal zzso zzso zzso labeling zzso The combination of zzso and zzso was more efficient in reducing the zzso protein zzso level and increasing the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso level than the zzso zzso 

The present work showed that zzso and zzso zzso inhibited zzso lung zzso in mice and the growth of lung cancer zzso and zzso cells, possibly through enhanced zzso The results provide leads for future research on the application of this combination for the prevention and treatment of lung zzso
