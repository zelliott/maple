zzso of zzso human lung cancer cells with compound K produced by zzso bacteria enhances zzso zzso cell zzso zzso in zzso induced by combined treatment are made apparent in the observation of nuclear zzso loss of zzso membrane potential zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso induced by compound K and zzso radiation is associated with zzso oxygen species zzso zzso Furthermore, compound K, in combination with zzso radiation, has an enhanced effect in the zzso of zzso tumor zzso of nude zzso These results suggest that compound K has possible application for cancer therapy when used in combination with zzso zzso
