zzso is a zzso zinc finger protein that is essential for normal zzso development and zzso Recently, it has been demonstrated that zzso is frequently zzso in both human and mouse zzso Although this zzso is thought to be involved in zzso little is known about the molecular mechanisms that lead to zzso zzso To identify the genes that may be controlled by zzso we performed differential display analysis of zzso from mouse zzso cells that had been zzso with the zzso zzso Two zzso the zzso gene zzso and zzso protein 3 gene zzso were zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was consistently zzso in zzso zzso zzso that exhibited defective zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso function downstream of zzso and may be involved in zzso zzso
