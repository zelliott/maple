zzso zzso zzso have been prepared from the combined zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso To this end, two original zzso and zzso zzso cholesterol derivatives have been zzso zzso of the particle surface charge was zzso to determine the ratio between zzso and zzso lipids that would give zzso zzso This ratio has been zzso to form particles sensitive to pH change in the range zzso zzso of DNA into these newly formed zzso complexes was checked by DNA accessibility to zzso and DNA zzso on an zzso zzso Gene expression of the formulated gene was similar for the zzso zzso taken as a control and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso properties of these zzso was shown in zzso using zzso a zzso zzso zzso The efficiency of the new zzso to deliver DNA to the tumor was compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso compound gave the most efficient zzso for tumor delivery in zzso
