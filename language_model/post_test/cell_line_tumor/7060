zzso of zzso protein in cancer cells can inhibit programmed cell death and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein levels by using zzso zzso targeting the gene message can increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to zzso zzso The objective of this work was to investigate the zzso efficacy of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alone and in combination with zzso zzso in an zzso and zzso zzso model of zzso human zzso lung zzso In addition to assessing therapeutic effect, zzso protein expression in tumor tissue isolated from lung and heart was zzso In the zzso zzso model, zzso at 5 and 10 zzso significantly inhibited tumor growth compared with zzso control groups, and zzso the zzso effect of zzso was associated with zzso of zzso protein in isolated tumor zzso Moreover, the combination of zzso with zzso was more active in zzso tumor growth than either drug used zzso In the zzso model, zzso treatment (5 zzso increased the median survival time of mice to 33 days in comparison with a median survival time of 21 days in the control zzso With this model, the zzso effect was demonstrated by assessing tumor growth in lung and heart zzso by zzso and zzso zzso and zzso expression by zzso When zzso at 5 zzso was combined with zzso administered at 5 zzso zzso of mice survived more than 90 zzso These data suggest that the combination of zzso and zzso may provide enhanced zzso activities against zzso lung zzso
