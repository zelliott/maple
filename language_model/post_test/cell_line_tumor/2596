The zzso zzso zzso zzso uses a zzso mechanism to zzso and degrade the tumor zzso protein zzso involving interactions with the zzso zzso pocket and the zzso domain of zzso The results presented here demonstrate that zzso also uses this same zzso mechanism to bind to the cell fate zzso zzso with both the zzso zzso pocket and the zzso domain of zzso also involved in forming the interaction with zzso Furthermore, the zzso domain interactions are crucial for zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso where two separate zzso form the interface with zzso only one region within the zzso binding domain of zzso zzso acids zzso mediates binding to both these regions of zzso By binding to both zzso on zzso zzso zzso the zzso complex and zzso zzso of zzso zzso we have identified the mechanism zzso uses to regulate the zzso levels of the zzso in zzso By targeting the zzso domain of zzso using acid zzso zzso we can overcome zzso zzso and degradation of zzso zzso on the stabilization of zzso in zzso Furthermore, delivery of zzso acid zzso zzso to cancer cells promotes zzso growth arrest and the induction of zzso This highlights the zzso mechanism of zzso on another zzso zzso and identifies the acid domain as well as N zzso as a potential target for small molecules that inhibit zzso
