zzso a blue copper zzso circulating in serum of all zzso is a zzso zzso mainly in zzso and zzso into plasma with six tightly bound atoms of copper per zzso Many aspects of the mechanisms by which synthesis and zzso of this protein are regulated by copper are still not zzso In zzso zzso cells this fine regulation is not zzso we have then zzso zzso zzso isolated from the liver of transgenic mice expressing a truncated form of zzso zzso growth factor zzso that are immortalized but not zzso zzso zzso was induced by treatment of cells with zzso zzso zzso of zzso labeling with zzso and of Western zzso followed by zzso demonstrated that maturation and zzso of zzso but not its synthesis are affected by copper zzso In this paper we have shown that in copper zzso zzso accumulates in a zzso zzso in which the protein is still in a zzso H sensitive form, and where presumably copper binding to the zzso takes zzso Moreover, we found that treatment of zzso cells with the zzso inhibitor zzso leads to immature zzso zzso in the zzso We have zzso conditions to induce in zzso copper zzso and found that zzso cells represent a suitable model to study in detail the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
