Emerging evidence indicate that zzso zzso may play important roles in zzso zzso expression of zzso has been frequently identified in different human zzso including zzso cancer zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso zzso impact the development of zzso remains largely zzso In this study, we show that zzso is significantly zzso in zzso compared to adjacent zzso zzso zzso zzso suppresses the expression of zzso by directly binding to its zzso region zzso zzso of zzso led to increased zzso of zzso cells and reduced tumor growth in zzso and in zzso zzso down zzso expression by specific zzso suppressed the growth of zzso cells in zzso and in zzso resembling that of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells effectively rescued the zzso of cell proliferation caused by zzso These data suggest that zzso serves as a tumor zzso by targeting zzso and call for the use of zzso as a potential therapeutic tool for zzso where zzso is often zzso
