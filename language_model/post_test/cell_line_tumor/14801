A zzso human zzso gene zzso harboring most of the known major zzso complex class I zzso of the zzso zzso was expressed as a fusion protein to a zzso zzso of zzso O zzso by the highly attenuated zzso zzso zzso which lacks zzso selection markers and the ability to spread from zzso This construct zzso was tested for zzso and zzso effects in zzso Despite being highly zzso zzso proved to be zzso in breaking immune tolerance toward the zzso zzso zzso zzso strong zzso immune responses in experimental zzso In tumors, zzso caused a reduction in regulatory T cells zzso accompanied by an increase in the zzso zzso zzso of this vaccine with the conventional zzso resistant zzso zzso zzso shows that zzso is more zzso in delaying tumor growth in zzso transgenic zzso Because of its zzso zzso mechanism and independence from zzso selection zzso zzso is potentially more suitable for human zzso These results support the future clinical development of this vaccine for the treatment of zzso zzso such as breast, zzso and pancreatic zzso
