Traditional Asian and African medicine use immature zzso fruits zzso zzso as zzso food to combat zzso Its effectiveness is due to zzso that inhibit the zzso of zzso zzso to stomach zzso The present study investigates the zzso effect in zzso zzso 

A standardized zzso fresh extract zzso zzso from immature zzso fruits was used for a quantitative in zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 clinical zzso zzso cells, and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso affected by zzso were zzso using a zzso overlay zzso with immobilized zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso served for binding studies to different zzso zzso strains and interaction experiments with zzso and zzso Iron zzso with different zzso were used to investigate the influence of the zzso of an interaction on the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso to 2 zzso inhibited zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso inhibited the adhesive binding of membrane proteins zzso zzso and zzso to its specific zzso zzso compounds from zzso bound zzso to different strains of zzso zzso as well as to zzso deficient zzso indicating an interaction with a zzso membrane structure in the vicinity of the zzso The binding depended on the charge of the zzso zzso zzso did not lead to subsequent feedback regulation or increased expression of zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso interactions between high molecular compounds from zzso fruits and the zzso zzso surface lead to strong zzso zzso
