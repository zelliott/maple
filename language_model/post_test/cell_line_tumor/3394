We recently developed a sensitive and flexible gene expression profiling system that is not dependent on an intact zzso tail and showed that it could be used to analyze zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that the zzso zzso zzso selection, extension and zzso zzso might be suitable for the analysis of zzso zzso zzso an important source of archival tissue zzso We now show that, using the zzso zzso system, highly zzso zzso and zzso gene expression profiles can be obtained with as little as 50 zzso of total zzso isolated from zzso zzso that had been stored from 1 to over 10 zzso Further, zzso and zzso markers derived from previous zzso expression profiling studies of zzso samples were validated in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso system should prove useful for zzso expression profiling of zzso clinical zzso
