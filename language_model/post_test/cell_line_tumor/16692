zzso cells take up a massive amount of nutrition compared to normal cells for increased zzso zzso special zzso for organic materials are required to satisfy the powerful consumption of nutrition in tumor zzso zzso zzso acid zzso 1 zzso incorporates large neutral zzso zzso most of which are also zzso as essential zzso zzso into cells in a zzso zzso Because of its high expression levels in a variety of cancer cells, it is speculated that zzso functions as a key zzso for highly effective delivery of essential zzso acids into cancer zzso In this regard, zzso inhibitor is expected to have clinical benefit for cancer zzso However, the molecular mechanism of enrichment of zzso in cancer cells remains poorly zzso Here, we show that a zzso zzso is a critical positive regulator of zzso expression in zzso zzso human pancreatic cancer zzso The zzso of zzso a representative neutral zzso acid, was strictly dependent on zzso in zzso zzso cells, and zzso zzso of zzso inhibited cell zzso zzso zzso expression with zzso resulted in severe reduction of zzso protein levels as well as zzso levels, which, in turn, led to a significant zzso of zzso zzso The zzso promoter has a zzso zzso binding sequence and zzso of zzso increased zzso promoter activity, whereas zzso of zzso binding site diminished this zzso Our results suggest biological significance of zzso in tumor growth and molecular machinery that could explain why zzso is zzso expressed in cancer zzso
