The purpose of this study was to clarify the relationship between zzso cancer zzso dissemination and zzso zzso zzso zzso and to explore the possibility of zzso molecular therapy for zzso zzso We zzso an zzso expression zzso into the zzso human zzso cancer cell line zzso and established an zzso cell line zzso to examine the relationship between zzso expression and cancer cell growth in zzso and in zzso zzso expression did not influence cancer cell growth and invasion in zzso but promoted tumor growth and zzso dissemination in zzso zzso showed that zzso expression inhibited natural killer zzso cell zzso in tumors and promoted tumor zzso In addition, the oral administration of the zzso inhibitor zzso inhibited the growth of zzso subcutaneous tumors in zzso These findings indicate that zzso promotes the zzso dissemination of zzso cancer by zzso zzso cell zzso in tumors and promoting zzso supporting the zzso of zzso molecular therapy in zzso zzso
