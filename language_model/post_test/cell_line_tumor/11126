To investigate the effects of zzso zzso zzso II on zzso melanoma in mice and the underlying zzso 

zzso mice bearing zzso melanoma were used in this zzso The experimental groups were treated respectively with zzso zzso zzso II at doses of zzso 5 and 10 g zzso zzso and zzso at zzso g zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso II at 10 g zzso zzso plus zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso The tumor volume and weight, the expression of zzso and zzso and the amount of zzso were zzso 

The tumor volume and weight, the expression of zzso and zzso and the amount of zzso were reduced significantly after treatment with zzso zzso zzso II at the doses of 5 and 10 g zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso II combined with zzso as compared with normal zzso group zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso II can inhibit the growth of zzso melanoma in mice and zzso the expressions of zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso II produces the zzso effect via a possible zzso zzso
