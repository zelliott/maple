The mechanisms underlying tumor dormancy in human primary zzso and bone zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso are still not completely zzso The aim of this study was to determine differences in the fates of cultured primary zzso zzso cells, zzso primary zzso zzso cells, bone zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells following zzso into these four groups of zzso mice through subcutaneous injection of zzso zzso (4 zzso The injected mice were monitored for tumor development at the sites of zzso In only the group injected with zzso cells, the resulting zzso remained small throughout the zzso observation period after injection, but gradually became zzso zzso zzso examination revealed that these zzso invariably consisted of mostly structures of zzso pearls and zzso bridges with occasional zzso and degenerative zzso In contrast, animals injected with zzso cells developed tumors progressively with occasional central zzso In the two groups injected with zzso and zzso cells, progressive zzso of tumors were noted, with the latter being at slightly faster rates, whereas the zzso of both groups showed a poorly differentiated zzso with abundant zzso The study results highlight the high zzso of zzso but not zzso following zzso gene transfer to the induction of tumor zzso which is zzso via induced cell zzso Thus, induced cell differentiation could provide a new mechanism by which tumor dormancy is zzso
