Human pancreatic tumors often zzso the zzso factor zzso 8 zzso in part due to zzso of zzso a frequent occurrence in pancreatic zzso In this study, we demonstrate that reducing zzso zzso activity, through either zzso zzso or small interfering zzso reduction of zzso zzso significantly decreased zzso expression zzso zzso zzso without affecting zzso transcription, but by decreasing zzso of zzso To ascertain whether zzso expression of zzso was dependent on zzso we used stable clones expressing a zzso zzso of zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso and subsequent DNA binding and zzso gene expression or a zzso activated zzso of zzso zzso expression was significantly lower in clones expressing the zzso zzso and significantly increased in clones expressing the activated zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity significantly reduced zzso zzso expression and tumor necrosis zzso zzso expression zzso zzso zzso for zzso yet zzso activity was not dependent on zzso We therefore suggest that zzso zzso through zzso of zzso and zzso are all required for expression of zzso a critical zzso factor in pancreatic zzso
