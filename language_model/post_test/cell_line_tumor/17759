The effect of pH (6-10), temperature zzso degrees zzso zzso concentration zzso as zzso and zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso on the zzso zzso of zzso zzso 2 with zzso was investigated by performing zzso experiments with synthetic zzso buffer zzso or zzso zzso The zzso zzso was independent of zzso concentration and zzso zzso zzso ratio but had strong pH zzso with the rate of zzso decreasing with increasing zzso The zzso at pH 6 and 8 were consistent with zzso zzso while zzso at pH 10 were characterized by a lag phase followed by a zzso zzso The rate of zzso increased with increasing zzso energies of zzso zzso 8) and zzso zzso zzso The results obtained in this study revealed that zzso zzso might not generally provide adequate control of zzso in drinking water at high pH and low zzso
