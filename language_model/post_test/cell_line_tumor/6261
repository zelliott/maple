zzso zzso zzso zzso is a medicinal herb with zzso zzso as an active zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso activity of zzso zzso extract and one of its major compounds zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso was induced by injecting zzso melanoma cells zzso on the zzso zzso skin of zzso zzso In zzso experiments were conducted using human zzso vein zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso significantly inhibited zzso cell zzso migration, invasion, and tube formation in zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso of zzso cells from rat zzso ex zzso was also zzso A marked decrease in the production of zzso zzso zzso and the expressions of zzso zzso and zzso oxide zzso by zzso cells were observed after the treatment with the extract or zzso zzso administration of the extract significantly inhibited zzso melanoma cell zzso zzso formation in zzso mice in zzso Analysis of serum zzso profile clearly showed that extract significantly reduced the elevated levels of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso and zzso colony stimulating factor and the most potent zzso factor zzso in zzso zzso NO level was also found to be significantly lowered by the administration of the zzso zzso factors such as zzso and zzso level were elevated in the zzso zzso
