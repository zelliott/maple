zzso state of a zzso region harboring zzso on mouse zzso 12 was examined using two distinct zzso One is zzso zzso examining the degree of enrichment with zzso zzso zzso at zzso 9 zzso in zzso and the other is zzso zzso zzso that measures a zzso zzso state by using zzso The zzso zzso showed that a zzso zzso covering the gene and an upstream region constituted zzso enriched with zzso zzso in cells expressing zzso compared to cells not expressing zzso In contrast, regions other than the zzso zzso did not show much difference in the enrichment between the two different types of zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso of two expressing and two zzso zzso provided compatible zzso patterns, suggesting that the zzso zzso state detected by zzso zzso is correlated with the zzso state controlled by zzso zzso tail modification linked to gene zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso zzso should provide a new approach to the regulation of zzso structure with respect to its zzso state, zzso zzso zzso
