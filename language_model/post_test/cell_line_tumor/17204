We developed a new experimental animal model of human multiple myeloma using zzso zzso zzso zzso A human myeloma cell line, zzso was zzso zzso into 20 zzso mice, all of which developed hind leg paralysis and distress around 6 weeks after zzso zzso studies showed that only the bone zzso was infiltrated with zzso cells, and no cells were present in other zzso zzso zzso in cortical bones and loss of zzso bones were prominent in zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso cells were not detected in zzso or zzso mice 6 weeks after intravenous zzso Human zzso produced by zzso cells, was detected in the serum of zzso zzso mice by zzso The results indicated that this zzso zzso model might be useful for studying the zzso of myeloma and related zzso zzso and are suggestive of its zzso to the future development of new zzso
