Some of zzso root extracts from zzso zzso exert zzso against cancer cells through disruption of membrane zzso called zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits the highest zzso effect among 8 zzso which we evaluated for zzso zzso We investigated if zzso zzso zzso zzso in its zzso effects and also the possible zzso 

Eight zzso were evaluated using different cancer cells and cell viability zzso The potent zzso zzso was investigated for its roles in zzso raft disruption and downstream pathways to zzso of cancer zzso zzso effects of zzso was also investigated in zzso using mouse zzso zzso 

zzso consistently exerts its potent zzso in 2 cell survival zzso using 5 different cancer cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in different ways from zzso zzso depleting cholesterol out of the zzso since zzso raft proteins were zzso modulated by the zzso During disruption of zzso zzso zzso activated neutral zzso 2 zzso 2) zzso membrane zzso into zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso demonstrated its zzso activities against zzso tumor cells in mouse zzso model, confirming its potential as an adjunct or zzso agent by itself in zzso 

This study demonstrates that neutral zzso 2 is responsible for the zzso of zzso through production of zzso zzso from membrane zzso Thus neutral zzso 2 and its relevant mechanisms may potentially be employed in cancer zzso
