In most human zzso the zzso zzso is highly zzso zzso of zzso zzso contributes to zzso in numerous zzso and zzso Thus, targeting zzso stability could be a crucial step for cancer zzso Here we report zzso as a key zzso regulating zzso stability and activity by recruiting the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso the protein level of zzso without affecting the zzso level, and significantly zzso its zzso activity, leading to zzso of cell proliferation and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso enhanced zzso of zzso through direct interaction with zzso and recruitment of zzso zzso of zzso resulted in less sensitivity to the growth zzso effect of zzso by inducing stable zzso zzso In conclusion, these findings that zzso functions in zzso zzso degradation and enhances the zzso effect of zzso signaling provide a possible new therapeutic approach for cancer zzso
