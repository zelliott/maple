The analysis of protein modification by zzso is a challenging zzso Most reported zzso zzso have been characterized from in zzso reactions or through affinity capture of the zzso zzso which enables global analyses but is poorly suited to targeted studies of specific zzso We employed a targeted molecular probe approach to study modifications of the molecular zzso heat shock protein 90 zzso which regulates diverse client zzso zzso affinity capture with a zzso probe isolated both zzso of the native protein zzso and zzso from human zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso capture afforded higher purity zzso than did zzso and enabled detection of zzso zzso protein by liquid zzso mass zzso zzso We applied this approach to map and zzso zzso formed on zzso by zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso by identified zzso and zzso of zzso as having a 158 Da zzso corresponding to zzso zzso zzso Five zzso zzso were also zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The rates of zzso at these sites were determined with zzso protein in zzso and with zzso in zzso cells with a zzso zzso relative zzso zzso During in zzso and cell treatment with zzso zzso on zzso and zzso displayed zzso rates ranging from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso Within the middle zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso demonstrated the most rapid zzso with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso on zzso zzso was zzso more rapidly than the zzso zzso zzso despite very similar predicted zzso values of both zzso The zzso middle zzso domain thus may play a zzso role in zzso disruption of zzso protein zzso The results illustrate the utility of a zzso affinity capture approach for targeted analysis of zzso zzso and their biological zzso
