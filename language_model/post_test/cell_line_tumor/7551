One challenge in the development of cancer therapies is the availability of zzso zzso Recently, zzso zzso libraries have been used for the selection of zzso zzso zzso especially cancer cell zzso Here we describe the methods to identify zzso breast cancer zzso peptides from a zzso random zzso zzso It is possible to select both zzso and zzso peptides using this zzso This method can also be applied to the selection of targeting peptides for other adherent cancer zzso The identified short peptides can be potentially incorporated into a variety of early diagnostic and targeted therapeutic systems against breast zzso
