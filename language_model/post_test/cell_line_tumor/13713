The mechanisms responsible for zzso in patients with zzso classical zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso cassette (ABC) zzso zzso zzso resistance in various zzso and zzso zzso has been shown to contribute to drug resistance in the zzso cell line, zzso 

We analyzed for expression of five ABC zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso using zzso in 103 zzso tumor specimens obtained from patients with zzso All patients received zzso standard chemotherapy with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or equivalent zzso zzso was expressed in zzso and zzso zzso cells in 16 of 82 cases zzso and zzso was expressed by zzso cells in 25 of 77 cases zzso All tumors were negative for zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression was associated with zzso disease zzso and was marginally associated with poorer zzso survival zzso zzso analysis after adjusting for zzso and zzso levels and age showed that patients with zzso with zzso cells positive for zzso had a higher risk of not responding to treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso by zzso cells in zzso patients predicts a higher risk of treatment failure and is marginally associated with poorer zzso survival using standard frontline chemotherapy zzso
