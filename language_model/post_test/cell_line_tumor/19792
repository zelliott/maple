The human zzso zzso zzso gene is a member of the zzso gene family and encodes two zzso zzso and zzso Although messages for both zzso and zzso are zzso in human zzso only zzso has been identified zzso Compared with other human zzso zzso has an extension at the zzso and zzso zzso zzso end of about 53 zzso zzso The structure and function of this unique zzso extension were zzso zzso of full-length zzso as well as truncated zzso without the zzso extension were expressed in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso extension significantly decreased the zzso of the expressed zzso as well as decreasing the rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were raised against both the full-length and truncated zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso raised to full-length zzso zzso only with full-length zzso whereas zzso raised to truncated zzso react with both full-length and truncated zzso Unlike full-length zzso truncated zzso was incapable of zzso to zzso in zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected in the zzso extension of full-length zzso expressed in zzso cells but not in truncated zzso At least one zzso zzso was detected in expressed zzso via two-dimensional gel zzso zzso analysis, and mass zzso zzso zzso expressed full-length zzso but not truncated zzso was zzso by zzso zzso or zzso protein zzso in zzso This study suggests that the zzso extension of zzso is an important site in the zzso nuclear zzso kinetic activity, and zzso of this zzso zzso
