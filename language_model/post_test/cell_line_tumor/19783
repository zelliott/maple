zzso zzso growth inhibitor zzso is a novel zzso zzso that belongs to the zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso Very little is known about the significance of zzso in zzso Our study zzso zzso expression in relation to breast cancer patient clinical zzso The zzso expression profile was assessed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a panel of 24 human normal and cancer cell lines and in a cohort of 151 zzso tissue samples zzso zzso 33 normal breast zzso zzso zzso 118 breast cancer zzso with a zzso median zzso Patients who had died of breast cancer or had local recurrence of the disease expressed significantly lower levels of zzso in comparison to the elevated levels in the disease free zzso High levels of zzso were associated with an increased chance of patient zzso zzso patients with breast zzso expressing reduced levels of zzso had a poorer prognosis than those patients expressing high levels of zzso However, no significant correlations were observed between zzso expression and zzso grade, zzso zzso or zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso is zzso expressed in human breast cancer zzso zzso displays zzso relevance as breast cancer patients with an overall poor prognosis express significantly lower levels of zzso compared to those with a zzso zzso
