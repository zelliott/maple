In this study, we describe the synthesis and characterization of a zzso consisting of zzso zzso 2,000 zzso zzso 25 zzso zzso zzso coupled to zzso zzso via zzso zzso for specific gene delivery to zzso cell zzso The efficiency of DNA zzso was studied using an zzso zzso exclusion zzso and demonstrated negligible differences compared to zzso zzso complex sizes were determined by dynamic light scattering to be in the range zzso zzso zzso zzso at different zzso ratios were close to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed efficient binding and zzso of zzso complexes using zzso zzso zzso In contrast, binding and zzso into zzso zzso cells was zzso In good correlation with these findings, reporter gene expression using targeted complexes in zzso cells was up to zzso higher than that of unmodified zzso zzso With the use zzso cells, no significant difference in expression efficiencies could be observed between zzso and zzso zzso zzso experiments with free zzso showed a significant decrease in reporter gene expression using zzso cells but no decrease using zzso cells, strongly supporting a specific zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso might be a promising new zzso for targeted gene transfer to zzso tumor cells in zzso
