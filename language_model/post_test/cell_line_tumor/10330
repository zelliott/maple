zzso and zzso zzso zzso agents 5 and 8 were achieved and allow the introduction of zzso zzso zzso into proteins and peptides whilst the zzso zzso structure is zzso zzso of the zzso hormone zzso bearing a single zzso or zzso group were prepared through zzso into the zzso zzso For the first time, the exact reaction mechanism of the zzso was zzso by applying zzso zzso experiments and it was shown that, during the reaction, zzso zzso were zzso zzso modification of the zzso zzso with a zzso zzso was achieved through a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso this suggests that such a zzso could serve as an attractive platform to prepare artificial zzso compound zzso The biological activity and specificity of a representative modified zzso zzso was demonstrated and efficient zzso cell zzso occurred in a zzso manner into zzso positive cells zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso presented zzso could be applied for introducing such zzso into alternative peptides and proteins and, in principle, could facilitate the efficient design of a broad variety of artificial protein and zzso zzso with previously unknown zzso
