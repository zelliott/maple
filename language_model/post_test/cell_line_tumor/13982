We have previously shown that the selection of cancer cell lines with zzso agents can alter the invasive potential of the cells, resulting in a zzso zzso where cells not only invade through zzso and migrate through membrane zzso but also subsequently zzso from the zzso of the invasion chamber, survive in suspension and ultimately attach to and grow on the bottom of the well beneath the zzso In order to determine the significance of this in zzso the following experiments were zzso 

zzso mouse zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso or zzso Three zzso with differing zzso were isolated and their zzso potential in zzso was compared to the parental cell line, through injection into the zzso fat pad of zzso mice and subsequent primary zzso growth and zzso to the lungs zzso 

zzso zzso was zzso linked to zzso diameter zzso zzso zzso The zzso status predicted the zzso of lung zzso in 2/3 zzso groups, with significant differences in the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The in zzso zzso zzso coupled with decreased zzso may predict for zzso potential in zzso
