A previous study on the human zzso zzso zzso promoter revealed remarkable differences in the mechanism of zzso gene regulation between the human and zzso zzso Indeed, a low degree of zzso was observed in the sequence of zzso promoters among human, zzso and rat zzso Only five short zzso regions zzso could be identified among the three zzso A human zzso minimal promoter was engineered and assembled into a zzso zzso zzso zzso This human zzso minimal promoter contained the five zzso plus the first zzso zzso from the zzso start of the human zzso promoter and the first 35 zzso of the untranslated zzso zzso leader of the human zzso zzso A significant degree of specificity for this human zzso minimal promoter was observed only for human zzso zzso cells zzso but not for zzso differentiated mouse primary zzso and zzso zzso cells, indicating a significant difference in zzso gene regulation between the human and mouse zzso Not only is the degree of zzso between the human and mouse promoters in the range of only zzso but also those few elements that share a high degree of zzso display totally different functions in human and mouse zzso zzso In the zzso system, zzso zzso is required for the zzso of zzso minimal zzso zzso neither the zzso nor the zzso binding sites for zzso are present in the 13 zzso DNA sequence that contains the human zzso zzso Instead, the zzso termed one and four of the human zzso promoter zzso only for a half zzso binding site sequence for zzso which failed to bind zzso in an in zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso Additionally, of the three zzso zzso response element zzso core sites zzso and two zzso sites present in the human zzso promoter, only one core and two zzso sites formed protein binding zzso Interestingly, there was no increase of protein binding complex formation upon zzso induction and in no case could zzso zzso zzso from the zzso These findings, taken together, demonstrate that zzso binding sites for zzso do not play a direct role in zzso an interaction between zzso and the human zzso zzso Likewise, zzso and Western zzso analysis have also confirmed that both zzso and zzso zzso expression does not positively correlate with zzso gene expression in zzso in contrast to the mouse zzso In addition, real-time zzso analysis revealed that the zzso of human zzso gene expression zzso by zzso zzso molecules did not affect human zzso gene expression in differentiated zzso A better understanding of human zzso gene regulation may have important implications both for the development of novel therapeutic approaches and the study of the zzso of a variety of neurological zzso including Parkinson's disease, bipolar disorder, and zzso
