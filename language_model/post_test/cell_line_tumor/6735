The synthesis is reported of a group of zzso zzso compounds as zzso zzso zzso with systematic variations at the zzso zzso and zzso A new zzso methodology has been developed for zzso zzso zzso zzso relationships are reported using surface zzso resonance and a zzso melting zzso to examine zzso zzso together with a zzso zzso zzso These reveal relationships between zzso stabilization and zzso zzso and optimal zzso and zzso zzso lengths for zzso zzso zzso molecular modeling using molecular dynamics simulations has been undertaken on four zzso zzso zzso exposure of zzso cancer cells to a subset of the most active compounds, at doses lower than the zzso values, showed that one compound produced a marked decrease in population growth, accompanied by zzso which is consistent with zzso targeting by this zzso
