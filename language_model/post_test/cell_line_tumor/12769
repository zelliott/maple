TRAIL is a novel therapeutic agent for potential use in zzso zzso zzso however, zzso zzso cells exhibit resistance to zzso zzso To evaluate the effects of zzso on sensitivity of human zzso cell line zzso to zzso and to investigate the potential zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso and then exposed to zzso The proliferation zzso of the treated cells was studied by the method of zzso The cell zzso was analyzed by zzso zzso and by flow zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was introduced to detect the zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso 3, and zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso 3 was detected by Western zzso zzso The results showed that the combination treatment of zzso and zzso could inhibit the proliferation of zzso cells significantly compared with the alone treatment zzso zzso which was chiefly attributed to the induction of obvious zzso The enhancement of zzso by zzso was due to the zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso and followed by the zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso could enhance the zzso induction of zzso cells to zzso zzso carried zzso
