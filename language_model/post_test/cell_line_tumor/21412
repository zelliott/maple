zzso or zzso a zzso imaging agent, has been shown to be zzso of response to traditional cancer therapies in patients with a wide range of zzso It is known that the environment of the tumor results in a myriad of zzso consequences, including zzso zzso in metabolism and zzso In an effort to better characterize the relationships between zzso and other prominent zzso this current study was undertaken to compare the regional distribution of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

Taking advantage of the different zzso of zzso zzso zzso in comparison to zzso zzso zzso we undertook a zzso zzso study in zzso zzso Four groups were zzso zzso zzso 2 h zzso zzso and zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 h zzso and zzso 24 h zzso zzso zzso 1 h zzso and zzso 10 zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1 h zzso and zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso PET imaging was performed in zzso zzso rats with imaging on concurrent days comparing zzso with zzso and zzso 

It was shown that the regional distribution of zzso and zzso showed an excellent correlation when the zzso had been allowed to distribute for either 10 zzso zzso or 24 h zzso The regional comparisons between zzso (10 zzso and zzso (1 zzso resulted in a very poor correlation zzso between the regional zzso of the two zzso The comparison between zzso and zzso showed a strong relationship zzso between the two zzso The zzso PET images for the distribution comparisons between zzso and zzso and zzso were in agreement with the data generated from the zzso zzso 

The data show that it is important to remember that a number of different zzso situations can exist when considering the relationship between regions of high zzso zzso proliferation and zzso
