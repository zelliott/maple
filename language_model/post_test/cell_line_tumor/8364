While the contribution of specific tumor zzso networks to cancer development has been the subject of considerable recent study, it remains unclear how zzso in these networks are integrated to influence the response of tumors to zzso zzso Here, we show that mechanisms commonly used by tumors to bypass early zzso checkpoints ultimately determine zzso response and generate zzso vulnerabilities that can be exploited with targeted zzso Specifically, evaluation of the combined status of zzso and zzso two commonly zzso tumor zzso zzso can help to predict the clinical response to zzso zzso We show that in zzso settings, suppression of zzso dramatically zzso tumors to zzso chemotherapy, zzso conversely, in the presence of functional zzso suppression of zzso or its downstream target zzso actually protects tumors from being killed by zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso cancer cells display strong zzso addiction to zzso for survival after DNA damage, such that suppression of zzso in zzso zzso inherently zzso zzso tumors to zzso zzso Thus, the specific set of zzso induced during tumor development plays a dominant role in determining both the tumor response to conventional chemotherapy and specific zzso to targeted therapies in a given zzso
