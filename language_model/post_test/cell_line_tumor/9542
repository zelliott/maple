The aim of this study was to investigate if zzso with zzso in different cell cycle zzso resulted in a different response as measured with the zzso zzso In addition, the influence of zzso temperature was zzso 

zzso from a zzso human zzso cell line, zzso and a human breast cancer cell line, zzso were synchronized by zzso block and zzso at either 2 degrees C or 37 degrees C in the zzso zzso and zzso After zzso by zzso B, the frequency of zzso was zzso 

Clear zzso relationships were zzso More zzso were detected in zzso cells zzso in zzso and S than in zzso while the differences were not as prominent in zzso zzso The zzso temperature had no significant influence on the formation of zzso in either of the cell zzso 

The formation of zzso varies with the cell cycle stage at the time of zzso
