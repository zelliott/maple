zzso cell tumors of the zzso represent approximately zzso of zzso zzso zzso The molecular zzso of zzso cell tumors is not known but 2 human zzso cell zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso exhibit zzso zzso of the nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso has a complex mode of action which includes zzso of zzso zzso We examined the effect of zzso on the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso and zzso cells both showed a zzso zzso of cell proliferation and viability in response to zzso together with an increase in zzso This was achieved at zzso within the range seen for clinically responsive zzso The zzso zzso activity was not however zzso Genes were identified that were regulated in both lines in response to zzso This study suggests that advanced zzso cell tumors, as represented by the cell lines, may respond to zzso either alone or in combination with other zzso
