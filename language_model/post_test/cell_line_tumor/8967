zzso cancer zzso harbors a myriad of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso promoter DNA is an important mechanism of zzso gene zzso in zzso There is considerable amount of data to suggest that DNA zzso zzso may be useful for the early detection and diagnosis of zzso In addition, candidate zzso studies have shown an association between specific gene zzso and zzso and zzso indicators of poor prognosis in zzso 

To more zzso identify DNA zzso zzso in zzso initiation and zzso we examined the zzso status of zzso zzso sites from regions with a broad spectrum of zzso zzso interrogating both zzso and zzso regions using the recently developed zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In all, we selected 33 zzso novel zzso sites that were zzso zzso in high-grade zzso zzso zzso and zzso in comparison with benign prostate tissue samples zzso discovery zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fold change zzso Of the 33 zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as top candidate novel genes that are frequently zzso and whose zzso was associated with zzso of gene expression in zzso cell zzso zzso analysis of the genes with altered zzso patterns identified the involvement of a zzso network of genes whose activity may be regulated by zzso zzso zzso zzso and 6, zzso and zzso in prostate zzso 

Our zzso zzso profile shows zzso zzso of important regulatory signals in prostate zzso
