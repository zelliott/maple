zzso zzso treatment includes zzso radiation zzso The high zzso of zzso cells zzso their zzso and is responsible for the dismal zzso Recently, we reported the zzso of zzso class I zzso products in invading tumor cells in human and mouse zzso zzso Here, we tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression on zzso tumors and enhances the effectiveness of zzso 

zzso zzso expression on zzso cells was analyzed in zzso and in zzso by flow zzso and zzso zzso To test the response of established zzso zzso to treatment, mice with measurable (at CT zzso brain tumors were randomly assigned to four groups receiving zzso no treatment, zzso zzso in two zzso of 4 zzso zzso vaccination with zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso factor, or zzso zzso and zzso zzso were tumor response and zzso 

An zzso radiation dose of 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules on zzso cells in zzso In zzso zzso induced the expression of the zzso light chain zzso of the zzso class I complex on zzso cells invading normal brain and increased zzso and zzso T cell zzso However, the survival advantage obtained with zzso or vaccination alone was zzso In contrast, zzso in combination with vaccination increased long-term survival to zzso to zzso compared with zzso to zzso in the other groups zzso zzso zzso Surviving animals showed zzso immunity by rejecting challenge zzso 

zzso radiation can be successfully combined with peripheral vaccination for the treatment of established high-grade zzso
