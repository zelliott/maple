Emerging evidence clearly suggests the potential zzso and zzso activity of a well known zzso zzso zzso However, studies have shown that zzso is not readily zzso and thus the tissue zzso of zzso is also poor except for gastrointestinal zzso Because of the potential biological activity of zzso many studies have attempted for making a better analog of zzso that is equally effective or better with increased zzso which was the purpose of our current zzso 

We have designed and zzso new zzso zzso zzso of zzso and Schiff bases along with their copper zzso complexes and evaluated their biological activities with respect to the zzso effects on zzso rabbit zzso zzso and growth zzso and induction of zzso in colon and pancreatic cancer cell zzso 

All copper complexes possess distorted square zzso zzso with zzso metal to zzso zzso with zzso copper zzso zzso The zzso compound zzso exhibited zzso effects on zzso rabbit zzso zzso or cellular zzso zzso and caused both growth zzso of cancer cell lines and induced zzso cell death in our preliminary zzso 

Our results suggest that our newly zzso classes of zzso zzso could be useful as zzso and/or therapeutic agents against zzso
