zzso is an important component of DNA zzso break repair, and zzso zzso leads to extreme sensitivity to zzso zzso We studied whether radiation therapy combined with zzso zzso by small interfering zzso enhances radiation sensitivity in zzso and in zzso Seven human cancer cell lines were zzso with zzso zzso included in zzso virus of Japan envelope zzso zzso cells were implanted into male zzso zzso nude mice treated with zzso zzso and zzso The survival rate of cell lines zzso with zzso zzso decreased by zzso to zzso with zzso zzso compared with zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso rates of zzso zzso combined treatment zzso h after zzso in zzso cells and 6 h in zzso cells were significantly higher zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively), compared with the groups not treated with zzso zzso zzso tumors treated with combined therapy decreased in volume and zzso slowly compared with radiation zzso Our results indicate that combined therapy consisting of zzso zzso and zzso contributes to zzso of tumor growth and may be a novel strategy for cancer zzso
