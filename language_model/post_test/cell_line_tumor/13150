zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso is common in zzso lung cancer zzso and has been recently shown to contribute to cancer zzso It has been reported that the zzso zzso such as zzso in combination with chemotherapy could lead to an absolute benefit of overall survival zzso compared with chemotherapy zzso In this study, we investigated the effects of zzso zzso a humanized zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso on zzso human lung zzso cell line zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso cells had a relatively higher rate of zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were approximately zzso times resistant to zzso than zzso zzso The combined therapy of zzso and zzso showed strong synergistic zzso effect on cell proliferation of zzso cells in zzso The synergistic zzso effect was also observed in zzso zzso nude zzso Further study showed that zzso could lead to a significant cell arrest at zzso phase of cell cycle in both zzso and zzso zzso A dramatic increase of zzso rate was detected in zzso zzso but not zzso zzso Moreover, when combined with zzso zzso brought higher zzso rate in zzso cells rather than in zzso zzso In conclusion, our results suggested that zzso could significantly enhance zzso of human lung zzso cells to zzso at least partially by induction of zzso phase arrest and cell zzso
