The tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso is a promising candidate for cancer zzso that exhibits the ability to zzso induce zzso in zzso zzso zzso peptides bind to the zzso zzso and zzso which are selectively expressed in tumor zzso and at the surface of certain tumor zzso To enhance the zzso effect, an zzso zzso in which TRAIL was fused with the zzso zzso cell adhesive zzso zzso zzso was constructed and evaluated for zzso The soluble TRAIL and zzso proteins were expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso using a zzso zzso The zzso effect of the zzso zzso on cell proliferation was evaluated zzso using zzso and wound healing zzso and cell zzso was assessed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression zzso The results revealed that zzso inhibited the proliferation of multiple tumor cell lines zzso zzso and zzso Western zzso analysis demonstrated that the treatment of tumor cells with zzso activated the zzso zzso by the zzso of zzso in the same way as zzso TRAIL zzso These results demonstrate that zzso possesses more potent zzso effects than zzso and, therefore, merits further investigation in zzso and clinical zzso
