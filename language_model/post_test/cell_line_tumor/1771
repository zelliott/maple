zzso zzso growth factor zzso has a central role in breast cancer development and zzso but the mechanisms that control its expression are poorly zzso Breast cancer tissue zzso revealed an inverse correlation between the zzso zzso factor zzso box class O zzso and zzso zzso Using the zzso breast cancer cell lines zzso and zzso as model systems, we tested the possibility that zzso expression is zzso regulated by zzso zzso treatment of zzso or zzso cells resulted in nuclear zzso and zzso of zzso followed by a reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression experiments showed that zzso zzso the zzso zzso promoter, whereas another zzso member, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso pull-down zzso showed that both zzso and zzso bind a consensus zzso response element zzso in the zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso activated zzso zzso zzso bound to the zzso before recruiting zzso zzso 2 zzso to the promoter, leading to decreased zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso These results show that zzso repression of target genes in breast cancer cells, such as zzso involves competitive displacement of zzso zzso and active recruitment of zzso zzso zzso
