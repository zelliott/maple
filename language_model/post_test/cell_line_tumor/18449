Recent studies have provided increasing evidence that zzso zzso does not rely exclusively on zzso of zzso vessels, but also involves bone zzso circulating zzso precursors zzso Animal studies revealed that zzso of zzso tissue can be enhanced by zzso zzso But a possible limitation to the use of vascular precursors for therapeutic zzso is the relatively low number of these zzso In this study, we demonstrate that ex zzso expanded differentiated zzso cells zzso and smooth muscle cells zzso may home to the tumor zzso allowing targeting of zzso expression to the zzso zzso 

zzso cells zzso or zzso zzso cells were zzso from zzso zzso We have defined culture conditions in which we observed two types of clones easily differentiated according to their zzso zzso or zzso zzso characterization was assessed by zzso flow zzso analysis and zzso reaction with reverse zzso zzso of zzso network in zzso was studied in three-dimensional collagen zzso And recruitment of these cells to a zzso zzso site was assessed into zzso Severe Combined zzso zzso mouse zzso 

The zzso cells zzso positive for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and incorporating zzso LDL were zzso zzso cells expressed zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso Muscle Heavy zzso zzso zzso and zzso They also displayed a zzso zzso in a medium containing zzso So we concluded that zzso cells were zzso zzso and zzso zzso with each other to form a zzso like network in three-dimensional type I collagen zzso Moreover, these ex zzso differentiated cells are able to home to the tumor zzso 

We provide evidence that zzso for zzso and zzso circulate in human zzso blood and differentiate into functional zzso and zzso These differentiated cells could provide a zzso for vascular cell therapy, because of their zzso capacity to the zzso zzso
