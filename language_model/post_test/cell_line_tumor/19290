zzso zzso zzso is one of the most common zzso worldwide and is characterized by aggressive tumor behavior coupled with poor zzso Various zzso have been linked to zzso development, most prominently chronic zzso B and C virus infections as well as chronic alcohol zzso In approximately zzso of zzso the zzso remains zzso however, recent zzso data suggest that most of these zzso zzso develop due to zzso zzso To identify zzso DNA copy number aberrations and genes relevant to zzso we performed zzso comparative zzso zzso of 63 zzso of zzso zzso and 4 zzso cell lines followed by gene expression profiling and functional analyses of candidate zzso For a zzso zzso region on zzso we observed zzso copy number gains and zzso zzso in viral and alcohol-related zzso resulting in zzso of zzso target zzso zzso zzso showed neither zzso gains, nor zzso zzso nor target gene zzso suggesting that tumors of this zzso develop by way of a distinct zzso zzso Furthermore, we detected several zzso small zzso zzso including amplification of zzso on zzso and frequent gains of zzso on zzso Both genes were zzso in approximately half the zzso zzso and gene zzso reduced cell viability as well as proliferation and increased zzso rates in zzso cell zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso and zzso act as zzso zzso in a significant percentage of zzso
