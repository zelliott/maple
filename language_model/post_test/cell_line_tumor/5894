zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso which is expressed in a wide range of cell types and is involved in zzso zzso and tumor zzso Here, we investigated the function, regulation, and expression of zzso in zzso zzso expression was observed in three zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso ability, which was blocked by zzso zzso zzso or a zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells promoted cell migration without attenuating cell zzso Both zzso and zzso were zzso by zzso induction in zzso zzso cells, and were highly expressed in zzso transgenic mouse zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso zzso of human zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso of tumor cells embedded in an excess of irregular zzso bone zzso in zzso of tumors undergoing so-called zzso zzso was also expressed in zzso zzso with zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed zzso with zzso in both mouse and human zzso zzso expression was significantly higher in zzso zzso zzso zzso 6) than in primary zzso zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso which is not expressed in normal zzso but in zzso is zzso expressed in transformed zzso and in zzso and is under zzso zzso zzso Thus zzso is a candidate zzso for therapeutic zzso
