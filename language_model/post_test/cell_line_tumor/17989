The function of the zzso zzso protein zzso in prostate cancer is zzso zzso is necessary for correct prostate development and zzso frequent zzso loss in prostate zzso However, no zzso occur in the coding region and some particularly aggressive zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso is often referred to as candidate tumor zzso zzso Recent findings suggest a function in protection against zzso damage involved in prostate zzso Thus zzso may act differently at various stages of prostate zzso Unlike a classical tumor zzso zzso is zzso by zzso and zzso by zzso In this study we performed zzso based functional analysis by knocking down zzso expression in zzso prostate cancer cells and analyzing the impact of zzso on gene expression and cell zzso zzso of zzso evoked a massive zzso of zzso zzso followed by reduction in zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso growth factor zzso zzso Western zzso analysis showed strong decreases of zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso cell proliferation decreased and expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso were diminished, whereas expression of zzso binding protein 3 zzso and zzso tissue inhibitor 3 zzso was zzso In tumor cells not deprived of zzso expression this gene still has a function which might differ from its role in prostate development and zzso zzso zzso altered the expression of genes highly relevant in prostate cancer cell proliferation and zzso In zzso zzso most probably plays the role of an zzso zzso factor whose zzso is paralleled by zzso and zzso zzso Since zzso can regulate zzso expression it may become a target for interference in hormone zzso prostate zzso
