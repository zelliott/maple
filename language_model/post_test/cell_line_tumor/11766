Our final goal is to develop an appropriate method using nuclear medicine technique for monitoring the effect and prediction of zzso zzso zzso on zzso The aim of this study is to evaluate the effect of zzso on tumor cells in zzso using zzso and zzso as zzso 

Five tumor cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with varied characteristics were zzso after zzso for zzso with several doses of zzso zzso zzso oxygen was monitored by the zzso zzso detection system during zzso and generated zzso was zzso zzso effects were rapidly evaluated by nuclear medicine techniques zzso of zzso and zzso and traditional methods for cell viability zzso and zzso blue zzso at zzso after zzso zzso zzso concentration was measured by zzso zzso and cell protein content was measured by the Lowry zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso concentration were standardized by protein zzso zzso % of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso blue was zzso to the control zzso 

zzso % of zzso was zzso related to decrease % of zzso (R zzso zzso while decrease % of zzso was zzso related to that of zzso (R zzso zzso The decrease % of zzso was more sensitive than that of zzso zzso However, neither zzso nor zzso zzso was correlated with sensitivity to zzso In addition, zzso zzso before zzso was zzso related to decrease % of zzso (R zzso zzso 

Our findings in in zzso studies suggest that zzso is better than zzso for early evaluation of zzso effect, but zzso zzso may be used to predict zzso sensitivity before zzso
