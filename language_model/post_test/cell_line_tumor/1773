zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso that is zzso in a variety of zzso including zzso breast, zzso zzso and zzso High zzso levels are associated with enhanced cell zzso survival, migration and zzso Despite its frequent zzso the molecular mechanisms that regulate the zzso of zzso proteins in zzso cells are not well zzso Here, we show that turnover of zzso which does not require zzso is zzso regulated by two distinct zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and by a zzso zzso which acts independently of zzso but is regulated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso depletion stabilized zzso and further increased its levels in zzso cells expressing zzso zzso zzso These effects correlated with increased zzso zzso zzso We suggest that during zzso degradation, association with zzso provides a mechanism for zzso zzso recognition, while the C zzso of the protein regulates its subsequent zzso zzso
