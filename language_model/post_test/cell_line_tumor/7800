We previously established a line of zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, and showed that zzso zzso inhibited cell proliferation and induced zzso This study was aimed to further zzso the cellular mechanisms leading to this zzso in these zzso zzso acid compositions of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells and control cells, and the location of PC zzso by zzso zzso were analyzed with zzso zzso zzso thin layer zzso zzso gas zzso zzso and zzso zzso The effects of zzso zzso on the zzso membrane zzso the release of zzso C from zzso and the activity of zzso were determined by Western zzso zzso zzso PC by zzso contained more zzso groups of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and was mainly located in zzso zzso zzso increased the zzso membrane fluidity and the release of zzso C from the zzso into the zzso which in turn activated zzso and zzso the key molecules in the zzso zzso zzso We demonstrated that, in rat zzso cells, zzso zzso proceeds through zzso
