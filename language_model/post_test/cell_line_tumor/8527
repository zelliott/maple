Combined zzso growth factor zzso zzso inhibitor zzso with chemotherapy is believed to be more effective in treating zzso lung cancer zzso with zzso zzso zzso This hypothesis failed to be realized clinically and needs to be examined in zzso 

Using the zzso zzso zzso and classical zzso method, we investigated the combination effects of 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso in a panel of 15 zzso cell zzso 

Upon treatment with the 6 zzso zzso the 12 cell lines that did not harbor zzso displayed a broad spectrum of group results, from obvious zzso to robust zzso The values of group mean combination index zzso ranged from zzso to zzso In contrast, the 3 cell lines with zzso showed a tendency toward consistent antagonism to the tested zzso zzso with a narrow range of higher group zzso zzso In the presence of zzso the zzso or zzso group was more zzso than the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso or zzso group zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso zzso The results of using the zzso combinations with the zzso zzso cell line zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso shared patterns similar to those with the zzso and zzso cell lines, zzso 

zzso zzso zzso cells showed a wide spectrum of zzso suggesting that zzso combined zzso might not be a good treatment strategy for zzso harboring zzso
