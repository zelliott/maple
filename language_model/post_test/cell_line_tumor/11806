zzso are commonly used as functional foods and zzso A zzso zzso from the green zzso zzso zzso has been reported to have zzso activity toward various cancer zzso We previously observed that zzso induced different pathways of zzso in zzso human gastric cancer zzso zzso growth factor zzso plays an important role in cancer cell zzso Increased zzso levels increase the expression of the small zzso and activate the zzso zzso resulting in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso which mediate the attachment of cells to surrounding zzso cells or zzso zzso Thus, the zzso of zzso signaling would zzso zzso expression and thereby effectively decrease cell growth and zzso In the present study, we determined the effect of zzso treatment on the zzso migration and zzso of zzso human gastric cancer zzso To investigate the mechanism by which zzso exerts its zzso actions, we examined the effect of zzso on the expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso the small zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Our findings indicate that zzso zzso zzso cell proliferation and migration by zzso zzso expression via the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may be an important factor in the development of functional foods and therapeutic zzso
