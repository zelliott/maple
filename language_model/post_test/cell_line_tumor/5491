Regulatory zzso cell receptors can contribute to zzso zzso immune responses by modulating T cell zzso zzso T cell zzso We investigated the potential of the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso to enhance tumor zzso zzso of human T zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso with both zzso and zzso functions in zzso zzso In T cells, its expression is positively associated with the acquisition of a zzso zzso memory zzso zzso zzso receptors that link zzso zzso zzso fragments specific for the zzso surface zzso zzso and zzso to the signaling zzso of human zzso and/or zzso were expressed in zzso activated peripheral blood T cells by zzso gene zzso While zzso signaling alone failed to induce T cell zzso functions or zzso it significantly zzso the zzso zzso responses induced by zzso zzso zzso did not affect the zzso zzso memory zzso of expanding T cells, nor did it increase the proportion of T cells with regulatory zzso zzso These data support a zzso role for zzso in human T cell zzso As an amplifier of zzso signals, zzso may provide a powerful new tool for zzso of cancer, promoting sustained zzso and proliferation of zzso zzso T zzso
