There has been much discussion concerning zzso zzso chemicals suspected of exerting adverse effects in both wildlife and zzso Since the majority of these compounds are zzso a large number of in zzso tests for zzso characteristics have been developed for screening zzso One reliable and widely used method is the reporter gene zzso employing zzso receptors zzso and a reporter gene with a zzso zzso responsive element zzso Other elements such as zzso also mediate zzso signals and the manner of response could be quite different from that of zzso Since this has yet to be zzso the zzso zzso zzso activity in response to a series of environmental zzso was investigated in comparison with zzso zzso All the compounds exhibited zzso properties with zzso and their zzso responses were quite zzso These was one exception, however, zzso zzso did not exert any zzso activity, while it appeared to be zzso at zzso to zzso with the zzso zzso None of the compounds demonstrated zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that significant differences can occur in responses through the two zzso pathways depending on environmental zzso
