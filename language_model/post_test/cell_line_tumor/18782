zzso gene expression system was used to deliver the suicide gene zzso to human breast cancer cell line zzso and control the zzso gene expression zzso The animal model of human breast cancer on severe combined immune zzso zzso mice was set up to explore the suicide gene therapy by the regulation of zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was inserted into the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso Using modified calcium zzso zzso method, two zzso zzso and zzso were performed for zzso cell line and selected by zzso B and zzso zzso cell line that zzso expressed zzso zzso gene was zzso zzso gene expression in the zzso cell line was under the control of zzso zzso Cell viability was also determined by zzso zzso whereas zzso gene expression was analyzed by reverse zzso zzso 

zzso cell survival rate was decreased from zzso to less than zzso when zzso zzso concentration was increased from 0 to 1000 zzso at 1 zzso of zzso after 72 hours of zzso zzso At 1 zzso of zzso zzso the cell numbers decreased from 7 zzso zzso zzso to 2 zzso zzso zzso when zzso concentration was increased from 0 to 1500 zzso after 72 hours zzso In addition, bystander effects were generated in zzso when zzso - zzso of zzso zzso cells were mixed in zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, the human breast cancer models in zzso mice were set zzso The zzso gene was expressed with the regulated character after zzso cells were implanted into the female zzso mice 7 days after zzso induction followed by zzso administration of zzso for 23 zzso zzso tumors in zzso mice that were implanted with zzso cells shrank remarkably after zzso and zzso administration as compared with the zzso 

The human breast tumor cells zzso expressing zzso gene can be eradicated by administration of zzso and induced with zzso or its zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso
