After zzso into the zzso zzso zzso proteins that fail to fold there are zzso Through a process termed dislocation such zzso proteins arrive in the zzso where zzso zzso and finally zzso zzso dispense with the unwanted zzso The machinery involved in the extraction of zzso proteins from the zzso is poorly zzso The human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the dislocation of class I major zzso complex zzso products, resulting in their rapid zzso Here we show that zzso uses its zzso domain to recruit class I zzso products to a human zzso of zzso zzso a protein essential for the degradation of a subset of zzso zzso zzso We show that this zzso zzso is essential for the degradation of class I zzso molecules zzso by zzso but not by zzso We conclude that zzso is an important factor for the extraction of certain zzso folded proteins from the zzso zzso
