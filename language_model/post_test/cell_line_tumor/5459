The protein interacting with C zzso 1 zzso protein was first identified as a novel binding partner for protein zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso BAR domain and a zzso domain interacting with many synaptic zzso including the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso is strongly implicated in zzso trafficking and synaptic zzso In zzso zzso has been characterized extensively in cell culture zzso To study zzso in an intact system, we characterized zzso expression zzso in the adult and zzso zzso central nervous zzso zzso was found in cell bodies in the zzso zzso the zzso zzso the zzso and the neuroendocrine center zzso zzso The cell types that express zzso were identified using zzso zzso trap zzso The zzso cells form a zzso of zzso zzso zzso was neither detected in zzso nor in zzso zzso Also, we observed zzso expression in only a few zzso zzso located in the zzso zzso In contrast, we detected robust zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the neuroendocrine system, which express the zzso factor zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso cells include zzso cells that produce the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells also occurs in zzso as it was also observed in a rat zzso cell line derived from pancreatic zzso At the zzso level, zzso was found in the zzso zone but surprisingly not in synaptic zzso We conclude that zzso may serve an important role in the neuroendocrine system both in insects and zzso
