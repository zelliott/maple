In zzso zzso cells, the viral zzso protein mediates zzso zzso of the major zzso complex zzso class I genes by targeting the class I zzso Here, we demonstrate by a combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis that zzso is a physical component of the class I zzso repression complex, known to comprise zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso but not zzso from the zzso repression zzso zzso with elimination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso also resulted in a dramatic increase in zzso zzso a hallmark of zzso active zzso zzso zzso class I zzso expression was restored on the surface of zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is associated with the zzso class I complex and apparently mediates class I zzso zzso by enacting zzso repression through zzso and zzso
