The biological mechanisms underlying zzso resistance of prostate cancer are not fully zzso In the present study, we examined the role of organic zzso transporting zzso zzso as zzso of zzso zzso zzso into cells to support growth under zzso zzso Cell growth and zzso expression of zzso genes were studied in human prostate cancer zzso and zzso cells under zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso on cell growth was investigated in zzso cells in which zzso had been zzso Growth of both cell lines was zzso by zzso and the effect was attenuated by zzso an inhibitor of steroid zzso which can covert zzso to zzso zzso zzso expression was increased most prominently among various genes tested in zzso cells grown in zzso zzso Similar results were obtained with zzso zzso Furthermore, the characteristics of zzso zzso by zzso cells were consistent with those of zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells resulted in loss of the zzso sensitivity of cell zzso Our results suggest that enhanced zzso expression is associated with zzso cell growth of prostate cancer cells under zzso zzso Thus, zzso may be a pharmacological target for prostate cancer zzso
