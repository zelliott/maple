To evaluate whether patients with zzso gastrointestinal zzso zzso to chemotherapy harbor zzso zzso T zzso 

Expansion of zzso zzso zzso zzso and cancer cell lines was attempted from gastrointestinal cancer zzso in 16 consecutive patients for the study of zzso immune zzso zzso zzso of genes zzso zzso receptors zzso was used to define zzso elements and specific zzso 

zzso were expanded from zzso in all patients, and new tumor cell lines were generated in 5 zzso zzso tumor recognition without zzso against zzso zzso gastrointestinal tumors was found in zzso zzso from 3 of these 5 zzso In a patient with gastric cancer liver zzso the repertoire of zzso zzso was dominated by zzso sister clones zzso to 2 out of 4 zzso cancer cell lines restricted by zzso From the same patient, a rare zzso zzso clone with a distinct zzso recognized all four cancer cell lines restricted by zzso In a patient with zzso duct cancer, two distinct zzso zzso clones were isolated from a highly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from these clones recognized zzso restricted by zzso In a third patient, zzso zzso zzso was progressively lost against an zzso colon cancer cell line that displayed loss of zzso zzso 

This study provides a basis for the development of zzso for patients with advanced gastrointestinal zzso by first establishing the presence of naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso at the molecular zzso
