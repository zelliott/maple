Although the zzso transition zzso is a normal process that occurs during development, it is thought to be associated with cancer progression and zzso Emerging evidence links zzso stem cells zzso in the tumor zzso with the occurrence of zzso in cancer zzso In this study, the human breast cancer cell line zzso was zzso with human zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso cells were analyzed for changes in cellular zzso zzso zzso protein expression and tumor zzso We found that zzso zzso cells underwent zzso and established a stable zzso zzso after prolonged zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso transforming growth zzso zzso zzso by zzso regulated the establishment of zzso in zzso cells by targeting the zzso regulatory zzso The zzso of zzso zzso levels can inhibit and reverse the zzso progress by zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso The maintenance of a stable zzso state by zzso cells required the establishment of zzso zzso signaling to drive and sustain zzso zzso which had been initiated by the prolonged zzso with zzso These results suggest that zzso may promote breast cancer zzso by stimulating and zzso the zzso zzso
