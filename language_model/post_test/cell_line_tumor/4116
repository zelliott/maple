Nuclear zzso B zzso and zzso are two major regulators involved in both tumor initiation and zzso However, the association between these two signaling pathways still remains zzso In this work, we demonstrate that zzso zzso stimulates the induction of zzso in several cancer cell lines through repression of zzso zzso We also show that zzso zzso results in an zzso of zzso oxygen species zzso which participate in the stimulation of zzso These findings present a zzso by which zzso promotes zzso in cancer cells and provide evidence for the zzso zzso effect of some zzso
