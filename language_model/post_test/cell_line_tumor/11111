To study the mechanism of resistance and its reversal to zzso zzso zzso in a pancreatic cancer cell line zzso 

zzso and zzso techniques were used to investigate the mechanism of drug zzso zzso zzso was used to reverse the drug resistance in a zzso pancreatic cancer cell line zzso zzso flow zzso and zzso zzso were employed to evaluate the effect of reversing drug resistance by zzso 

zzso cells showed weak expression of zzso zzso revealed by zzso while its parental zzso cells were zzso Both cell lines did not express zzso protein zzso As compared to the parental zzso cells, the zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso was decreased while that of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso With a concentration of 4 zzso at one zzso and 24 zzso after zzso treatment, there was no change in zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, when the concentration of zzso was increased to 30, 60, and 90 zzso there was a zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso 123 was zzso increased, and the zzso of zzso was zzso zzso 

The resistance to zzso of a pancreatic cancer cell line is due to decreased expression of zzso and increased expression of zzso and zzso zzso only in toxic zzso can reverse the drug resistance by zzso zzso gene and zzso zzso
