zzso zzso growth factor zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are key regulators of tumor zzso Strategies to block zzso signaling were successfully used to inhibit experimental tumor growth and indicated that zzso is the main signaling zzso zzso in zzso tumor zzso Here, we investigated the role of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of 2 different experimental tumors in zzso zzso zzso were generated that lack the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene transfer of the zzso zzso led to a strong reduction of tumor growth and zzso in zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the inhibited zzso revealed reduced vascular density, decreased tumor cell proliferation as well as increased tumor cell zzso and the formation of zzso The zzso gene transfer of the full length zzso also caused a significant reduction of tumor growth in both zzso The zzso effects of the zzso zzso and the full length zzso in zzso zzso were zzso through host tumor zzso cells because the zzso zzso cells were not infected by the zzso The formation of zzso between zzso and full length or truncated zzso was observed in zzso and might contribute to the growth zzso effect by modulating distinct signal zzso zzso The results of our study underline the central role of the zzso signaling system in tumor zzso and demonstrate that zzso can serve as a target for zzso gene zzso
