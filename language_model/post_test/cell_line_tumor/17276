We have carried out a detailed zzso of 550 zzso of zzso DNA on human zzso 21 containing the zzso and zzso zzso Comparative zzso analysis between this region and the zzso of zzso zzso on mouse zzso 16 indicated that the order and orientation of the zzso and zzso genes were zzso and revealed several regions containing potential zzso zzso zzso Four zzso including those for small protein G, zzso zzso human zzso protein and zzso zzso were zzso A potentially novel gene zzso with alternative zzso zzso consensus zzso donor and zzso sites, but no coding potential nor zzso zzso was identified and found to be expressed in a range of human cell zzso We have identified four novel zzso zzso that arise from a previously zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequences enabled us to determine the complete zzso structure of the zzso zzso We have also identified the presence of zzso zzso in the first and second zzso of the zzso zzso Our studies have important implications for Down syndrome as this region contains multiple zzso zzso both coding and potentially zzso that may play as yet zzso roles in the zzso of this zzso
