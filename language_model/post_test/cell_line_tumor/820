zzso of zzso acid zzso was used to construct zzso containing zzso by means of a zzso interaction between the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso obtained zzso showed a high zzso in water and a constant zzso release rate of about zzso in zzso The zzso zzso preparation was less zzso zzso to the zzso human colon cancer cell line in zzso compared with free zzso In zzso zzso of zzso in zzso mice bearing zzso tumor revealed a potent zzso effect with no remarkable toxicity up to a dose of 100 zzso of free zzso zzso The drug concentration in tumor after administration of zzso was 13 times higher than that after the free zzso This result can be attributed to the enhanced zzso and retention zzso effect of zzso drugs observed in solid zzso Complete blood counts and cardiac zzso showed no serious side effects for intravenous zzso doses of the zzso zzso as high as 100 zzso zzso equivalent in zzso These data indicate that zzso administration of zzso zzso zzso can enhance the therapeutic effect of zzso while reducing greatly cardiac and bone zzso zzso which should allow safe use of high doses of this zzso
