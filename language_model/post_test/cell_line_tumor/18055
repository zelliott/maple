The restricted zzso zzso repertoire found in zzso chronic zzso leukemia zzso implies a role for zzso in the zzso The nature of the zzso has, however, not been zzso although examples of zzso have been zzso We have analyzed a panel of 28 zzso cell lines and primary cultures, producing zzso zzso with different zzso zzso variable region gene usage and zzso status, including several zzso determining region 3 zzso subset zzso Using zzso zzso or protein zzso we have discovered novel zzso binding to zzso zzso These zzso included zzso proteins zzso zzso B, and zzso but also zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and oxidized zzso zzso zzso Additional new zzso identified were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso these zzso represent molecular motifs exposed on zzso zzso and bacteria, and several zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, these intriguing data, showing a limited target structure recognition, indicate that zzso zzso B cells are derived from a cell compartment that produces zzso zzso which may be instrumental in elimination and scavenging of zzso cells and zzso zzso
