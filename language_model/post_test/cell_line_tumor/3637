To develop an zzso animal model for zzso derived zzso cell zzso zzso 

Fifteen Fischer 344 rats were zzso with 1, 2, 5, 10, or 20 zzso zzso zzso cells in their zzso The animals were observed for tumor growth and zzso 

All animals developed tumors that grew zzso Pulmonary zzso developed in all animals and zzso developed zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso flank tumor in Fischer 344 rats is a new animal model that closely resembles the behavior of human zzso head and neck zzso 

The existence of an zzso zzso zzso and reliable animal model of zzso that somewhat resembles human head and neck zzso gives the opportunity to perform zzso experiments on head and neck cancer in these zzso
