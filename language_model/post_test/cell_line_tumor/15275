zzso zzso zzso is one of the most common zzso and the third leading cause of death from cancer zzso zzso has a very poor prognosis because of tumor zzso frequent zzso spread, and zzso zzso The molecular mechanism of zzso zzso and zzso is poorly zzso The zzso protein zzso is required for zzso migration during mouse embryonic liver zzso In this study, we show that high zzso protein expression in primary zzso zzso is associated with significantly worse survival and early tumor recurrence in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression in zzso cells inhibited cell migration and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso in nude mice while zzso of zzso in zzso cells promoted these zzso zzso zzso activity is most likely attributed to its zzso of zzso factor zzso zzso zzso and stabilization of zzso protein by recruiting zzso zzso 1 zzso to prevent the zzso of zzso which subsequently zzso an zzso transition response in zzso zzso We further demonstrated the zzso value of using the combination of zzso and zzso levels to predict zzso survival and early recurrence of zzso 

zzso is a critical factor that promotes zzso zzso
