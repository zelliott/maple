In order to investigate why human zzso are abundantly infiltrated by zzso cells without signs of zzso activity, experimental models were established in zzso and in zzso 

zzso human blood zzso were added to zzso or zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso analyzed after 72 h by zzso zzso zzso zzso were administered to zzso zzso Fischer rats by intravenous or zzso zzso 

zzso of both cell lines were infiltrated by zzso which took on a chronic inflammatory zzso with zzso of zzso and MAC zzso and zzso to zzso but not to zzso After both zzso and intravenous injection, zzso zzso accumulated within the tumor zzso of the rat zzso while the surrounding brain was only sparsely zzso 

The experimental models described here allow for further investigation of the interactions between zzso and zzso cells, both in zzso and in zzso Moreover, zzso that zzso from the peripheral blood into brain tumors may serve as carriers for targeted zzso
