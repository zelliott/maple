In this work we report on a simple zzso zzso device that achieves continuous zzso separation using the principle of zzso zzso migration in spiral zzso The dominant zzso forces coupled with the Dean zzso force due to the zzso zzso geometry cause particles to occupy a single equilibrium position near the inner zzso zzso The position at which particles zzso is dependent on the ratio of the zzso lift to Dean drag zzso Using this concept, we zzso for the first time, a spiral zzso zzso for zzso focusing of particles at distinct equilibrium positions across the zzso zzso from a zzso zzso The individual particle zzso can be collected with an appropriately designed outlet zzso To demonstrate this principle, a zzso zzso spiral zzso with a fixed zzso of 500 zzso and a height of 130 zzso was used to simultaneously and continuously separate 10 zzso 15 zzso and 20 zzso polystyrene zzso The device exhibited zzso separation zzso The versatility of the device was demonstrated by separating zzso and zzso cells with zzso efficiency and high relative viability zzso The achieved zzso of approximately 1 million zzso is substantially higher than the sorting rates reported by other zzso sorting methods and is comparable to the rates obtained with commercial zzso flow zzso zzso The simple zzso structure and high zzso offered by this passive zzso approach make it attractive for zzso devices in biomedical and environmental zzso
