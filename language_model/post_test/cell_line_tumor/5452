We investigated the effects of compounds isolated from a zzso extract of rose hips on zzso zzso in zzso mouse melanoma cells and the possible mechanisms responsible for the zzso of zzso zzso We found that, among the isolated compounds, zzso was a particularly potent zzso zzso To reveal the mechanism for this zzso the effects on zzso of zzso mouse melanoma were zzso zzso decreased the zzso zzso activity as well as the zzso activity in a cell zzso zzso We also examined the cellular level of zzso protein and found that zzso zzso inhibited zzso protein zzso We consider from these results that the zzso of zzso by zzso was due to the zzso of both zzso activity and of the protein zzso
