zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso a main component of zzso suggested to support cell attachment and to impact cell differentiation and zzso The aim of this study was to investigate zzso expression in zzso zzso at zzso and protein level, since zzso proteins are suggested to be of great importance for the zzso potential of zzso zzso was extracted from 13 zzso zzso cell lines and zzso analysis with zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso expression in all cell lines, with highest expression in the zzso zzso cell line zzso and lowest expression in the two zzso cell lines zzso zzso Furthermore, we investigated zzso expression by zzso in a commercially available tissue zzso including 50 zzso zzso as well as in archival tissue from 33 zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a zzso location in the zzso cells of almost all zzso apart from the zzso zzso The most intense zzso was observed in zzso zzso with some evidence of a slight increased intensity in advanced zzso Our data indicate that zzso is strongly expressed by the zzso cells of zzso zzso in different degree in the various zzso types and might be implicated in zzso interaction in terms of zzso attachment and zzso
