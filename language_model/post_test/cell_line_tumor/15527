zzso zzso zzso is the most important zzso factor of zzso zzso However, effective therapy has not been established against zzso zzso zzso In this study, we explored the efficacy of gene therapy targeting zzso zzso zzso of zzso cancer by suppressing the action of vascular zzso growth factor zzso through soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso For this purpose, we first conducted a model experiment by introducing zzso zzso into an zzso cancer cell line zzso and established zzso cell line with high zzso zzso The zzso medium of zzso cells inhibited zzso zzso cell growth in zzso and zzso expression in zzso cells suppressed in zzso zzso zzso and lung zzso without zzso the growth of a zzso zzso zzso To validate the therapeutic zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso were injected into the skeletal muscle of mice with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and lung zzso of zzso cells were completely suppressed by the zzso expression of zzso using zzso virus zzso These results suggest the possibility of gene therapy against zzso zzso and lung zzso of zzso cancer by using zzso expression of zzso
