zzso 112 is an orally active small zzso zzso drug which zzso the zzso of zzso at low zzso zzso The current study investigates the zzso effect and the mechanism of action of zzso 112 in in zzso models of human zzso and zzso zzso Four human zzso and 2 zzso cancer cell lines were incubated with increasing zzso of zzso 112 with and without zzso inhibitor zzso for 72 zzso zzso effects of zzso 112 were analyzed using crystal violet zzso zzso analysis of DNA content as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 112 displayed zzso activity in all six cell zzso The zzso determined after zzso incubation for zzso and zzso zzso was zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso was 5 zzso for zzso 3 cells, 1 zzso for zzso zzso for zzso 42 cells, zzso zzso for zzso 1 cells and zzso zzso for PA 1 zzso zzso effects of zzso 112 could not be zzso by zzso zzso with zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after treatment with zzso 112 was indicative of zzso cell zzso zzso 112 zzso increased zzso zzso cells and the zzso effect was least pronounced in zzso phase of the cell cycle, indicating cell death during zzso as determined by zzso zzso The orally active small zzso zzso inhibitor zzso 112 showed zzso activity in human zzso and zzso cancer cell lines at low zzso zzso which could not be zzso by zzso zzso and is therefore a good candidate for in zzso studies in these zzso
