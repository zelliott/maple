Here we describe a novel strategy using multiplexes of synthetic small interfering zzso zzso corresponding to multiple gene targets in order to compress zzso interference zzso screen zzso Before investigating the practical use of this strategy, we first characterized the zzso zzso induced by a large subset zzso zzso 129 zzso of the entire zzso library used in this study ( approximately 800 zzso approximately 400 zzso We next demonstrated that zzso zzso could silence at least six genes to the same degree as when the genes were targeted zzso The entire library was then used in a screen in which randomly zzso zzso were zzso for their affect on cell zzso Using this strategy, several gene targets that influenced the viability of a breast cancer cell line were zzso This study suggests that the screening of randomly zzso zzso may provide an important avenue towards the identification of candidate gene targets for downstream functional analyses and may also be useful for the rapid identification of positive controls for use in novel zzso zzso This approach is likely to be especially zzso where zzso costs or platform limitations are zzso
