A number of zzso have been developed to correct for migration time drift in zzso zzso Those zzso require identification of common components in each zzso However, not all components may be present or resolved in zzso of complex samples, which can confound attempts for zzso This paper reports the use of zzso zzso derivatives of zzso acids as internal standards for alignment of zzso zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso before zzso proteins and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso after the zzso zzso These compounds were used as internal standards to correct for variations in migration time over a two-week period in the separation of a cellular zzso The experimental conditions were deliberately manipulated by varying electric field and sample preparation zzso Three components of the zzso were used to evaluate the alignment zzso Before zzso the average relative standard zzso in migration time for these components was zzso After zzso the average relative standard zzso in migration time for these components was reduced to zzso
