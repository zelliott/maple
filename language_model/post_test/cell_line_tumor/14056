The goal of this study is to investigate the zzso effects and mechanism of zzso on the growth of zzso cancer cells in zzso and in zzso 

zzso cancer cells zzso zzso were grown in zzso zzso or a combination of the zzso The zzso or zzso effects of zzso on the cells were evaluated by a zzso zzso zzso flow zzso and a zzso activity zzso A Western zzso was used to zzso the protein expression of zzso initiation factors zzso and zzso basic zzso growth factor zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso analysis zzso the zzso transcript expression of zzso and zzso The zzso cells were transplanted zzso to zzso nude mice to produce solid zzso zzso and zzso were administered to the mice either as individual drugs or in zzso The tumors were excised and zzso to determine the effect each drug had on tumor size, zzso levels, zzso factors, and zzso density zzso 

zzso inhibited the growth of zzso cells in zzso in a zzso and zzso manner with an zzso of zzso zzso (24 h zzso Increased zzso was observed in zzso zzso zzso is suspected to enhance zzso activity, and thus inhibit protein expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In zzso the growth of zzso zzso tumors in nude mice was inhibited by zzso injection of zzso Compared with control groups, zzso significantly inhibited the protein expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and decreased the zzso 

zzso zzso the growth of zzso cells in zzso and in zzso These data provide useful information for further clinical study on the treatment of zzso by zzso
