The zzso zzso complexes zzso zzso involving zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been prepared and zzso by zzso analysis, zzso zzso zzso mass and zzso zzso zzso and variable temperature magnetic zzso Single crystal X-ray analysis of zzso zzso revealed a zzso zzso structure of the complex with the zzso zzso as a bridging zzso zzso data for all complexes were fitted using zzso model (for S zzso zzso and also using a zzso closed ring model showing a weak zzso interaction zzso approximately zzso to zzso zzso and moreover, zzso magnet properties have been observed in the case of zzso zzso The exponential correlation between the magnetic properties (the zzso exchange zzso zzso and the zzso of the free zzso zzso has been zzso The zzso ordering as well as a moderate structural zzso in the vicinity of iron atoms has been proved by the zzso zzso zzso (2 zzso zzso (7 zzso experiments in the case of zzso in which two zzso with the line zzso zzso have been zzso The compounds have been tested for their zzso activity, DNA zzso activity, and in zzso zzso against two human cancer cell zzso chronic zzso zzso zzso and breast zzso zzso The best result regarding the zzso has been achieved for the complex of zzso zzso where zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso
