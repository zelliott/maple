Cancer cells frequently exhibit defects in zzso which contribute to increased survival and zzso zzso For example, genetic zzso or abnormal zzso degradation can reduce expression of zzso which limits zzso In zzso where abnormal zzso degradation of zzso occurs, we hypothesized that zzso peptides that bind to human zzso zzso zzso class I molecules would be generated for presentation to zzso T zzso To test this hypothesis, we generated T cells against pooled zzso zzso using the blood of healthy human zzso Although zzso responses were of low frequency zzso a zzso zzso clone zzso was isolated that zzso recognized zzso zzso zzso presented by zzso zzso was able to recognize and kill a variety of zzso cancer cells including primary tumor cells from chronic zzso leukemia zzso No zzso was seen against zzso zzso cells such as zzso blasts and skin zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso corresponded with the zzso degradation patterns of zzso protein observed in cancer zzso Taken together, our findings suggest a new concept for tumor zzso based on regulatory proteins that are zzso expressed in normal cells, but that have zzso enhanced degradation in cancer zzso zzso degradation products offer candidate immune zzso in zzso such as zzso in which increased zzso degradation zzso with poor clinical zzso
