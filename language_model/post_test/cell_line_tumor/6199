A multifaceted strategy using a composite of zzso zzso and natural zzso silk zzso zzso and zzso zzso blend scaffolds was investigated for the treatment of a tissue zzso zzso zzso by providing local release of the therapeutic and filling of the zzso site with the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso were zzso and characterized for drug zzso and release, mechanical strength, and efficacy against zzso breast cancer cells in zzso and in zzso in a rat tumor zzso zzso zzso were embedded in zzso and zzso scaffolds and the amount of zzso zzso was a function of the scaffold composition and zzso loading zzso In zzso there was a burst release of zzso from all scaffolds during the first zzso though it was detected even after zzso zzso in zzso concentration in the scaffolds decreased the overall elastic zzso and ultimate zzso strength of the zzso After zzso of in zzso zzso the cell density zzso and percent degradation zzso within the remodeled no zzso zzso scaffold was significantly higher than the zzso loaded zzso zzso although there was no significant difference in the amount of collagen deposition in the zzso zzso zzso The presence and release of zzso from the zzso scaffolds inhibited the integration of zzso into the adjacent tumor due to the formation of an zzso barrier of zzso tissue that was lacking in zzso zzso zzso While no significant difference in tumor size was observed between the in zzso tested groups, tumors treated with zzso loaded zzso scaffolds had decreased presence and size and similar zzso of new tissue as compared to no zzso zzso zzso
