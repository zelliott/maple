zzso cancer stem cells zzso have been implicated in tumor recurrence following zzso However, the contribution of zzso to zzso in zzso cancer is unclear and zzso zzso mechanisms are zzso Here, we address these issues by zzso analysis of the zzso of zzso and zzso differentiated tumor cells zzso isolated from three distinct zzso colon zzso Mass zzso zzso identified zzso unique proteins in the zzso media of the paired zzso and DTC zzso zzso zzso Analysis revealed that proteins governing zzso zzso were most significantly enriched in the zzso zzso The vast majority of these zzso promote cell zzso The zzso zzso is also characterized by a zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso networks are highly enriched in the zzso zzso zzso also zzso high levels of zzso zzso including zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso We show that these zzso cause zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso are characterized by extensive survival and zzso networks, which are likely to contribute to zzso zzso In addition, zzso may zzso drug responses in nearby tumor cells by detoxifying zzso drugs in the zzso zzso 

Cancer stem cells are thought to play an important role in zzso drug resistance and tumor recurrence following zzso zzso it is important to identify the factors that are zzso by zzso Our results provide novel insights into the pathways that govern the intrinsic resistance of zzso to chemotherapy and, zzso demonstrate that they can also zzso zzso drugs in the zzso zzso A better understanding of the pathways that govern drug resistance in zzso may help in developing effective zzso zzso
