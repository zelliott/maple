zzso zzso is a zzso protein involved in a complex network of zzso The role of zzso in zzso is zzso The zzso gene zzso is zzso or rearranged in a number of zzso disorders, but such changes have not been detected in solid zzso However, experiments with cultured zzso cells and with mice carrying a single zzso zzso zzso indicate a tumor zzso function for zzso To resolve the role of zzso in solid zzso we examined its expression and zzso in zzso normal breast tissue and a large array of human breast zzso samples zzso zzso zzso and also evaluated its association with zzso variables and patient zzso The intensity and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso varied across clinical zzso No zzso explaining the differences were found, but the present findings indicate that expression levels of zzso affected its zzso Our study also revealed a novel zzso zzso pattern for zzso which was an independent zzso factor of poor zzso In addition, reduced levels of zzso protein were associated with poor zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso cells of zzso normal breast displayed high levels of zzso and zzso of zzso in the invasive zzso cells zzso their growth in soft zzso These results support a tumor zzso role for zzso in breast zzso
