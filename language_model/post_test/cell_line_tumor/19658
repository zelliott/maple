zzso zzso whose zzso from zzso zzso is regulated by increases in the concentration of zzso zzso is a well-known hormone that regulates calcium zzso However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the gene expression dependent on zzso have not been zzso The downstream regulatory element zzso zzso zzso zzso was recently identified as a zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the possible involvement of DREAM in the regulation of CT gene expression and zzso A zzso zzso using zzso cells, a zzso zzso cell line, showed that a particular region in the CT gene promoter zzso the promoter activity under zzso conditions but induced the activity when the zzso concentration was zzso We found two zzso sequences in a region located upstream from the zzso start zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed that DREAM bound to the zzso and also indicated that DREAM bound to the zzso in a zzso zzso We generated stable zzso of zzso cells with zzso or zzso zzso which lacked the responsiveness to zzso zzso In contrast to the wild type, zzso of the zzso DREAM inhibited the increase in CT zzso induced by a calcium zzso The addition of zzso to increase zzso activated the CT promoter, probably by the interaction of DREAM with zzso element binding zzso independent on the zzso by zzso Together, these results suggest that DREAM plays an important role in human CT gene expression in a zzso and zzso zzso
