The purpose of this zzso study was to evaluate the zzso and alkaline zzso zzso activity of a new zzso root repair material, zzso Root zzso zzso zzso zzso USA, Savannah, zzso and to compare these characteristics with those of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Tulsa, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Santa Maria, zzso 

Human zzso zzso cells were exposed to zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the materials zzso and 50% zzso for 24 hours after which the zzso and zzso activity of the cells were evaluated using a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In the positive control group, zzso zzso zzso Mannheim zzso Indianapolis, zzso was used to lyse the cells, representing zzso zzso and in the negative control group cells received fresh culture medium zzso Data were statistically analyzed using the zzso zzso test and zzso analysis of zzso 

The results revealed that the zzso of the cells as well as zzso activity were significantly decreased after exposure to zzso zzso in almost all time zzso both in zzso and 50% zzso with the exception of zzso activity of day 1 zzso of zzso at 50% zzso zzso did not change the zzso or zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso concentration reduced the zzso on days 1 and 3, whereas zzso zzso of 50% concentration affected the cells only on day zzso None of the zzso zzso had any effect on zzso activity of the zzso 

It was concluded that zzso zzso of all time periods in general reduced the zzso and zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso only, whereas zzso had no effect on the zzso
