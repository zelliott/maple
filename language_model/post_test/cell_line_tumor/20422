Using specific zzso zzso zzso and small interfering zzso against protein zzso zzso zzso or zzso we find that zzso positively regulates zzso in rat zzso zzso cells, whereas zzso zzso regulates zzso Mass zzso and zzso analyses reveal that zzso zzso zzso at zzso and/or zzso during zzso zzso of a zzso form zzso but not that of a zzso zzso form zzso increases zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso binds to zzso and retains its zzso and/or zzso zzso conversely, the zzso zzso is unable to sever zzso zzso resulting in zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso binds to the zzso zzso zzso cell sorting analysis with zzso zzso and simultaneous observation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso reveals that during zzso zzso zzso is dependent on zzso zzso These results indicate that a novel zzso zzso event regulates zzso by zzso its ability to zzso zzso and bind to zzso thereby promoting zzso zzso which is necessary for zzso of zzso
