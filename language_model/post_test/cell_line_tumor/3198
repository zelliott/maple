To evaluate the inflammatory response and barrier formation of a new zzso type zzso zzso type zzso zzso cell line to establish its suitability for toxicity and drug transport zzso 

zzso and zzso cells were challenged with zzso zzso zzso of inflammatory zzso was zzso by zzso The barrier properties of zzso cells were evaluated by zzso electrical resistance zzso zzso sodium zzso apparent zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso similar levels of zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso was not produced by either cell zzso In contrast to zzso cells, zzso cells did not zzso zzso or zzso zzso cells produced zzso zzso of approximately 55 zzso zzso and zzso zzso of approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was weak and zzso Attempts to zzso culture conditions did not increase the barrier properties of the zzso cell zzso 

The zzso cell line models the zzso inflammatory response to zzso challenge and provides a valuable complement to cell lines currently used in toxicity zzso However, under the experimental conditions used the zzso cell line did not form the highly restrictive tight junctions which exist in zzso
