To identify novel zzso of zzso of zzso cancer zzso we developed an zzso zzso model of zzso zzso and selected in zzso zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso cell line with enhanced potential for zzso to the zzso We compared the differences in the gene expression profiles between zzso and zzso cells using gene expression zzso We found that expression of special zzso zzso protein 2 zzso was zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis of 146 zzso zzso samples showed that zzso of zzso was strongly correlated with poor zzso zzso invasion, zzso zzso zzso distant zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso survival analyses further showed that zzso expression was a potential zzso zzso factor for zzso These results demonstrated not only that zzso is a potential novel zzso factor for zzso but also that selection of a highly zzso clone of zzso in zzso coupled with gene expression profiling is a powerful approach to identifying zzso markers for zzso
