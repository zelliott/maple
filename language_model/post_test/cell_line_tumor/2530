Cancer patients frequently develop zzso To test the hypothesis that the appearance of zzso precedes the clinical diagnosis of cancer, we applied an zzso approach to compare zzso profiles before and after appearance of zzso zzso from zzso cells, a lung zzso cell line, were separated by two zzso zzso and then zzso with serum samples from 8 individuals who were eventually diagnosed with lung zzso Compared with zzso profiles from 3 years prior to the appearance of zzso 21 zzso spots newly appeared or presented with stronger zzso intensity when clinical diagnoses were zzso Among them, 10 matched spots on zzso gels were identified by mass zzso analysis as 5 zzso With zzso analysis, the zzso of protein zzso D was confirmed, and notably, in lung cancer zzso the zzso of zzso against the specific forms of zzso D differed significantly from the control groups ( zzso Our findings suggest that harnessing immunity may have utility for early cancer marker discovery, and that comparing zzso to specific forms of zzso D may be a promising early marker of lung zzso
