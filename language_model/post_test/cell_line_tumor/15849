We investigated the associations between zzso zzso expression in tumor cells and sensitivity to zzso or patient prognosis in zzso 

Fifty-one zzso zzso tumor samples were manually zzso to collect tumor cells, and zzso was zzso zzso clinical samples of advanced zzso showed appropriate quality of the isolated zzso for real-time reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso The zzso expression levels were determined by real-time zzso in 4 zzso cell lines and 19 clinical zzso The sensitivity to zzso was assessed by zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso zzso expression of the clinical samples was investigated for its association with prognosis in advanced zzso zzso 

There was a significant positive correlation between zzso zzso expression and the sensitivity to zzso in four zzso cell zzso High zzso expression may be correlated with zzso zzso zzso survival zzso were zzso by zzso expression using the median value as a zzso point and analyzed for zzso significance by the zzso test zzso Furthermore, zzso survival analysis revealed that only zzso expression had a significant impact on the overall survival zzso 

Our results may warrant clinical application of zzso in zzso treatment for poor prognosis zzso
