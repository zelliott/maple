To investigate the zzso effects of zzso of zzso zzso zzso on cell cycle and zzso of human zzso cell line zzso 

zzso method was used to study the zzso rate and zzso relationship of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso double zzso were used to measure the DNA concentration and zzso rate in zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso zzso had obvious zzso effect and with good linear relationship between time and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso could regulate the zzso transition in zzso cell, which could make the cell in S phase arrest, result in the zzso of cells in S phase, blocked DNA synthesis and replication of cells, blocked tumor cells into the zzso phase, so as to restrain the proliferation of tumor cells and induce the zzso of zzso zzso And this zzso effect showed obvious zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso zzso zzso could inhibit the zzso cell line zzso in zzso by zzso cell proliferation and inducing zzso of the cell in a zzso dependence zzso
