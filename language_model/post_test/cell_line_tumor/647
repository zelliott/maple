zzso zzso is considered to act as a potent barrier to cell zzso and has been seen in zzso during the early stages of tumor zzso Human zzso cells frequently express zzso zzso or zzso and are thought to be permanently growth zzso Many studies have suggested that the zzso and, to a lesser extent, the zzso tumor zzso proteins act as critical triggers of zzso zzso in zzso and thus these proteins represent major zzso of progression to zzso There have also been reports, however, showing that zzso and/or zzso is not sufficient to execute the zzso zzso zzso In this study, we examined the impact of zzso zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to directly assess the individual contribution of human zzso and zzso genes to the zzso zzso zzso We formally show that cultured human zzso can initiate an effective zzso zzso program in the absence of zzso zzso Our data are consistent with observations showing that zzso zzso cells do not always express zzso and highlight the need to thoroughly explore zzso molecular pathways of zzso in human zzso
