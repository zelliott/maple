Previous studies have shown that the anomalous fruit extract of zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso properties in various solid and zzso tumors in zzso However, the zzso actions of zzso on zzso expression and zzso activity in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso have not been studied zzso In the present study, the zzso effects of zzso were demonstrated in three zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression studies on zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and real-time quantitative zzso repeat amplification protocol zzso to show the zzso effect of zzso on zzso in zzso The means of zzso of zzso for the zzso cell lines and zzso zzso zzso cells were 21 and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso cells lost their zzso potential which was zzso to zzso Moreover, zzso demonstrated zzso suppression on the expression of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso activity in the zzso cell zzso Our overall results thus provide the first evidence that the zzso effects of zzso on zzso involve the suppression of zzso expression and zzso of zzso zzso Our findings also offer a new opportunity for the future development of zzso as a novel zzso agent for zzso and possibly for other zzso
