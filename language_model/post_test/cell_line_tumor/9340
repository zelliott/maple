The zzso zzso the major component of the senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease zzso has been zzso to be toxic to zzso both in zzso and in zzso Several mechanisms have been proposed to be involved in the zzso zzso among others it has been suggested that the zzso zzso exerts its toxic effect mainly by zzso the surrounding zzso population, which in turn zzso the synthesis and release of zzso and zzso zzso In addition, a direct effect of zzso on zzso has been also zzso However, the precise mechanisms involved in the zzso zzso have been not yet definitely zzso To characterize the effects directly induced on zzso we have analyzed the gene expression profile induced by the zzso zzso zzso in human zzso zzso cells, by using the zzso zzso Human Genome zzso Plus zzso zzso Our results confirm that zzso may directly induce zzso cell zzso zzso signals that in zzso have been described as zzso of Alzheimer's zzso
