The 70 zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso located at zzso is amplified and zzso in zzso of primary breast zzso and breast cancer cell zzso zzso is a zzso zzso regulated by zzso pathway, which plays a crucial role in control of cell cycle, growth and zzso Our aim was to determine zzso and zzso zzso dependent gene expression profiles by zzso using five breast cancer cell lines with zzso gene copy number and gene expression zzso The zzso dependent profiles were determined by zzso zzso of zzso in two breast cancer cell lines zzso zzso These profiles were further correlated with gene expression zzso caused by zzso of zzso zzso with zzso inhibitor zzso or zzso inhibitor zzso 

Altogether, the zzso of zzso altered the expression of 109 and 173 genes in two breast cancer cell lines and 67 genes were altered in both cell lines in addition to zzso Furthermore, 17 genes including zzso and zzso showed overlap with genes zzso expressed after zzso or zzso zzso The gene expression signatures responsive to both zzso zzso and zzso inhibitions revealed previously unidentified genes suggesting novel downstream targets for zzso zzso 

Since zzso zzso is associated with aggressive disease and poor prognosis of breast cancer patients, the potential downstream targets of zzso and the whole zzso zzso identified in our study may have diagnostic zzso
