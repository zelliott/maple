Identification of genes that are zzso during zzso zzso cell zzso may reveal novel regulators of zzso We have demonstrated that gene expression programs in zzso zzso cells grown in zzso cultures differ significantly from those in three-dimensional zzso zzso We identify a protein zzso zzso zzso that was zzso in mature zzso zzso zzso zzso structures but had low to zzso levels in zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso interference inhibited proliferation arrest during zzso Low levels of zzso expression correlated with reduced survival for breast cancer patients, suggesting a tumor zzso zzso Furthermore, we showed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso is a direct zzso of zzso and that loss of zzso increased zzso cell proliferation and zzso together with zzso zzso of zzso Moreover, in patients with zzso breast tumors, low zzso expression correlated with poor clinical prognosis compared to zzso patients with high levels of zzso Thus, zzso is a novel regulator of zzso zzso a potential tumor zzso and a novel zzso marker for patients with zzso breast zzso We have identified the protein zzso zzso zzso as a regulator of three-dimensional zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells and as a regulator of zzso zzso In addition, we demonstrated that zzso is a direct zzso of zzso and that decreased expression of zzso predicts poor prognosis for zzso breast cancer zzso Thus, our results identify zzso as a novel regulator of zzso zzso zzso a potential tumor zzso and a zzso zzso for breast zzso
