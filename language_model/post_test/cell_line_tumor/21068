The phenomenon of zzso of zzso zzso genes showing similar expression levels is known across all zzso zzso We recently mapped the zzso zzso zzso back onto the zzso and provided evidence for the statistically significant zzso of regulated zzso They did, however, not always show similar expression levels, and many of the regulated genes were, in fact, zzso 

In this study, we were able to reproduce this observation with zzso data stemming from 1) human zzso treated with the zzso and potential zzso II inhibitor zzso 2) human zzso treated with the zzso II inhibitor zzso and 3) mouse zzso cells treated with the zzso II inhibitor zzso We found statistically significant zzso of regulated gene zzso and zzso the window size of zzso zzso zzso by using zzso data stemming from lung tissue of a mouse transgenic line zzso the zzso factor zzso which served as a negative control, we found regulated genes to be located with regard to each other nearly in the same way as genes distributed randomly all over the zzso zzso zzso 

We suggest zzso II zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to be responsible for significant zzso of regulated genes through the inability of the stabilized zzso complexes to zzso zzso Within the permanently opened zzso zzso zzso genes might be allowed to be zzso zzso of zzso however, does not inhibit zzso II zzso zzso the zzso is able to perform its normal function of zzso breaking and rejoining the DNA double zzso As a result, exclusively target genes are zzso
