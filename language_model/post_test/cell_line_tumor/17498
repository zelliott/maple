To determine the expression levels of three zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in seven human gastrointestinal cancer cell lines, and to compare the zzso levels with the sensitivity to zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels were assessed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein contents were measured by zzso Fifty percent zzso zzso of growth zzso representing the sensitivity to drugs, were determined by zzso zzso 

zzso values ranged from zzso to zzso zzso for zzso and from zzso to zzso zzso for zzso zzso Cell lines with lower zzso zzso and protein levels tended to be more sensitive to zzso ( zzso but neither zzso nor zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso Only zzso zzso level was sharply related with zzso sensitivity ( zzso but zzso and zzso were not zzso A correlation was found between zzso and protein levels of zzso ( zzso but not zzso ( zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso levels may be useful indicators in predicting the zzso activity of zzso or zzso zzso
