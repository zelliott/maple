zzso zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are key factors in zzso zzso In this study the expression of these factors was identified in cartilage zzso As zzso zzso has been found to be an indispensable factor in zzso zzso we further analyzed the effect of zzso on the expression of zzso zzso and zzso using a previously established cell culture zzso 

zzso specimens of zzso conventional zzso and zzso zzso were obtained from 72 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression was detected by conventional and quantitative reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso expression was also detected by zzso or Western zzso 

zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso was clearly demonstrated in cartilage zzso zzso expression was positively correlated with the tumor zzso Higher zzso expression levels were detected in conventional zzso zzso II and III zzso a zzso grading zzso than in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A typical pattern of zzso zzso was identified, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso presented as a low-level transcript with slightly elevated levels in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso variable zzso expression levels were detected in solitary cases of conventional zzso zzso regulated zzso and zzso expressions in a zzso zzso Whereas low zzso zzso increased zzso and zzso transcription, high zzso zzso had the opposite zzso zzso did not activate zzso zzso 

zzso signaling in cartilage tumors is variable and at least partly zzso by zzso The findings are of therapeutic zzso either as a desired effect or a side effect in medical zzso
