zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso by human breast cancer zzso is associated with poor clinical zzso The zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso is a leading example of a molecular targeted agent, and has an zzso effect on various cancer zzso But the details of the zzso effect and mechanism have not been zzso We studied the zzso effect of zzso in breast cancer cell lines and the zzso zzso downstream of zzso associated with cell zzso 

In this study, we zzso the zzso and zzso effect of zzso in zzso zzso breast cancer cell lines by zzso analysis and zzso chamber zzso We analyzed several zzso zzso pathways which are activated by zzso activated zzso zzso zzso protein zzso 1 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso C zzso by blocking those pathways using zzso of each zzso and also investigated the effects on the zzso of zzso light chain zzso 

zzso inhibited proliferation in most of these cell zzso zzso was shown to be zzso Furthermore, proliferation of zzso cells was not affected by zzso zzso but migration of zzso cells was significantly zzso zzso and zzso zzso blocked zzso cell migration and zzso zzso but the zzso inhibitor did not influence cell zzso 

zzso has an zzso effect on zzso that results in an zzso zzso zzso and zzso are important for the migration of zzso cells, and zzso may inhibit migration by blocking these zzso zzso
