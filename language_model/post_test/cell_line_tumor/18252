zzso of zzso changes using optical zzso has been an active area of research in recent zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso technique that can be used to diagnose various tumors with high sensitivity and zzso We evaluated the ability of zzso zzso to differentiate normal pancreatic tissue from zzso tumors in a mouse zzso 

We collected 920 zzso 475 from 31 normal pancreatic tissue and zzso from 29 tumor zzso using a zzso zzso laser zzso zzso function analysis was used for zzso of normal and tumor zzso 

Using principal component analysis, we were able to highlight subtle chemical differences in normal and zzso zzso Using zzso as the gold standard, zzso analysis gave sensitivities between zzso and zzso and zzso between zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso along with zzso function analysis is a useful method to detect zzso changes in the zzso zzso tumors were characterized by increased collagen content and decreased DNA, zzso and lipids components compared with normal pancreatic zzso
