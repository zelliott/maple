zzso zzso DNA zzso replication has long been considered to occur by zzso synthesis of the two zzso starting at the multiple origins of the zzso loop zzso We report the discovery of a major replication origin at position 57 in the zzso of several human cell lines zzso zzso and zzso and immortalized zzso The nascent chains starting at this origin, in contrast to those initiated at the previously described origins, do not terminate prematurely at the 3' end of the zzso but proceed well beyond this control point, behaving as zzso replicating zzso This origin is mainly responsible for zzso maintenance under zzso conditions, whereas zzso synthesis from the formerly identified zzso origins may be more important for recovery after zzso depletion and for accelerating zzso replication in response to zzso zzso
