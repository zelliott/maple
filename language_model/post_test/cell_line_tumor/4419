The zzso zzso have important roles in multiple aspects of zzso acid metabolism and in the regulation of different cellular zzso zzso expression of zzso has been reported in several types of cancer including zzso zzso and gastric zzso zzso tumor cell populations generate a tumor zzso that can present zzso zzso or zzso zzso The analysis of zzso zzso responses considering the changing nature of the tumor zzso is important to understand tumor cell survival under stress zzso We analyzed the zzso response of zzso zzso zzso zzso and A3 in lung tumor cell lines under zzso zzso and serum deprivation zzso We used zzso to obtain a relative zzso of the zzso transcript zzso We found that the zzso transcript was the most abundant, followed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso was the zzso although its transcript levels were the most zzso zzso transcript levels in lung tumor cell lines responded to changes in the zzso however, zzso transcript levels relative to zzso expression did no change in all tested stress conditions, indicating that the alternative zzso between these zzso was zzso zzso zzso and B1 transcript levels were zzso under serum deprivation zzso possibly to promote a migration zzso Our data provide new insights into the zzso responses of zzso that might favor tumor cell survival and zzso
