High circulating cholesterol and its zzso zzso may facilitate prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso a key cholesterol regulatory protein may effect changes in systemic cholesterol zzso In this investigation, we determined whether zzso of the zzso E gene can trigger defective zzso cholesterol zzso which could promote aggressive prostate zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso moderate and highly zzso zzso prostate cancer cell lines were zzso and we explored whether the zzso zzso were associated with tumor aggressiveness generated by zzso cholesterol zzso using the expression of zzso zzso a zzso surrogate of cholesterol zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso revealed that the zzso cell lines carried zzso zzso or zzso zzso while the aggressive cell lines carried the zzso zzso Our data suggest a contrast between the zzso and the aggressive prostate cancer cell lines in the pattern of cholesterol zzso and zzso zzso Our exploratory results suggest a relationship between prostate zzso zzso zzso and cholesterol zzso Further investigation of this relationship may zzso the molecular basis for considering cholesterol as a risk factor of aggressive prostate tumors, and underscore the potential of the dysfunctional zzso zzso as a zzso of aggressive zzso
