zzso belongs to the zzso zzso family and is known to be activated at the initial step in the cascade of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso can be blocked by a relatively large amount of zzso which renders resistance to death zzso zzso in many types of cancer zzso To ask if zzso zzso of zzso contributes to the induction of zzso we introduced the zzso gene into zzso cells using an zzso zzso zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso increased expression of active forms of zzso in zzso zzso A large amount of zzso zzso of 50) induced zzso significantly in zzso cells and resulted in zzso of zzso (in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (in zzso zzso and dynamic release of zzso c and zzso from the zzso into the zzso On the other hand, a small amount of zzso zzso of 10) causes a slight but zzso increase in the level of zzso with only a small effect on zzso proteins and zzso zzso However, small amounts of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso cell death (with an zzso of 10 or 20, zzso These results suggest both that zzso zzso of zzso by zzso may be essential for induction of zzso cell death and that the combination of zzso and TRAIL or zzso agents could provide a useful strategy for treatment of zzso
