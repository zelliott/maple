zzso zzso 1 zzso is currently an emerging target in pancreatic zzso In this report, we describe a series of zzso based on zzso zzso and evaluate zzso zzso and growth zzso activity in the human pancreatic zzso zzso tumor cell zzso The zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso at the zzso position were zzso zzso of zzso human zzso indicative of zzso zzso However, those with zzso and zzso zzso were poor zzso of zzso zzso activity, due to attenuated elimination of the leaving zzso The ability of this series of zzso to inhibit zzso human zzso correlated with zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The examination of zzso interactions in complex with zzso from zzso molecular zzso simulations supported the observed zzso data with respect to zzso zzso The design of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso allowed us to test the hypothesis that zzso zzso was required for growth zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso analogue were potent zzso of zzso activity and cell zzso however, the zzso and zzso compounds were also potent zzso of zzso activity but relatively poor zzso of cell zzso In addition, the zzso compounds, which were not zzso of zzso zzso activity, demonstrated potent growth zzso These data demonstrate that zzso zzso activity can be zzso from growth zzso activity and suggest additional or alternative targets to zzso that are responsible for the growth zzso activity of this series of zzso in human pancreatic zzso
