zzso transformation induced by zzso radiation was studied using a human retinal zzso zzso cell line immortalized by zzso zzso cell clones were zzso in zzso mice and were analyzed by zzso and comparative zzso zzso zzso zzso cloned cell lines and cell lines derived from tumors produced in zzso nude mice following transplantation exhibited a zzso zzso zzso showed an amplification of zzso and a deletion of the remaining zzso zzso cloning of the amplified region by FISH analysis and subsequent sequence analysis of zzso clones showing amplified FISH signals identified the candidate gene zzso This gene also was found to be zzso expressed at an increased zzso The findings indicate that zzso may play an important role in zzso zzso of zzso zzso This is the first evidence for zzso amplification in human cancer zzso
