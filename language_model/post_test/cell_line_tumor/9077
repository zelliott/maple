The use of zzso zzso zzso is an emerging therapeutic approach for cancer, which thus far has not been employed for zzso We therefore constructed zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso where the zzso A zzso promoter controls expression of the zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso virus was evaluated for zzso protein zzso replication ability, and zzso activity in various cell zzso It was also evaluated for treatment of zzso human zzso tumors in nude zzso To use zzso for the treatment of zzso liver zzso it is important that normal zzso do not support virus replication to minimize zzso We therefore evaluated zzso protein expression in normal zzso We also evaluated zzso gene expression in normal zzso and zzso tumor cells from zzso zzso 

We found that zzso replicates similarly to zzso virus in tumor cells with neuroendocrine features, including the zzso zzso cell line and the zzso zzso cell lines, whereas it is attenuated in other cell zzso Thus, cells where the zzso promoter is active are selectively zzso We also found that zzso is able to suppress fast-growing human zzso zzso tumors in nude zzso Furthermore, zzso is highly expressed in zzso cells from zzso zzso whereas it is not expressed in normal zzso 

zzso is an interesting agent for the treatment of zzso liver zzso in conjunction with standard therapy for these zzso
