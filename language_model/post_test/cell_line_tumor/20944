The zzso tumor zzso protein plays a key role in maintaining zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso during zzso stress is due to both increased protein stability and zzso zzso Previous reports have shown that zzso zzso is translated from an alternative initiation zzso to produce zzso truncated zzso zzso besides full-length zzso We have demonstrated that two internal zzso entry sites zzso regulate the translation of zzso and zzso in a distinct cell cycle zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso protein zzso is a zzso zzso interacting zzso zzso zzso protein binds specifically to both the zzso zzso but with differential zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein results in reduction of activity of both zzso and also the levels of both the zzso It is well known that zzso agents such as zzso enhance the expression of zzso Our results indicate that during zzso treatment, zzso protein zzso from nucleus to the zzso probably to facilitate zzso zzso zzso zzso These observations suggest that the relative zzso abundance of zzso zzso under zzso conditions, might contribute to regulating the coordinated expression of the zzso zzso zzso to the differential affinity of zzso binding to the two zzso zzso
