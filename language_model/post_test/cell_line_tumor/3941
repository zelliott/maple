Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer deaths and efforts are zzso to identify novel therapies to treat these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso that zzso zzso to form zzso acid, has been shown to zzso zzso signaling downstream of zzso which is an zzso driver in some lung zzso Since zzso in zzso and zzso are common in lung cancer, we hypothesized that limiting the function of zzso would zzso zzso properties of lung cancer zzso 

We determined the expression levels of zzso in a mouse models of zzso zzso and zzso lung cancer and in human lung cancer cell lines with zzso zzso in either zzso or zzso We also tested the effects of zzso depletion of zzso in lung cancer cells and tested if zzso depletion zzso the effects of zzso a new generation zzso zzso 

zzso was expressed in zzso zzso from mice with zzso zzso or zzso lung zzso It was also expressed in human lung cancer cell lines with zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso in lung cancer cell lines, harboring zzso zzso reduced their growth on plastic and in soft zzso and also zzso the effects of zzso an zzso zzso zzso depletion also reduced growth of one of two lung cancer cell lines that zzso zzso zzso 

Our data indicate that zzso is a potential therapeutic target in lung zzso especially those harboring zzso zzso Our findings warrant further studies to examine the effects of limiting its function in zzso
