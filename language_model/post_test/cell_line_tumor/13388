zzso in head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso is high due to emergence of therapy resistance which results in local and regional zzso that may have their origin in resistant cancer stem cells zzso or cells with an zzso transition zzso zzso In the present study, we investigate the possibility of using the cell surface expression of zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso both of which have been used as stem cell zzso to identify zzso within zzso cell lines that differ with respect to zzso and treatment zzso Three zzso consisting of zzso zzso and zzso cells, respectively, were collected by zzso cell zzso The zzso population showed a zzso zzso zzso while the zzso population was dominated by zzso zzso The zzso population was enriched with cells in zzso and showed a relatively low proliferation rate and a high zzso zzso Using a real time zzso zzso 27 zzso of which 14 were related to an zzso zzso and two with zzso were found to be zzso expressed in zzso cells in comparison to zzso zzso Moreover, zzso cells showed a low sensitivity to radiation, zzso zzso and zzso and a high sensitivity to zzso relative to its zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, our results show that the combination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell surface expression can be used to identify a treatment resistant zzso with an zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso
