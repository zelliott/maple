The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso Novartis zzso Corporation; zzso zzso is a powerful drug for treatment of chronic zzso leukemia zzso and other zzso It selectively targets various zzso zzso thereby leading to growth arrest of respective cancer zzso Given its wide application, it is of high importance to know all related underlying molecular zzso We had previously found that zzso increases the cellular clearance of zzso protein zzso by targeting the zzso zzso and thereby zzso zzso zzso Here, we describe that zzso dose zzso activates the cellular zzso machinery in zzso cells, independently of tissue type, species origin or zzso status of zzso zzso is an zzso cellular degradation mechanism implicated in many zzso and zzso zzso Our data link for the first time the process of zzso with the mode of action of zzso zzso of zzso might represent an additional mechanism of zzso to induce growth arrest, promote zzso in cancer cells and eventually even promote zzso zzso
