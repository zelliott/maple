Despite improvements in diagnosis of advanced prostate cancer zzso treatment is not efficient and zzso survival is still zzso Initially, the less abundant of cell types, neuroendocrine cells zzso are involved in regulatory process but their zzso role is not fully zzso Among others, an increase in zzso cells along with tumor progression has been commonly reported but their role in zzso or the molecular mechanisms of zzso is still a matter of zzso We have used human zzso cells zzso induced to differentiate to zzso cells with several zzso zzso withdrawal, zzso zzso or treatment with the zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso patients' specimens were also analyzed by western zzso and by zzso zzso zzso cells express high levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso in addition to zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso factor, mainly through zzso zzso into the zzso More importantly, zzso of zzso zzso the rise of zzso in zzso cells, showing that zzso zzso might be instrumental for zzso differentiation in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso is highly expressed in advanced tumors of patients' when compared with control, zzso samples or with zzso tumors, along with the presence of zzso a common zzso zzso Also, zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso with zzso markers in most of zzso cells observed in zzso zzso The present findings indicate that zzso is essential for zzso zzso and mediates in part the differentiation process, which appears also to be critical in zzso
