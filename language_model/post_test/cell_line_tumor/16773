zzso zzso and their zzso receptors have been implicated widely in cancer zzso In this study, we report a critical zzso relationship between zzso expression and zzso in the setting of human zzso zzso zzso Among the zzso zzso zzso only zzso was detected in all the zzso cell lines zzso Moreover, in zzso zzso zzso expression was significantly higher than in zzso liver zzso Reduction of zzso or its zzso zzso in cancer cells reduced cell invasion in zzso and tumor growth, zzso and zzso in zzso zzso loss of zzso led to reduced zzso zzso zzso and decreased zzso in zzso zzso via zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso high expression of zzso was an independent predictor of increased recurrence and poor survival in zzso Human zzso samples expressing high levels of zzso also contained an increased number of zzso zzso and zzso and the combination of zzso and zzso was a superior predictor of recurrence and survival than either marker used zzso Together, our findings suggest that elevated expression of zzso promotes zzso zzso and a zzso inflammatory environment and is associated with poor patient zzso These results support the concept that zzso of the zzso zzso may improve prognosis after zzso zzso
