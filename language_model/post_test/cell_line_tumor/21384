zzso of zzso group of protein zzso zzso by homocysteine zzso zzso has been implicated in vascular disease in zzso We have previously generated zzso rabbit zzso zzso zzso that specifically recognize the zzso zzso on zzso zzso The present work was undertaken to examine the utility of these zzso for the zzso detection of zzso proteins in biological zzso We found that the rabbit zzso specifically detected zzso in a zzso zzso that the signal resulting from the reaction of the zzso with zzso depended on the amount of the zzso and that the sensitivity of the zzso was zzso The rabbit zzso zzso also specifically detected zzso zzso in human zzso as shown by positive zzso zzso of zzso and zzso samples from cardiac surgery patients, and a lack of zzso when the zzso was zzso with zzso We also observed increased zzso zzso for zzso in zzso zzso from zzso mice with zzso induced by a high zzso diet, relative to zzso mice fed a control zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso rabbit zzso zzso can detect and monitor zzso proteins in human and mouse zzso with good sensitivity and zzso
