The zzso loop 2 zzso zzso of the G zzso zzso class A is thought to function like an zzso zzso We created zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to target this lid and to examine if these zzso can selectively activate the zzso 

Western blots and zzso zzso zzso determined zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell cycle zzso zzso cell zzso checked for zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso examined the zzso ability to induce zzso zzso zzso kit zzso zzso detected zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso measured zzso effect on suppressing zzso zzso zzso binding interference zzso with the fluorescent zzso zzso was used to examine zzso interference to zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso selective and zzso and they suppress cell proliferation via cell cycle arrest and zzso In addition, these zzso decrease zzso production and inhibit zzso zzso Interestingly, these zzso do not interfere with zzso zzso 

The zzso is an important zzso for G zzso zzso zzso and required for zzso binding zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso independently inhibited zzso proliferation and decreased hormone zzso Unlike zzso our zzso do not interfere with zzso zzso
