This study assessed the zzso and zzso potential against tumor lines of zzso seed extracts of 21 plant species belonging to different families from zzso zzso In addition, some underlying mechanisms involved in this zzso were also zzso Among the 21 extracts tested, the zzso zzso after 72 h of incubation demonstrated that only the zzso extract obtained from zzso zzso seeds zzso which has steroids, zzso and zzso showed in zzso zzso activity against human cancer cells, being zzso more active on leukemia zzso line zzso value of zzso zzso zzso than on zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso 180 cells zzso of zzso zzso zzso After zzso exposure, flow zzso and zzso analyses of zzso cells showed that zzso caused decrease in cell number, volume and viability as well as zzso DNA fragmentation in a zzso way, suggesting that the zzso triggers zzso pathways of cell zzso
