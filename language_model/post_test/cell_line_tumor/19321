As a therapeutic approach for the treatment of zzso diseases, it would be tempting to lower the level of the potent zzso testosterone zzso and zzso zzso by using zzso of type 3 and type 5 zzso zzso zzso However, the efficiency of such a strategy will be optimal only if zzso zzso the precursor of zzso does not possess per zzso zzso activity on the zzso zzso zzso To determine if the zzso effect previously observed on zzso cells for zzso originates from its direct zzso zzso action on zzso or from its transformation into a zzso we started a series of zzso using the human prostate cancer zzso cell line, which expresses a highly sensitive zzso By real-time zzso analysis, we detected type 1 zzso zzso a small amount of type 5 zzso but not type 2 zzso nor type 3 zzso We then studied the transformation of labeled zzso in zzso cells after zzso days and the most important zzso detected was zzso zzso which is the product of zzso zzso We measured only low levels of zzso zzso and zzso This result was next confirmed by using an inhibitor of zzso that completely inhibited the transformation of zzso into zzso and consequently into zzso and zzso The zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso cells was next determined in presence or absence of the zzso zzso Although the cells zzso in the presence of zzso only, no cell proliferation was observed with a combination of zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is not zzso per zzso We next determined that zzso and zzso zzso cell growth with the same pattern and potency as zzso whereas zzso had a zzso lower zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso is not in itself an zzso steroid on zzso zzso cells, and its zzso activity appears to be zzso by its transformation into zzso and/or into zzso
