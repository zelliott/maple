zzso zzso has limited clinical benefits in pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a novel, zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor that has zzso zzso This study tested the benefits of combined zzso and zzso in zzso 

Cell viability and protein expression were evaluated by zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso growth and survival experiments were performed in zzso zzso 

In zzso cells, zzso zzso and zzso + zzso respectively, caused zzso zzso and zzso zzso in proliferation at 100 zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso and zzso + zzso respectively, caused zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso In zzso zzso zzso and zzso + zzso respectively, caused zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso increased zzso as evidenced by the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Net zzso growth compared with controls in the zzso zzso and zzso + zzso groups was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was reduced by zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso + zzso groups, respectively, compared with zzso Median survival in the control, zzso zzso and zzso + zzso groups was 16, 21, 24 and 30 days, respectively zzso 

These findings support a combination approach using zzso zzso agents such as zzso with standard zzso therapy in the treatment of zzso
