Rapid development of multiple drug resistance against current therapies is a major barrier in the treatment of zzso zzso zzso agents that can overcome acquired drug resistance in cancer cells are of great zzso Previously, we have demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a stable analogue of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso drug resistance and zzso with a variety of cancer therapies in leukemia zzso zzso relationship zzso studies of zzso guided the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso a compound with low zzso zzso against a zzso of zzso and solid tumor zzso More zzso our studies of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso resistant cancer cells highlight its ability to selectively kill drug-resistant cells over parent cancer zzso zzso zzso tumor cell growth through the induction of zzso with detailed mechanism of its selectivity toward drug-resistant cancer cells under zzso These results suggest that zzso is a promising candidate for treatment of zzso with multiple drug zzso
