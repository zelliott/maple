The regulation of the zzso death and its relevance in zzso therapy are largely zzso Here, we have investigated the zzso and zzso activities of two zzso system zzso zzso and zzso The present study points out that the zzso cell lines zzso and zzso are useful models to study the zzso to zzso and necrosis in response to zzso system zzso zzso cells show resistance to zzso induced by zzso and zzso but they are more susceptible to necrosis induced by zzso zzso zzso cells are more susceptible to zzso induced by both zzso but show some resistance to zzso zzso No overt differences in the induction of zzso and zzso or in the expression levels of other components of the zzso machinery were observed between zzso and zzso zzso Instead, by comparing the zzso profiles of the two cell lines, we have found that the resistance to zzso necrosis could arise from differences in zzso zzso and in the zzso In particular, collagen IV, which is highly expressed in zzso cells, and zzso whose adhesive function is zzso by zzso in zzso cells, can restrain the zzso response to zzso zzso our results provide an initial characterization of the molecular signals governing cell death by necrosis in zzso cell zzso
