Our previous study shows that tumor invasion is inhibited by zzso zzso zzso In the present study, the mechanism underlying the zzso effect of zzso on invasion of human zzso cells zzso was attempted to be zzso zzso ability of the tumor cells was shown to be inhibited in a zzso manner by treatment with zzso at zzso zzso for 1 zzso zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso cells were markedly diminished relative to those of zzso cells as evaluated by electron spin resonance method using the zzso agent zzso zzso was localized in the vicinity of the cell membrane abundantly in zzso cells, but was diminished in a zzso manner in zzso cells as shown with the zzso agent zzso The cell zzso zzso zzso increased zzso in the cell nucleus of zzso cells as shown by Western zzso Thus the zzso of tumor invasion by zzso was shown to be attributed to decreases in both the cell migratory ability and the zzso zzso near the cell zzso which may result from an increase in zzso in the cell nucleus and reduction of zzso zzso that is achieved by enrichment of zzso zzso derived from zzso
