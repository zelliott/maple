zzso is a zzso protein of the zzso type that is abundantly expressed in zzso and has been implicated in the regulation of several zzso activities, including proliferation and zzso We show here that reducing zzso levels in the zzso cell line zzso and the zzso cell line zzso by small interference zzso technique results in a rapid zzso of stress zzso collapse of zzso onto the plasma membrane and reduced migration, and acquisition of a zzso zzso Also, zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells show a higher abundance of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso which mark differentiated zzso compared with control zzso These effects are dependent on reduced zzso of the zzso zzso zzso downstream zzso zzso and zzso and consequently elevated activity of zzso and zzso and decreased activity of the zzso zzso Also, rat primary zzso zzso zzso zzso expression when exposed to the zzso agent zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at later stages of zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, reducing zzso levels results in a remarkably slow resumption of zzso zzso suggesting the zzso might regulate its own zzso Finally, we show that zzso interacts with zzso zzso thereby stimulating the zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso might contribute to reduce the differentiation potential of cells of the zzso lineage and participate in the zzso zzso process in the case of brain insult and in invasive properties of zzso zzso
