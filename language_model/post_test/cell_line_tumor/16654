zzso is defined as a chronic liver disease with altered zzso metabolism and could result in zzso zzso zzso response was known as a promoting factor in progression of some zzso In this study, we determined the significant increase of zzso level in zzso patients' zzso 

The zzso levels in zzso patients' zzso were measured and correlated with clinical zzso zzso zzso expressions in zzso zzso were detected by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell lines were treated with zzso and tested the zzso and invasive zzso 

The zzso levels showed positive correlations with serum zzso and alkaline zzso and a negative correlation with zzso This study also showed an association with shorter survival times when patients with low and high serum zzso levels were zzso In zzso studies demonstrated the effect of zzso on cell proliferation and invasion in zzso manners, which could be inhibited by zzso a clinical used zzso zzso Invasion showed an association with the zzso gene expression and could be inhibited by small interfering zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso was the main zzso zzso that response to zzso zzso 

zzso zzso protein could be one of the zzso for zzso invasion in zzso via the zzso zzso These findings could lead to an understanding of the mechanism of zzso zzso
