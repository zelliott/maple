Here, we report the results of zzso analysis of the mouse zzso zzso cell line exposed to zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso The objective of the work was to examine whether zzso affects the expression of proteins in this cell line and to compare the zzso expressed proteins with the corresponding zzso expression zzso The identified proteins were zzso using a zzso quantitative method based on counting the observed peptides as an index of protein zzso The calculation of the ratio of peptides obtained from exposed and control samples allowed us to evaluate the effect of zzso on protein expression and to compare these results to those obtained in gene expression profiling zzso zzso of some of the zzso expressed proteins and their corresponding zzso was zzso The analysis of the protein ratios revealed that 12 proteins were significantly zzso These proteins included zzso proteins zzso zzso beta 2 and zzso zzso The first two proteins were zzso zzso whereas the third was zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso binding protein and zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso were decreased zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso translation factor zzso which are involved in protein zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso Also, proteins involved in zzso of zzso and in transcription, zzso factor zzso 2 and zzso binding protein 4 zzso were decreased zzso and zzso times, zzso Nuclear zzso zzso II was reduced zzso Finally, zzso zzso an essential protein for cell zzso and a protein similar to zzso (with a molecular weight and a zzso zzso comparable to that of zzso were also zzso zzso zzso zzso We propose that the observed zzso of the expression level of zzso in the zzso cells could account for the previously reported zzso effect of zzso
