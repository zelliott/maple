In this report, the development of a zzso cell chip for monitoring allergic response is zzso A rat zzso leukemia cell line zzso a tumor analog of rat zzso mast cells, has been used as a model to observe its allergic response upon zzso zzso The cells were cultivated on a zzso zzso zzso the surface of which was modified by several zzso The zzso zzso which comprised a cell zzso chamber and zzso channels, was zzso by conventional molding zzso In order to detect the allergic response, a fluorescent zzso zzso was introduced inside the cell compartment that included zzso The cells were zzso with zzso bovine serum zzso zzso after incubation with zzso zzso When zzso events occurred, the zzso system detected the fluorescent signal of zzso which was released from zzso cells by using a zzso tube zzso fitted onto a zzso
