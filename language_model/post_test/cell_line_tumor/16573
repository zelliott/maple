The zzso zzso is a zzso protein that acts as an energy dependent, zzso zzso pump and is zzso by the zzso zzso It has been shown to be responsible for zzso resistance zzso in a defined zzso of breast cancer patients and thus represents a molecular target for zzso zzso in this tumor zzso zzso zzso have been developed and demonstrated high selectivity for zzso with zzso activities in the low zzso zzso Although some objective responses were achieved in clinical trials, combination therapy with these zzso zzso such as zzso zzso caused unacceptable zzso zzso zzso zzso to the tumor site is a mean to increase their therapeutic index, and in this context binding of zzso zzso to circulating zzso is an established technology to reduce the toxicity and enhance the efficacy of zzso zzso In this study, we consequently developed an zzso zzso zzso of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso in a zzso synthesis using a zzso zzso zzso system established in our laboratory that first introduces zzso acid at the zzso of zzso followed by zzso with zzso zzso to form the zzso zzso zzso The zzso group enables the zzso to bind rapidly and selectively to the zzso position of zzso zzso after intravenous zzso zzso analysis demonstrated rapid zzso binding of the zzso zzso as well as the quantitative release of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso at pH zzso zzso its ability to circumvent zzso was tested in two zzso breast zzso cell lines zzso and zzso The zzso status of these cell lines can be reversed by zzso which was confirmed in a zzso 123 zzso using zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso as well its zzso zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso as well as to an zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso achieving zzso values in the same order of magnitude as the parental cell zzso Thus, a novel zzso of zzso has been developed that could have the potential to improve the toxicity issues and tumor targeting properties of the original zzso
