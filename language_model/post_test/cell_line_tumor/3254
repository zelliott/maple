zzso the principal component of zzso is a zzso zzso integral membrane zzso The interaction of the zzso scaffolding domain with signaling molecules can functionally inhibit the activity of these signaling zzso Little is known about how zzso influences the expression of zzso zzso an ABC zzso zzso by zzso resistance zzso zzso To zzso the possible mechanism between zzso and zzso zzso in the present study, we zzso zzso in the zzso breast zzso cells, a zzso resistant line, and then selected single clone cells highly expressing zzso zzso Both Western zzso and zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso was markedly zzso in the zzso while zzso protein was almost zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction also showed that the expression of zzso zzso was significantly suppressed in the zzso It was confirmed further by Northern zzso zzso Moreover, through measuring the changes of drug resistance and zzso transport activity in the zzso we found that zzso of zzso reversed drug resistance of zzso and lowered their zzso transport activity to the level of zzso Taken together, our results indicate that such suppression of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso may occur at the zzso zzso
