It is well established that genetic zzso that impair zzso function zzso women to early onset of breast and zzso zzso However, the zzso factors that support normal zzso functions remain to be zzso Using a zzso approach to search for such zzso factors, we identified zzso zzso and zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso domain of zzso as found in breast cancer patients zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso caused the loss of physical interaction between zzso and zzso and significantly reduced the zzso of zzso zzso function by zzso The reported zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso Wang, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Goldberg, zzso zzso and Rosen, zzso zzso (1999) Science zzso zzso was rescued by the zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso activity appeared to be indispensable for zzso complex function in both zzso gene regulation and DNA zzso zzso zzso of the zzso complex suggested that zzso formed a complex with zzso presumably as a novel zzso of zzso known zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complex zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso McMahon, zzso zzso Cole, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (2002) zzso Cell 9, zzso Unlike other zzso the isolated complex zzso a previously unknown combination of components including zzso and zzso major components of the zzso zzso surveillance repair complex zzso Thus, our results suggested that the multiple zzso functions require a novel zzso zzso zzso complex zzso
