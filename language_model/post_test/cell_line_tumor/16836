The zzso zzso factor is a well known regulator of cell proliferation and zzso but its role in response to DNA damage is less zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso can inhibit proliferation in a variety of human tumor zzso However, it is still elusive how the agent acts on zzso Here we show that zzso and zzso cells formed DNA zzso breaks after zzso exposure, accompanied by zzso zzso at protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso break marker zzso and promoted zzso arrest in zzso zzso and zzso while expressed zzso zzso of zzso zzso significantly reduced ability to accumulate at sites of DNA damage and zzso arrest, suggesting that zzso is required for zzso zzso checkpoint zzso upon DNA zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso zzso promoted zzso in zzso cells, indicating that zzso may induce zzso in zzso zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso plays a crucial role in zzso zzso arrest but is zzso for zzso zzso These data also suggest that the mechanism of zzso action is zzso
