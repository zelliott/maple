In zzso coli, several proteins whose synthesis is enhanced by zzso at the level of translation have been zzso We looked for proteins that are similarly regulated in zzso using a mouse zzso zzso zzso cell culture zzso zzso zzso was induced by adding an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso enhanced by zzso were determined by comparison of protein levels in control and zzso cells using two-dimensional gel zzso and were identified by zzso degradation and/or zzso tandem mass zzso zzso stimulation of the synthesis of these proteins at the level of translation was confirmed by measuring levels of the corresponding zzso and zzso and levels of the zzso zzso zzso The proteins identified in this way were zzso protein 1, beta zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso L zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso Since zzso was most strongly enhanced by zzso among three zzso the mechanism of zzso stimulation of zzso synthesis was studied using zzso cells zzso zzso with genes zzso zzso fusion zzso with normal or zzso zzso region zzso of zzso zzso zzso most likely enhanced zzso zzso on the zzso of zzso zzso
