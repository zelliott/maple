Chaperone protein quantity may regulate the balance of proteins involved in invasion and zzso zzso is a zzso and zzso protein that has been implicated in zzso migration, and zzso We reported that zzso zzso in zzso human breast cancer cells results in a significant decrease in migration and zzso to zzso molecules that is reversed upon deletion of the zzso zzso domain zzso We now zzso that zzso analysis would identify proteins involved in zzso processes that are regulated by zzso and/or its zzso domain zzso zzso array analysis of zzso cells zzso either zzso zzso zzso or zzso identified zzso as a zzso target zzso zzso is a known zzso zzso Increased zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso was found in zzso zzso zzso zzso with these findings, zzso quantity and zzso were increased in zzso zzso but suppressed in FL zzso both zzso forms resulted in zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso FL zzso reduced the already low zzso zzso in response to attachment on collagen zzso zzso invasion of zzso cells engineered with the zzso zzso was enhanced in FL cells and minimal in zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked a greater percentage of the zzso invasion in FL cells than in zzso zzso This implies a zzso function of zzso on zzso and thus zzso zzso zzso may be necessary for zzso and zzso zzso in FL cells, zzso a negative signal of the zzso domain when zzso is zzso We propose that zzso regulates zzso expression to regulate zzso cell zzso and zzso
