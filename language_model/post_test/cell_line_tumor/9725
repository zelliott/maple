zzso zzso zzso protein 3 zzso was reported to be important for regulating zzso zzso assembly and zzso zzso While the protein level of zzso was shown to be altered during cell cycle zzso the molecular mechanism in controlling zzso level is zzso Here, we show that zzso protein level can be regulated by zzso a well known zzso of zzso zzso We identified zzso as an interacting partner of zzso by a zzso array zzso Both in zzso and in zzso binding studies indicated that zzso can form complexes with zzso zzso of zzso zzso prolonged zzso protein level during zzso zzso zzso of zzso level by zzso zzso or zzso zzso correlated well with an increase or decrease of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the domain mapping studies of zzso revealed that multiple zzso are involved in zzso degradation of zzso Altogether, our findings suggest that zzso controls zzso protein stability during zzso zzso
