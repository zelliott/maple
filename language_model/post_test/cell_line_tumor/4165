The aims of the present work are to explore the effect of cold working on zzso zzso of zzso low cost zzso nitrogen containing zzso stainless zzso zzso and to compare it with conventionally used biomedical grade, zzso zzso zzso and zzso using Dalton's zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed on DL cell line for zzso evaluation and cell zzso zzso As a result, it was observed that the zzso had higher cell proliferation and cell growth and it increases by increasing nitrogen content and degree of cold zzso The surface zzso of the zzso was also investigated by water contact angle zzso The value of contact angles was found to decrease with increase in nitrogen content and degree of cold zzso This indicates that the zzso character increases with increasing nitrogen content and degree of cold working which further attributed to enhance the surface free energy zzso which would be conducive to cell zzso which in turn increases the cell zzso
