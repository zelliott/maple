zzso forms of cancer are often defined by zzso zzso zzso yet in most cases, the zzso or contributing genetic components remain poorly zzso Here, we zzso zzso zzso to identify candidate zzso potentially contributing to aggressive breast cancer zzso We identified the zzso protein zzso (also known as zzso which is located at a zzso region frequently amplified in breast cancer zzso as a potential zzso zzso of zzso in zzso normal human zzso zzso cells resulted in acquisition of zzso properties such as loss of contact zzso zzso independence, and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in human breast cancer cell lines inhibited colony formation, invasion, and migration in zzso and markedly reduced tumor formation and zzso in mouse zzso zzso zzso of zzso enhanced zzso zzso and increased Ras zzso in zzso As these results indicate that zzso is a zzso gene frequently amplified in breast cancer that encodes a protein with zzso function, we suggest it has potential importance as a therapeutic zzso Furthermore, these studies provide new insight into the emerging role of the zzso family of small G proteins and their interacting partners in zzso
