Mouse zzso zzso cells were zzso into zzso membrane deposited on calcium zzso gel beads via the zzso zzso Two zzso with different zzso acid zzso zzso high and zzso but with the same molecular weights were zzso zzso of the cells in the membrane zzso by the zzso with an intermediate content of zzso acid zzso was approximately zzso higher than those in the membrane zzso by the zzso with a high content of zzso acid immediately after zzso Growth of cells in zzso was hindered in case of zzso in the zzso membrane deposited on the zzso zzso zzso The zzso cells in the zzso made from zzso zzso needed a longer period to establish a zzso in recipients than those in the zzso made from zzso zzso despite the same number of viable cells zzso zzso of the zzso with the core made from the zzso zzso maintained their blood zzso values less than 300 zzso for a longer zzso
