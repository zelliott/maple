Various animal models of zzso tumor have been developed for the zzso evaluation of therapeutic zzso for the treatment of zzso zzso The ideal model for the investigation of therapeutic effects of proposed novel zzso treatments requires the mass of the implanted tumor to be confined to the zzso of the zzso at least for the initial zzso However, previously reported zzso tumor models are not suitable for the evaluation of zzso therapies for the treatment of superficial zzso cancer, since the muscle invasive tumors have developed from the beginnings of the zzso These models are too aggressive to study local treatment zzso In the current study, we demonstrated that careful zzso of zzso mouse zzso cancer cells into the zzso of a zzso zzso mouse could establish a superficial zzso tumor with an zzso of zzso The procedure and technique for handling animals are simple for standard animal zzso Maintenance of the in zzso conditions of zzso cells without contamination of zzso and careful selection of the zzso of zzso mouse seem to be essential for stable tumor zzso This zzso tumor model appeared to be easy to reproduce among several investigators in different zzso The zzso zzso tumor model, which was confined to zzso lets us evaluate various zzso treatment zzso
