In a previous experimental study using a chronic zzso failure rat model, a zzso zzso effect of zzso zzso on bone formation was found that could be reproduced in an in zzso zzso using primary rat zzso The results from the latter study allowed us to distinguish between a reduced zzso formation in the presence of an intact zzso at low zzso (1 zzso and an interference of the element with the zzso zzso formation at high doses zzso zzso To further investigate the latter effect of Sr on zzso bone mineral properties, an in zzso study was set up in which the zzso rat zzso cell line was exposed to zzso added to the cell culture medium in a concentration range varying between zzso zzso zzso growth and functionality of the culture was investigated by measurement of the alkaline zzso activity and calcium zzso concentration in the culture medium zzso as an index of zzso zzso zzso zzso at various time zzso At the end of the culture period zzso days zzso samples of the zzso cultures were taken for further analysis using X-ray zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso doped with various Sr zzso (based on the cell culture and previous experimental studies and yielding zzso + zzso ratios ranging from zzso was prepared and examined for crystal growth and zzso Crystal size was assessed using scanning electron zzso zzso zzso incorporation indicated a reduced zzso in the 20 and 100 zzso Sr groups zzso zzso zzso synthetic zzso showed a significant zzso reduction in crystal growth, as assessed by zzso and an increase in zzso apparent from zzso zzso + zzso zzso Moreover, in both zzso cultures and synthetic zzso zzso and zzso analysis showed a reduced zzso and altered crystal lattice at similar zzso These new data support our previous in zzso and in zzso findings and point to a potential zzso interference of Sr with zzso formation and crystal properties in zzso
