zzso grow in the presence of zzso T cells, suggesting the existence of intrinsic cancer cell escape zzso We hypothesized that a zzso zzso zzso inhibitor could sensitize tumor cells to zzso because this class of agents has been reported to increase tumor zzso expression and shift gene expression to a zzso milieu in cancer zzso To test this question, we treated zzso zzso melanoma with the combination of the zzso inhibitor zzso and the adoptive transfer of zzso melanoma zzso zzso T zzso The combined therapy significantly improved zzso activity through several zzso zzso increase in zzso and zzso zzso expression by tumor zzso zzso decrease in competing zzso zzso in recipient mice, resulting in a zzso advantage for the zzso transferred zzso and zzso improvement in the functional activity of the zzso transferred zzso We confirmed the beneficial effects of this zzso inhibitor as a zzso to zzso in a different model of zzso zzso vaccination with the melanoma zzso zzso protein 2, which also showed a significant improvement in zzso activity against zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso inhibitor zzso significantly enhances tumor zzso through effects on target tumor cells as well as improving the zzso activity of tumor zzso zzso
