zzso zzso seems to play an important role in the complex control of prostate cell zzso It zzso proliferation and zzso differentiation and zzso in prostate cancer zzso However, the molecular mechanisms of the zzso activity of zzso are not completely zzso The expression of zzso factor zzso a member of the transforming growth zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be associated with zzso and zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso human prostate cancer cells in a zzso and zzso zzso In zzso cells, the suppression of cell growth by zzso is accompanied by stimulation of zzso zzso and protein zzso Human zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso We do not detect any effect of zzso zzso on the zzso growth of zzso cells, but this zzso partially reverses the suppression of zzso cell growth by zzso suggesting that the effect of zzso on cell growth is at least partially zzso by zzso In zzso cells, which are less responsive to the zzso effect of zzso it has no effect on zzso zzso We do not detect an effect of zzso zzso on zzso zzso in zzso cells, but zzso zzso are zzso zzso in response to zzso which suggests that in zzso cells zzso may exert its action through zzso alternative to the classical zzso signaling zzso The present study describes the regulation of zzso the zzso protein of the zzso zzso by zzso in zzso prostate cancer zzso This is a new link between zzso and growth factors of zzso zzso in the control of prostate cell zzso
