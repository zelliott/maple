zzso a local decrease in oxygen tension occurring in inflammatory and tumor zzso zzso gene expression in zzso Because zzso are important zzso producers, we investigated the regulatory effects of zzso on zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso zzso the production of the zzso and T zzso zzso and zzso factor, zzso zzso zzso zzso Exposure of mouse zzso to low oxygen tension resulted in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso expression and protein zzso zzso zzso effects were selective for zzso because the zzso zzso inflammatory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not affected, and zzso was zzso zzso also zzso in a zzso fashion, zzso zzso by zzso and zzso Moreover, the zzso action of zzso was exerted on human zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with zzso of gene zzso and zzso zzso suggesting a dual molecular mechanism of zzso Finally, we found that the zzso zzso zzso acid and the iron zzso zzso which mimic zzso in the induction of gene zzso zzso regulated the expression of zzso This study characterizes a novel property of zzso as a selective inhibitor of zzso production induced by different stimuli in zzso and demonstrates that zzso of gene expression by zzso can be controlled at both zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso may represent a negative regulatory mechanism to control zzso zzso recruitment in pathological zzso
