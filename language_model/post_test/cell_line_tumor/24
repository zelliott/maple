The critical roles of zzso in cell growth and differentiation have made zzso zzso zzso a promising target for zzso zzso Recent studies have demonstrated in zzso that some zzso zzso zzso could be used as zzso and oxidized by zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso an zzso that zzso natural zzso indicating a potential role of zzso in determining the sensitivity of cancer cells to specific zzso zzso This study zzso in zzso the effect of zzso on zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its mechanism when highly expressed in human lung cancer line zzso 

A clone with high expression of zzso was obtained by zzso zzso lung cancer cell line with zzso zzso and selecting with quantitative zzso zzso and zzso activity zzso Cell proliferation was determined by zzso method and zzso related events were evaluated by DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso western zzso (for zzso C and zzso and zzso zzso (for zzso zzso 

A clone highly expressing zzso was zzso High expression of zzso in zzso cells inhibited zzso of zzso decreased their sensitivity to the toxicity of zzso and prevented zzso induced zzso 

These results indicate a new drug zzso mechanism in the tumor zzso High expression of zzso can greatly decrease the sensitivity of tumor cells to the specific zzso zzso by detoxifying those zzso and prevent analogue induced zzso
