zzso techniques are being useful to obtain zzso and gene expression signatures associated with different zzso zzso deregulation is a frequent event in the zzso of breast as well as other zzso In addition to DNA repair functions of zzso it is involved in a wide range of cellular processes such as cell cycle, zzso zzso or zzso However, the molecular events underlying zzso zzso are still largely zzso In order to deepen our understanding of zzso zzso we integrated data from zzso and zzso zzso experiments on zzso breast cancer cell line, and the zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso to obtain significant zzso relationships associated with the presence of zzso zzso By using zzso integration of gene and zzso expression data, we found significant zzso relationships underlying the array zzso We additionally evaluated the role of these statistically significant pairs at the biological pathways level and identified zzso and zzso pathways associated with these expression zzso Furthermore, we zzso validated zzso induced by zzso that commonly regulate zzso a key regulator of zzso and zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso and zzso induced in zzso zzso cells, bind and regulate zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso zzso or zzso in zzso zzso cells was sufficient to zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that integration of zzso and zzso associated with zzso expression was useful to discover new zzso interactions as molecular events underlying zzso zzso
