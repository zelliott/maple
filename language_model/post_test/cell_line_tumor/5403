zzso in the zzso gene are the most common cause of zzso familial Parkinson disease zzso zzso has been initially characterized as an zzso zzso zzso but the pathological relevance of this activity remains zzso Recently, an impressive amount of evidence has accumulated that zzso is involved in the maintenance of zzso function and zzso We used a human zzso cell line as a model to study the influence of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso Using an unbiased zzso zzso approach, we found that zzso is associated physically with zzso DNA zzso in zzso as well as in differentiated zzso zzso In zzso the association of zzso with zzso could be confirmed in brain tissue of mouse and human zzso zzso and zzso of zzso were enhanced in zzso cells zzso the zzso zzso The ability of zzso to support zzso was impaired by zzso zzso point zzso Most importantly, we show that zzso protects zzso from zzso damage and stimulates zzso zzso Moreover, higher zzso of zzso to zzso oxygen species and reduced zzso repair capacity was observed in zzso zzso of a zzso zzso Our data indicate a novel role for zzso in directly supporting zzso function and protecting zzso zzso integrity from zzso zzso
