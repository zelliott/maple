The molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso effects of zzso are not well understood and remain the subject of zzso One of the zzso possibilities involves zzso in gene zzso We examined gene expression profiles in zzso gastric cancer cells treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso for 24 zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso of genes were induced or zzso more than zzso in cells treated with zzso zzso Seven genes were selected and confirmed by reverse zzso chain zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso cells treated with zzso zzso zzso expression level was decreased zzso by zzso zzso In addition, the expression pattern of zzso was zzso related to that of zzso We also examined zzso expression in human gastric cancer zzso and compared it with zzso parameters to study its zzso role in the zzso zzso was frequently and strongly expressed in gastric cancer zzso compared with that in adjacent zzso zzso Its zzso scores were positively correlated to zzso labeling zzso and tumor zzso and is higher in zzso type than in diffuse zzso In zzso a number of zzso both induced and zzso could be important in zzso zzso zzso cell death in gastric cancer zzso zzso one of the zzso zzso is zzso in gastric zzso and has positive role in tumor progression and zzso of zzso zzso
