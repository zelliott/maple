zzso zzso chains have been found to be associated with zzso deposits in a number of diseases including zzso zzso zzso zzso lines of evidence have linked zzso and their zzso zzso and especially zzso zzso to the metabolism of the prion protein zzso zzso are a family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso can become zzso by zzso produced zzso zzso When zzso is exposed to a reducing agent, such as zzso zzso oxide is released and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso These processes take place while zzso zzso via a zzso zzso zzso We have previously demonstrated that prion protein provides the zzso zzso required to zzso zzso groups in the core protein of zzso By using zzso zzso zzso and zzso techniques, we now show that copper zzso zzso of prion protein and zzso from the cell surface to zzso zzso We find that prion protein is controlling both the zzso of zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression has no effect on zzso prion protein zzso but in cells expressing a prion protein construct lacking the copper binding domain zzso of zzso is much reduced and zzso is zzso We also demonstrate that zzso zzso chains of zzso are poorly zzso in prion zzso zzso The addition of either zzso zzso zzso oxide donors, zzso or zzso expression of prion protein restores zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that the interaction between zzso and zzso prion protein is required both for zzso and zzso zzso
