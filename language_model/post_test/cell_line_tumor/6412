The application of viral elements in tumor therapy is one facet of cancer zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso disease virus has previously been demonstrated to induce zzso in cancer cell zzso Here, we aim to further investigate its zzso mechanism and possible zzso effect in zzso models of zzso zzso zzso one of the most common human zzso zzso 

Treatment with zzso inhibited cell proliferation in two zzso zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso with zzso values in the range of zzso zzso zzso also induced zzso in these cells, which was zzso by zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and resulted in zzso changes and zzso zzso of zzso leading to the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso Treatment with zzso zzso zzso which did not affect the viability of normal zzso suppressed cell migration and invasion via attenuating zzso zzso The production of zzso was modulated by zzso zzso zzso that was decreased after zzso zzso The in zzso zzso effects of zzso were assessed in both subcutaneous and zzso mouse models of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso delivery of zzso inhibited subcutaneous tumor growth as a result of increased zzso zzso administration of zzso in an zzso zzso model suppressed tumor growth, inhibited zzso zzso and prolonged zzso Furthermore, a decrease in the serum level of zzso was observed in zzso zzso 

The data presented zzso suggest that, via zzso zzso zzso zzso suppresses the growth, migration, and invasion of zzso zzso cells by inducing zzso and attenuating zzso production both in zzso and in zzso zzso protein zzso thus has the potential to be developed as a new therapeutic agent for zzso
