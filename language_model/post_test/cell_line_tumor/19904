The present studies evaluated the direct effects of the presence of human zzso zzso on gene expression of specific promoter regions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its product, zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso breast tumor cells and in a stable clone of zzso cells containing zzso zzso zzso designated as zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 human breast tumor cells have significantly increased gene expression of total zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with high levels of gene expression of specific zzso promoter zzso regions zzso zzso and zzso with no significant change in zzso levels of zzso zzso 10 human breast tumor cells produced significantly increased amounts of both zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso activity and zzso derived from zzso zzso activity ( zzso compared to zzso control zzso The greatest zzso of zzso or zzso production was observed by the combination of the selective zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso ( zzso The greatest zzso effect in zzso zzso zzso control cells was observed with the combination of 25 zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not with 10 zzso zzso suggesting that there are zzso mechanisms involved in the zzso effect of this agent at doses greater than 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso also significantly inhibited proliferation of zzso zzso 10 human breast tumor cells, with no further zzso activity with the addition of 10 zzso zzso observed at either 24 or 48 h of zzso These studies demonstrate that zzso directly regulates gene expression of specific zzso promoter regions and regulates zzso zzso zzso Agents that inhibit zzso or block the biological effects of zzso may be useful in significantly limiting zzso activity and proliferation of human breast tumor cells regardless of the presence of zzso In addition, the unique human breast tumor cell model used in these studies may be a useful tool in identifying the spectrum of activities of agents that block the biological effects of zzso and zzso
