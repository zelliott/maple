Our goal was to clarify the involvement and clinical significance of zzso in pancreatic zzso 

We examined zzso expression in 45 bulk pancreatic zzso in zzso cells, including invasive zzso zzso zzso cells (20 zzso pancreatic zzso zzso zzso cells (12 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells (19 zzso and normal zzso cells (11 zzso and in pancreatic juice samples from 99 patients with pancreatic diseases (32 cancer, 35 zzso and 32 chronic zzso zzso We used quantitative real-time reverse zzso with zzso zzso to measure zzso in these various types of zzso 

In bulk tissue zzso pancreatic cancer and zzso expressed significantly higher levels of zzso than did zzso zzso ( zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso expressed significantly higher levels of zzso than did zzso ( zzso and zzso zzso although zzso expression did not differ between zzso and zzso zzso In pancreatic juice zzso cancer and zzso juice expressed significantly higher levels of zzso than did zzso juice (both zzso zzso operating characteristic curve analyses revealed that measurement of zzso in pancreatic juice was useful for discriminating zzso disease from chronic zzso zzso under the zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso 

zzso may be an early zzso marker of pancreatic zzso and measurement of zzso in pancreatic juice may be useful for early detection of pancreatic cancer or screening of early pancreatic zzso
