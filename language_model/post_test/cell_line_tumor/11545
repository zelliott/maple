zzso zzso is an important driver of tumor zzso however, the zzso regulators of tumor cell zzso and zzso are not zzso Here, we show that tumors maintain energy production under zzso deprivation through the function of zzso zzso zzso in zzso Using cancer cell lines, we found that zzso zzso zzso including tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso dampen the zzso of the zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso preserve zzso zzso and release the cell zzso zzso focal zzso zzso zzso from zzso by the zzso zzso zzso In turn, this results in enhanced tumor cell invasion in low nutrients and zzso dissemination to bone or liver in disease models in zzso Moreover, we found that zzso zzso levels were correlated with shortened overall survival in patients with zzso cell lung zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso including zzso overcome zzso stress and promote tumor cell zzso by limiting the zzso of the zzso sensor zzso and preventing zzso
