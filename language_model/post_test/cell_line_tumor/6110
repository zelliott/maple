We have developed zzso and cell based zzso to characterize small therapeutic molecules that inhibit the DNA damage checkpoint zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

To prepare a screen of large chemical libraries, we zzso the full-length and the zzso domain versions of human zzso We characterized their properties and then selected full-length zzso as the zzso most suitable for zzso We then identified and characterized structurally different zzso zzso in cell zzso by measuring zzso and checkpoint bypass zzso 

We treated human cells with zzso I zzso and demonstrated that at the time of zzso inhibitor addition, the cells have damaged DNA and activated zzso One zzso zzso the zzso zzso was active in the checkpoint bypass zzso 

Knowing that the protein zzso zzso properties are different for each zzso it seems that only a limited range of zzso activity is tolerated by zzso zzso has an essential role in determining how cancer cells respond to zzso treatments, therefore, zzso of this protein zzso are of great medical zzso
