We use novel zzso zzso optical zzso to observe the zzso activities of human lung cancer cells in a zzso cell culture zzso zzso variations of the zzso numbers are measured without fluorescent zzso By carefully designing the zzso field inside the culture zzso we establish stable concentration zzso of the injected zzso The zzso are injected via a separated central zzso and the concentration zzso are different at different positions in the zzso The same chip can be used for both control and treated zzso Using zzso growth factor as the treatment, we verify that the zzso of zzso indicate the direction of concentration zzso experienced by a living cancer zzso while the treatment of bovine serum zzso shows no specific effect on the growth of zzso The combination of zzso high-resolution optical zzso and a zzso cell culture chip establishes a convenient and versatile platform for zzso zzso zzso
