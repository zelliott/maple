zzso zzso cell zzso zzso is often resistant to standard treatment, thereby requiring new therapeutic zzso In this regard, tumor cell migration and zzso have recently been shown to be regulated by zzso and their respective receptors zzso zzso In the context of zzso zzso of zzso expression is closely related to the development of invasive zzso Thus, we hypothesized that the zzso zzso could be exploited for zzso targeting with gene therapy zzso In this regard, targeting zzso zzso to tumor cells is critically dependent on zzso gene zzso Toward the end of zzso tumor zzso we evaluated the utility of the zzso promoter in an zzso zzso First, zzso of zzso was confirmed in several zzso cell zzso Next, an zzso zzso was constructed, zzso the human zzso promoter drives the expression of a reporter zzso We tested the activity of the zzso promoter in zzso and in zzso in relevant zzso Our data indicate that the human zzso promoter is highly active in zzso cells but not in normal human zzso Finally, zzso studies in mice demonstrated dramatic repression of the zzso promoter in the liver but not in the zzso In conclusion, the unique activity of the zzso promoter in zzso lines and its repression in normal human cells and in the zzso liver underscore its potential utility as a novel candidate for zzso targeting of zzso
