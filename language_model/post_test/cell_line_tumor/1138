Early clinical trials, mostly in the setting of melanoma, have shown that zzso cells zzso expressing tumor zzso induce some immune responses and some clinical zzso A major difficulty is the extension to other tumors, such as breast zzso for which few defined zzso zzso are zzso We have demonstrated, using both prostate zzso and melanoma as model systems, that zzso loaded with killed zzso tumor cell lines can induce zzso T cells to differentiate into zzso T zzso zzso specific for shared tumor zzso 

The present study was designed to determine whether zzso would capture killed breast cancer cells and present their zzso to zzso zzso and zzso T zzso 

We show that killed breast cancer cells are captured by immature zzso that, after induced zzso can efficiently present zzso class I and class II peptides to zzso and zzso T zzso The zzso zzso are able to kill the target cells without a need for zzso with zzso zzso zzso can be obtained by zzso the zzso loaded with killed breast cancer cells with zzso peripheral blood zzso indicating that the zzso can overcome any potential zzso effects of breast cancer zzso 

zzso zzso with killed breast cancer cells may be considered a novel approach to breast cancer zzso and to identification of shared breast cancer zzso
