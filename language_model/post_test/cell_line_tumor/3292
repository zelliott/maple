The synthesis and evaluation of a group of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are reported, which show a similar level of activity against zzso in zzso compared to their zzso zzso Computer zzso and calculations of relative binding energies suggest an equivalent binding mode to human zzso zzso DNA, but with significantly reduced zzso as a result of the limited zzso of the zzso zzso compared to the zzso zzso zzso melting studies on zzso and zzso zzso complexes using a zzso approach support these zzso zzso cell proliferation studies at zzso doses with two representative zzso using the zzso cell line, show that neither compound produces growth arrest, in contrast with the effects produced by the zzso zzso compound zzso It is concluded that zzso zzso activity is a necessary though by itself insufficient property in order for cellular growth arrest to occur at zzso zzso and that tight zzso binding is also zzso
