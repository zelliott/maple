The expression of high mobility group protein A1 zzso protein has been closely related to various zzso and zzso degrees of zzso To investigate the influence of zzso zzso on the tumor and the mechanism underlying zzso of zzso we zzso the zzso zzso zzso into the zzso zzso zzso cell and observed the changes of cell zzso invasion abilities, and the tumor zzso zzso gene expression could be efficiently zzso and cell zzso migration, invasion, and zzso zzso level were also zzso zzso nude mice injected with the zzso cells zzso zzso zzso showed the significant lower tumor weight, tumor volume, and longer zzso time compared with the control zzso Our results suggest that zzso of zzso could inhibit growth and zzso zzso of zzso cells, which may be a therapeutic target protein for zzso zzso and may be of biological zzso
