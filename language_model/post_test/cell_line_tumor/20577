zzso is a zzso specific zzso zzso protein zzso that zzso to zzso zzso through an interaction with the zzso scaffold zzso to regulate zzso formation and cell zzso zzso we zzso using a combination of zzso zzso and zzso that zzso zzso regulates directed and random migration by controlling zzso maturation and dynamics through the regulation of both zzso assembly and zzso Interestingly, zzso was also localized to zzso formed in three-dimensional zzso zzso environments and zzso depletion promoted cancer cell migration and invasion through zzso zzso These findings highlight the importance of GAP proteins in the regulation of zzso family zzso and the coordination of the cell migration zzso
