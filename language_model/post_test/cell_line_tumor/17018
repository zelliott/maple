zzso and their receptors play important roles in the development of primary tumors and their zzso Particularly zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso seem to be critical in proliferation and invasion of zzso cancer, the leading cause of death from zzso zzso in the United zzso zzso the first natural product zzso zzso and its zzso were examined for their effects on proliferation of the zzso zzso cancer cells in order to validate their candidacy as leads to develop novel zzso cancer zzso Acting as zzso antagonists, zzso and its zzso significantly suppressed zzso zzso zzso zzso The compounds also inhibited the proliferation of zzso at zzso to zzso zzso Moreover, zzso and several zzso did not show significant zzso in zzso zzso cells at zzso up to zzso Based on these results, zzso and one of its synthetic zzso were defined as potential leads to develop novel agents against zzso zzso
