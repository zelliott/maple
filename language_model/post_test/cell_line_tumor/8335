zzso zzso genes relate to the development of human zzso In this study, we used a zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting zzso gene to combine with clinical drug zzso zzso for the treatment of human zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso zzso expression zzso zzso knocked down the target zzso and zzso Higher efficacy on growth zzso was observed when zzso was combined with zzso This synergistic effect was associated with zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso protein 1 by zzso through zzso of zzso and total zzso Western zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso of zzso and total Ras were zzso by zzso Following Ras zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were dramatically inhibited by zzso zzso The data showed that zzso zzso of nuclear zzso was enhanced by zzso In addition, the combination of zzso and VCR zzso inhibited the growth of human zzso zzso in zzso Our findings suggested that combination of zzso zzso and appropriate zzso agents might be a promising approach for the treatment of human zzso zzso
