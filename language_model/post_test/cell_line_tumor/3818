zzso P zzso zzso by zzso in zzso is a zzso zzso protein that zzso insulin resistance in type 2 zzso zzso of zzso might provide a novel therapeutic approach to treating type 2 diabetes, but few drugs that inhibit zzso expression in zzso have been identified to zzso The present findings demonstrate that zzso suppresses zzso expression by zzso zzso zzso zzso and subsequently zzso zzso in zzso zzso Treatment with zzso reduced zzso promoter activity in a zzso and zzso manner; this effect was zzso by zzso of an zzso zzso zzso also suppressed zzso gene expression in the liver of zzso zzso analysis of zzso factor binding sites zzso among the species resulted in identification of the zzso site in the zzso element of the zzso zzso A zzso reporter zzso showed that zzso suppresses zzso element activity, and a zzso zzso revealed that zzso decreases binding of zzso a direct target of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso with zzso for zzso but not for zzso zzso zzso zzso activity suppression of the zzso element of the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso promoter activity and rescued the zzso effect of zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso but it increased its zzso and decreased its nuclear zzso These data provide a novel mechanism of action for zzso involving improvement of systemic insulin sensitivity through the regulation of zzso production and suggest an additional approach to the development of zzso zzso
