zzso interactions between zzso zzso and cells of the gastric zzso to which it zzso may affect zzso Changes in gene expression of zzso zzso induced by zzso to zzso gastric cancer cells by zzso were compared to changes in gene expression of zzso zzso cultured without zzso cells by using zzso filter zzso zzso was zzso verified by zzso zzso of green fluorescent zzso zzso Four experiments showed that 22 and 21 zzso zzso genes were consistently zzso and zzso zzso The zzso genes included zzso island, zzso outer membrane zzso and zzso zzso The zzso factor zzso zzso zzso the stress response zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso gene zzso were zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was confirmed by quantitative zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was confirmed by reverse zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was confirmed by quantitative zzso and the zzso of zzso was confirmed by zzso The zzso of gene expression in zzso zzso after zzso to gastric cells in zzso suggests that changes in zzso outer membrane zzso and stress responses, among other changes, may be involved in gastric zzso
