Resistance to chemotherapy is a common feature of zzso zzso This resistance is zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein is pivotal in the propagation of the signal originated from many zzso Our aim was to investigate whether zzso of Ras zzso affects the response to zzso in zzso zzso We found an enhanced sensitivity to zzso of two zzso cell lines expressing dominant negative zzso Moreover, zzso expressing cells, implanted in nude mice, resulted in being extremely sensitive to zzso The growth of all the tumors was significantly inhibited by combining zzso zzso infection with zzso zzso The majority of zzso cells expressing zzso underwent zzso in response to zzso In zzso zzso alone did not influence the growth of tumors, suggesting that the effects of zzso observed in zzso could not be zzso in zzso The survival signal zzso zzso by Ras was essentially zzso by zzso of zzso zzso via zzso
