zzso therapy zzso is a promising treatment for zzso zzso However, recurrence and zzso of the tumor after zzso remains zzso In this study we investigated zzso and zzso expression in tumor zzso after zzso zzso nude mice with zzso tumors of similar size were randomly assigned to three groups zzso zzso In the two treatment groups, mice were zzso zzso zzso at a dose of 100 zzso and zzso h prior to laser zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso 100 zzso The mice in one of the treatment groups were sacrificed at 24 h after zzso The other treatment group and control group mice were sacrificed 14 days after zzso and the tumor weights were determined for all three zzso Mean tumor weights at 14 days after zzso were zzso g in the treatment group and zzso g in the control group ( zzso zzso showed the zzso level in tumor zzso at 24 h after zzso was slightly higher than that in the control group, while it was zzso at 14 days after zzso The zzso level was not significantly different in tumor zzso among the three groups, but it was lower in zzso tumor cells 24 h after zzso Our results suggest that zzso may play a role in tumor recurrence and zzso following zzso zzso tumor cells escaped from zzso is the main reason for tumor zzso
