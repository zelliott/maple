This paper aimed to investigate the treatment efficiency of zzso labeled folate targeting zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso on human zzso zzso zzso cells or zzso mice were divided into different groups and treated as zzso zzso negative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chemotherapy and zzso zzso chemotherapy and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso chemotherapy, zzso and zzso Treatment of B to H inhibited proliferation of zzso cells, with the greatest zzso being observed in group H ( zzso zzso zzso zzso peak appeared beside zzso phase in groups of B to zzso The zzso rates of zzso cells in groups of A to H were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our findings in zzso study showed that the mass of tumor in each group of B to H was significantly lower than that in the negative control zzso zzso In addition, compared with each group of B to G, group H showed highest zzso of tumor growth ( zzso In conclusion, the combination of magnetic induced zzso chemotherapy and targeted zzso of radiation exposure can effectively inhibit the growth of zzso cancer, which indicates a potential applications in zzso cancer zzso
