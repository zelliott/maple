zzso of the zzso tumor zzso gene is a common event in many types of tumors, including breast zzso zzso zzso zzso protein is thought to promote tumor cell survival and resistance to zzso zzso zzso restoring zzso function by converting existing zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso is being pursued as one strategy to promote zzso of tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso and induction of massive zzso is a zzso small zzso that converts zzso to the active zzso and zzso zzso in tumor zzso Here we examined whether zzso activates zzso and zzso cell death in zzso and in zzso in zzso breast cancer cell lines that express zzso zzso zzso and zzso Fluorescent zzso with zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso converted zzso into the zzso zzso In zzso treatment of tumor cells with zzso zzso zzso led to a zzso loss of cell viability and induced cell death zzso In contrast, zzso had no effect on the viability of zzso cells, normal breast cells, and zzso cells, all of which express zzso zzso zzso treatment of mice inhibited the growth of tumors from zzso of zzso zzso and zzso cells but did not influence zzso obtained from zzso zzso zzso studies showed that zzso induced the zzso zzso zzso in zzso breast cancer zzso Our findings suggest that zzso renews the zzso of zzso breast tumors to zzso and should be investigated for use in breast cancer zzso
