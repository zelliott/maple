To investigate whether zzso a novel zzso zzso of zzso possesses beneficial activities against zzso zzso and zzso the two major pathological characteristics of Alzheimer's disease zzso 

zzso zzso and Morris water maze were used to detect zzso zzso activity and evaluate spatial learning and memory ability, zzso Both high content screening and Western zzso were carried out to detect zzso precursor protein zzso while zzso and zzso were conducted to detect zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso mice, zzso (1 zzso zzso significantly ameliorated spatial learning and memory deficits, which was consistent with its in zzso zzso ability against zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 49 zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso injected zzso once daily for 3 weeks lowered zzso level by zzso and zzso level by zzso in zzso transgenic mouse zzso This zzso zzso action might be zzso as zzso reduced zzso by about zzso in zzso cells but did not alter zzso zzso And both zzso and zzso lowering action of zzso maintained longer than that of zzso 

zzso zzso dual actions against zzso zzso and zzso and provides a promising lead compound for symptomatic and zzso therapy of zzso
