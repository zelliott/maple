The zzso zzso zzso target of zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be involved in the development of zzso zzso is a zzso inhibitor blocking zzso class zzso and zzso complex 1 and zzso Here, we studied the effect of targeting the zzso zzso by zzso and zzso in melanoma cells and in a melanoma mouse zzso zzso targeting of zzso and zzso by zzso induced zzso and zzso arrest, and inhibited viability of melanoma cells in zzso Combined treatment with zzso and the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso led to the synergistic suppression of zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso and to the induction of zzso In zzso zzso and zzso displayed only modest zzso activity, but the combination significantly reduced the tumor growth compared with both single zzso These data show that blocking the zzso zzso using the combination of two distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to superior efficacy against zzso melanoma in zzso and in zzso
