Acquisition of zzso characteristics zzso to breast cancer zzso cells the capability of invading zzso different from primary tumor site, allowing cell migration and zzso Regulators of the zzso transition zzso may represent targets for zzso zzso zzso evidence supports functional implications of zzso zzso metabolism in zzso cell signaling and zzso We investigated the effects of zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso and zzso zzso zzso as a candidate regulator of cell differentiation and zzso in the highly zzso BC cell line zzso 

zzso expression and activity were investigated using zzso laser scanning zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on human zzso compared with zzso and zzso BC cells and a zzso immortalized counterpart zzso The effects of zzso on zzso and zzso activity, loss of zzso markers and changes in migration and invasion potential were monitored in zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso chamber invasion combined with scanning electron zzso zzso Cell zzso formation and composition of zzso bodies and cell zzso were investigated in zzso BC cells by cell count, zzso zzso of zzso cells, nuclear magnetic resonance and zzso zzso 

zzso (but not zzso zzso showed zzso to zzso zzso in BC compared with zzso cells, the highest activity (up to zzso zzso zzso being detected in the zzso zzso zzso Exposure of the latter cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted into zzso zzso zzso while zzso was zzso inhibited by a maximum of zzso These features were associated with progressive decreases of zzso traits such as zzso and zzso zzso reduced zzso and milk fat zzso zzso 8 levels, zzso formation and decreased in zzso cell migration and zzso Moreover, proliferation arrest, changes in cell zzso and formation of zzso zzso bodies typical of cell differentiation were induced by zzso in all investigated BC zzso 

These results support a critical involvement of zzso in controlling molecular pathways responsible for maintaining a zzso zzso in zzso BC cells and suggests zzso zzso as a means to promote BC cell differentiation and possibly enhance the effectiveness of zzso zzso
