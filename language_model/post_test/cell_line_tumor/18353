The use of charged zzso in attaching zzso to zzso zzso may improve zzso retention of the radioactive label after zzso and degradation of targeting zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso might be possible charged zzso In this study, a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was labeled with zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso zzso zzso and coupled to zzso humanized zzso zzso The overall labeling yield at zzso conditions was zzso zzso zzso The label was proven to be stable in zzso in zzso and a set of zzso zzso The labeled zzso retained its capacity to bind to zzso zzso expressing zzso The results of the study demonstrated feasibility for using derivatives of zzso in indirect labeling of zzso for zzso
