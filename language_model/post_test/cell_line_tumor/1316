The zzso family of zzso factors responds to a variety of zzso and zzso signals and, as such, are key regulators of cell growth, differentiation and cell zzso The cellular response to DNA damage is a zzso process generally involving the initial detection of DNA damage, propagation of signals via zzso modifications zzso zzso and zzso and, finally, the zzso of a zzso We have previously reported that zzso can be induced by DNA damage, and that it plays an important role in DNA zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso zzso compromises two zzso DNA damage modification events, the zzso of zzso and zzso We find that the zzso in these zzso modifications after zzso zzso is due to reduced expression of important DNA damage responsive zzso zzso We characterized the regulation of one of these zzso zzso and we demonstrated that zzso associates with the zzso promoter and directly controls its zzso Furthermore, we find that zzso expression of zzso is sufficient to rescue the zzso zzso zzso resulting from zzso zzso Our study reveals a novel facet of zzso control of the DNA damage zzso
