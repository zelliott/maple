zzso factor 1 zzso zzso regulates the function of the zzso inhibitor of zzso protein zzso a member of the zzso family that exerts zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is thought to increase cell proliferation and to protect cells from zzso The aim of the study was to investigate the correlation between the zzso signaling zzso and zzso in colon zzso 

Four human colon cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso stable zzso with zzso sense and zzso were zzso The effects of zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso on the zzso signaling zzso and expression of zzso and zzso proteins were zzso The zzso activity of core zzso promoter was assessed by dual zzso reporter zzso Cell proliferation was measured by zzso zzso zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso increased the expression of zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso A similar result was obtained in cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso was zzso zzso of the putative promoter of the zzso gene was significantly increased by zzso treatment and zzso transient zzso zzso zzso of zzso appeared to have little or no effect on zzso zzso zzso of zzso was more sensitive to zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso by zzso reversed zzso zzso of cell zzso 

zzso expression was zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso through zzso regulation, which required de zzso protein zzso The results suggest that zzso mediates zzso induced by the zzso zzso in colon zzso
