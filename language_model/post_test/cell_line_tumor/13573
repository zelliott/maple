The purposes of this study were to investigate the role of zzso Ras zzso I zzso on cell growth, zzso zzso and other biological characteristics of zzso breast cancer zzso Our goal was to provide experimental evidence for the development of future effective treatments of zzso breast zzso A zzso zzso expression zzso was constructed and zzso into the human zzso breast cancer cell lines zzso and zzso Then, various experimental methods were zzso to analyze the biological characteristics of zzso breast cancer cells and to examine the impact of expression of the zzso gene on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We further analyzed the cells in each group after treatment with zzso to examine the effects of this drug on various cellular zzso When we compared zzso zzso and zzso cells to their respective empty zzso and control groups, we found that cell viability was significantly lower zzso zzso zzso in the zzso cells, and the proportions of zzso phase cells and zzso cells were significantly higher in the zzso cells zzso zzso zzso In all groups of zzso cells, zzso treatment significantly decreased cell growth zzso zzso zzso The proportion of cells in zzso phase and the number of zzso cells in the zzso group were significantly higher than that in the empty zzso group and the control group zzso zzso zzso The growth of zzso zzso cells was significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso while the proportion of zzso cells was significantly increased zzso zzso zzso Cell growth, zzso and the percentage of zzso cells were similar between the zzso empty zzso and control zzso zzso expression inhibited zzso D1 expression in zzso cells and zzso cells, while it promoted zzso and zzso expression in these zzso zzso expression zzso the growth and proliferation of zzso breast cancer cells, while it also promotes zzso in these zzso zzso expression also improves the sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso by inducing zzso
