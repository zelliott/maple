Cancer stem cells can be isolated from human zzso using specific cell surface zzso zzso cancer cells, however, lack specific cell surface zzso making this approach zzso In this study an alternative method was used, involving isolation of side population cells to explore the stem cell characteristics of zzso zzso Side population cells were isolated from the zzso transitional cell cancer cell line zzso and examined for potential stem cell characteristics related to zzso cell cycle distribution, zzso and zzso It was observed that zzso side population cells have stronger zzso and colony formation abilities than zzso population zzso Side population cells were also more resistant to chemotherapy and zzso which may be due to expression of the zzso cassette zzso zzso G, member 2 zzso Overall, the results suggest that side population cells from the human zzso transitional cell cancer cell line zzso zzso zzso zzso
