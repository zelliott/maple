zzso lung zzso with zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso are sensitive to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso however, unlike zzso agents, it is generally accepted that minimal doses of drugs zzso target molecules are sufficient when zzso agents, including zzso are zzso Thus, any utility of higher doses remains zzso We compared zzso (15 zzso zzso therapy with high-dose zzso zzso therapy using an zzso lung cancer zzso zzso Both zzso doses induced tumor zzso but tumors zzso in the zzso group within 1 month, whereas tumors in the high-dose group did zzso Neither the zzso zzso nor zzso amplification was apparent in zzso zzso We also compared outcomes after two doses of zzso (5 and 25 zzso in a transgenic zzso lung cancer mouse zzso In line with the results obtained using the zzso model, both zzso doses completely inhibited tumor growth, but tumors treated with the lower dose of zzso developed earlier drug zzso In conclusion, a low zzso dose caused tumors to become drug-resistant prior to acquisition of the zzso zzso or zzso amplification in zzso models of lung zzso This suggests that it is important to zzso the zzso dose for treatment of zzso zzso lung zzso zzso may need to be given at a dose greater than the minimum required for zzso of target zzso
