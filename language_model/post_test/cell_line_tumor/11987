Recently, we have reported that zzso zzso acts as an inhibitor of zzso However, the zzso mechanism for zzso is still poorly zzso Here we show that suppression of zzso zzso II regulatory light chain zzso and zzso of zzso zzso are involved in the zzso effect of zzso on the calcium zzso zzso from human zzso zzso zzso Surface zzso resonance zzso also revealed that zzso binds to the cell surface, and the disruption of zzso zzso resulted in reduction of zzso zzso We have previously identified the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as an zzso zzso on the cell zzso Treatment of the cells with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression abolished the effects of zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso of the zzso includes the primary binding of zzso to the cell surface zzso and subsequent zzso of zzso
