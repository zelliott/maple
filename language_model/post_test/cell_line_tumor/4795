Recently, we reported that zzso showed therapeutic effects on the spinal zzso injury zzso in rat model possibly via its zzso activity in the nervous zzso This study investigated the molecular mechanism of its zzso and zzso effects in zzso zzso cells and in rat zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Single administration of zzso either zzso or locally using a zzso clearly reduced the zzso events in the surrounding region of the injury site in rat zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso of cells occurred mainly in the zzso but not significantly in the zzso in the surrounding zzso In both zzso cells and in rat zzso model, zzso actually reduced the expression of zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso while further induced that of an zzso protein zzso In the zzso zzso locomotor test, the single zzso administration showed better behavioral recovery than the zzso control only at early times within 1 week after zzso Overall, zzso was shown to exert its zzso effect on the neural injury by regulating the expression of zzso related zzso providing the molecular basis on its zzso zzso zzso administration of zzso appeared to be necessary for the sustained functional recovery from zzso
