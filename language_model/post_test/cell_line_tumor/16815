To establish a zzso cervical zzso cell line of zzso zzso background and to evaluate the related biological characteristics for future biomedical investigations of diseases in the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso cell zzso specimens of zzso patients were obtained and cultured in zzso by zzso zzso method, followed by continuous zzso to reach a stable growth determined by cell viability and growth zzso zzso study, cell cycling and zzso analysis were zzso zzso study was conducted by zzso of nude zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression was detected by zzso and zzso zzso 

A cervical zzso cell line was successfully established and maintained for 12 months through 70 zzso The cell line had a stable growth with a population doubling time of zzso zzso zzso method and double zzso zzso showed that the cell line had zzso rates of zzso and zzso zzso zzso evaluation demonstrated numerous cell surface zzso or zzso a large number of zzso structures in zzso typical zzso and nuclear zzso zzso analysis revealed human zzso with the number of zzso per cell varying from 32 - 97 with a majority of 54 - 86 zzso zzso tumors formed in nude mice showed zzso structures identical to those of the primary zzso The cells had high expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso but no zzso zzso 

A cervical zzso cell line from a female zzso patient is successfully zzso The cell line has the characteristics of human cervical zzso cell zzso and it is stable with maintaining the characteristic biological and zzso features in zzso for more than 12 months, therefore, qualified as a stable cell line for further biomedical zzso
