zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been reported in human zzso cancer cells, thus we aimed to zzso its role in the proliferation of the human zzso cancer cell line, zzso zzso caused a rapid zzso of zzso which coincided with a significant increase in cell zzso The zzso of zzso activity by zzso or by zzso zzso against zzso zzso or zzso of zzso zzso zzso production by zzso resulted with zzso of cell zzso that was restored by addition of zzso The zzso zzso activated both protein zzso A zzso and zzso pathways via the zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso or the zzso inhibitor zzso caused a partial zzso of cell proliferation which was restored by zzso But, inhibited proliferation in the presence of both zzso could not be restored by addition of zzso AS or zzso but not zzso inhibited zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso is zzso by zzso AS or zzso but not zzso decreased zzso zzso as well as the nuclear zzso of zzso and zzso D1 and increased the plasma membrane zzso of zzso with zzso suggesting that these processes are regulated by the zzso zzso Similarly, zzso cells exhibited zzso dependent proliferation via zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, our findings suggest that the regulation of zzso proliferation is zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso and regulates zzso and zzso D1 cellular zzso by zzso zzso
