An zzso fluorescent zzso zzso zzso has been zzso zzso zzso and examined as a zzso DNA zzso delivery zzso This material zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and efficient cellular zzso zzso can effectively protect zzso against zzso degradation, which is necessary for gene zzso Green fluorescent protein zzso expression experiments reveal that zzso can achieve efficient delivery and zzso of zzso zzso zzso gene with zzso efficiency, which zzso that of commercial zzso agents, zzso 2000 zzso and zzso zzso zzso is also highly zzso with zzso quantum yield in water, and exhibits excellent zzso which allows for real-time tracking the location of gene delivery and zzso These features and capabilities represent a major step toward designing and applying zzso zzso that function in both imaging and therapeutic zzso
