zzso zzso cells zzso are continuously exposed to large numbers of zzso bacteria but are relatively insensitive to them, thereby averting an excessive inflammatory zzso In this study, we show that the low responsiveness of human zzso lines to zzso was mainly brought about by a zzso of zzso gene zzso Additionally, the presence of an zzso zzso element in the zzso region of the zzso gene and binding of a zzso to the element was zzso The zzso factor zzso which was expressed more abundantly in a zzso zzso zzso line than in a zzso zzso zzso line, zzso zzso gene zzso zzso is known to interact with the scaffold protein zzso via its N zzso to recruit zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as DNA zzso at the zzso region of the zzso gene was significantly higher in zzso zzso zzso lines than in a zzso line or a zzso zzso zzso zzso It was demonstrated that zzso gene zzso was zzso by these zzso regulations, which were, at least in part, dependent on zzso zzso of zzso gene expression by these mechanisms in zzso possibly contributes to the zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
