The zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso is involved in the emergence of zzso prostate cancer zzso Here, we identified several zzso zzso zzso that may contribute to the development of zzso Seven zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to be zzso expressed in zzso compared with benign prostate zzso zzso according to zzso zzso zzso growth advantage for zzso cells zzso with zzso and zzso was zzso zzso was demonstrated to reduce zzso whereas zzso enhanced zzso zzso regulation of zzso and zzso was confirmed by zzso stimulation of the zzso cells followed by expression zzso The zzso sites in proximity of these zzso were demonstrated with zzso zzso zzso To identify target genes for the zzso zzso zzso analyses were performed with zzso cells zzso with zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was reduced in the cells zzso with zzso and zzso zzso Also, the protein expression was reduced according to western zzso zzso zzso and zzso were confirmed to be targets by zzso zzso Finally, zzso showed a statistically significant ( zzso reduction of zzso protein in zzso compared with zzso prostate cancer zzso The lack of zzso zzso was also associated ( zzso with a short zzso time in patients who underwent zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso is zzso in zzso leading to reduced expression of zzso Thus, zzso is a potential marker for aggressive disease and is a putative drug target in zzso
