Members of the zzso regulatory zzso protein zzso family of zzso factors control the synthesis and zzso of cholesterol, fatty zzso zzso and zzso Continuous zzso infusion of zzso diets as part of total zzso nutrition generates well defined zzso cycles zzso of urine ethanol zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso are the result of cyclical expression and activity of the principal zzso zzso zzso Class I alcohol zzso zzso and this mechanism involves regulated zzso zzso expression and binding to the zzso zzso In this study, we further explore the molecular mechanism for zzso zzso expression during the zzso pulse in adult male rats fed ethanol by total zzso nutrition for zzso zzso In zzso rats, in which the zzso protein increased by approximately zzso the nuclear form of zzso decreased by approximately zzso Because the zzso promoter contains two zzso zzso response element zzso sites zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso relative to the zzso start zzso zzso mobility shift zzso were conducted using an zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear protein binding decreased by zzso on the ascending limbs and by zzso on the descending limbs of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The specificity of nuclear protein binding to the zzso site was confirmed using zzso and zzso zzso zzso The in zzso binding status of zzso to zzso sites, as measured by the zzso zzso zzso had a pattern very similar to the zzso mobility shift zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso demonstrated these sites to be essential for zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that depletion of the zzso protein from nuclear extracts increased zzso activity by approximately zzso and that the liver X zzso zzso zzso (a known zzso of zzso zzso reduced in zzso expression of zzso zzso by zzso We conclude that zzso is a negative regulator of the zzso gene and may work in concert with the zzso proteins to mediate ethanol induction of zzso in zzso
