zzso originally isolated as an zzso factor with the zzso regulatory element of zzso was found to be toxic to zzso coli zzso and to zzso zzso cells zzso when zzso zzso and zzso To investigate the possibility of tumor gene therapy using zzso its effect was tested in zzso zzso melanoma zzso Because zzso reduces the viability of zzso cells when zzso zzso the zzso gene was cloned into a zzso gene expression zzso zzso to circumvent the lethal effect in unwanted zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso from the packaging cell was infected into zzso melanoma cells and screened in the presence of zzso Out of a total of 53 stable clones selected with zzso two clones zzso zzso at more than twice the level when induced by zzso a zzso which implies the amount of the zzso exhibiting the toxicity is zzso Although these clones control only low levels of zzso zzso of the established melanoma cell line may help us decipher the function of zzso and apply it as a tumor therapeutic gene in the zzso
