Although many of the zzso abnormalities in zzso zzso are identifiable zzso some are only zzso using molecular zzso We describe a novel cryptic zzso in acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso zzso and zzso revealed a fusion involving zzso and the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso The zzso zzso was in zzso 7 of zzso and zzso 1 of zzso The zzso zzso was not detected - neither on the zzso nor on the zzso level - and FISH showed that the zzso part of zzso was zzso zzso maps to a zzso region characterized by zzso zzso zzso 17 zzso zzso are present 1 zzso zzso to zzso and 3 zzso zzso to zzso these may be important in the genesis of zzso This is the second cryptic zzso zzso in zzso zzso and the first in zzso The zzso have not previously been reported to be rearranged in zzso The cellular context in which zzso is active is unknown, but we here show that it is expressed in normal bone zzso in primary zzso and in cancer cell zzso Its involvement in the zzso suggests that deregulation of zzso pathways may be zzso important in zzso
