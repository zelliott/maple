Studies into the genetic origins of tumor cell zzso pose significant challenges to zzso mining zzso zzso between measures of gene expression and zzso have the potential to identify clinical zzso of compound response, cellular pathways important to efficacy and potential zzso all vital to zzso drug zzso An investigation has been conducted that jointly explores zzso zzso zzso gene expression profiles and zzso zzso growth zzso zzso profiles, viewed from novel applications of zzso maps zzso and zzso analyses of gene expressions, to identify zzso of zzso and zzso zzso genes that discriminate zzso and zzso tumor cell zzso Linear zzso Analysis zzso is used to zzso the accuracy of discriminating genes to predict tumor cell zzso zzso results find zzso higher prediction zzso using zzso fewer zzso for zzso discriminating genes when compared to genes derived using conventional gene zzso zzso The proposed zzso data mining procedure was used to derive discriminating genes for ten well-known zzso zzso genes were further evaluated using gene set enrichment analysis zzso to reveal a cellular genetic landscape, comprised of small numbers of key over and under expressed zzso and zzso zzso zzso as important for a zzso tumor cell zzso zzso zzso are provided as support for zzso pathways derived from this zzso zzso similar results are found when using gene expression zzso derived from different zzso zzso The data used in this analysis is available at zzso zzso zzso
