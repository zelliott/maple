Renal cell zzso zzso is a highly zzso and often fatal disease of the zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso Complex zzso for Transport zzso family, and plays a role in the zzso in sorting proteins to the zzso body zzso zzso functions as a tumor zzso gene and has been reported in pancreatic tumor zzso Here, we examined the expression level of zzso in human zzso zzso and zzso tumor cells by real-time quantitative zzso and western zzso We found that the expression level of zzso is significantly lower in zzso zzso and zzso tumor cells compared with adjacent zzso zzso and normal zzso zzso Additionally, zzso of zzso expression by zzso induced tumor formation in normal zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso did not significantly affect tumor cell proliferation in zzso and tumor progression in zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso using a zzso zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso tumor cells in zzso and the growth of zzso tumor in zzso Thus, our results demonstrate that zzso functions as a tumor zzso gene in zzso cells and may be a useful target for treatment of zzso
