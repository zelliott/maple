zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso leaves has been reported to have zzso zzso The objectives of our research were to determine how zzso regulates the cell cycle, cell proliferation and protein zzso C zzso during zzso growth and zzso To establish the cell cycle effects of zzso on brain cells zzso zzso cell line zzso and human zzso zzso cell line zzso cells were treated with either zzso zzso zzso or zzso (40 zzso zzso from flow zzso demonstrated that zzso delayed the number of cells entering and zzso DNA synthesis zzso phase in both zzso and zzso cells indicating that zzso may inhibit S phase zzso Assessment of cell viability demonstrated that zzso and zzso zzso cell were highly sensitive to zzso The zzso decreased proliferation was sustained at zzso zzso A zzso activity zzso was zzso to establish the role of zzso in zzso mode of zzso Exposure of zzso and zzso zzso cells to zzso suppressed zzso activity and reduced the protein content of most of the zzso zzso We determined that cancer growth zzso by zzso was due to zzso zzso programmed cell zzso Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that zzso represents a novel zzso zzso zzso
