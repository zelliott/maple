Parkinson's disease zzso is a common movement disorder marked by the loss of zzso zzso zzso in the brain stem and the presence of zzso inclusions designated as zzso bodies zzso The cause of zzso in zzso is not clear, but it has been suggested that protein zzso and zzso contribute significantly to the development of the zzso zzso and zzso proteins are cleared by zzso zzso system zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Recent studies suggested that different types of zzso linkages can zzso these two pathways in the process of protein zzso In this study, we found that zzso of zzso can rescue zzso from zzso zzso in a zzso model of zzso This zzso is dependent on the formation of zzso 48 zzso linkage which is known to target protein degradation via the zzso zzso with our results that we observed in zzso we found that zzso zzso in the cell can facilitate cellular protein degradation by the zzso in a zzso 48 zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso of zzso protein degradation can be a potential therapeutic approach for zzso
