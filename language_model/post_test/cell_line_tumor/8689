zzso initiation plays a critical role in the regulation of cell growth and zzso We report here that zzso translation initiation through induction of zzso zzso by zzso compounds restricts the availability of the zzso zzso complex and abrogates the proliferation of cancer cells in zzso and tumor growth in zzso Restricting the availability of the zzso complex zzso zzso the expression of zzso proteins and zzso the expression of zzso stress response genes in cancer cells as well as in tumors excised from either animal models of human cancer or cancer zzso These findings provide the first direct evidence for zzso control of zzso expression by small molecules in zzso and indicate that translation initiation factors are bona fide targets for development of zzso zzso zzso
