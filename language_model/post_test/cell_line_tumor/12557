zzso zzso is a major zzso component isolated from the stem bark of zzso zzso a widely used Chinese medicinal zzso We investigated zzso in its zzso effects on human zzso cell lines zzso and zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso cell invasion, without affecting cell attachment or zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells was inhibited by zzso at the both zzso and protein zzso This zzso tended to be greater in cells zzso at low density than in those at high zzso zzso showed an zzso effect on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso in zzso cells, whereas zzso zzso zzso DNA binding activity, nuclear zzso B zzso nuclear zzso and zzso zzso B zzso degradation were affected very zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso expression of zzso and in zzso cell invasion at a zzso level through zzso zzso zzso in zzso cell lines, which suggest zzso might become an effective agent for suppressing zzso cell zzso
