We investigated the zzso effect and mechanism of zzso zzso zzso zzso therapy zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso cells zzso and zzso was zzso and zzso while this was not observed for zzso cells zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso markedly inhibited the proliferation of zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso ( zzso and the killing effect was improved with increased zzso concentration and energy zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso and zzso cells underwent zzso after treatment with zzso Additionally, zzso was induced after zzso in a three-dimensional culture of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed zzso Cell death caused by zzso was rescued by an irreversible inhibitor zzso of zzso However, cell viability was not markedly decreased compared with the zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins were markedly zzso in the treatment groups and increased with zzso concentration as determined by western zzso zzso In zzso tumor volume markedly decreased at zzso days zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed widespread zzso and zzso inflammatory cells in the zzso zzso zzso analysis also showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins were significantly increased in the zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso has a potent killing effect on zzso cells in zzso and significantly zzso tumor growth in zzso which is associated with the zzso zzso
