We previously developed a zzso zzso zzso that enabled dual targeting delivery of zzso zzso to both tumor zzso cells and tumor cells in a solid zzso The targeted zzso zzso zzso consequently zzso potent zzso efficacy in a zzso solid tumor model after 3 sequential zzso However, the probable zzso for this enhanced zzso activity has not been fully zzso In the present study, therefore, the changes in tumor zzso induced by sequential administration of zzso zzso were investigated, with emphasis on its impact to the zzso zzso of the subsequently injected zzso In addition, the potential for zzso zzso production upon repeated administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso was clearly zzso Two sequential injections of zzso zzso induced superior zzso activity in tumor tissue and thus resulted in broader zzso distribution of the subsequent test dose of zzso zzso zzso compared with a single injection of zzso zzso In addition, it was confirmed that repeated administration of zzso zzso did not induce a significant zzso zzso response, indicating that zzso zzso in zzso zzso was efficient in zzso the ABC zzso These results suggest that sequential treatment strategies with zzso zzso agents might be superior to zzso strategies in achieving zzso in the tumor zzso and zzso the zzso of the zzso and, therefore, would result in substantial therapeutic zzso
