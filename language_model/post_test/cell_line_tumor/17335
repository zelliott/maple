The zzso zzso channel zzso family comprises four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have also recently been zzso The gene for zzso zzso maps onto zzso zzso a locus for benign adult familial zzso zzso Despite sequence identity with other zzso channel zzso zzso does not display zzso channel activity when expressed in zzso zzso instead zzso activity of zzso and zzso zzso The present study investigated the molecular structure of zzso In zzso analysis detected a new zzso zzso zzso which extended the reported zzso sequence to approximately 600 zzso A promoter motif was found only in the upstream region of the newly detected zzso zzso To determine the zzso mechanism of zzso we generated a series of deletion zzso and random zzso and examined promoter activities using the zzso zzso Three zzso motifs were found to be active in the core promoter zzso spanning from zzso zzso to zzso (A of the zzso initiation zzso was counted as zzso At least two additional sequences were detected as essential elements for promoter zzso A possible alternative 3' end was also detected at 280 zzso downstream from the reported 3' zzso These results provide useful information in developing zzso screening for zzso zzso
