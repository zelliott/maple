zzso zzso drugs zzso such as zzso zzso zzso display promising zzso properties, but zzso resulting from zzso zzso limit their clinical zzso Although zzso zzso is responsible for the zzso activity of zzso recent studies suggest that zzso zzso 5 zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling are closely associated with its ability to induce zzso of tumor zzso However, the underlying mechanisms responsible for zzso zzso factors that influence sensitivity of tumor cells to zzso and the importance of zzso for breast tumor cell growth have not been zzso Here we show that SS can induce zzso of breast tumor cells, which predominantly rely on zzso for zzso zzso but not normal zzso zzso cells, which rely on zzso zzso other than zzso for zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of protein zzso G zzso by SS was associated with increased zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso and protein levels, reduced zzso nuclear zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso factor zzso promoter activity, and decreased expression of zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso or known zzso zzso was sufficient to selectively induce zzso and zzso zzso zzso in breast tumor cells with minimal effects on normal zzso zzso zzso These findings provide evidence that SS zzso zzso of breast tumor cells through a mechanism involving zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso represents a novel molecular target for the discovery of safer and more zzso drugs for breast cancer zzso
