zzso models of human zzso are indispensable in the drug discovery and development process for new cancer drugs, small molecules and zzso They are however imperfect zzso of human zzso given the genetic and zzso zzso of the latter and the zzso of zzso survival and zzso pathways that characterize this spectrum of zzso This review discusses zzso tumor models - traditional zzso zzso zzso zzso genetically engineered tumor models, primary human zzso and various zzso zzso tumor models - their advantages, limitations, zzso and pathological zzso zzso these animal models represent a portfolio of test systems that should be zzso at specific stages in the drug discovery process in a pragmatic and zzso manner of increasing complexity, zzso zzso and clinical predictability of the human zzso Additionally, evaluating the efficacy of novel therapeutic agents emerging from drug discovery programs in a variety of zzso models can better mimic the zzso of human zzso and also aid in establishing dose levels, dose regimens and drug combinations for use in clinical zzso Nonetheless, despite the sophistication and zzso relevance of these human cancer models zzso genetically engineered tumor models and primary human zzso the ultimate proof of concept for efficacy and safety of novel zzso zzso lies in zzso The judicious interpretation and zzso of data derived from these models to humans, and a zzso greater emphasis placed on zzso medical research in early stage clinical trials, are essential to improve on the current clinical attrition rates for novel zzso therapeutic zzso
