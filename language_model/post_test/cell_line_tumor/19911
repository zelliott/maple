To investigate the effect of melanoma differentiation associated zzso 24 zzso on human zzso zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso and normal liver cell line zzso with a different zzso zzso 

The zzso gene was zzso into human zzso zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso and zzso line zzso with a zzso zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells was confirmed using zzso zzso expression was confirmed using zzso zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso were used to study tumor cell proliferation and cell cycle in zzso zzso and flow zzso zzso after zzso and zzso zzso were performed to indicate the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso gene was expressed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The protein product of zzso was confirmed in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso test indicated zzso could induce growth suppression and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso but could not in zzso Cell cycle test revealed zzso could block those cancer cells in zzso but not in the normal cell zzso 

zzso selectively zzso growth suppression and zzso in zzso zzso lines zzso zzso and zzso in zzso independent of the state of zzso gene but not in normal liver cell zzso This indicates zzso can be a perfect gene for gene therapy in zzso zzso
