We previously described a zzso of zzso zzso cancer zzso cells with a functional zzso zzso zzso I zzso zzso which zzso the capacity to respond to zzso a known zzso zzso by enhancing zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso - events that are known to promote tumor zzso It is therefore important to distinguish those patients that should not receive zzso it is also important to identify alternative chemotherapy options that would benefit this zzso of zzso The objective of this study is to determine if the zzso zzso zzso can be a substitute for zzso in patients with Type I zzso 

zzso cells isolated from either zzso or tumor tissue were treated with increasing zzso of zzso or zzso and cell viability zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was determined using Western zzso zzso zzso integrity was zzso using zzso zzso zzso profiling was performed from zzso using zzso zzso zzso activity was measured using a zzso reporter zzso In zzso activity was determined using a subcutaneous zzso mouse zzso 

zzso and zzso exhibited the same zzso effect on Type I and II zzso The zzso at 48 h for Type II zzso cells was zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso For Type I zzso cells, the zzso at 48 h was zzso 3 zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the number of viable cells was accompanied by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso did not induce zzso zzso did not enhance zzso zzso nor induce zzso zzso in Type I zzso zzso 

Administration of zzso to patients with high percentage Type I cancer cells could have zzso effects due to zzso enhancement of zzso and zzso activities, and zzso production zzso zzso which promote zzso and tumor zzso zzso has similar zzso activity in zzso cells as that of zzso However, unlike zzso it does not induce these zzso effects in Type I zzso zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso may represent an alternative to zzso in this zzso of zzso zzso
