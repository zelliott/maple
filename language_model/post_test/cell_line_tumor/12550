From the seeds of zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein designated as zzso that demonstrated zzso activity toward zzso zzso with an zzso of zzso zzso was zzso zzso demonstrated an zzso sequence with pronounced similarity to zzso and a molecular mass of 32 zzso It was isolated by zzso on zzso zzso and zzso 75 and was not bound by either zzso zzso zzso was devoid of zzso zzso The zzso activity against zzso zzso was completely preserved from pH 4 to 10 and from zzso to zzso zzso Red zzso at the tips of zzso zzso zzso indicated zzso of zzso zzso However, there was no zzso activity toward zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibited proliferation of breast cancer zzso cells with an zzso of zzso zzso but did not affect zzso zzso zzso Its zzso value toward zzso reverse zzso was zzso zzso The unique features of zzso include relatively high stability when exposed to changes in ambient pH and temperature, specific zzso and zzso actions, potent zzso zzso zzso activity, and lack of binding by strongly zzso and zzso zzso
