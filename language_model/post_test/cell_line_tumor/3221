zzso factor zzso is the membrane zzso of the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso of the zzso complex zzso the zzso zzso We used short hairpin zzso zzso zzso interference to knock down zzso expression in the human zzso melanoma cell line zzso After zzso with the zzso zzso 3 stable clones with significantly zzso zzso expression were zzso They exhibited decreased proliferation in zzso as determined by zzso zzso incorporation and soft zzso zzso The in zzso zzso potential was assessed in an experimental pulmonary zzso model in which cells from different clones were injected into the tail vein of nude zzso The zzso of pulmonary tumors was significantly lower in mice receiving zzso cells zzso zzso zzso than in control mice injected with zzso cells or cells zzso zzso with empty expression zzso zzso zzso zzso The mice injected with zzso cells had markedly longer survival time zzso zzso 17 zzso compared to the control mice zzso zzso 5 zzso p zzso zzso Thus, reduction of zzso levels in zzso cells significantly delayed and reduced lung tumor zzso As a first step in zzso the molecular basis for this effect, we compared the global gene expression profile in zzso cells and control cells by using zzso zzso zzso zzso known human genes were found to be significantly zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso genes significantly zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso in zzso cells compared to control zzso The zzso expressed genes zzso proteins functioning in transcription, translation, cell communication and cell zzso The results provide a basis for investigating molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of zzso on the zzso capacity of zzso melanoma zzso
