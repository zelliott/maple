T cell zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins zzso and zzso have been implicated in zzso zzso to the zzso zzso of T zzso However, the role of these molecules in the zzso process is not yet zzso Here we find that a subset of zzso became rapidly stabilized and that their zzso zzso zzso zzso after engagement of the T cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso required the zzso zzso which was also found to be essential for zzso zzso but it occurred independently of T cell zzso massive zzso zzso The zzso domain, which was mapped as the zzso region involved in zzso zzso was able to mediate the formation of stable, zzso zzso and to restore zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Further experiments indicated that zzso stabilization was required for zzso zzso Our work identifies zzso and stable, zzso zzso as central players in zzso zzso in T zzso
