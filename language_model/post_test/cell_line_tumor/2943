zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were all considered to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for tumor diagnosis, though based on different rationale of tissue zzso This study compared the zzso zzso and imaging of these three zzso in a zzso and zzso mouse zzso 

zzso mice were zzso with zzso zzso zzso cells in the right thigh on Day zzso zzso oil zzso zzso was injected in the left thigh on Day 11 to induce inflammatory zzso zzso zzso and zzso imaging of zzso zzso and zzso were performed on Day 14 after tumor zzso 

The inflammatory zzso were clearly zzso by zzso and zzso at 3 days after zzso oil zzso The zzso and inflammatory zzso ratios derived from zzso imaging were zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso and zzso for zzso at 4 h post injection, zzso Among these, the zzso ratio was the highest zzso for zzso compared with that of zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso has the highest zzso zzso under concentration of zzso zzso time curve, zzso zzso of injected dose per gram of zzso 

zzso images and zzso studies showed that the zzso of zzso in the tumor is significantly higher than that in inflammatory zzso at 4 h post zzso zzso and zzso delineated both tumor and inflammatory zzso Our results demonstrated the potential of zzso in distinguishing tumor from inflammatory zzso
