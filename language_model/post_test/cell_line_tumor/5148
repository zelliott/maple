This study was designed to investigate the molecular changes that may develop during exposure of breast cancer cells to zzso agents and that may lead to acquired zzso We used two breast cancer cell lines, a parental zzso and a zzso zzso zzso Cell survival, cell cycle distribution and zzso expression level of genes involved in DNA damage response, zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso cells were zzso more resistant to zzso zzso than the zzso zzso zzso treatment causes arrest of zzso cells in zzso and zzso zzso of cell cycle whereas zzso cells were arrested in zzso The molecular changes in both cell lines due to zzso treatment could be classified zzso zzso the zzso level of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was higher in zzso than zzso During zzso treatment, the expression level of these genes decreased in both cell lines but the rate of zzso was faster in zzso than zzso zzso zzso The expression level of zzso was the same in both cell lines but 48 and 72 h of drug treatment, zzso disappeared in zzso but still expressed in zzso zzso There was no change in the expression level of zzso zzso and zzso in both cell zzso zzso after validation in clinical samples, zzso of genes like zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso could be used as a zzso zzso for detection of acquired resistance in breast cancer and as therapeutic targets for the improvement of breast cancer treatment zzso
