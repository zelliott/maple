We investigated the zzso properties and cellular expression of the zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso which we identified in a German family with zzso dominant zzso zzso This zzso leads to an zzso zzso zzso with the potential to interfere with protein folding via incorrect zzso bond zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso exhibited a tendency for zzso in zzso zzso analysis of the correctly zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed unchanged zzso and degradation characteristics compared to wild type zzso zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso cells was reduced to approximately zzso of wild zzso A similar zzso zzso was observed with another rare zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso All zzso were detected in cell extracts at comparable levels but a large portion of zzso zzso was present in an zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso retention of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso stress markers zzso protein zzso and the spliced form of the zzso binding zzso zzso were elevated in cells expressing zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso zzso and zzso retention of human zzso zzso causes zzso zzso in carriers of the zzso zzso zzso stress triggered by zzso zzso represents a new potential disease mechanism for chronic zzso
