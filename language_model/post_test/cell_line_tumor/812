Basic zzso growth factor zzso was inserted in the middle of human zzso 1 zzso sequence at an zzso inhibitor zzso site zzso by a new gene fusion technique, zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso was active both as zzso and as zzso Furthermore, it acquired an additional ability of evading zzso through zzso blockade of zzso caused by fused zzso zzso As a result, zzso showed stronger growth zzso on zzso melanoma cells than an zzso tandem fusion zzso Thus, the zzso technique increases accessible positions for gene fusion on zzso resulting in construction of a potent zzso zzso
