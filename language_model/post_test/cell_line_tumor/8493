The zzso and zzso zzso can be considered as zzso zzso in drug discovery being good platforms for the search of new zzso zzso These zzso are commonly found fused to the zzso scaffold belonging to the biologically important family of the generally designated zzso zzso Several zzso have shown promising zzso activity and since most of them are from natural origin, the zzso zzso only allows a particular pattern of substitution which limits their structural diversity and renders any broad zzso study hard to be zzso zzso with the aim of zzso the importance of the fused ring orientation and zzso pattern in zzso this study describes the synthesis of 14 new zzso and evaluation of their cell growth zzso activity in four human tumor cell lines as well as their zzso in two membrane zzso This systematic approach allowed establishing zzso and zzso relationships for the obtained compounds in combination with 6 previously described zzso From this work an angular zzso scaffold emerged as particularly promising, presenting a potent cell growth zzso activity and suitable zzso zzso
