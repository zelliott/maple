zzso zzso junctions are zzso structures connecting individual cells in zzso zzso They are zzso and functionally linked to the zzso zzso zzso of these junctions is a key event during zzso and pathological zzso but how this influences gene expression is largely zzso Here, we investigate whether junction zzso regulates zzso by serum response factor zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso integrity was found to correlate strictly with zzso zzso In cells lacking zzso zzso no zzso zzso was zzso zzso evidence is provided that zzso occurs via zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso junctions is accompanied by induction of zzso and zzso However, using zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso but not zzso is required for zzso and target gene induction in zzso cells, in contrast to zzso zzso zzso zzso is a prerequisite for zzso but failed to induce zzso zzso excluding a sufficient role of the zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso junctions facilitate zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso and zzso upon zzso zzso
