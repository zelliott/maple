zzso and zzso T cells are reported to be increased in select patients with cancer and are poor zzso zzso Based on the association of these T cells and poor zzso we hypothesized that tumors induce zzso in T cells, which zzso effects zzso zzso In this report, we show that human T cells from healthy donors incubated with tumor for only 6 h at a low tumor to zzso ratio undergo a zzso zzso characterized by the loss of zzso and zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso of T cells is induced by soluble factors and triggers increases in expression of zzso molecules such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso these T cells are not only zzso altered, but also functionally altered as they can suppress the proliferation of zzso T zzso This suppression requires zzso contact and is zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are distinct from classically described natural T regulatory zzso Our observations support the novel concept that tumor can induce zzso T cells with zzso function and may effect both the diagnosis and treatment of zzso
