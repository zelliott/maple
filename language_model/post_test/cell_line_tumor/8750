zzso zzso is involved in several zzso zzso its role in zzso zzso has not been addressed so zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso exhibits clinical relevance as it is linked to advanced zzso zzso zzso poor patients' zzso and molecular features of enhanced zzso transition zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells develop large, zzso and zzso tumors in mouse zzso features that are reverted by zzso injection of a specific zzso zzso In contrast, injection of the corresponding mimic in mouse zzso from zzso zzso cells increases tumor growth and zzso potential while reduces the zzso zzso These zzso effects are reproduced in human zzso cell zzso We identify zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as an zzso direct target in zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso the effects of zzso zzso and zzso zzso those due to zzso zzso or zzso respectively, zzso their zzso zzso Furthermore, we provide zzso zzso that most of the zzso effects are due to zzso suppression that in turn zzso zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor, key zzso of cell zzso zzso and zzso Since higher levels of zzso are found in advanced tumor stages zzso we propose a novel role of the zzso axis in zzso the progression toward more invasive zzso zzso of zzso and its association with zzso may be useful as a zzso zzso Its targeting in zzso should be evaluated as a novel effective therapeutic tool against zzso
