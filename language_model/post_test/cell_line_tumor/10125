Due to their particular magnetic properties, zzso of metallic iron are promising candidates for magnetic fluid zzso when compared to the commonly used iron zzso However, the difficulty of handling these structures in ambient conditions without zzso zzso its practical zzso In this work, iron filled carbon zzso zzso zzso by human serum zzso are studied as potential agents for zzso Here the iron is zzso inside of the carbon shells and protected from reactions with its zzso Besides protecting the iron and biological environment against each other, the carbon shells can also work as an interface for zzso with other biological molecules of zzso In order to assess if such structures could induce any toxic effect in human cell cultures, we have zzso its zzso on a dosage and time dependent manner by measuring zzso activity, cell zzso cell cycle distribution and zzso Our results have shown that those zzso strongly associate with cells within a short incubation period and do not pose any significant toxic zzso The magnetic properties of iron filled carbon zzso in biological environment, zzso associated to cells, have been studied and a possible rotation as a function of the applied magnetic field is zzso Our initial findings encourage the further study of these structures as potential zzso zzso
