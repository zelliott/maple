zzso of zzso zzso a plasma membrane drug zzso zzso a member of the ABC zzso family), is the most prevalent cause of zzso resistance in cancer zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso massive cell death of zzso leukemia cells zzso Cell zzso of zzso in which zzso zzso was induced by selection with zzso zzso or by stable zzso with a zzso zzso full-length human zzso zzso were less sensitive to zzso Both zzso cell lines exhibited typical zzso zzso zzso Resistance of R and T cells to zzso was associated with lower binding of zzso as compared to S cells when zzso by the following zzso zzso zzso PAGE and zzso of proteins in the crude membrane fraction followed by detection with zzso zzso and zzso and zzso fluorescent zzso or zzso zzso of the intact cells with surfaces labeled by zzso These data indicated that the presence of zzso in zzso cells independently of the mode of its expression induced zzso of cell surface zzso targets of zzso zzso this feature may be considered as a secondary cellular response to zzso zzso
