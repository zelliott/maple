zzso zzso is a bottleneck in the production of therapeutic proteins from inclusion zzso In recent years, several studies have described zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein that targets the zzso In our study, the zzso protein zzso was expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso The isolated inclusion bodies were zzso using size exclusion zzso zzso and further zzso using zzso exchange zzso Three different methods of SEC zzso zzso were zzso In zzso tests on zzso cells showed that the zzso protein could effectively inhibit the proliferation of zzso cells, especially the protein zzso by zzso and pH zzso zzso The zzso zzso concentration zzso of zzso zzso was achieved with this new method, unlike an zzso of zzso zzso achieved in the zzso zzso
