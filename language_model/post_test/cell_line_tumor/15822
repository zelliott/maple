zzso is a frequently zzso tumor zzso gene that opposes the zzso zzso through zzso of zzso Recently, nuclear zzso of zzso was found as a key component of its zzso zzso however its nuclear function remains poorly zzso Here we show that nuclear zzso interacts with zzso promotes zzso association with zzso and thereby enhances the zzso activity of the zzso zzso We find that nuclear exclusion but not zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso This nuclear function of zzso provides a straightforward zzso explanation for the zzso cellular zzso response zzso by acute zzso loss and the zzso activity of zzso inactive zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso and zzso zzso states are not synonymous as they are zzso sensitive to pharmacological zzso of zzso targets such as zzso and Aurora zzso This finding identifies a strategy for cancer patient zzso and, thus, zzso of targeted zzso zzso
