To study the biological characteristics of zzso T zzso zzso induced by zzso cell zzso zzso with the zzso virus zzso membrane protein 2A zzso zzso zzso To establish zzso zzso zzso animal models expressing zzso and investigate the zzso effect of zzso specific zzso in zzso 

The zzso cells were isolated from human peripheral blood zzso cells zzso and cultured with the zzso zzso colony stimulating factor zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso The expression of surface markers on mature DC was detected by zzso activated cell zzso zzso zzso DC were zzso with zzso zzso zzso Under the help of zzso zzso zzso specific zzso were induced by zzso zzso DC with zzso zzso The population of zzso was detected by zzso zzso animal models were constructed by zzso zzso cells expressing zzso zzso into zzso nude zzso After zzso injection of zzso specific zzso the size of tumor was zzso The tumors were removed after 30 d and subjected to zzso zzso 

zzso DC displaying typical characteristics of zzso and zzso were obtained from zzso cultured in the medium containing zzso zzso and zzso The zzso specific zzso induced by zzso DC were composed of mainly zzso and zzso T zzso The zzso animal models were constructed three weeks after zzso zzso zzso The study in zzso indicated that the tumors treated with zzso specific zzso grew slowly compared with zzso zzso volume of treated groups was significantly smaller than that of zzso The zzso sections showed local necrosis and zzso of zzso in tumor zzso 

Typically mature DC could be generated in zzso by zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso could be induced by zzso zzso DC in zzso zzso mice models could be constructed by zzso zzso zzso zzso specific zzso could inhibit the growth of implanted tumor and produce an zzso effect in zzso
