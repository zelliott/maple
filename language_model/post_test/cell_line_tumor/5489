zzso cell death through zzso plays an essential role in the zzso zzso turnover of zzso zzso Failure of this active zzso process is central both to the development of breast cancer and to the appearance of the zzso cancer cells that produce clinical zzso zzso expression cloning in two independent laboratories has identified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed gene zzso as a novel zzso regulator and candidate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is also a key target for candidate zzso maternal embryonic zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We have used zzso interference to zzso zzso and zzso zzso both simultaneously and zzso in breast cancer cells in zzso to determine the importance of their roles in zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was measured by quantitative zzso in breast cancer tissue and in matched breast zzso tissue from the same zzso zzso data of these genes obtained using zzso from a separate group of patients were related to patient survival in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso expression inhibited zzso and the zzso produced by combining the two zzso was consistent with control of zzso by zzso zzso expression is significantly reduced in breast cancer tissue and this reduction is associated with poor patient survival, as predicted for a candidate breast cancer zzso zzso In addition, zzso expression is increased in breast cancer tissue and this increase is also associated with poor patient survival, as predicted for a candidate zzso zzso expression is reduced in breast cancer tissue but decreased zzso expression showed no correlation with survival, indicating that the most important factors controlling zzso activity are zzso modification (by zzso and zzso rather than the rate of zzso of zzso zzso 

The combination of in zzso functional studies with the analysis of gene expression in clinical breast cancer samples indicates that three functionally interconnected zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso important in breast cancer and identifies them as attractive targets for improvements in breast cancer risk zzso prognosis and zzso
