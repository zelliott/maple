The breast and zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso along with its zzso partner zzso zzso domain protein zzso plays important roles in DNA repair, zzso regulation, and zzso To explore further functions of zzso we performed mass zzso analysis and identified zzso zzso 1 zzso as a protein that interacts with the zzso region of zzso zzso directly bound to the zzso region of zzso and zzso zzso localized to zzso in zzso and to the zzso pole in zzso phase, and its zzso resulted in zzso amplification and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso observed in breast cancer cell line, zzso failed to bind zzso and rescue the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso the binding of zzso to zzso These findings suggest that zzso plays an important role in zzso regulation together with zzso
