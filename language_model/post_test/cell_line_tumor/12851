The zzso zzso zzso proteins catalyze the regulated formation of zzso oxygen species zzso which play key roles as signaling molecules in several zzso and zzso zzso zzso generation by the zzso member of the zzso family is necessary for the formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso cellular structures known as zzso Selective zzso of zzso zzso can provide zzso zzso insights into these cellular processes in contrast to scavenging or zzso of zzso zzso Currently no specific zzso zzso have been zzso Here, by zzso zzso we identify a subset of zzso zzso (here referred to as zzso (and its related zzso as zzso zzso and specific zzso zzso that zzso block zzso zzso generation, with only marginal activity on other cellular zzso zzso and receptors including the other zzso zzso zzso also blocks the zzso formation of zzso zzso in colon cancer zzso Such effects can be reversed by zzso of zzso zzso which is suggestive of a selective mechanism of zzso of zzso by this zzso These results zzso the relevance of zzso zzso generation in mechanisms of cancer invasion and define zzso as a useful zzso chemical probe and potential therapeutic agent for zzso of cancer cell zzso
