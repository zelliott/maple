zzso of the human organic zzso transporting zzso zzso and zzso has been previously believed to be restricted to zzso Here we show that the gene zzso zzso but not zzso is abundantly expressed in multiple human solid tumors that include zzso zzso and zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso gene expression in a panel of 60 human tumor cell lines was linked with sensitivity to multiple zzso agents, including the platinum zzso drugs zzso zzso and zzso In addition, zzso of zzso in zzso cells increased cellular zzso of platinum agents and decreased cell zzso In mice with a targeted disruption of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso ratio of zzso was significantly reduced compared with zzso mice, without concurrent changes in expression profiles of other zzso zzso Our findings indicate an unexpected role for zzso and host zzso carriers in the toxicity and disposition of platinum zzso drugs, and may provide a foundation for understanding the extensive zzso zzso zzso seen with these drugs in zzso
