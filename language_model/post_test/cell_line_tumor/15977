Patients with zzso zzso syndromes have increased risk for zzso cancer zzso Although progression of zzso to zzso is observed, zzso mechanisms remain zzso The authors examined whether familial zzso zzso harbor defects in DNA mismatch repair zzso and zzso for zzso zzso of zzso a gene zzso in the zzso of some zzso zzso syndrome zzso 

Ten zzso zzso syndrome patients were zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso DNA were zzso for zzso instability zzso and zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso and zzso protein expression were assessed in all zzso by zzso In addition, 99 zzso sporadic zzso and 50 each of zzso and zzso cell clones were examined for zzso zzso 

Twenty-five zzso of 43 zzso zzso syndrome zzso demonstrated zzso or greater zzso in zzso zzso consistent with zzso zzso zzso zzso lost zzso zzso and zzso expression was lost in zzso from zzso zzso zzso sporadic zzso zzso did not show any of these zzso zzso analysis revealed wild type zzso 7 and 8 sequences suggestive of nonexistent or rare events for zzso zzso however, zzso sporadic zzso showed 11 zzso of 99 zzso within zzso with 4 tumors having complete loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells revealed zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso from zzso zzso syndrome zzso harbors zzso zzso which may prime zzso zzso zzso from zzso patients lose zzso zzso but loss is not a universal early feature of all zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso can occur in zzso cells, suggesting that zzso zzso could drive zzso zzso syndrome zzso
