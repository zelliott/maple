Aurora zzso play critical roles in zzso and are being evaluated as therapeutic targets in zzso zzso is a zzso selective, zzso competitive inhibitor of Aurora zzso B and zzso zzso of zzso zzso to the clinic can benefit patients by identifying the tumors that are more likely to respond to therapies, especially novel zzso such as zzso 

59 zzso zzso cell lines were used as models for response where in zzso sensitivity to zzso was based on both time and degree of cell zzso The response data was analyzed along with zzso zzso and zzso zzso profiles to determine zzso of zzso 

20 cell lines were sensitive and 39 were resistant to treatment with zzso High zzso number was more prevalent in resistant cell lines zzso zzso zzso Fisher zzso zzso Greater resistance was also found in cell lines harboring zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A review of zzso zzso in zzso cell lines showed an association between zzso zzso status and zzso number zzso zzso zzso Fisher zzso zzso 

High zzso number associated with resistance to the zzso of Aurora B and C suggests cells with a mechanism to bypass the high zzso checkpoint are resistant to zzso High zzso number, a hallmark trait of many late stage zzso zzso varies in prevalence among zzso zzso zzso The high frequency and relative ease of measurement make high zzso number a viable negative zzso marker for zzso
