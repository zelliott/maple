zzso zzso offer great promise in many industrial and biomedical applications, however little information is available about gastrointestinal zzso The purpose of this study was to assess the zzso zzso stress, zzso and zzso zzso release induced by zzso zzso on human colon zzso zzso zzso The biological activity of these particles was related to their zzso zzso The zzso characteristics were evaluated by zzso electron zzso The zzso was determined by growth zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso oxygen species production, cellular zzso content, changes of zzso membrane potential and zzso cell death were zzso by flow zzso The inflammatory zzso were evaluated by zzso zzso zzso Treatment with zzso zzso corresponding to zzso for zzso induced on zzso cells a significant decrease of cell zzso zzso increase, zzso and zzso decrease, zzso of inner zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Higher doses induced about zzso of zzso already after zzso of zzso The experimental data show that zzso stress may be a key route in inducing the zzso of zzso zzso in colon zzso zzso Moreover, the study of the relationship between zzso effects and zzso characteristics of particles suggests that surface area does not play a primary role in the zzso
