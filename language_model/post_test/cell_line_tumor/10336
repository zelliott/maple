Selective zzso cell activity for both zzso and zzso zzso peptides has previously been zzso As zzso possesses activities similar to both of these, this study investigates zzso zzso toxicity in zzso and in zzso 

In zzso cancer cell viability was evaluated after treatment with 1 and 5 zzso of zzso In zzso zzso zzso effects in zzso mice bearing zzso primary zzso melanoma were tested, with two groups each containing 35 zzso The zzso group received 1 zzso of zzso per animal, zzso which was well zzso the zzso group received a zzso 

zzso at 5 zzso was lethal to zzso Mia zzso and zzso cells and inoffensive to normal zzso In zzso zzso treatment over 21 days significantly delayed tumor zzso inhibited tumor growth and prolonged the lifespan of the zzso Mice in the zzso group survived at significantly higher rates zzso zzso zzso than those in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso calculated with the zzso zzso The average tumor weight in the zzso group was zzso g but was only about zzso g in the zzso mice, if zzso 

These data warrant further exploration of zzso as a tumor zzso zzso
