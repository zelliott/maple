The melanoma zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso family and a novel tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene transfer has zzso growth zzso and zzso effects in a broad spectrum of cancer zzso In breast cancer cells, zzso zzso expression triggers zzso effects by zzso of survival signals, such as zzso and zzso The zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increases the sensitivity of zzso breast cancer cells to zzso agents and zzso In this study, we evaluate the effects of treatment with zzso and zzso combination therapy in a panel of zzso cell lines, and in established tumors in nude zzso Compared to individual treatments, the combination of zzso and zzso elicits zzso zzso activity in zzso tumor cell zzso increased cell death, cell cycle block and zzso The zzso and zzso interaction was shown to be synergistic by zzso zzso zzso does not alter cell surface zzso levels, but the combination of zzso results in increased expression of cell surface zzso with zzso zzso of zzso from the nucleus to the cell zzso In zzso the combination of zzso and zzso showed significantly increased zzso activity ( zzso against zzso zzso These data suggest that the combination of zzso with zzso may be a novel therapy for breast cancer patients whose tumors zzso zzso The observed synergistic effect may improve treatment options for otherwise poorly responsive, zzso breast cancer zzso
