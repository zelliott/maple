zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and provides reducing energy to all cells by maintaining zzso zzso The most common clinical manifestations in patients with zzso zzso are zzso zzso and acute zzso zzso The effects of microbial infection in patients with zzso zzso primarily relate to the zzso anemia caused by zzso or viral infections and the subsequent medication that is zzso We are interested in studying the impact of bacterial infection in zzso zzso zzso knock down zzso lung zzso cells, together with the common pathogen zzso zzso were employed in our cell infection zzso Here, we demonstrate that a lower cell viability was observed among zzso cells when compared to scramble controls upon bacterial infection using the zzso zzso A significant increase in the zzso zzso was detected among zzso zzso zzso cells by observing zzso zzso intensity within cells under a zzso microscope and zzso this signal using flow zzso The impairment of zzso removal is predicted to enhance zzso activity in zzso cells, and this enhanced zzso was observed by zzso zzso zzso under a zzso zzso microscope and zzso by flow zzso A higher expression level of the intrinsic zzso zzso zzso as well as the downstream zzso zzso was detected by Western zzso analysis of zzso cells following bacterial zzso In conclusion, we propose that bacterial infection, perhaps the zzso zzso zzso zzso in this case, promotes the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso This would trigger a stronger zzso activity through the intrinsic zzso thereby reducing cell viability when compared to wild type zzso
