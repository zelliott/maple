This study explores the role of zzso zzso in regulating zzso and zzso delays during zzso We demonstrate here that exposing zzso human zzso type 2 zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso for zzso h zzso increases zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso with the pharmacological zzso zzso and zzso markedly suppresses zzso zzso zzso and zzso and also restores the zzso zzso activities of zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso during zzso contributes to the zzso zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso signaling during zzso further delays zzso entry and zzso zzso zzso significant expression of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso A into zzso while marginally decreasing zzso zzso zzso activities, which may be related to nuclear association with zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso signaling markedly suppresses the zzso of zzso zzso proteins and zzso zzso zzso activities during zzso Taken together, the results presented here suggest that zzso zzso acts upstream of zzso and zzso to suppress zzso activities; however, it is also required for induction of zzso zzso and maintenance of zzso zzso activities that oppose delays in zzso entry and zzso
