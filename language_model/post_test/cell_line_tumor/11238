Described is the construction of a large array of zzso zzso zzso along with screening and isolation protocols for sorting rare, approximately 1 in zzso cancer stem cells zzso from a zzso cell zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso array of zzso zzso zzso 50 zzso 75 zzso structures and 25 zzso zzso zzso was zzso on a large glass zzso providing an array of approximately zzso million zzso zzso Image analysis zzso were developed to permit array screening for identification of zzso labeled cells in less than 15 zzso using an zzso zzso microscope with a computer controlled zzso zzso Device operation was tested by zzso zzso cells zzso with green fluorescent protein zzso zzso with zzso zzso cells at ratios of zzso to zzso on the array followed by screening to identify zzso zzso zzso containing cells of interest were then selectively released by a focused laser pulse and collected on a numbered zzso zzso zzso with high zzso A direct comparison of this technology with zzso cell sorting zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso offered enhanced post sorting purity zzso yield zzso and viability zzso for rare cell zzso As a demonstration of the zzso value, pancreatic tumor cells from zzso cell lines and zzso zzso were screened for the presence of zzso zzso and zzso surface markers of pancreatic zzso Following cell isolation and culture, 63 zzso zzso of the isolated zzso cells and zzso of sorted human zzso cells formed tumor zzso retaining high expression levels of zzso zzso and zzso The ability to isolate rare cells from relatively small sample sizes will facilitate our understanding of cell biology and the development of new therapeutic zzso
