Central role of zzso active protein zzso zzso zzso in melanoma drives the search for new targets to abolish its zzso zzso zzso zzso is promoted by zzso zzso zzso and is zzso but the zzso linking zzso and zzso to deregulation of this zzso remains poorly zzso Here employing zzso melanoma model, we show that zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso the negative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso acid rescued zzso indicating that raft zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso Indeed, direct zzso blockade with the zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso was sufficient for zzso zzso and zzso of zzso whereas zzso of zzso in zzso cells restored zzso zzso and zzso activities to their zzso zzso This zzso was also interrupted by zzso of the zzso sensor zzso either by its zzso zzso or the zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso or by diminishing the zzso zzso entry with zzso zzso or small hairpin zzso against zzso zzso of zzso prevented zzso zzso zzso entry, aborted zzso stimulation of zzso zzso and disrupted its zzso binding to zzso abolishing zzso activity and entire zzso zzso Most importantly, blockade of this cascade in the tumor site by zzso zzso administered to zzso mice, robustly retarded tumor growth and extended animal zzso Together, our data suggest that zzso zzso couple zzso zzso entry to sustained zzso of major zzso signaling elements in melanoma cells and underscore the potential of zzso agents as effective zzso zzso
