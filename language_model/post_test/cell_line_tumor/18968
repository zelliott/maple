In zzso cells, activated zzso zzso zzso zzso to the nucleus guided by the zzso However, the detailed mechanisms underlying zzso zzso remain zzso Using gain and loss of function studies, we report here for the first time that the zzso protein zzso zzso controls zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, zzso cells, and rat zzso zzso slice cultures impaired zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso activity, measured by a specific reporter gene zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso directly interact on zzso zzso formed by zzso zzso A zzso truncated zzso with zzso zzso activity did not influence zzso zzso In zzso mouse zzso cells and zzso zzso cells in rat zzso zzso slice cultures, zzso zzso zzso showed zzso of zzso expressed zzso and zzso In these systems, zzso zzso zzso hampered zzso zzso Thus, we conclude that zzso expression is tightly regulated to adequately control zzso zzso Because zzso is primarily expressed in zzso zzso cells, our results introduce this zzso protein as a new zzso of zzso signaling in this cell type and suggest the existence of zzso mechanisms regulating zzso zzso to the zzso
