Nuclear zzso zzso is a zzso factor and zzso of zzso during liver zzso and closely related to the formation and development of zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the effect of small interference zzso zzso zzso of zzso on growth of human zzso zzso zzso Our data indicated that the expression of zzso zzso was significantly higher in the zzso cells than that in the normal liver zzso cells before zzso and the expression of zzso in the zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso was reduced at the levels of zzso zzso and protein zzso using real-time reverse zzso chain reaction, zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso Interestingly, the zzso index of the zzso cells increased up to zzso detected by zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is zzso in zzso cells and can be inhibited by zzso zzso through the zzso zzso Thus, we conclude that zzso is a potential molecular target for zzso gene zzso
