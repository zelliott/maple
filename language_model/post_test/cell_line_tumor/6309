We previously reported the discovery of zzso zzso as potent zzso agents for zzso To further understand the structural requirements for the potency of zzso zzso gain insight in the zzso relationships zzso and investigate zzso stability for these compounds, we report extensive zzso studies on the zzso zzso Compared with the previous set of zzso zzso the newly zzso zzso zzso have lower potency in general, but some of the new zzso have comparable potency to the most active compounds in the previous set when tested in two melanoma and four prostate cancer cell zzso These zzso studies indicated that the zzso activity was very sensitive to subtle changes in the zzso Tested compounds zzso and zzso are equally active against highly zzso resistant cancer cell lines and their parental cell lines, indicating that drugs developed based on zzso zzso may have therapeutic advantages over zzso in treating resistant zzso zzso stability studies of compound zzso revealed that zzso zzso failed to extend stability as literature reported because zzso was found as the major zzso zzso in rat and mouse liver zzso However, this sheds light on the possibility for many modifications on zzso ring for further lead zzso since the modification on zzso such as compound zzso did not impact the zzso
