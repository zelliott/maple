In the present study, we report the novel application of zzso zzso zzso in cancer drug zzso The facile synthetic procedure for generating multiple zzso groups on the zzso cage offers scope for high drug loading in addition to zzso zzso zzso a first line cancer zzso was zzso to zzso through a zzso zzso achieving zzso loading zzso The zzso zzso was found to be relatively stable in zzso buffer saline but temporally released the active drug when incubated with tumor cell zzso The zzso zzso suppressed the proliferation of cancer zzso in zzso through a zzso cell cycle block, resulting in zzso Furthermore, in an in zzso zzso tumor model, zzso exhibited comparable zzso efficacy as free drug without the systemic toxicity of free zzso Additionally, we demonstrate that the zzso platform can be extended to other zzso agents, such as the slightly zzso zzso and can emerge as a new paradigm in the management of zzso
