To investigate the effect of zzso zzso gene transfer on transplanted lung cancer in mice and its mechanism of zzso 

zzso tumor model was induced by subcutaneous zzso of 2 zzso zzso Lewis lung cancer zzso cells into the back of zzso zzso The mice were treated by zzso injection of 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso in zzso and its maintaining time were detected by zzso and Western zzso zzso The zzso level in serum was determined by zzso zzso The zzso of tumor growth and changes of survival were recorded and the zzso density zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The tumor zzso was observed by electron zzso 

In comparison with controls, zzso injection of zzso significantly inhibited the tumor growth and zzso and prolonged the survival rate of mice zzso zzso zzso Strong positive expression of zzso was seen in the tumor tissue after injection of zzso zzso zzso by mouse zzso zzso zzso while the control groups showed only very low expression or zzso zzso zzso concentration was zzso zzso zzso zzso at the second week of administration, the expression of zzso diminished a month zzso The zzso density zzso decreased from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso per zzso 200 zzso microscopic field by zzso zzso and from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso More zzso tumor cells were seen under the transmission electron zzso 

zzso gene therapy zzso by zzso zzso efficiently zzso expression of zzso in zzso and zzso the growth and zzso of zzso It is concluded that its action is targeted to tumor zzso and the mechanism is zzso of tumor zzso
