zzso membrane zzso zzso reflect the functional status of zzso within zzso Our recently published method provides a zzso estimate of the zzso of populations of zzso particles within living cells at 37 degrees C using a combination of conventional zzso zzso and three-dimensional zzso by exhaustive zzso zzso The current studies demonstrate variations in the mean zzso among six different cell types zzso human skin zzso zzso and differentiated zzso cells, zzso cells, zzso cells, and primary cultured zzso and zzso in different parts of the same cells zzso growth cones zzso cell zzso The largest zzso was in zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso 2 zzso while the lowest was in transformed zzso zzso cells zzso zzso 2 zzso This method revealed large variations in mean zzso among cells of the same type within a single culture zzso The percent area of the cell occupied by zzso particles differed among different cell types, and ranged from zzso in zzso to zzso in differentiated zzso zzso The data can also be analyzed by calculating the sum potential of all of the zzso in a zzso The sum zzso per cell revealed a large range between cell types from zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso to zzso zzso 1039 zzso in zzso zzso Although biological implications of zzso of zzso are not clear, this approach provides a tool to address this zzso
