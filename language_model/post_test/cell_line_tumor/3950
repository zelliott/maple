The zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso are deleted in zzso cells from more than 50% of patients with chronic zzso leukemia zzso As these zzso are also less abundant in patients without zzso zzso their zzso in zzso is likely to be caused by additional zzso We found the primary transcripts zzso of zzso to be elevated and processing zzso zzso zzso to be reduced in cells from zzso patients zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso indicating a block of zzso maturation at the zzso processing zzso Using a zzso reporter zzso for zzso processing we validated the zzso in primary zzso zzso The block of zzso maturation is restricted to specific zzso and can be found in the cell line zzso but not in zzso even though both are derived from the same zzso zzso In these cells, the zzso zzso zzso leads to reduced zzso processing, but full processing efficiency is recovered upon deletion of the zzso zzso or nuclear zzso of zzso Thus, we show that, apart from zzso deletion or zzso zzso zzso processing of zzso leads to specific reduction of zzso in zzso zzso This represents a novel zzso mechanism in the zzso of zzso
