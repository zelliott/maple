To compare the biological effectiveness of 290 zzso zzso beams in zzso Japan and in zzso Germany, given that different methods for beam delivery are used for zzso 

zzso small zzso and human zzso zzso tumor zzso cells zzso growing in zzso were zzso with zzso zzso of zzso Bragg zzso zzso adjusted to achieve nearly identical beam zzso profiles at the zzso Medical Accelerator in zzso and the zzso zzso in zzso Cell kill efficiencies of carbon zzso were measured by colony formation for zzso cells and zzso zzso survival in zzso zzso gamma rays were used as the reference zzso zzso doses at given zzso were used for relative biological effectiveness zzso calculations and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso doses zzso zzso standard zzso of zzso cells ranged from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso doses of gut zzso after single doses ranged from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso whereas zzso zzso doses after three zzso doses were zzso zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso difference of zzso between the two facilities was zzso or zzso for gut zzso survival or zzso cell zzso zzso 

The zzso beams at the National Institute of zzso Sciences in zzso Japan and the zzso zzso zzso in zzso Germany are biologically identical after single and daily zzso zzso
