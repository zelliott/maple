In species with zzso zzso such as the mouse and human, zzso cells of the zzso zzso induce zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells zzso to cross the zzso zzso of the zzso Since zzso and zzso zzso zzso are expressed in zzso and zzso cells respectively and zzso protein zzso zzso mediate zzso zzso the roles of zzso and zzso signaling in zzso interactions were zzso By zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso to mimic zzso zzso we found that zzso zzso outgrowth on zzso was significantly enhanced by zzso zzso zzso Since zzso zzso zzso had no effect on zzso expansion on zzso culture surfaces, its enhancing effect on zzso outgrowth on zzso may be zzso by acting on zzso to facilitate zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the percentage of zzso zzso at the zzso interface was markedly increased by zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso inhibitor zzso was able to suppress the enhancing effect of zzso zzso zzso on zzso expansion on zzso Upon zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expansion on zzso were significantly inhibited by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso Our results establish that zzso zzso zzso could activate zzso zzso and zzso to induce zzso zzso thereby promoting zzso outgrowth on zzso
