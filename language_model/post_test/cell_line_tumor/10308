zzso zzso growth factor zzso that is zzso by tumor cells plays a key role in zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso is produced by inflammatory cells, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and is known to promote zzso indirectly by interacting with zzso The aim of this study was to determine the role of zzso zzso its interaction with zzso and the efficacy of zzso therapy targeting zzso with oral zzso and zzso with zzso in pancreatic cancer zzso 

zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used alone or in combination in an in zzso zzso zzso to test their effect on zzso caused by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In an in zzso model of zzso zzso treatment effects after zzso under zzso with oral zzso or zzso and a combination of both were zzso In zzso zzso zzso had a direct and strong zzso effect that was independent and additive to zzso zzso Complete zzso of zzso required the zzso of zzso and zzso In zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso zzso with oral zzso alone resulted in a significant decrease in zzso growth and mean vascular density comparable to zzso zzso zzso 

zzso derived zzso acts as a zzso direct and zzso independent zzso factor in the context of zzso zzso zzso is as effective as zzso zzso zzso zzso in addition to zzso is therefore likely to be important for successful zzso treatment in pancreatic zzso
