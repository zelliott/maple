zzso cancer is a known cause of mortality in men worldwide although the risk factor varies among different ethnic zzso Loss of the Y zzso is a common zzso zzso observed in the human prostate zzso 

We screened 51 standard sequence zzso sites zzso corresponding to a zzso region of the Y zzso zzso zzso the coding region of the zzso gene and assessed the status of the zzso zzso in the human prostate cancer cell lines zzso and zzso The zzso was found to be intact and coding region of zzso showed no sequence variation in both the cell zzso However, zzso zzso showed sequence and copy number zzso zzso and zzso cells were found to carry zzso and 1945 copies of the zzso respectively per zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso copies detected in these cell lines are much below the average of that reported in normal human zzso Similarly, the number of zzso repeat and its derivatives within the zzso zzso showed variation compared to those of the normal zzso 

Clearly, the zzso is zzso affected in both the cell zzso Work on additional cell lines and zzso samples would augment our understanding about the zzso of this zzso Based on the present work, we zzso that copy number status of the zzso may be exploited as a supplementary zzso tool to monitor the occurrence of prostate cancer using zzso zzso
