In previous work we showed that zzso levels of zzso inhibited zzso outgrowth in zzso zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis targeted at proteins involved in zzso growth and stress responses, revealed that such exposure led to a reduction in the levels of zzso heavy chain, zzso associated protein 1 B zzso zzso and zzso The aim of this study was to apply the approach of 2 zzso zzso gel zzso and mass zzso to identify novel zzso of zzso A number of proteins were found to be zzso compared to the control on zzso zzso These were classified in to 3 main groups of zzso zzso factors, zzso and the zzso protein zzso all of which are involved in cell zzso survival or zzso The changes observed for zzso were further confirmed by quantitative Western zzso analysis with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the same zzso indicated that the zzso network was disrupted in zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso is disrupted by zzso exposure, which may be related to increased zzso zzso
