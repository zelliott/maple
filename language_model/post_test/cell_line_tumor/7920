zzso zzso 4 zzso is expressed in a variety of zzso including breast, brain, zzso and zzso zzso interactions are critical for tumor development, growth, and zzso Compared with normal zzso zzso tissue (including zzso expresses high levels of zzso Previous clinical and zzso observations suggest that zzso levels could be used as a zzso marker of zzso zzso Here we report the results of zzso of zzso expression levels in experimental brain tumors using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and control zzso zzso were zzso zzso were obtained in zzso yield, with zzso zzso specific zzso and greater than zzso zzso Severe combined zzso mice harboring zzso zzso were used for ex zzso zzso and imaging zzso Surface zzso expression levels on zzso zzso cells were analyzed by flow zzso 

zzso and imaging studies showed a specific zzso of zzso in zzso tumors, with zzso zzso ratios reaching 15 zzso 3 at 48 h after zzso The zzso zzso ratio for zzso and zzso was zzso at 48 h after zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso cells showed a zzso to zzso increase in zzso expression relative to zzso accounting for the high zzso zzso observed in the zzso 

Our data demonstrate the feasibility of imaging zzso expression in experimental brain zzso The elevated zzso levels observed may have been, in part, due to the hypoxic tumor zzso
