zzso is zzso by zzso of pancreatic zzso and is associated with resistance to chemotherapy and a poor zzso zzso has been a standard treatment for patients with advanced pancreatic cancer for a zzso Recent reports have demonstrated that zzso treatment zzso the zzso environment by eliminating zzso zzso zzso cells zzso We zzso that a cancer vaccine targeting zzso can achieve enhanced efficacy when combined with zzso In this study, we tested this hypothesis using modified zzso Ankara zzso expressing full-length zzso zzso The poorly zzso mouse zzso zzso cell line, zzso which expresses zzso zzso and is zzso to zzso was used for this zzso zzso with zzso resulted in a modest therapeutic zzso effect on established zzso zzso When administered with zzso zzso zzso resulted in significant tumor zzso and prolonged zzso The enhanced vaccine efficacy was associated with decreased zzso zzso To analyze the zzso immune response to zzso zzso we zzso a zzso library of zzso with 11 zzso overlapping from full-length zzso zzso zzso from mice zzso with zzso produced zzso zzso in response to in zzso stimulation with the overlapping zzso zzso Increased zzso zzso T cells that specifically recognized the zzso tumor line were seen in mice treated with zzso and zzso These data suggest that vaccination with zzso in combination with zzso represents an attractive strategy to overcome zzso peripheral immune zzso and this effect has potential for clinical benefit in pancreatic zzso
