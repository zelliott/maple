zzso zzso are zzso zzso that function as key zzso regulators of gene zzso zzso maturation is controlled by the zzso zzso zzso However, the detailed mechanism of zzso zzso remains zzso We show that the tumor zzso breast cancer 1 zzso zzso the processing of zzso primary zzso zzso increased the expressions of both precursor and mature forms of zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, this tumor zzso was shown to be directly associated with zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso complex, and it zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We also found that zzso recognizes the zzso secondary structure and directly binds with primary transcripts of zzso via a zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso regulates zzso zzso via the zzso zzso complex and zzso Our findings also indicate novel functions of zzso in zzso zzso which may be linked to its tumor zzso mechanism and maintenance of zzso zzso
