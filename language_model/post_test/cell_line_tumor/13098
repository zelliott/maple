To achieve a more complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor zzso we established a zzso cell line from the human zzso zzso cell zzso cell line zzso after long-term radiation zzso The biological features of the resulting cell lines were zzso zzso zzso technology was used to measure the zzso of gene expression in the zzso zzso We found that certain genes associated with DNA repair, cell cycle, zzso zzso were significantly zzso In particular, genes related to zzso such as zzso were significantly zzso zzso cells had higher zzso activity and longer zzso than their parental zzso Our research suggests that zzso function is a novel hallmark of cellular zzso and the zzso link between zzso maintenance and zzso may involve the genes and pathways we implicated in this zzso
