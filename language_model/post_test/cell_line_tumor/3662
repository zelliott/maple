The zzso gene is transcribed in an zzso zzso zzso When tumors of various zzso or cell types are considered, zzso zzso or zzso status remains zzso To address the potential regulation of zzso gene expression by an zzso steroid hormone zzso zzso or by a zzso hormone zzso zzso we performed experiments in rats zzso treated with chemical zzso This range of in zzso experiments demonstrated that chronic hyperprolactinemia zzso the zzso expression in zzso and zzso cells whereas zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso appeared to be opposite zzso in the zzso zzso zzso We investigated these hormonal effects in three human prostate zzso cell zzso In zzso cancer cells, the opposite effect of zzso and zzso was zzso However, in normal cells zzso zzso remained insensitive to the hormones in fetal calf serum zzso medium but became responsive in a zzso zzso In the zzso cancer cell line, tested for its zzso and zzso the hormones had no effect on zzso expression whatever the culture zzso Finally, we demonstrated that zzso zzso the zzso expression in zzso cells by the zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso expression is regulated by both a zzso and a male steroid zzso
