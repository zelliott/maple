zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso have been extensively investigated for the imaging of tumor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Recently, we designed and zzso a zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso through a zzso zzso The goal of this study was to investigate the dual zzso property and tumor diagnostic value of zzso zzso zzso labeled with zzso zzso zzso 68 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was zzso with zzso acid zzso and labeled with zzso The dual zzso binding affinity was investigated by a zzso competition binding zzso The in zzso and in zzso dual zzso targeting of zzso was evaluated and compared with that of zzso and zzso 

zzso had zzso zzso and zzso binding affinities comparable to those of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The dual zzso targeting property of zzso was validated by blocking studies in a zzso tumor zzso zzso showed higher tumor zzso than zzso and zzso zzso can also image tumors with either zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso exhibited dual zzso targeting properties both in zzso and in zzso The favorable zzso of zzso such as convenient zzso high specific activity, and high tumor zzso warrant its further investigation for clinical cancer zzso
