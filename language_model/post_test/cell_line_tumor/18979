The cancer cell zzso may contain many potentially useful zzso We therefore sought to identify proteins in the zzso media of zzso zzso zzso cell lines but not in those from other cancer cell zzso The zzso of 21 cancer cell lines derived from 12 cancer types were analyzed by zzso combined with zzso zzso Among the 325 proteins identified, zzso response zzso zzso zzso was chosen for evaluation as a potential zzso zzso since it was selectively detected in the zzso cell line zzso and has never been reported as a cancer zzso zzso analysis of 169 zzso specimens showed that zzso was positively detected in zzso of the tumors, but zzso or not detected in zzso of the adjacent zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso rate was significantly increased in earlier stage tumors and zzso zzso zzso Plasma zzso levels were significantly higher in zzso patients (N zzso zzso versus healthy controls (N zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Our results indicate that comparative analysis of cancer cell zzso is a feasible strategy for identifying potential cancer zzso and that zzso may be a novel zzso zzso
