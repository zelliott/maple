Both zzso system A activity and fetal plasma cortisol zzso are associated with zzso growth zzso but it is not known if these factors are mechanistically zzso Previous functional studies using zzso cells and zzso produced conflicting results regarding the regulation of system A by zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso cell line, we investigated the regulation of system A by zzso System A function was analyzed using zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso transport zzso zzso expression zzso A zzso zzso was studied at the zzso and protein levels using Northern and Western zzso zzso zzso was carried out using zzso The zzso transfer rate across zzso zzso after zzso with cortisol for 24 h was significantly increased compared with zzso This was associated with a zzso of the zzso zzso at lower cortisol levels and significant zzso of zzso and protein expression levels at cortisol levels zzso zzso This is the first study to show functional and molecular regulation of system A by cortisol in zzso zzso It is also the first study to identify which system A zzso is zzso These results suggest that cortisol may be involved in zzso of system A in the zzso to ensure sufficient zzso acid supply to the developing zzso
