zzso cholesterol transport zzso a process to deliver excess cholesterol from the periphery to the liver for zzso from body, is a major zzso property of zzso zzso As major zzso for cholesterol zzso in zzso zzso cassette zzso A1 zzso and zzso zzso are critical for zzso We investigated mechanisms for the regulation of zzso and zzso expression by fatty acids zzso in zzso zzso zzso were incubated with 100 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso acids in the absence or presence of zzso a liver X zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not saturated zzso significantly reduced zzso and zzso zzso without the zzso zzso A zzso a zzso zzso zzso not only increased zzso ABC zzso expression but zzso the zzso repression by zzso zzso The increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso paralleled the increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso expression was significantly zzso Although the repressive effect of zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso was abolished by zzso protein levels remained zzso Chemical and genetic zzso of protein zzso C zzso did not abolish the repressive effect of zzso acid on zzso and zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression by two distinct mechanisms in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso repression possibly by modulating zzso zzso state and zzso zzso zzso
