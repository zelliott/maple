Patients with zzso errors of zzso fatty acid zzso accumulate zzso zzso and zzso in various zzso Some of these patients present significant cardiac diseases such as zzso and zzso The mechanism of how fatty acid zzso is involved in disease zzso is still unclear but zzso of zzso has been suggested to be one possible mechanism of zzso zzso In this study, we measured zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso after incubation of zzso zzso with different saturated and zzso long- and zzso fatty acid species for various time periods and at different zzso zzso We assessed zzso induction by analyzing the zzso membrane potential and zzso expression as well as the composition of the accumulating zzso We identified only zzso and zzso zzso fatty acids potentially leading to an increase in zzso expression and disruption of the zzso membrane potential, resulting in zzso and necrosis in cultured zzso This study demonstrates significant toxicity of especially those fatty acid species in zzso that significantly accumulate in fatty acid zzso defects presenting with cardiac disease such as very zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
