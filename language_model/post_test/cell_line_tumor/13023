zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been widely used as traditional herbal medicines to treat various diseases including cancer in East zzso 

The present study sought to investigate the possible mechanism in zzso effect of zzso zzso that was grown on zzso zzso zzso on zzso melanoma zzso 

The zzso effect of zzso on zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso zzso cells were detected by flow zzso zzso The proteins involved in zzso and cellular differentiation were assessed by zzso zzso zzso contents of PG or zzso were analyzed using zzso 

The zzso zzso fraction zzso of zzso exhibited the strongest zzso activity among zzso zzso zzso or water) on zzso zzso zzso zzso extract showed stronger zzso effect than zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso extract on zzso melanoma cell zzso zzso zzso extract induced the zzso structures and the zzso production in zzso zzso zzso zzso extract increased a zzso cell population through inducing zzso and activated zzso protein expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso extract contained zzso Rd, zzso zzso zzso and zzso more than PG zzso zzso Rd and zzso significantly inhibited zzso cell zzso 

Our data suggest that zzso zzso extract zzso zzso cell proliferation through inducing zzso and cellular zzso
