zzso zzso is a human gene initially described by our group to be zzso during in zzso differentiation processes of zzso zzso and leukemia cells triggered by different zzso We now report presence of a putative imperfect zzso response element zzso in the promoter of zzso zzso Given that zzso are known to regulate cellular differentiation processes of zzso zzso we studied whether expression of zzso would be regulated by zzso zzso zzso in breast and zzso cancer zzso As examined by means of real time zzso treatment with zzso zzso for at least zzso resulted in a significant increase of zzso transcript levels in zzso zzso breast cancer and zzso zzso cancer cells, but not in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso transcript levels was also observed after treatment with specific zzso zzso and was inhibited by zzso with pure zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso cancer zzso Treatment with zzso totally inhibited zzso effects suggesting that zzso of zzso gene expression is no zzso early response but a secondary event requiring protein zzso The results of this study demonstrate that transcript levels of zzso gene zzso are zzso in breast and zzso cancer cells in an zzso zzso Whether zzso is a zzso of zzso cellular differentiation processes has to be determined in further zzso
