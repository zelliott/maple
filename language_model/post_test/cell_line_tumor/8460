The zzso gene 15 zzso and zzso pathways play roles in zzso hypoxic and inflammatory zzso To identify zzso between these two tumor zzso we investigated the effect of zzso on the activity of the master hypoxic zzso factor zzso 

zzso and zzso treatments were used to induce the expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso between zzso and the zzso and zzso system were studied using zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and pull-down zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso system on the zzso processes were examined using reporter, reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso growth zzso 

We found that the level of the free form of zzso is zzso regulated by zzso treatment, and that the free zzso level is lower under zzso zzso studies have shown that zzso not only interacts physically with zzso but is also zzso in multiple zzso zzso expression zzso the functional zzso of zzso and zzso zzso expression of the zzso and/or zzso system zzso zzso gene expression and zzso zzso 

In zzso our results revealed zzso between inflammatory and hypoxic pathways through the zzso of zzso On the basis of these results, we propose a novel negative feedback loop for the zzso zzso involving the regulation of zzso via zzso zzso
