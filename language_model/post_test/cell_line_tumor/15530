zzso zzso cell zzso zzso is a common zzso of zzso cancer that is particularly prevalent in East Asian zzso Our previous expression profile analysis showed that the gene zzso protein zzso zzso 7 zzso is zzso in zzso zzso Here, we aimed to validate zzso as a zzso factor and a candidate target for molecular treatment of zzso Both zzso and Western zzso analysis of zzso from zzso patients revealed that zzso was significantly zzso in tumor tissue samples of zzso zzso zzso of zzso showed that increased expression of zzso was zzso correlated with overall survival zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso survival, wound healing, and invasion of zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso decreased zzso of zzso zzso and focal zzso zzso zzso important zzso of cell zzso survival, and zzso zzso our findings suggest that zzso has potential as a zzso marker for zzso and might also be a candidate for targeted therapy in the treatment of zzso
