Loss of zzso expression is a major characteristic of highly invasive and zzso zzso zzso transition zzso has been advocated to be a zzso mechanism for the suppression of zzso and tumor zzso Snail is a zinc finger zzso factor that triggers the zzso and is one of the recently identified zzso zzso The reverse correlation of Snail and zzso expressions has been reported in many types of human zzso including zzso cell zzso zzso In this study, we showed that three zzso negative SCC cell lines had a zzso zzso strong expressions of zzso a zzso marker zzso and zzso Compared to other zzso positive SCC cells, these cells showed higher invasive ability and expression of zzso a zzso degrading zzso which has been demonstrated to be highly expressed in invasive cancer zzso zzso of Snail in zzso cells resulted in the loss of zzso zzso the change of their zzso to zzso and the zzso of zzso gene zzso indicating that an zzso was induced by zzso Furthermore, these cells became more invasive and showed higher levels of zzso activity and its gene zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso promoter activity was induced by Snail zzso and the promoter region from zzso to zzso relative to the zzso start site was necessary for this zzso These results indicate that Snail is a new zzso of zzso expression and suggest that the zzso contributes to the increased invasion not only through the zzso of zzso zzso but also the zzso of zzso expression in SCC zzso
