The zzso gene family is frequently involved in zzso zzso that cause human cancer, including prostate cancer, zzso and zzso However, the mechanisms by which zzso zzso zzso which are zzso zzso factors, target genes necessary for zzso is not well zzso Ewing's zzso serves as a paradigm for the entire class of zzso tumors because nearly all cases harbor zzso zzso zzso involving zzso zzso The most common zzso in Ewing's zzso encodes the zzso zzso zzso zzso We used whole zzso zzso zzso to identify target genes that are directly bound by zzso Analysis of the promoters of these genes demonstrated a significant zzso of highly repetitive zzso elements zzso In a parallel approach, we found that zzso uses zzso zzso to regulate the expression of some of its target genes including zzso a gene required for Ewing's zzso zzso The zzso in the zzso promoter bound zzso in zzso and in zzso and was both necessary and sufficient to zzso zzso regulation to a reporter zzso Genome wide zzso studies demonstrated that zzso zzso were enriched close to zzso genes but not zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated that the ability of zzso to bind DNA and zzso gene expression through these repetitive elements depended on the number of consecutive zzso zzso These findings illustrate an unprecedented route to specificity for zzso proteins and use of zzso in zzso
