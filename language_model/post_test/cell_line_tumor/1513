As an effort to overcome limits of zzso zzso as a systemic delivery zzso for cancer therapy, we developed a novel system using zzso Ad zzso DNA with two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in expectation of zzso effect caused by progeny viral production followed by zzso The zzso Ad zzso for active viral replication zzso with each zzso were able to replicate only in human cancer cells and produce progeny zzso The zzso zzso delivering the zzso markedly zzso to evade the innate and zzso immune zzso The zzso ratio of the zzso administered zzso was approximately zzso decreased in liver when compared with naked zzso Moreover, zzso ratio of the Ad DNA delivered by zzso or zzso was significantly elevated at zzso or zzso greater than that of naked zzso zzso The zzso improved the chance of the DNA to zzso within tumor versus liver with zzso increased zzso In conclusion, the innovative and simple system for delivering zzso Ad zzso DNA with the zzso zzso skipping time-consuming steps such as generation and characterization of zzso Ad zzso can be zzso as an alternative approach for cancer zzso
