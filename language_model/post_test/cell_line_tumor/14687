zzso of the interactions between zzso zzso and zzso is still zzso Cell lines derived from the zzso breast cancer cells were generated with suppressed expression of the zzso zzso zzso termed zzso cells, by stable zzso using small interfering zzso zzso expression zzso zzso for control cells carried sequence generating zzso zzso zzso with reduction in the zzso levels, the zzso cells also showed a reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expressions, and an zzso in the expression of zzso The number of the zzso cells was reduced in response to zzso and human zzso plus zzso growth factor, but zzso did not cause an increase in the number of the zzso cells compared to zzso The proliferation rate of zzso cells was only reduced in response to zzso compared to controls, whereas their zzso and zzso zzso rate was zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso was increased in the zzso cells after treatment with zzso without affecting control zzso Furthermore, zzso of the tumor zzso protein zzso was elevated in the zzso cells compared to the zzso In conclusion, suppressing zzso expression decreased the level of zzso but increased the level of zzso zzso growth rate of the zzso cells was reduced mostly through an increase in zzso without affecting proliferation zzso We zzso that a decreased zzso ratio triggered a rapid zzso of zzso zzso which in turn zzso the zzso tumor zzso and accelerated zzso zzso
