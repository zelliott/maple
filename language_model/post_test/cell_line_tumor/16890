We explored the effect of zzso protein expression on tumor growth in zzso by using zzso zzso 

Human lung zzso zzso cells were zzso by using zzso zzso or a control zzso zzso at zzso zzso The zzso cells were implanted in zzso mice either individually or after mixing with zzso zzso zzso 

The expression of zzso protein was demonstrated in zzso but not in zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not inhibit tumor cell proliferation in zzso zzso of zzso resulted in rapid tumor growth, whereas mice implanted with zzso either failed to develop tumors or developed smaller slowly zzso zzso In the case of tumors grown from zzso with zzso cells, only zzso cells resulted in decreased tumor volumes with low vascular density and poorly developed zzso 

The effect of zzso protein expression is a consequence of zzso of zzso and/or zzso proliferation in zzso
