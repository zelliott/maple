zzso zzso is a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which has entered Phase I clinical trials in the zzso and Phase zzso in zzso In the present study, we investigated the effects of zzso on zzso differentiation and zzso in human zzso cell lines and primary zzso zzso zzso The results showed that at low zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso At moderate zzso zzso zzso induced zzso as determined by the increased expression of the zzso differentiation marker zzso At relatively high zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso oxygen zzso zzso zzso or zzso blocked zzso cell differentiation and zzso suggesting an essential role for zzso in these zzso zzso c release and zzso zzso dysfunction are involved in zzso zzso of zzso In addition to cell lines, zzso also exhibits therapeutic effects in human primary zzso zzso Moreover, daily oral zzso treatment of nude mice bearing zzso cell zzso suppressed zzso growth, induced zzso cell zzso and prolonged the survival of zzso zzso In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that zzso is a novel zzso with potential zzso value in several zzso zzso especially zzso
