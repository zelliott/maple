zzso is a mixture of zzso primary alcohols that has been shown to decrease serum cholesterol in animals and in zzso The zzso effect results from a decrease in cholesterol synthesis by suppression of zzso zzso activity, but the mechanism of this suppression and the active components of zzso have not been zzso In the present study, we investigated the ability of zzso and its principal components to inhibit cholesterol synthesis in cultured rat zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso yielded a zzso decrease in zzso incorporation without evidence of cellular zzso zzso zzso the major constituent of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso yielded smaller and statistically insignificant decreases in cholesterol zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso obtained with zzso At pharmacological zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso decreased zzso incorporation into cholesterol without affecting the incorporation of zzso indicating that these compounds act at or above zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not directly inhibit zzso zzso and incubation of these compounds with zzso cells did not affect zzso zzso zzso However, zzso activity was decreased by up to zzso in zzso prepared from these cells, suggesting that zzso zzso activity was zzso by zzso zzso zzso with this hypothesis, a zzso increase in zzso zzso was noted in zzso zzso Because zzso is activated by zzso and is well established to suppress zzso zzso activity, these results suggest that zzso or a zzso decreases zzso zzso activity by zzso zzso
