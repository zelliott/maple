All members of zzso growth factor zzso family are expressed as zzso precursors on cell surfaces and then zzso converted to soluble zzso for zzso zzso zzso by a zzso and zzso zzso As zzso complex formation is essential for this zzso zzso zzso of cell surface retention could affect their physical interaction with zzso and eventually contribute to shedding zzso Here, we showed that zzso of zzso zzso an zzso zzso accelerated its zzso on cell zzso zzso occurred at zzso 240 of zzso as the primary zzso zzso Using a zzso protein of zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis and a cell surface zzso zzso revealed that a significant portion of zzso was expressed on the cell surface, immediately zzso and predominantly localized to early zzso zzso zzso shedding of zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso was significantly reduced in comparison to zzso zzso These results suggested that zzso zzso and the subsequent trafficking to zzso zzso is a novel shedding regulatory mechanism that contributes to the zzso of zzso zzso in growth factor zzso
