To identify additional targets of zzso we used a zzso zzso system to examine zzso patterns in response to enforced expression of zzso zzso in zzso cancer cells, and identified the zzso zzso 4 ( zzso gene as a direct target of zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso catalyzing the second step of the zzso degradation zzso zzso of zzso zzso was induced in zzso cells in response to DNA damage caused by zzso treatment, in a zzso zzso zzso contains a potential zzso binding sequence in zzso and the interaction of zzso with the site was shown by zzso and zzso zzso We confirmed zzso zzso activity of the binding site by means of a reporter zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso zzso was able to enhance cell death induced by infection with zzso zzso cells transformed to zzso zzso showed significantly lower zzso zzso oxygen species zzso levels than parental or control cells after treatment with hydrogen zzso or zzso Those cells were also resistant to cell damage caused by hydrogen zzso These results suggest that zzso might play a protective role against cell damage induced by generation of zzso zzso through zzso zzso of zzso
