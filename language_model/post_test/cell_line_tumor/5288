zzso zzso zzso is an zzso produced by zzso zzso that causes zzso death to hundreds of thousands of humans zzso zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso which zzso neurotransmitter release in the central nervous system to elicit zzso paralysis, but the molecular basis for zzso entry into zzso remains zzso zzso is a approximately zzso protein that has AB zzso zzso the A domain is a zinc zzso and the B domain encodes a zzso domain and zzso zzso domain zzso Earlier studies showed that zzso bound zzso via two zzso sites, termed the zzso site (the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso site (the zzso zzso Here we report that zzso high affinity binding to zzso is zzso solely by zzso zzso array and solid phase binding analyses identified zzso that bound exclusively to either the W pocket or the R pocket of zzso zzso bound to the W pocket, and zzso bound to the R zzso Using these zzso and zzso forms of zzso that lacked one or both zzso pocket, zzso binding to both of the W and R pockets were shown to be necessary for high affinity binding to zzso and zzso zzso The crystal structure of a zzso complex of zzso with sugar components of two zzso bound to the W and R supported the binding of zzso to both zzso zzso These data show that zzso are functional dual receptors for zzso
