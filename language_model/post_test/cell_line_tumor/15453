The aim of this study was to investigate the potential zzso of solid zzso zzso zzso loaded with zzso The zzso were tested as a new drug delivery system zzso for the zzso treatment of pulmonary hypertension in human zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined to zzso zzso base and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with particle size of approximately zzso and zzso particle size distribution were successfully manufactured using a novel zzso homogenization method and were stable up to three zzso zzso zzso were then used in in zzso and ex zzso models representing lung and heart zzso For in zzso models, human zzso zzso cell line zzso and mouse heart zzso cell line zzso were zzso For ex zzso models, rat precision cut lung slices zzso and rat heart slices zzso were zzso All the models were treated with plain zzso and zzso zzso in a concentration range of zzso of zzso zzso The toxicity was evaluated in zzso and ex zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso Median lethal dose 50% zzso values for zzso cells and zzso were found to be in the range of zzso while for zzso cells and precision cut heart slices values were found between 1500 and zzso zzso showed slightly higher zzso values in comparison to zzso Considering the zzso aspects, zzso zzso could have potential in the treatment of pulmonary hypertension via inhalation zzso
