The zzso zzso zzso family consists of a large group of zzso and structurally divergent zzso The transforming growth zzso zzso signaling zzso has been implicated in the stimulation of zzso zzso in zzso colon cells, thereby possibly modulating cell zzso and zzso However, the specific zzso targeted by zzso signaling or underlying mechanism of the expression of zzso has not yet been zzso In this study, we investigated the specific zzso targeted by the zzso signaling zzso In nine human gastric cancer cell lines zzso zzso cell lines showed positive expression of zzso zzso patterns of zzso proteins correlated well with the level of zzso zzso and zzso transcripts in these cell lines, but zzso expression was not observed in all of these zzso To investigate the role of zzso signaling in zzso zzso we selected two zzso unresponsive gastric cancer cell zzso zzso cells that contain a zzso in the zzso type II zzso and zzso cells that express low to zzso level of the zzso zzso intermediate zzso zzso Restoration of zzso signaling in these cells induced expression of the zzso and increased activity of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression was observed in the zzso of the stomach of zzso mice, but was markedly decreased in zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso and zzso are major target genes for zzso zzso zzso
