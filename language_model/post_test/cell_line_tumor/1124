The mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso in zzso system used for the study of zzso cell zzso It was determined that this cell line has a zzso zzso in zzso 5 of zzso Based on this assumption that the cell line is zzso for the zzso zzso it was zzso that the small colony zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may be due to a newly induced zzso in both the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso would also be zzso or zzso and would lose their ability to grow at normal zzso zzso we published our evaluation of the zzso status in zzso zzso This analysis included sequencing of zzso zzso 4 and determined that the mouse zzso cell line has a zzso in both of the zzso zzso and, therefore, no zzso zzso zzso in either zzso cells or zzso zzso Because the cells have no zzso zzso it is not possible that the small colony zzso results from a newly induced loss of both functional zzso and zzso To determine whether small colonies might, however, include the deletion of both zzso and zzso we zzso using zzso marker analysis, a series of small colony zzso We also zzso in zzso zzso to determine that the zzso zzso are, in fact, in their normal zzso 11 location in zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso From all of these analyses we can conclude that the small colony zzso zzso is not caused by deletion of both zzso and zzso
