zzso zzso zzso is a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso 1 zzso that is zzso in several childhood zzso and cell zzso Because of its novel mechanism of action, zzso was evaluated through the zzso 

zzso was tested against the zzso in zzso cell line panel at zzso from zzso zzso to zzso zzso and against the zzso in zzso zzso panels administered IV at a dose of 30 zzso zzso zzso or 15 zzso zzso zzso using a zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso demonstrated zzso activity, with a median relative zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced significant differences in zzso in 19 of 32 zzso of the zzso solid tumor zzso and in 2 of 4 zzso of the zzso ALL zzso zzso induced tumor growth zzso meeting criteria for intermediate zzso zzso zzso activity in 11 of 30 zzso zzso solid tumor zzso including zzso (4 of 6) and zzso (2 of 3) panels, and 2 of 4 ALL zzso zzso responses zzso were observed for 4 of 32 solid tumor zzso zzso one glioblastoma, and one zzso and one of four ALL zzso 

zzso shows potent in zzso activity against the zzso cell lines with no zzso zzso In zzso zzso induced zzso in several zzso zzso However, zzso data suggest that mice tolerate higher systemic exposure to zzso than humans, suggesting that the current results may zzso potential clinical efficacy against the childhood zzso zzso
