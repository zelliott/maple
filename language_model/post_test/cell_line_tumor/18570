zzso zzso zzso stress has increasingly come into focus as a factor contributing to zzso zzso Although zzso mechanisms have been implicated in zzso stress, the signaling pathways involved remain zzso In this study, we examined the role of the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso that is highly zzso in many systems for balancing cell survival and zzso zzso treatment of the human zzso cell line zzso with zzso an zzso of zzso stress, increased cell death over zzso zzso as measured by zzso zzso zzso were zzso increased levels of active zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and treatment with zzso reduced zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso was not zzso although zzso was activated following zzso zzso An early and transient zzso of zzso occurred after zzso zzso stress, and targeting this zzso with the zzso zzso zzso or zzso significantly reduced cell zzso Similar zzso was obtained against zzso A, another zzso stress zzso However, protection against zzso stress via zzso zzso was not accompanied by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso or DNA zzso These data indicate that zzso may contribute to zzso pathways of injury after zzso zzso
