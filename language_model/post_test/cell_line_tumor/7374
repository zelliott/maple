The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be a potent inhibitor of cell growth and a strong zzso zzso We investigated for the first time whether in zzso combinations of zzso with various zzso compounds may result in an additive zzso effect on the proliferation of human zzso cancer zzso 

As a model two different human zzso cancer cell lines were zzso All cell lines were incubated with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was measured after four days using the zzso zzso 

For both zzso cancer cell lines a significant additive effect of zzso with zzso and zzso was observed at the lower concentration range of these zzso zzso 

zzso is able to enhance the zzso activity of certain zzso at pharmacological relevant zzso This zzso zzso is currently in a phase II trial in patients with zzso zzso breast cancer and the zzso has been shown to be very zzso The combination of zzso with zzso may therefore offer a new clinically relevant treatment regimen for zzso zzso
