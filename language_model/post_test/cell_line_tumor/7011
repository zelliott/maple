zzso comprise a class of low molecular weight compounds displaying a variety of biological activities including zzso of tumor growth and zzso To gain insight into the mechanisms underlying zzso zzso we have employed the zzso zzso melanoma zzso zzso zzso mice were injected zzso with tumor cells and zzso zzso or zzso each at 50 zzso given zzso and lung tumor cell colonies counted 14-6 days zzso Three different injection schedules were used for each zzso zzso daily injection, starting 24 h before injection of the tumor zzso zzso single dose, 24 h preceding tumor challenge; zzso daily injection, starting 24 h after the injection of the tumor zzso All three compounds significantly reduced tumor lung deposits zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, when treatment was delayed by 24 h after tumor cells zzso zzso multiple daily doses of zzso or zzso were less effective that a single dose of the same compound given 24 h before tumor challenge zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso were found to inhibit zzso expression in a zzso manner in zzso and in zzso pulmonary zzso zzso In ex zzso experiments, the number of tumor cells adhering to lung vessels was significantly diminished in animals treated with a single dose of zzso and zzso These findings indicate that the zzso of tumor cell zzso by zzso or zzso may significantly depend on the ability of these compounds to alter the zzso zzso further zzso the role of the zzso processes in the zzso zzso
