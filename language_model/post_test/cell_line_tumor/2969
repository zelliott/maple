zzso cancer is the leading cause of death among all zzso zzso in Western zzso Although therapy for zzso cancer has been greatly improved in the past 20 years, the overall survival for patients with advanced zzso cancer has not changed zzso The poor survival rates in patients with advanced zzso cancer are due both to late diagnosis and to lack of effective drugs for the majority of patients who have a zzso and develop resistance to current chemotherapy agents used for zzso zzso Thus, developing and discovering effective novel drugs with different molecular structures from conventional chemotherapy agents have become an urgent clinical zzso 

zzso cancer cells were treated with zzso and zzso zzso in these cells and tumor formation in soft zzso were zzso The molecular mechanism by which statins suppress zzso cancer cell growth was zzso 

Both zzso and zzso effectively induced zzso in zzso cancer cells and suppressed zzso growth of these cells in soft zzso Further investigation of the molecular mechanism has revealed that the expression of zzso and zzso small zzso family members, was highly induced in the cells by these statins along with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso a zzso zzso was significantly induced by these zzso 

Our findings provide new insight into the molecular mechanism by which statins induce zzso in zzso cancer cells and may lead to novel therapies for advanced zzso zzso
