Acting via the zzso zzso zzso zzso exert potent zzso effects partly by zzso inflammatory gene zzso occurring via factors such as zzso In the present study, the synthetic zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso and pulmonary zzso zzso This zzso with reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso Since zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (a surrogate of zzso zzso are sensitive to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso we explored the role of zzso in repression of these zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transcription, and zzso expression by zzso are sensitive to zzso or zzso zzso This indicates a role for de zzso gene zzso zzso expression of zzso profoundly reduces zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso is significantly reduced to levels consistent with zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso induction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Small interfering zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression partially reverses the repression of zzso zzso zzso demonstrating that zzso zzso in the zzso repression of this zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso dramatically zzso zzso zzso transcription, and this is significantly reversed by zzso small interfering zzso This reveals an important and novel role for zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the repression of zzso zzso by zzso We conclude that zzso zzso is essential to the zzso properties of zzso zzso
