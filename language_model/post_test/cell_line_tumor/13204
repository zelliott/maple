The objective of this study is to develop a sustained release system of small interfering zzso zzso inside cells aiming at a prolonged time period of gene zzso zzso zzso solution containing zzso zzso was zzso by zzso addition, followed by the zzso zzso zzso of gelatin to prepare gelatin zzso incorporating zzso The zzso were zzso with time in zzso saline solution containing zzso to release zzso zzso The zzso were zzso more slowly as the zzso concentration become higher, and consequently the rate of zzso become zzso zzso was released from the zzso as a result of zzso zzso The zzso were zzso into colon 26 cells zzso zzso zzso irrespective of the zzso zzso The gene expression was suppressed by the zzso incorporating zzso capable for the longer-term release, and subsequently the time period of gene suppression was zzso The zzso release inside the cell was observed, while the release period became longer for the zzso zzso It is possible that the zzso zzso release for a longer time period contributes to the prolonged time period of gene zzso
