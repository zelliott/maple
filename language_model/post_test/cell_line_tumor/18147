To assess the effect of suppression of zzso growth zzso zzso zzso in zzso cell line by small interference zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso using zzso 2000 was conducted to silence zzso gene zzso the expression levels of zzso zzso and protein were zzso and the effects on the cell cycles at 48 hours of zzso were assessed by real-time zzso western zzso and flow zzso zzso zzso zzso The cell growth was detected by cell counting zzso zzso at 24, 48, 72, 96 hours of zzso After 24 hours of zzso the cells were cultured with different zzso of zzso zzso for 24 hours, the cell growth zzso rate was evaluated by zzso Following incubation with 10 zzso zzso for 24 hours after 24 hours of zzso the zzso cells and the protein expression level of zzso zzso B cell zzso 2 zzso were identified by zzso and western zzso zzso 

zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso and protein were markedly decreased respectively at 48 hours of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso accompanied the reduction of cell growth at 48, 72, 96 hours of zzso with zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso respectively ( zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso arrest of zzso phase, the zzso phase rate of cells were zzso ( zzso zzso Following treatment with zzso 5, 10, 20 zzso zzso for 24 hours after 24 hours of zzso the cell growth zzso rates were zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively ( zzso zzso Treatment with 10 zzso zzso for 24 hours after 24 hours of zzso zzso zzso of cells zzso ( zzso and decreases zzso protein zzso 

zzso interference of zzso gene zzso the zzso silence in zzso cell line significantly, zzso cell growth in zzso arrests the zzso phase, and enhances the zzso to zzso
