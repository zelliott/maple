We tested the accuracy of zzso zzso for zzso maintenance zzso zzso in diagnosing zzso cancer, using cells retrieved from zzso 

zzso samples were obtained from 497 patients, the majority presenting with gross zzso zzso or undergoing zzso surveillance zzso following previous zzso zzso We performed an initial study of 313 patients, followed by a validation study of 184 zzso In all cases, zzso of zzso cancer was established by zzso 

In the initial study, receiver operator characteristic analysis showed an area under the curve of zzso ( zzso for the zzso group and zzso ( zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso were provided by threshold values of zzso zzso cells in zzso samples and zzso cells in zzso samples, based on a minimum total cell number of zzso zzso these thresholds to the validation data set gave zzso sensitivity, zzso specificity and zzso negative zzso value zzso in zzso and zzso sensitivity, zzso specificity and zzso zzso in zzso zzso maintenance zzso zzso provided clinically relevant improvements over urine zzso with greater sensitivity in zzso and greater specificity in zzso zzso 

zzso maintenance zzso zzso is a zzso and accurate test that is suitable for both zzso and zzso patient zzso
