In the current study, we have used an zzso approach to identify proteins that commonly elicit a zzso response in patients with zzso zzso zzso of the zzso 

zzso obtained at the time of diagnosis from 40 patients with invasive breast cancer and 42 healthy controls were screened for the presence of zzso zzso to zzso cell line proteins using a zzso zzso zzso 

An zzso protein detected in zzso from 21 of 40 patients was isolated and subsequently identified as zzso zzso 

The zzso approach implemented here offers a powerful tool for determining novel tumor zzso that induce a zzso immune response in cancer zzso From our findings, the zzso zzso protein and/or the related circulating zzso may display clinical usefulness as potential diagnostic markers and provide a means for a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying breast cancer zzso
