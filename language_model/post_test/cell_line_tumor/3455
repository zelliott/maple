Pixel zzso occurs when the zzso intensity exceeds a threshold and the recorded zzso intensity is zzso zzso experiments are commonly afflicted with saturated zzso As a result, zzso of gene expression are zzso with the amount of bias increasing as a function of the proportion of zzso zzso zzso is directly related to the zzso tube zzso zzso settings and zzso abundance and is not necessarily associated with poor array or poor spot zzso When choosing zzso settings, higher zzso settings are desired because of improved zzso ratios of zzso zzso This improved signal is somewhat offset by zzso of high-intensity zzso In practice, spots with saturated zzso are discarded or the biased value is zzso Neither of these approaches is appealing, particularly the former approach when a highly expressed gene is discarded because of zzso 

We present a method to correct for zzso using zzso zzso The method is based on a censored zzso zzso zzso on several zzso indicate that the method performs zzso zzso studies suggest that the method is robust under certain model zzso
