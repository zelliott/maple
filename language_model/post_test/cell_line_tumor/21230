zzso in cancer is associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso evidenced by increased zzso of zzso zzso in patients zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso which can be regulated by zzso factor 1 alpha zzso We have previously reported in established breast lines that zzso levels in the presence of oxygen leads to the Warburg zzso However, zzso and zzso can also be induced independent of zzso by other factors, such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso This study investigates zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso breast cancer cells under the assumption that these represent the in zzso condition better than established zzso Similar to in zzso zzso or primary breast zzso rates of zzso were diverse, being higher in cells expressing both zzso and zzso and lower in cell lines low or negative in both zzso zzso No correlations were observed between zzso rates and zzso zzso Two of 12 cell lines formed zzso in zzso Both were positive for zzso and zzso zzso and only one was positive for zzso zzso was affected by pharmacological regulation of zzso and zzso These findings suggest that zzso and/or zzso activities are both involved in the regulation of zzso in breast zzso
