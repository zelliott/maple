zzso from fruits of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been used to improve cough and breathing difficulty in Japan for many zzso To explore whether zzso may alleviate respiratory zzso we investigated its effect on expression of zzso zzso and production of zzso zzso zzso in human pulmonary zzso zzso cells in zzso Treatment with zzso zzso zzso resulted in an increase of zzso expression and zzso production in zzso zzso Both the zzso zzso expression and zzso production were significantly inhibited by zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso did not affect zzso expression nor zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso production in pulmonary zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso two major constituents responsible for zzso relaxing effect of zzso did not mimic the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso To identify active zzso of zzso responsible for the zzso effect, zzso was introduced in a zzso zzso zzso column and zzso zzso to yield water zzso zzso methanol zzso zzso methanol zzso zzso methanol zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, none of these five zzso alone inhibited zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, exclusion of water fraction from zzso abolished the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso present in water fraction is required but not sufficient for the zzso activity of zzso which may result from interactions among multiple zzso
