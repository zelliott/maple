zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling is an established mechanism underlying zzso prostate cancer zzso and suppression of zzso zzso signaling remains a therapeutic goal of zzso zzso zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lack the zzso zzso zzso domain zzso the intended target of zzso deprivation therapies including zzso therapies such as zzso and zzso While the zzso full-length zzso zzso zzso and zzso are both increased in zzso their expression regulation, associated zzso programs, and functional relationships have not been zzso In this study, we show that suppression of zzso zzso signaling by targeting zzso leads to increased zzso expression in two cell line models of zzso zzso zzso zzso activated a distinct expression signature enriched for zzso genes without requiring the presence of zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling suppressed the zzso signature and activated expression programs mainly associated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso In prostate cancer cells and zzso zzso treated with zzso or zzso increased expression of two zzso active zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso paralleled increased expression of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso was positively correlated with zzso in clinical zzso zzso Together, our findings support an zzso shift toward zzso signaling in a subset of zzso tumors as the zzso is rendered zzso suggesting an important mechanism contributing to drug resistance to zzso zzso
