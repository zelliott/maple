Although multiple mechanisms have been implicated in zzso recent evidence has suggested that the attachment of cells to zzso zzso proteins such as zzso zzso may mediate the signals that participate in cell survival and resistance to zzso We established previously that human zzso cancer cells and breast cancer cells adhering to zzso acquire a survival advantage through zzso of the zzso zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso regulates zzso in adherent cells is zzso In the present study, we have investigated the role of the interaction between the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso in the phenomenon of resistance to zzso We show here that the resistance of zzso zzso or zzso cells to zzso requires zzso and we present evidence that zzso of the zzso activity of zzso is zzso The zzso of zzso zzso in response to zzso on the other hand, is abolished by zzso zzso We further demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was governed by zzso via the promotion of direct protein association of zzso with zzso Our results indicate for the first time that zzso plays a critical role in zzso zzso resistance to zzso The present findings may help us to understand the formation of zzso zzso zzso and facilitate development of novel zzso zzso
