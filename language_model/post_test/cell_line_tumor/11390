Lung cancer is the one of the most frequent causes of zzso zzso In recent years, it has been documented that statins have zzso and cancer zzso zzso However, the mechanism of zzso on lung cancer is still zzso In this study, the human lung cancer cell line zzso cells were incubated with zzso zzso inhibited the survival of zzso cells in a zzso manner, decreased zzso protein zzso and increased zzso protein expression time and dose zzso In addition, zzso blocked cells in the zzso phase of the cell cycle, zzso zzso D1 and zzso protein zzso zzso the zzso zzso cascade by increasing zzso zzso and -9 zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso levels to induce cells zzso zzso zzso suppressed decreased zzso protein expression and suppressed zzso zzso in zzso zzso Taken together, these results showed that the zzso effect of zzso in lung cancer zzso cells via the zzso cell zzso influencing the cell cycle, zzso zzso D1 and zzso zzso inducing zzso and decreasing zzso levels, possibly by zzso the zzso of zzso zzso contribute to lung cancer therapy and may be an ideal zzso and cancer zzso agent for lung zzso
