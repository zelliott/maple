zzso is a small, heavily zzso zzso protein which is linked to the membrane via a zzso zzso anchor and therefore zzso in zzso zzso zzso is widely used as a zzso marker for zzso zzso zzso is also expressed on a variety of human zzso including zzso zzso breast, zzso colon and lung cancer and has been linked to poor zzso Except for its role as a zzso for zzso on zzso and zzso cells, a specific function for zzso has not been zzso Here we show that zzso affects the function of the zzso zzso zzso Using isolated zzso bone zzso B cells from zzso mice and zzso zzso zzso cell lines, we demonstrate that zzso expression reduces zzso cell migration and zzso via zzso We observed that the loss of zzso zzso cellular cholesterol levels and enhanced zzso zzso raft zzso zzso zzso migration and raft residence was also observed in zzso breast cancer cells expressing high and low levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells expressing low levels of zzso also showed enhanced zzso formation in zzso mice compared with cells zzso zzso These results demonstrate a novel role for zzso as a regulator of zzso function that could be relevant for breast cancer growth and zzso
