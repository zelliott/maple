B cell differentiation into zzso cells zzso is a tightly regulated process under the control of multiple zzso zzso One such zzso factor, zzso blocks the transition of B cells to zzso via two separate activities: zzso stimulating the expression of target genes that promote B cell identity and zzso interfering with the functional activity of the zzso factor zzso zzso is a member of a zzso family, several members of which are expressed within the B cell zzso including the closely related protein zzso In this report, we demonstrate that zzso but not zzso can block zzso formation despite the fact that zzso and zzso bind to apparently identical DNA sequence motifs and are thought to regulate overlapping sets of target zzso The DNA binding domain of zzso is required, but not sufficient by itself, to block zzso zzso In addition, less zzso regions within the N zzso of zzso play an important role in zzso B cell zzso zzso between the N zzso of zzso and zzso rather than differences in the DNA binding zzso determine whether the proteins are capable of blocking zzso formation or zzso
