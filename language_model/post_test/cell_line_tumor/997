In this study, we identified the expression and the regulation of zzso members (a zzso and zzso at both gene and protein levels during human zzso differentiation and zzso Human peripheral blood zzso zzso treated with zzso and zzso were used as an in zzso fusion zzso In zzso we used human zzso zzso tumor as a source of mature zzso and human zzso cells as a control representing zzso and zzso bone zzso zzso using zzso zzso enabled us to identify the expression of zzso 8, 9, 10, 15, 17, and 28 in both zzso and zzso Using zzso specific for each zzso 12 zzso zzso and zzso we observed a strong signal for both forms zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells, while only zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso and zzso Gene regulation was studied using real-time zzso analysis performed during zzso zzso this showed a progressive increase of zzso 12 zzso level from day 1 to 8 of the culture, while at around day 9, zzso 12 zzso level decreased zzso We also showed that zzso 8, zzso 17, and zzso 28 decreased according to the stage of zzso differentiation or zzso zzso 10 was zzso during cell zzso However, zzso zzso showed that zzso 10 protein zzso from the zzso and zzso to the plasma membrane during culture and to the ruffled border in zzso zzso The same zzso process was observed using an zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso Between days 12 and 14, zzso 12 zzso with the zzso ring, and at day 15, a strong signal was also present in ruffled border or zzso zone area of zzso Our results describe the expression and regulation of various zzso in human bone cells and the selective expression of zzso zzso in zzso Our gene regulation and protein zzso studies suggest a function for zzso 10 and zzso zzso in the formation of zzso from zzso and zzso zzso
