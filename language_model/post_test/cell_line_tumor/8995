zzso of the zzso zzso gene are amongst the most frequent aberration seen in human zzso Some zzso zzso zzso proteins are prone to loss of zzso zzso that is bound to the zzso zzso core, promoting protein zzso and therefore zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso binding and zzso activities, zzso tumor growth and resistance to zzso zzso zzso studies, devoted to identify small molecules that reactivate zzso represent therefore an attractive zzso therapeutic zzso Here we tested a novel fluorescent zzso zzso zzso to evaluate its effect on zzso zzso in cancer zzso 

zzso protein zzso was examined after zzso treatment by zzso and zzso zzso using zzso zzso The zzso zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso target zzso The zzso zzso zzso was evaluated by zzso analysis of zzso zzso of an zzso mice zzso 

The zzso complex induced zzso change in zzso and zzso zzso zzso two of the most common zzso zzso zzso treatment restored zzso binding and zzso functions and induced zzso cell zzso In zzso studies showed that the zzso complex reached zzso zzso of an zzso mice model, highlighting its ability to crossed the zzso zzso 

Our results demonstrate that zzso complex may reactivate specific zzso proteins and that may cross the zzso barrier, becoming a promising compound for the development of drugs to halt tumor zzso
