zzso induced signaling is characterized by an early induction of a nuclear zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso complex via its zzso versus a late induction via zzso and protein zzso zzso A possible interaction between these two pathways and a potential function for protein zzso C in this context has not previously been zzso Here we report that in zzso tumor cells, protein zzso C zzso is a part of the zzso zzso With zzso zzso and zzso as zzso the zzso complex zzso into the zzso zzso zzso C zzso blocks the nuclear release of zzso zzso by direct binding shown by zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso immune zzso The expression levels of zzso zzso can be further manipulated by zzso of zzso zzso C zzso or an expression zzso containing protein zzso C zzso or zzso zzso The zzso zzso regulation by protein zzso C zzso is zzso in different zzso human tumor cell lines zzso cell zzso breast zzso and zzso Furthermore, all three cell lines harbor both zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso of each zzso leads to major reduction of zzso zzso expression due to increased nuclear protein zzso C zzso zzso We conclude that the nuclear binding of zzso zzso is a novel function of protein zzso C zzso which plays an important role in zzso zzso zzso Since several zzso zzso tumor cell lines harbor this regulation, it could indicate a more general role in tumor zzso
