Since it was first identified, zzso alpha 1 zzso has been characterized to have zzso effects on several pathological conditions, in particular as a zzso of immune response and zzso Several properties exerted by zzso may be attributable to a direct action on zzso zzso zzso has been shown to exert an immune zzso activity on both T cell and natural killer cell maturation and to have an effect on functions of mature zzso including stimulating zzso production and zzso T zzso zzso zzso In previous studies we have shown that zzso increases the expression of major zzso complex class I surface molecules in zzso and human tumor cell lines and in primary cultures of human zzso In the present paper, we describe preliminary data indicating that zzso is also capable of increasing the expression of tumor zzso in both experimental and human tumor cell zzso This effect, which is exerted at the level of the target tumor cells, represents an additional factor increasing the zzso activity of zzso
