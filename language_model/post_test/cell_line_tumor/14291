zzso zzso zzso zzso are thought to have potential as a new generation of zzso zzso Since zzso the main characteristic of zzso zzso is believed to depend on altered zzso zzso we investigated the effect of two potent zzso zzso and zzso zzso on the interaction of prostate cancer cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells were treated with various zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso was zzso using zzso cells seeded on collagen type I, collagen type IV, zzso zzso and zzso The expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were measured using flow zzso of cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment reduced the ability of both cell lines to adhere to the zzso proteins zzso This effect was more pronounced for zzso cells than for zzso zzso zzso treatment decreased the expression of zzso zzso by zzso in zzso cells and zzso in zzso zzso treatment slightly reduced the ability of zzso cells to zzso but did not decrease zzso cell zzso Nevertheless, expression levels were reduced for most zzso tested, except the expression of zzso for which no significant effect was zzso Our results point to a possible role of zzso as zzso of prostate zzso cell zzso to zzso zzso zzso by acting as zzso of zzso zzso
