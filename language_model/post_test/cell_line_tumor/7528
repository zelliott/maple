zzso is widely used to treat cancer patients through the blocking of zzso and result in formation of zzso giant cancer cells zzso which are generally believed to be zzso cells or in zzso zzso Here, we showed that zzso following the treatment of zzso of zzso breast cancer cell line have capability to generate zzso progeny cells through zzso The zzso not only grew into zzso cancer cells that formed cancer zzso structures in zzso but also zzso into multiple tumor zzso cells including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso formed zzso and zzso cancer zzso structures that expressed normal stem cell zzso These progeny cells generated from zzso showed decreased ability of zzso invasion and tumor growth and became more resistant to zzso than parental zzso zzso These results demonstrated that zzso zzso have properties of cancer stem cells that can generate both zzso cancer cells and zzso of zzso zzso zzso are not only the zzso zzso to tumor zzso and but also contribute to zzso zzso
