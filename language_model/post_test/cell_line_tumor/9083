The zzso zzso zzso have come to be highlighted by their close relation to the cell invasion of zzso The zzso of zzso have undergone extensive development because of its effectiveness against tumor invasion and zzso zzso a suitable animal model is necessary for searching new zzso zzso against zzso In this study, we established an experimental model by zzso zzso zzso cells zzso into zzso zzso zzso brain, and the expression and zzso activity of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso cells and in tumor tissue was determined by means of reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso in zzso film zzso and zzso The results of zzso showed that the zzso level of zzso in zzso zzso cells was higher than that of zzso and the zzso expression of zzso was increased along with the growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the expression of zzso and zzso were significantly increased in tumor zzso and the zzso wasn't detected in normal zzso The positive stain of zzso and zzso was enhanced with the growth of zzso zzso especially for zzso The expression of active zzso was found in tumor zzso In conclusion, the expression of active zzso and zzso was increased in zzso rat brain during the growth of zzso zzso at different time zzso which indicate that zzso animal model may be a prospective animal model to test new zzso zzso
