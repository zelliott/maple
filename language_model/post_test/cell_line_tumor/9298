Several studies into the mechanisms involved in control of zzso gene expression have identified zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as essential regulators of zzso zzso Recently, interactions between zzso and zzso have been zzso Here, we investigate the role of zzso on the regulation of zzso expression by determining its interaction with the F promoter, one of the multiple promoters of the human zzso gene and the only one active in zzso We found that, in this promoter, three zzso sites are zzso By zzso mobility shift zzso in combination with zzso and zzso experiments, we demonstrated that zzso zzso binds one of the zzso motifs of the F zzso To understand whether or not they are involved in influencing F promoter activity, different zzso deletion and zzso zzso were zzso zzso into human zzso zzso zzso of zzso activities allowed the identification of a prevalent negative role of a sequence context, within the zzso region, which may be under the control of zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso and zzso of zzso zzso provided evidence that zzso has a more complex role than initially zzso In fact, zzso zzso and zzso zzso sites carried out opposite roles which are zzso by zzso levels in bone zzso zzso the resulting F promoter activity may be tightly regulated by a dynamic interplay between these two zzso sites, with a predominance of negative effect of the zzso zzso zzso
