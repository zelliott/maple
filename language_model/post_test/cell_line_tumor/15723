This study is to investigate the mechanism underlying the zzso effects of zzso grape powder zzso and identify the zzso compounds zzso We examined zzso signaling pathways affected by zzso and by its active zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso in human zzso zzso cells by zzso cell viability zzso the activities of zzso 3 and zzso 7, and the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dramatically decreased zzso acid zzso production of zzso oxygen species zzso Assessment of individual active components revealed that at zzso corresponding to 300 zzso zzso only zzso demonstrated zzso effects against zzso zzso In contrast, increased zzso of other individual zzso compounds were required to produce measurable zzso zzso Only combinations of all four zzso compounds zzso zzso zzso and zzso restored a degree of the zzso effects seen with zzso The zzso of zzso at 30 zzso concentration could reverse the zzso effects on the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso reduced zzso stress, zzso zzso stress, and zzso The mechanisms involved in the zzso effects of zzso included reduced generation of zzso and reduced processing of certain zzso We demonstrated that zzso zzso and zzso are active compounds within zzso that zzso zzso These findings contribute to our understanding of the molecular mechanisms of zzso and zzso effects of grape and are expected to assist in developing clinical protocols to treat a variety of zzso zzso
