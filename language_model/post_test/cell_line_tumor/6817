Lung zzso cells are the primary cellular targets for respiratory virus pathogens such as influenza and zzso zzso Here, we have analyzed influenza A, influenza B and zzso zzso zzso response in human zzso lung zzso zzso zzso virus infection resulted in low zzso zzso zzso and zzso production at late times of zzso However, when cells were zzso with zzso or zzso zzso zzso production was greatly zzso zzso zzso resulted in enhanced expression of zzso zzso zzso regulatory factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso Most importantly, zzso DNA binding of zzso zzso zzso and zzso onto zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, was markedly enhanced in zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso and zzso have a significant role in zzso zzso cells for higher zzso and zzso production in influenza A virus zzso
