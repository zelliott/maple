The tumor zzso zzso plays a key role in the regulation of cell cycle, zzso DNA repair, and zzso It acts as a zzso factor, and is able to activate various genes to exert specific zzso zzso the main regulator of zzso zzso the function of zzso through direct zzso On the basis of this finding, zzso the zzso interaction can be a potentially important target for cancer zzso We showed here that zzso an analog of zzso zzso zzso zzso stabilized zzso and selectively activated the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells, resulting in a pronounced zzso effect through inducing cell cycle arrest and zzso Meanwhile, we confirmed by zzso analysis that zzso could also inhibit zzso interaction, similar to zzso zzso zzso results revealed that zzso had no effect on the zzso gene zzso level, but it could induce the zzso of zzso at the zzso level, which was the downstream of zzso zzso we concluded that the zzso of zzso caused by zzso was mainly because of the decrease of the protein degradation rather than the zzso of zzso gene zzso Furthermore, no zzso formed after zzso treatments, indicating that a zzso mechanism was unlikely to contribute to the zzso of zzso by zzso In conclusion, the data acquired from zzso cells indicated that zzso exhibited high zzso activity by zzso zzso interaction, and that the mechanism was derived from the zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso It was also surprising that zzso showed high zzso effect against zzso zzso zzso cells, which was quite different from zzso zzso phase arrest might have contributed to the high zzso activity of zzso on zzso zzso The changes of zzso and zzso protein levels in zzso zzso cells indicated that the mechanisms involved in the cell cycle arrest in zzso and zzso cells were probably different, to which our future research would be zzso
