zzso is a zzso zzso zzso factor that zzso in specifying the zzso nervous zzso It is also involved in the zzso control of the zzso neurotransmitter zzso as it regulates the gene expression of zzso zzso and zzso The results of this study show that the human zzso of zzso is also capable of regulating the zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which encodes the zzso zzso of the zzso type zzso zzso In particular, we demonstrated by zzso zzso and DNA zzso zzso that zzso assembles on the zzso region of zzso promoter and, by zzso experiments, that it exerts its zzso effects by acting through the zzso minimal zzso zzso does not seem to bind to DNA directly, and its DNA binding domain seems to be partially zzso for the regulation of zzso gene zzso However, as suggested by the findings of our zzso zzso it may establish direct or indirect zzso interactions with zzso thus regulating the expression of zzso through a zzso zzso As the zzso zzso is expressed in every terminally differentiated zzso cell, this is the first example of a zzso gene whose expression is regulated by zzso zzso
