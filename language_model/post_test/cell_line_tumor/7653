zzso zzso zzso is a cancer with a poor zzso and the zzso survival of patients depends on the existence of invasion and zzso The zzso transition zzso is an important step in zzso invasion and zzso zzso box protein C2 zzso is a zzso factor that has been reported to induce the zzso Therefore we examined the correlation between zzso expression and clinical pathological factors, and zzso the function of zzso The expression of zzso in 77 zzso cases was investigated by zzso zzso and the relationship between zzso expression and zzso factor was zzso zzso by small interfering zzso zzso was performed to determine the roles of zzso in zzso cell zzso zzso expression correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients in the high zzso expression group had a poorer prognosis than the patients in the low zzso expression zzso Moreover, zzso zzso inhibited cell zzso and invasion, and decreased the expression of zzso markers zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso contributes to a poor prognosis and cancer zzso zzso may be a promising molecular target for regulating zzso zzso
