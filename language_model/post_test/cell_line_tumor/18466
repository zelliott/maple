Previous studies have demonstrated that copper zzso zzso can inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso However, the exact nature of the interactions between zzso and copper is not fully zzso In this study, the effect of copper on the cell cycle arrest induced by zzso or zzso was zzso Both zzso and zzso were effective in zzso of cell growth and cell cycle zzso Cell cycle analysis revealed that zzso zzso zzso caused a decrease in zzso phase cells that corresponded with an increase in S and zzso phase cells, and that zzso or zzso zzso copper sufficiently inhibited zzso cell cycle zzso In contrast, zzso caused an increase in zzso phase cells that corresponded with a decrease in S and zzso phase zzso Interestingly, zzso or zzso zzso copper did not inhibit zzso cell cycle zzso In addition, cell free gel shift zzso demonstrated that zzso suppressed the zzso effect of copper on zzso DNA zzso Furthermore, although 5 zzso zzso in culture media significantly increased the zzso zzso content, zzso zzso copper zzso blocked this increase of the zzso zzso zzso zzso these data demonstrate that zzso and zzso cause cell cycle arrest via distinct mechanisms, and suggest that copper may interact with zzso zzso which represents the basis of antagonism between copper zzso and zzso
