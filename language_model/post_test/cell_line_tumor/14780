zzso zzso zzso zzso the formation of zzso zzso which is a key zzso zzso regulating cell responses such as zzso survival and zzso Here we have investigated the effect of targeted zzso of zzso on cell damage and zzso the mechanisms zzso 

Three human zzso cell lines zzso zzso breast zzso lung zzso were used, which were either zzso with zzso zzso to zzso zzso or treated with a zzso zzso Cell growth and viability were zzso by zzso zzso incorporation and colony zzso zzso oxygen species zzso were measured by zzso and zzso by zzso V with flow zzso zzso were zzso by Western zzso DNA damage was induced by zzso 

zzso of zzso by zzso strongly inhibited DNA synthesis and colony formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells revealed dysfunctional zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso and contained increased levels of zzso After zzso treatment with zzso increased DNA damage, measured by zzso zzso Similar effects were found in cells with a zzso inhibitor and zzso The increased damage response in zzso cells was accompanied by greater reduction of DNA synthesis and colony formation, and by more pronounced zzso zzso of a zzso zzso inhibitor reduced the increased zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso in zzso cells triggered zzso stress by increasing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso represents a promising approach to sensitize cells to DNA damage and facilitate zzso upon zzso zzso
