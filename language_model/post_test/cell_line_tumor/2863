On the basis of transmission electron zzso observations in tumor cell lines, zzso have made zzso diagnostic and zzso zzso Following this path, the zzso zzso laboratory established the zzso cell line derived from a human zzso grade III, which when injected to the zzso nude mouse flank developed a grade IV zzso In this study, we focused on zzso characterization of the zzso cells after being recovered from zzso zzso These cells in culture were zzso by two different electron zzso procedures to characterize zzso related to grade IV zzso and to observe their structures through cell zzso Additionally, comparative zzso descriptions of different cell passages in these technical procedures could be a useful tool for improving electron zzso cell lineage zzso zzso from many cell passage observations showed zzso similarities, which suggest zzso and zzso zzso In the first zzso zzso cells were harvested and then incorporated into zzso before subjecting them to electron zzso zzso whereas in the second one, zzso cells grew first on cover zzso zzso among protocols revealed that zzso zzso zzso spatial zzso of zzso and cell attachment to zzso were more preserved in the second zzso Furthermore, in this latter zzso a unique zzso structure was observed, which was already described when dealing with zzso cell line zzso zzso these analyses demonstrated a zzso characterization of a new zzso cell line using electron transmission zzso Moreover, it has been shown that the second procedure provides more detailed information compared with the zzso
