We measured zzso zzso zzso gene expression in human zzso zzso and surrounding zzso liver at both the zzso and protein level and examined the regulation and function of this zzso 

Since growth of zzso is zzso by signaling through the zzso zzso type 1 zzso we zzso zzso is a downstream gene regulated by insulin and IGF-1 in zzso zzso In addition, zzso regulation of zzso was examined in a transgenic zzso mouse model in which the human zzso zzso gene was zzso in the liver, and an in zzso model in which a zzso truncated zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in FOCUS zzso zzso The direct effects of zzso on zzso and zzso were examined in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and IGF-1 stimulation increased zzso zzso and protein expression and zzso in FOCUS and zzso zzso These effects were zzso by signaling through the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in high levels of zzso in zzso mouse zzso while zzso of zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso and zzso in FOCUS zzso Finally, zzso of zzso significantly increased zzso and zzso in zzso cells, whereas zzso zzso of zzso expression significantly reduced directional zzso in FOCUS zzso 

The results suggest that enhanced zzso gene activity is a common feature of human zzso and growth factor signaling through zzso regulates zzso expression and increases zzso and invasion of zzso zzso zzso zzso may represent an important target for regulating tumor growth in zzso
