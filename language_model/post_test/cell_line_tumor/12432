The zzso major zzso region zzso located within the zzso of the zzso zzso is the site of the most common zzso zzso zzso zzso which occurs in zzso zzso The zzso forms a triplex DNA structure under zzso conditions and the zzso factor special zzso zzso protein 1 zzso binds immediately downstream of the zzso These observations raise the possibility that the zzso may be involved in regulation of zzso gene zzso We investigated the role of the zzso zzso on reporter gene activity and the relevance of zzso to this function in a variety of cell zzso We found that the zzso zzso reporter gene zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso binding site abolished the zzso zzso regulation of reporter gene zzso zzso of zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso of the reporter gene zzso Our data strongly demonstrated that the zzso zzso possessed regulatory function that was related to zzso
