The pancreatic zzso zzso harbors multiple zzso and zzso pointing to the existence of numerous zzso and tumor zzso genes driving the genesis and progression of this lethal zzso Here, array comparative zzso zzso on a zzso zzso platform and zzso tools have been used to define the copy number zzso in a panel of 24 pancreatic zzso cell lines and 13 primary tumor zzso This high-resolution zzso analysis has identified all known regional gains and losses as well as many previously zzso highly zzso copy number zzso A systematic zzso scheme has selected 64 focal minimal common regions zzso of zzso copy number zzso These zzso possess a median size of zzso zzso zzso with 21 zzso zzso spanning 1 zzso or less zzso of zzso zzso and possessing an average of 15 zzso zzso Furthermore, complementary expression profile analysis of a significant fraction of the genes residing within these 64 zzso zzso has enabled the identification of a subset of candidates with statistically significant association between gene dosage and zzso zzso Thus, the integration of DNA and zzso profiles provides a highly productive entry point for the discovery of genes involved in the zzso of pancreatic zzso
