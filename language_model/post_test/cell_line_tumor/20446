zzso zzso a zzso analog of zzso is a common used clinical drug to inhibit proliferation and zzso of cancer zzso But the role of zzso in modulating immune responses remains zzso Here, we investigated the function and mechanism of zzso in regulation of zzso associated immune response in zzso We evaluated the influence of zzso on host defense against invaded pathogens by acute zzso mouse model, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and gelatin zzso zzso Our data showed that the survival and the serum zzso of zzso and zzso were all enhanced by zzso significantly in zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso oxide and zzso production as well as the zzso of bacteria were all zzso by zzso in a dose dependent manner in both zzso cells and bone zzso zzso zzso Then we further analyzed zzso associated signaling zzso by Western zzso zzso and zzso in the presence or absence of zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso at zzso 536 but not zzso zzso was enhanced obviously by zzso in a dose dependent manner, whereas the degradation of zzso was little zzso zzso the nuclear zzso and DNA binding ability of zzso was also increased by zzso obviously in zzso zzso Our results demonstrated that zzso could facilitate zzso immune response through promoting the zzso of zzso and zzso activity of zzso thus zzso the traditional zzso drug zzso as a novel immune regulator in promoting host defense against bacterial zzso
