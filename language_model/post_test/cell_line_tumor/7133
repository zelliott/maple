zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso labeled with zzso are used in the diagnosis and therapy of zzso zzso zzso zzso A method has been devised to zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso and zzso analysis yielded a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso for this zzso zzso of this zzso labeled with zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were prepared in a single step from a tin precursor in zzso yields of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso performed with the zzso zzso zzso human zzso cell line demonstrated that zzso and zzso were specifically zzso zzso more than zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso previously shown to exhibit maximum zzso in this cell zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso subcutaneous zzso in a zzso model zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso normal zzso was comparable to that of zzso and was shown to be zzso However, the zzso of zzso also was substantially higher in liver zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso at 1 zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso compared to that of zzso These data suggest that these novel zzso zzso retain their specificity for zzso both in zzso and in zzso however, because of their higher zzso in normal zzso they would be best applied in settings amenable to zzso administration such as zzso zzso zzso
