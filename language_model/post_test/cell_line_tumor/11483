Much of life's essential molecular machinery consists of large protein zzso that currently pose challenges for structure zzso A prominent example is the nuclear pore complex zzso for which the organization of its individual components remains zzso By combining zzso zzso zzso to directly resolve the zzso structure of the zzso with single particle zzso to use information from thousands of zzso we determined the average positions of fluorescent molecular labels in the zzso with a precision well below 1 zzso zzso this approach systematically to the largest building block of the zzso the zzso zzso we assessed the structure of the zzso zzso Thus, light zzso can be used to study the molecular organization of large protein complexes in zzso in whole zzso
