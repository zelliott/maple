zzso cancer is the most deadly zzso cancer with a very poor zzso zzso mouse models have proven to be one very useful tool in testing candidate therapeutic agents and gene function in zzso In this study we identify genes and gene networks important for the efficacy of a zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In order to understand how zzso zzso tumors may be growing and responding to zzso zzso we used zzso zzso expression and DNA copy number zzso to identify key genes and pathways that may be critical for zzso zzso tumor zzso We compared zzso zzso treated with the zzso zzso zzso to zzso tumors collected at multiple time zzso Cell viability zzso were used to test the function of the zzso zzso zzso on zzso cell zzso 

These data indicate that a number of known survival and growth pathways including zzso signaling and general zzso factors are zzso expressed in treated zzso zzso zzso As tumors grow, cell cycle and DNA replication genes show increased zzso consistent with faster zzso The steroid nuclear zzso zzso was significantly zzso in zzso treated zzso Surprisingly, stimulation of zzso with zzso reduced the efficacy of zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso is regulating a survival zzso in zzso zzso To identify which genes may be important for tumor growth and treatment response, we observed that zzso zzso some high copy number genes and stimulates expression of some low copy number genes suggesting that these genes are particularly important for zzso zzso growth and zzso 

We have characterized the time dependent responses of zzso zzso tumors to the vitamin D zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso promotes survival for some zzso tumor zzso We propose that a combination of regulated expression and copy number can identify genes that are likely important for chemotherapy zzso Our findings suggest a new approach to identify candidate genes that are critical for zzso zzso
