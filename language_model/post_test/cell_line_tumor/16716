zzso in the form of sodium zzso has been reported to exert zzso effects in several cancer cell types by inducing zzso cell death and zzso zzso by zzso oxygen species zzso However, the exact molecular pathways underlying these effects have not been fully zzso The present study used zzso human lung zzso cells for further investigation of the zzso mechanism of sodium zzso We showed that sodium zzso modulated both the zzso and intrinsic zzso zzso which were interconnected by Bid zzso We used zzso a zzso zzso to demonstrate that sodium zzso zzso was dependent on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso also increased zzso as indicated by an increase in zzso protein light zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso A1 enhanced sodium zzso zzso indicating that sodium zzso zzso functioned as a survival zzso zzso zzso treatment also resulted in generation of zzso which zzso zzso membrane potential zzso and regulated both zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso zzso factor 2 zzso showed a zzso zzso to the nucleus, which suggested that zzso might increase cell survival by suppressing zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso cells therefore appeared to trigger both zzso and zzso zzso which were both zzso by zzso The data suggest that regulation of zzso generation and zzso can be a potential strategy for treating lung cancer that is resistant to zzso zzso
