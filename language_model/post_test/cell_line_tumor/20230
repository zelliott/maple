The objective of this study is to investigate and compare the sensitivity in conventional zzso quantitative real time zzso zzso zzso and western blots for detection of prostate cancer tumor markers using prostate cancer zzso zzso We performed conventional zzso quantitative real time zzso zzso zzso and western blots using 5 kinds of zzso zzso zzso specific zzso zzso prostate specific membrane zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were compared for their detection sensitivity by real time zzso and zzso zzso In real time zzso there was a significant correlation between cell number and the zzso concentration obtained zzso for zzso zzso and zzso We found it possible to detect these markers from a single zzso cell in both real time and zzso zzso By comparison, zzso zzso reached a linear curve in fewer zzso cycles than real time zzso suggesting that zzso zzso may offer zzso results more quickly than real time zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso may offer tumor maker detection in zzso cells more quickly (with fewer zzso zzso with the same high sensitivity as real time zzso Further study is necessary to establish and evaluate the best tool for zzso tumor marker zzso
