The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the nuclear hormone zzso zzso of zzso zzso factors and a crucial regulator of cellular zzso zzso and zzso effects of zzso suggest that zzso zzso might be useful as effective zzso zzso Few studies have examined the efficacy of these zzso in animal models of zzso and their zzso of action are still not zzso Our studies indicate higher zzso expression in primary tumors from zzso lung cancer zzso patients when compared to normal surrounding zzso The expression of zzso was also observed in several zzso zzso The treatment of lung zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso a zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso activity and induced a zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso The observed growth arrest was predominantly due to the zzso of cell proliferation without significant induction of zzso Cell cycle analysis of zzso cells revealed a cell cycle arrest at zzso with zzso zzso of zzso zzso D and zzso In addition, zzso treatment zzso sustained zzso zzso in zzso cells, suggesting the zzso of a zzso zzso Furthermore, treatment of zzso zzso zzso mice with zzso or zzso inhibited primary tumor growth by zzso and significantly inhibited the number of spontaneous lung zzso zzso zzso our data demonstrate that zzso of zzso zzso lung tumor progression and suggest that zzso zzso may serve as potential therapeutic agents for zzso
