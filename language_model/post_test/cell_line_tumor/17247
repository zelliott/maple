zzso differentiation of zzso cells is one of the hallmarks of zzso However, the molecular mechanisms of this process remain zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of zzso factors on zzso zzso zzso signaling in zzso cells during their differentiation into zzso zzso zzso cell zzso medium induced zzso of zzso and zzso which was associated with an zzso of immature zzso zzso zzso activity was localized primarily in these zzso cells, which prevented the differentiation of immature zzso cells into mature zzso zzso This differentiation was restored after removal of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso the negative effects of these factors on zzso cell zzso and zzso of zzso reproduced the effects of zzso zzso Thus, this is a first demonstration that zzso factors may affect zzso cell differentiation in cancer via zzso zzso of zzso
