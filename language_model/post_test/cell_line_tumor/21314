Emerging evidence suggests that zzso acid zzso is a zzso regulator of zzso zzso zzso zzso we used zzso cancer cells as a model to investigate the molecular mechanisms that link the zzso G zzso receptors zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and release of zzso though the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The effect of zzso involves both zzso zzso and zzso enhancement of zzso zzso zzso The consensus sites for zzso in the zzso promoter were essential for zzso zzso of zzso by zzso The zzso and zzso zzso factors commonly involved in zzso zzso expression were zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso of the zzso promoter and zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso and activity through a novel mechanism zzso zzso signals and a zzso activity from a zzso zzso zzso zzso This role of zzso was not consistent with zzso zzso of zzso through zzso of zzso as full zzso of zzso with their own zzso only zzso zzso zzso In addition to the zzso zzso the zzso stabilization protein zzso bound to and protected zzso zzso in zzso cells, indicating an active role for zzso in sustaining zzso induction during zzso zzso
