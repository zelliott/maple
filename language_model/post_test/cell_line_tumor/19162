We recently found that zzso can zzso the nuclear zzso zzso zzso pathway, but whether other statins have similar effects to those of zzso is zzso zzso we evaluated the effect six different statins on zzso zzso zzso in human zzso leukemia zzso We then determined whether the combination of statins and standard zzso agents could overcome zzso and augment zzso Of the six statins zzso only the natural statins zzso zzso zzso and zzso not the synthetic statins zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed the zzso zzso and zzso the zzso induced by zzso zzso and zzso These results suggest that different statins behave differently from one another and that they may be useful in overcoming zzso
