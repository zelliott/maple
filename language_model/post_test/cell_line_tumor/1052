zzso Yang 1 zzso is a zzso factor that plays an essential role in zzso However, the full spectrum of zzso functions and mechanism of action remains zzso We find that zzso zzso results in zzso zzso due to a reduction of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulates zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is sufficient to induce zzso zzso zzso in zzso suggesting that this function of zzso is independent of its zzso zzso We identify direct physical interactions of zzso with zzso and zzso and show that the basis for zzso zzso zzso is its ability to facilitate zzso zzso zzso the tumor zzso zzso compromises the zzso interaction, which is important for zzso regulation of zzso Taken together, these findings identify zzso as a potential zzso for zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso and suggest a possible role for zzso in zzso
