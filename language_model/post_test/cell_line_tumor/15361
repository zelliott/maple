The basic mechanisms underlying promoter DNA zzso in cancer are still largely zzso It has been proposed that the levels of the zzso donor group in DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso might be zzso zzso levels depend on the zzso zzso a zzso group zzso which zzso the conversion of zzso to zzso in zzso zzso zzso has been proposed to display tumor zzso activity and to be frequently zzso in zzso zzso zzso In this study, we show that zzso shows zzso DNA zzso in some zzso cell lines and primary tumors (20 zzso zzso zzso could contribute to gene repression and its restoration in cell lines displaying zzso tumor growth in zzso In agreement, human primary tumors expressing zzso were of smaller size than tumors showing zzso zzso zzso analyses of gene promoter zzso identified 277 genes whose zzso zzso in zzso was associated with zzso zzso The findings in this manuscript indicate that DNA zzso plays an important role in the repression of zzso in zzso and that loss of zzso in human zzso could promote the establishment of zzso DNA zzso patterns at specific gene zzso
