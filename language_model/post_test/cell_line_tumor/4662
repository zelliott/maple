This study investigates the efficacy of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso in the treatment of head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso 

The in zzso replication and zzso of zzso were studied in two human SCC cell lines, in one zzso SCC cell line, and in human zzso The effects on tumor size and animal survival were investigated following in zzso zzso treatment of zzso tumor model zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso induced rapid zzso formation, and zzso in zzso zzso zzso and killed zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso all three SCC lines zzso The virus had no zzso effect on human zzso zzso size was smaller zzso zzso zzso and overall survival was better zzso zzso zzso for treated animals than for control zzso 

zzso zzso zzso a modest survival benefit for zzso in this zzso zzso zzso This zzso virus holds promise as a novel cancer treatment for zzso zzso
