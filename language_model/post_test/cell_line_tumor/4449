We examined the zzso effect of a novel zzso zzso Technology zzso zzso grain zzso zzso is a natural mixture composed primarily of zzso zzso zzso a specific strain of zzso with unique growth zzso The aim of this study was to examine the zzso effect of zzso on human zzso zzso zzso leukemia zzso cells zzso and explore the zzso approach underlying its zzso zzso cells were cultured with zzso zzso for zzso The zzso effect of zzso was assessed through examination of percent zzso zzso zzso zzso expression levels and changes in zzso membrane potential zzso zzso induced zzso in zzso cells in a zzso manner which was zzso at zzso for zzso zzso of zzso was associated with zzso of zzso decreased expression of zzso and decreased polarization of zzso In addition, zzso showed a unique characteristic of piercing holes in zzso cells, as indicated by zzso zzso This hole induction may be responsible for the zzso effect on cancer zzso These results suggest that zzso may act as a potential therapy for the treatment of zzso zzso
