zzso zzso factor zzso is a potent zzso growth factor that both enhances the survival and drives the differentiation and proliferation of zzso lineage zzso Recent studies have suggested that zzso has a zzso effect against zzso zzso In this paper, the authors investigated the zzso effect of zzso on zzso survival and locomotor behavior in a rat model of focal cerebral zzso zzso 

To understand its zzso effect in zzso zzso was administered to a zzso zzso zzso injury cell culture model that mimics the zzso of focal hypoxic cerebral zzso In the animal study, the authors prepared a rat focal cerebral zzso model by zzso the unilateral middle cerebral zzso They then examined the effects of zzso administration on changes in zzso volume, zzso gene zzso and improvement in locomotor zzso 

Treatment with zzso significantly increased cell viability in a cell culture model of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, in zzso administration of zzso at 60 zzso body weight daily for 5 consecutive days beginning immediately after injury decreased zzso volume, altered the expression of several zzso genes zzso zzso zzso 3, and zzso and improved locomotor behavior in the focal cerebral zzso zzso 

The zzso had zzso effects in in zzso and in zzso experiments and resulted in decreased zzso volume and improved locomotor zzso Although the specific mechanism involved in stroke recovery was not fully zzso as it was not the primary focus of this study, administration of zzso appeared to decrease the extent of zzso zzso by modulating the expression of several zzso genes such as zzso zzso zzso 3, and zzso Further investigations are necessary to better understand the role of zzso on neural zzso during the recovery phase of a stroke, as well as the zzso signal zzso pathways that mediate zzso
