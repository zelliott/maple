zzso zzso growth factor B zzso has recently been shown to be a promising novel zzso agent for several neurodegenerative zzso In the current study we extended previous work on zzso potential for Parkinson's disease zzso by testing an expanded dose range of zzso (1 and 10 zzso and directly comparing both zzso and zzso effects of zzso in progressive unilateral zzso zzso zzso models to a single dose of zzso cell zzso zzso factor zzso 10 zzso that has been established by several groups as a standard in both zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso tests the treatment with 1 and 10 zzso zzso resulted in significantly improved motor function of zzso rats compared to zzso zzso rats in the zzso zzso Both doses of zzso caused an increase in zzso zzso zzso cell and fiber count in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso The effect size was comparable to the effects seen with zzso In the zzso zzso zzso injection had no significant effect in either the behavioral or the zzso zzso whereas zzso injection significantly improved the zzso zzso behavior and reduced zzso zzso cell loss in the zzso We also present a strong positive correlation zzso of the expression of zzso with zzso zzso genes involved in fatty acid metabolism in rat zzso pointing to the zzso as a site of action of zzso zzso showed a positive correlation with zzso zzso genes that was not nearly as strong zzso zzso zzso zzso reduction of zzso fatty acid transport protein 1 and 4 levels and zzso both zzso protein and zzso levels in zzso zzso We further verified zzso expression in the human zzso zzso zzso of healthy controls and zzso patients, in zzso cells that show zzso with zzso These results have demonstrated that zzso has potential as a zzso agent for zzso therapy and should be further zzso
