The synthesis of a range of zzso of the zzso zzso core has been achieved from zzso in order to facilitate zzso zzso zzso zzso formation was achieved in the presence of a zzso zzso by increasing zzso hindrance in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso structurally related to zzso A, have also been prepared from zzso The zzso A zzso were prepared using the combination of the cross zzso of zzso zzso with a zzso zzso and a subsequent zzso zzso zzso reaction zzso zzso A synthetic route is thus provided that will enable zzso A zzso to be prepared in parallel to zzso zzso in the search for novel zzso and zzso zzso Biological evaluation of one zzso and one zzso A sugar derived analogue show that they inhibit proliferation and zzso migration of zzso and zzso cells at higher zzso than zzso zzso A zzso displayed similar potency to zzso of the zzso zzso
