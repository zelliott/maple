zzso is a serious public health in Thailand with increasing zzso and mortality zzso The present study aimed to investigate zzso activities of crude ethanol extracts of a total of 28 plants and 5 recipes used in Thai zzso medicine against human zzso zzso human zzso zzso and human zzso zzso cell lines in zzso 

zzso activity of the plant extracts against the zzso cell lines compared with normal cell line zzso zzso zzso zzso were assessed using zzso zzso zzso was used as a positive zzso The zzso zzso that zzso cell growth by zzso and the selectivity index zzso were zzso 

The extracts from seven plant species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Piper zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and one zzso recipe zzso exhibited promising activity against the zzso zzso cell line with survival of less than 50% at the concentration of 50 zzso Among these, the extracts from the five plants and one recipe zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Piper zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed potent zzso activity with mean zzso values of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso All possessed high activity against zzso cell with mean zzso ranging from zzso to zzso zzso In contrast, activity against the zzso cell zzso varied zzso mean zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso The only promising extract was from zzso zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity of all the four cells to zzso also varied according to cell types, particularly with zzso cell zzso zzso The extract from zzso zzso appears to be both the most potent and most selective against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso extracts from five plants and one zzso recipe showed potent zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso to other zzso cell lines varied according to cell types and the zzso cell zzso zzso appears to be the most resistant to the tested zzso
