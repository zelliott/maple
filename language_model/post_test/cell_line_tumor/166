Loss of zzso zzso on zzso zzso is one of the most frequent genetic zzso in zzso zzso zzso Our previous data showed that the smallest common deleted region was between zzso and zzso zzso approximately by a zzso region on zzso suggesting that the putative zzso zzso genes zzso at this locus might be involved in the development of zzso Of the four genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso located in this region, only zzso was zzso in zzso zzso of zzso was found in zzso zzso zzso cell lines and in zzso zzso zzso zzso To investigate the role of zzso in zzso we used the zzso of zzso in four zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso suppressed colony formation of zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso negative zzso in zzso cells enhanced colony zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso by zzso interference in zzso cells promoted colony zzso Taken together, these data strongly suggest that zzso might be the putative zzso in zzso Moreover, we showed that zzso zzso and zzso were elevated in zzso zzso and zzso zzso After zzso of zzso in zzso zzso partly reverse cellular colony formation zzso These data suggest that zzso suppresses zzso growth partly through the zzso checkpoint protein zzso
