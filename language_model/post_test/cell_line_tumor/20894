zzso zzso is a strong zzso that binds the serum response factor zzso zzso factor over zzso elements embedded within smooth muscle cell zzso and cardiac muscle zzso zzso Here, we sought to ascertain whether zzso gene expression zzso a structural and zzso cardiac or zzso zzso 

zzso expression of zzso in the zzso cell line zzso cardiac and zzso genes while suppressing both skeletal muscle markers and cell zzso zzso zzso shows that zzso and a zzso zzso apparatus are elevated with zzso zzso A short hairpin zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso however, zzso with zzso results in complete restoration of the zzso zzso microscopic studies demonstrate a zzso zzso zzso with no evidence for cardiac zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso reveal clear evidence for zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is sufficient for the establishment of a zzso zzso zzso
