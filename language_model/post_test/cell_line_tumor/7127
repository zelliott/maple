The zzso zzso factor zzso controls a genetic program that protects cells from zzso damage and maintains cellular zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso is the major upstream regulator of zzso and controls both the zzso zzso and zzso levels of zzso In this report, we demonstrate that zzso functions as a zzso zzso protein for a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso assembles into a functional zzso zzso zzso complex with zzso and zzso that targets multiple zzso zzso located in the zzso zzso domain of zzso for zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso of zzso is inhibited following exposure of cells to zzso zzso stress and zzso a zzso zzso A zzso zzso protein containing a single zzso substitution at zzso 151 within the zzso domain of zzso is markedly resistant to zzso by either zzso zzso stress or zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso with decreased association of zzso with zzso Neither zzso zzso stress nor zzso zzso association between zzso and zzso Our results suggest that the ability of zzso to assemble into a functional zzso zzso zzso complex is the critical zzso that controls zzso levels of zzso in response to zzso compounds and zzso zzso
