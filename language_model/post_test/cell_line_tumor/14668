zzso zzso zzso a zzso selective to zzso zzso and an inhibitor of zzso complex I, has been widely used as an zzso model of Parkinson's zzso In this study, we investigated the protective effects of a novel synthetic compound, zzso zzso on zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso induced zzso characterized by generation of zzso oxygen species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and increase in zzso ratio were blocked by zzso in a zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso was also inhibited by zzso in a zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso protects against zzso zzso by blocking zzso oxygen species stimulation and zzso signaling pathways in zzso cells, implicating the novel compound in the prevention of progressive neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson's zzso
