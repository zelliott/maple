zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso is typically associated with zzso of zzso zzso zzso induced zzso However, zzso is zzso in many zzso and is associated with poor prognosis in breast zzso The mechanisms by which zzso promotes zzso are zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso by zzso in zzso breast cancer cells had no effect on cellular physiology in zzso or tumor growth in zzso mice compared to zzso control zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso in zzso cells resulted in zzso of cell invasion and enhanced zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso Additionally, treatment of parental zzso cells with zzso zzso protein led to zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso array analysis demonstrated that high expression of zzso in zzso cells resulted in zzso in expression of approximately 200 zzso zzso fold or greater compared to zzso control cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed changes in expression of several genes associated with cancer progression including zzso zzso and zzso In zzso high zzso expression induced tumor growth in zzso mice compared to zzso control cells and increased tumor vessel zzso zzso array analysis of zzso control and zzso zzso zzso tumors revealed that zzso altered expression of approximately 600 genes in zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These combined observations suggest that the effects of zzso differ significantly in a zzso environment compared to the 3-D environment and that zzso stimulates tumor zzso
