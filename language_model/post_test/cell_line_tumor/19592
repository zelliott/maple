Although the structure has been zzso for the binding of zzso and zzso as potent zzso for zzso formation, very little is known about zzso a competitive inhibitor for zzso and zzso The structural basis for the interaction of zzso agents with zzso was investigated by molecular zzso and we propose binding models for zzso against zzso The proposed model was not only consistent with previous competition experiment data between zzso and zzso but further suggested an additional binding cavity on zzso Based on this finding from the proposed zzso complex, we performed molecular design studies to identify new zzso zzso These new zzso derivatives exerted growth zzso effects on all four human zzso and one zzso zzso cell lines tested and induced strong cell cycle arrest at zzso zzso Furthermore, these compounds exhibited a strong zzso effect on zzso zzso in zzso zzso we suggest that the validated zzso model would serve as a potent platform for designing new molecular entities for zzso agents targeted to zzso
