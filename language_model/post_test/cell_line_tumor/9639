To identify the zzso of zzso zzso protein 1 zzso in gastric cancer and to investigate the zzso expression of zzso and its correlation with the clinical pathological features of zzso 

We determined zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression in 3 gastric cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso from 52 primary gastric cancer specimens and matched tumor adjacent tissue specimens by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso exact test was used to analyze the statistical association between clinical pathological data and zzso expression of zzso 

In 3 cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso had zzso zzso and lost zzso zzso zzso After treatment of zzso and zzso with the zzso agent, zzso zzso was zzso In 52 primary gastric cancer specimens and matched tumor adjacent tissue zzso zzso of zzso was detected in 23 zzso and 8 zzso specimens respectively zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Loss of zzso expression was detected in zzso and 6 zzso specimens respectively zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso There was a significant correlation between zzso zzso and zzso expression zzso zzso expression was also correlated significantly with tumor stage and zzso zzso status, but not with patient sex, age and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is a common and early event caused mainly by zzso in gastric zzso zzso expression loss may be correlated with tumor zzso in primary gastric zzso
