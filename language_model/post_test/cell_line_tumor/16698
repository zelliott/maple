Several recent studies have reported that zzso are produced during zzso injury, and that zzso zzso play an important role in cell binding to the zzso and in liver zzso zzso clamping during zzso with vessel zzso for pancreatic head cancer causes zzso zzso injury, which might promote liver zzso We investigated the liver colonization of pancreatic cancer cells under zzso zzso and examined the involvement of zzso and its zzso A human pancreatic cancer cell line zzso was injected into the zzso of mice after zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, to investigate the effect of an zzso zzso on liver colonization in the zzso group, mice received an zzso injection of the zzso zzso following zzso zzso and tumor zzso zzso zzso Four weeks later, mice were sacrificed and the number of tumor zzso on the liver was compared to mice without zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of liver zzso in the zzso group was significantly higher (16 of 20, zzso than that in the control group (6 of 20, zzso ( zzso Moreover, mice in the zzso group had significantly more tumor zzso compared to those in the control group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ( zzso In the zzso group, only 2 of 5 zzso mice developed liver zzso zzso and southern zzso of the liver extracts showed that the expression of zzso and zzso zzso after zzso zzso was significantly higher than the zzso zzso zzso zzso increases liver zzso and zzso expression in pancreatic zzso These results suggest that zzso produced due to zzso zzso is involved in liver zzso
