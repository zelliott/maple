The long terminal repeat zzso of zzso contains the zzso sequences that control gene zzso Although several different zzso have been used in the context of zzso zzso the activity of the various zzso has not yet been systematically compared for their level of gene zzso We evaluated the effect of four different zzso on gene expression using zzso stem cell factor, and enhanced green zzso protein as reporter zzso zzso tested in this study were derived from zzso zzso leukemia virus, zzso zzso virus, zzso stem cell virus, and zzso zzso zzso It was found that the level of gene expression is affected by not only zzso but also the zzso and the cell types in which gene expression zzso Furthermore, the presence of other zzso sequences such as the internal zzso entry site zzso cassette could also significantly affect gene zzso Our results suggested that the zzso should be chosen carefully, more or less on an empirical zzso
