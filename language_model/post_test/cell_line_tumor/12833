zzso flux through zzso zzso calcium zzso channels is crucial for regulating brain functions including memory formation and zzso zzso in zzso zzso have been linked to many cognitive disorders, and understanding the regulation of this process is crucial for their zzso zzso here, we have evaluated the effect of a zzso protein known to be involved in memory functions called regulator of zzso signaling 14 zzso on zzso channel activity in zzso cell lines zzso and zzso zzso protein produced significant reduction in zzso influx in both cell lines and this effect was dependent on zzso zzso zzso Thus, our results provide evidence supporting the idea that zzso may facilitate the cognitive processing by modulating zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
