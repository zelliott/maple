The majority of patients with advanced zzso cancer will experience a zzso and ultimately die from zzso zzso zzso therapy shows promise for these zzso Novel therapeutic strategies should be developed on the basis of the molecular mechanisms involved in zzso cancer and the steroid hormone environment of zzso The zzso is the main target organ of zzso hormone zzso which bind to its zzso with high zzso In this study a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used as a targeting zzso to zzso an zzso zzso drug delivery zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso In zzso studies showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso enabled the specific zzso of zzso drugs and increased the zzso zzso concentration in zzso zzso cancer cells, resulting in enhanced zzso zzso In zzso studies showed that zzso possessed higher zzso efficacy against zzso zzso tumors without any clinical signs of adverse side effects or body weight loss due to modification with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso drug delivery system exhibited high potential in the treatment of zzso cancer, and tumor targeting via zzso hormone receptors might improve the outcome of zzso
