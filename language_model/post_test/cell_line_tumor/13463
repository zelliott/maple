zzso is primary zzso zzso of zzso zzso factor 6 zzso is a tumor zzso gene frequently zzso in a number of human zzso and a zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso The present study aimed to first explore the relationship between the expression level of the zzso gene in zzso and the occurrence of bone zzso 

zzso zzso and protein expression levels in zzso and normal bone tissue were zzso by real-time quantitative zzso and zzso zzso zzso and protein expression levels in zzso cells and normal zzso were detected by zzso reverse zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso 

Both the expression of zzso zzso and protein in zzso cells and zzso were significantly lower than that in normal cells and zzso zzso 

zzso is a putative tumor zzso gene involved in zzso which can be used as a new therapeutic target and an important marker for early diagnosis and zzso zzso
