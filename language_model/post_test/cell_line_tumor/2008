zzso of zzso zzso have recently been validated as therapeutic targets in zzso but the mechanism of zzso transformation downstream of this zzso is zzso 

Here, we evaluated whether zzso zzso effects on zzso proliferation and survival of zzso zzso cells are dependent on zzso and delineated the downstream signaling pathways operating during this zzso 

We identified significant zzso of zzso 2 and zzso zzso levels in primary acute zzso leukemia blasts compared to in zzso zzso cells from healthy zzso zzso specific zzso of zzso zzso or zzso 2 significantly reduced proliferation and induced zzso in human acute zzso leukemia cell lines and primary zzso zzso we found that protein zzso zzso could be zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso effects of the zzso of zzso zzso or zzso 2 were accompanied by zzso of protein zzso zzso with subsequent zzso by zzso This leads to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso via diminished zzso and, ultimately, zzso of zzso by zzso 

Our results provide strong evidence that zzso zzso and zzso 2 participate in the zzso proliferation and survival of zzso cells, and suggest that the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a target for zzso of zzso zzso or zzso 2 and, zzso leukemia cell zzso
