zzso cell zzso zzso in zzso is enriched in the zzso zzso species, the zzso precursor of zzso zzso zzso regulating this specificity are unclear but are typically lost for cells in zzso We used zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to determine the molecular species of zzso zzso by mouse zzso in zzso compared with cultured cells in zzso After incorporation of zzso zzso over 3 zzso zzso and newly zzso zzso and zzso species were zzso from precursor scans of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso as a wide range of species irrespective of the final membrane zzso zzso of isotope zzso argued against zzso zzso as the major regulatory zzso composition of the zzso pool under all conditions reflected that of either zzso or newly zzso zzso and was always at zzso The zzso of zzso zzso together with the prolonged time scale required for achieving final equilibrium compositions suggest that selective transport between zzso and/or zzso of selected molecular species are the most probable mechanisms regulating compositions of zzso and, ultimately, zzso zzso
