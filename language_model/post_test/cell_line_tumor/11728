zzso zzso is one of the causes for the high mortality rate of prostate cancer zzso patients, yet the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso are not fully zzso In our previous studies, we found that zzso suppresses the zzso of zzso yet the underlying mechanism remains zzso To identify the genes related to tumor zzso possibly regulated by zzso we performed tumor zzso zzso array zzso to analyze the zzso expressed tumor zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso related genes were screened in zzso zzso cells zzso silenced by zzso cells and in zzso cells, zzso zzso levels of possible related genes were verified by real-time zzso in 4 prostate cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso and in 85 clinical samples (12 normal, 26 benign zzso zzso and 47 prostate cancer zzso The results showed that 10 genes (including zzso and zzso were zzso and 4 genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in the zzso zzso zzso There were 41 genes significantly zzso and 15 genes zzso in zzso cells when compared with zzso zzso Eight common genes were found in both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were further identified as zzso genes in the prostate cancer cell lines and clinical samples, and their expression showed a negative correlation with the stage of prostate cancer ( zzso and zzso level ( zzso in clinical samples, indicating their possible involvement in zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings may provide insights into the mechanism involved in the suppression of zzso zzso by zzso and its possible interacting zzso and may provide clues for further exploration of the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso
