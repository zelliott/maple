zzso cancer, one of the deadliest of all solid zzso is one of the leading causes of cancer death worldwide, with zzso new cases and zzso deaths reported each zzso These unfortunate statistics reflect the advanced stage at which most patients with pancreatic cancer are diagnosed and the paucity of effective zzso zzso zzso zzso have been gaining scientific interest because of their medicinal zzso In the present study, 31 different mushroom extracts of 12 medicinal mushroom species were screened for their effect on the viability of human pancreatic zzso zzso zzso procedures were executed with organic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In some cases, culture liquid zzso extraction was also zzso All extracts were diluted to a concentration of 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso effects on cell viability were examined in human pancreatic zzso cells zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso and crystal violet zzso zzso Furthermore, extract effects on zzso leakage were also studied in order to exclude zzso damage of the zzso The screening phase revealed that among the total 31 extracts examined with various treatment doses zzso zzso administered for 72 zzso the zzso extract of the mushroom zzso zzso exhibited the most prominent decrease in cell zzso Moreover, exposure of cells to lower zzso then the above zzso zzso 5, zzso 10, 15, 20, and 50 zzso for 24, 48, and 72 h showed a significant decrease in cell zzso Crystal violet results support these findings, and zzso levels measured suggest the lack of a zzso effect of the zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso zzso extract zzso the viability of human pancreatic zzso zzso zzso and zzso Growth zzso can be achieved in low zzso of the extract and a short exposure zzso This effect can be zzso through zzso induction and/or cell cycle zzso therefore, additional experiments are needed in order to zzso the extract mechanism of zzso These findings may lead to the development of new therapeutic strategies for the treatment of pancreatic zzso
