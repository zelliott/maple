zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso is a zzso that zzso associates with the mature zzso zzso and zzso box small zzso zzso zzso Several lines of evidence indicate that zzso plays an important role in the synthesis of zzso and the zzso of zzso In the present study, we examined the zzso regulation mechanisms that govern the expression of zzso We first performed functional dissection of the zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso factors zzso and zzso could bind to the minimal zzso zzso This was demonstrated by zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed that zzso and zzso positively regulated the zzso zzso These findings may provide new insight into the mechanisms that regulate zzso zzso
