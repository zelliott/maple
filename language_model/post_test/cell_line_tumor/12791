This study reports an initial analysis of an zzso B cell line zzso established from an zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso analyses were performed for zzso and zzso zzso was used to detect zzso DNA, and sequence analysis to investigate zzso and deletions of the zzso membrane protein zzso gene of zzso 

zzso cells proliferated in zzso and showed zzso for surface zzso zzso zzso and zzso indicating that they belong to zzso zzso analysis showed zzso with a unique zzso zzso of zzso zzso DNA was detected in zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed a zzso deletion and 7 point zzso on the zzso gene in zzso zzso 

These results suggest the involvement of an zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso This cell line should thus facilitate further investigations on the zzso role of zzso in zzso zzso
