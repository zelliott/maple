zzso a cardiac zzso factor, plays an important role in cardiac zzso zzso zzso lead to a constellation of cardiac zzso which include zzso of zzso and zzso tract zzso However, the mechanisms underlying these zzso are poorly zzso We investigated the function and mechanism of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso responsible for zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso decreased its ability to mediate the expression of vascular zzso growth factor zzso and the expression of the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso both of which are closely related to cardiac zzso zzso reporter and zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso and zzso in zzso restored the expression of zzso which was due to a reduction in its competitiveness with zzso zzso factor zzso zzso for binding to zzso In addition, we found that the zzso and zzso zzso decreased cooperation between zzso and zzso factor zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso zzso These results provide important evidence that the zzso of zzso may play a role in the development of zzso heart disease zzso in zzso
