Previously, we have shown a role of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso in the stabilization of zzso against zzso zzso degradation resulting in thinning of the zzso and zzso skin cancer zzso zzso 30, zzso Current studies have demonstrated that zzso control of zzso binding protein zzso against zzso zzso degradation also contributes to the zzso of zzso expression and zzso Western and zzso analysis revealed that disruption of the zzso gene in mice and mouse zzso led to degradation of zzso and loss of zzso gene zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso identified a zzso site between zzso position zzso and zzso that bound to zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso zzso directly zzso and zzso zzso zzso direct interaction with zzso led to stabilization of zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso protection of zzso required binding of zzso with zzso Exposure of skin and zzso to the chemical stress agent zzso led to induction of zzso and stabilization of zzso zzso resulting in an increase in zzso zzso and protein in zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso the current data combined with previous data suggest that stress induction of zzso through both stabilization of zzso and increase in zzso and direct stabilization of zzso controls zzso zzso leading to protection against zzso skin zzso The studies are significant as zzso human individuals are zzso and zzso are zzso for the zzso zzso and might be susceptible to zzso skin zzso
