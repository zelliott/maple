zzso zzso acid zzso was shown to induce zzso arrest and suppress human zzso tumor growth by zzso zzso and zzso We examined the effect of zzso on leukemia and found that zzso inhibited growth and induced cell death in zzso cell lines and blasts from zzso zzso However, no significant changes in zzso and zzso levels and zzso arrest were zzso Cell death and growth zzso were dependent neither on zzso zzso and zzso levels nor on zzso zzso did not promote cell differentiation in zzso zzso Interestingly, significant zzso of zzso zzso was observed in zzso treated zzso zzso zzso our data showed that zzso inhibited cell growth and induced cell death in both zzso cell lines and zzso patient sample via a mechanism not zzso by zzso and zzso zzso and suggested that the zzso and the zzso zzso pathways are not zzso
