Previously, we demonstrated the zzso efficacy of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in several human liver cancer zzso models and the important role of zzso cellular zzso zzso in the zzso mechanism of zzso zzso of other mechanisms such as zzso of the functions of zzso in zzso activity remains to be zzso In this study, we investigated zzso zzso changes in zzso in mice following a single administration of zzso to clarify the zzso changes contributing to the tumor growth zzso of zzso including the changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso changes peaked 3-5 d after zzso administration and included increased tumor cell death, tumor cells with round zzso zzso tumor cells and small zzso cells zzso zzso zzso No direct effects of zzso on proliferation activity of tumor cells were zzso Meanwhile, zzso of zzso structures and a remarkable increase in zzso was noted in the zzso zzso zzso in zzso was observed mainly in the outer layer of tumor zzso the area of the increase approximately included the area where the change in tumor cells and zzso were zzso Interestingly, depletion of zzso in the zzso models resulted in a marked reduction of the zzso activity of zzso In the in zzso zzso zzso zzso was only slightly induced by mouse zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso play an important role in the zzso activity of zzso which is not likely to be direct zzso by zzso zzso
