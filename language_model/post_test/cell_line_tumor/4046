The purpose of this study was to test whether dual functional gold zzso zzso zzso can be used as an ultrasound imaging zzso and as an optical zzso for zzso therapy zzso in a zzso model of breast zzso 

zzso were zzso with an inner air and outer gold zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was tested with zzso cancer cells in zzso and non-obese zzso zzso mice with breast zzso zzso were injected into the tumor under ultrasound guidance and treated with zzso zzso laser zzso The zzso zzso effectiveness of zzso was evaluated by measuring the surface and internal temperature of the tumor as well as the size of the tumor using zzso zzso 

zzso laser zzso resulted in significant tumor cell death in zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso were able to serve as an ultrasound zzso to guide the zzso injection of zzso and ensure their uniform zzso In zzso studies revealed that zzso laser zzso increased the zzso temperature to nearly zzso for 8 zzso in zzso zzso zzso volumes decreased gradually and tumors were completely zzso in 6 out of 7 mice treated with zzso and laser zzso by 17 days after zzso 

This study demonstrates that zzso zzso with zzso zzso is a promising technique for in zzso treatment of breast zzso
