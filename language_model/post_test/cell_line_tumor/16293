zzso regulates numerous signaling pathways controlling a wide range of cellular zzso including cell zzso zzso and zzso However, it is still unclear whether zzso is involved in zzso zzso in zzso We studied the correlation of zzso expression with zzso parameters and survival in zzso zzso cancer and the effect of zzso expression on zzso of zzso cancer zzso 

zzso expression was zzso examined in zzso cancer, benign zzso and normal zzso zzso Two stable cell lines were established, zzso zzso which zzso zzso and zzso which zzso zzso expression using zzso zzso zzso expression level was evaluated by zzso reverse zzso chain reaction, Western zzso analysis, and zzso zzso The sensitivity of all zzso and zzso cell lines to zzso drugs zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was detected by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was found to be significantly higher in zzso cancer compared with benign tumors and normal zzso High levels of zzso expression were associated with the International Federation of zzso and zzso stage and significantly predicted a poorer overall survival and zzso survival compared with low zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso in zzso cells decreased zzso compared with normal and empty zzso controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells led to a significant increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso may be a useful zzso indicator in patients with zzso zzso These results clarified for the first time the possibility that zzso plays an important role in regulating zzso to zzso drugs in zzso cancer zzso
