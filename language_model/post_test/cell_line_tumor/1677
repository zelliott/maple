The rabies virus zzso zzso zzso is known as a zzso zzso for systemic delivery of small interfering zzso zzso into the zzso However, selective zzso of zzso cells or specific brain regions remains a zzso In the present study, we show that the zzso zzso can efficiently be used as shuttle system to zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso leading to selective zzso of zzso expression in zzso and in zzso After zzso zzso expression was reduced up to zzso in zzso zzso zzso injected zzso zzso delivered zzso zzso specifically to zzso in the zzso resulting in a specific zzso of zzso expression up to 400 zzso from the injection zzso Further zzso studies of zzso zzso with larger molecules such as zzso zzso or DNA fragments were also successfully performed and improved in zzso zzso the zzso is not only a highly promising drug delivery system for zzso and potentially other therapeutic zzso but also a powerful tool to systematically analyze gene function in the brain under experimental settings in correlation to neurodegenerative zzso
