zzso of the present study was the investigation of the zzso of zzso zzso in human derived cells and of its zzso effects in laboratory zzso This zzso zzso zzso is contained in fried meat and fish in higher zzso than most other cooked food zzso In the present experiments, zzso caused zzso induction of zzso in the human derived zzso cell line zzso at zzso zzso or zzso zzso In contrast, no significant effects were seen in zzso another human zzso cell line, which may be explained by the concurrent lower activity of zzso zzso an zzso playing a key role in the zzso of zzso A positive result was also obtained in the single cell gel zzso zzso zzso in peripheral human zzso but the effect was only significant at the highest concentration zzso zzso In Fischer zzso rats and zzso mice, the liver was the main target organ for the formation of DNA zzso (at zzso or zzso zzso zzso and in lungs and colon substantially lower levels were zzso zzso organ specificity as in the DNA zzso zzso was seen in zzso zzso with rats, whereas in mice the most pronounced induction of DNA migration was observed in the zzso zzso of our results with data from earlier experiments indicate that the zzso potency of zzso is equal to that of other zzso which are contained in human foods in much smaller zzso zzso our findings can be taken as an indication that the human health risk caused by exposure to zzso is higher than that of other zzso that are formed during the cooking of meat and zzso
