To investigate the reversal effect of zzso a zzso zzso on zzso resistance in zzso zzso zzso human gastric zzso cell line zzso 

zzso of a human gastric cancer cell line, zzso and its zzso zzso zzso were cultivated with zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso of drugs in zzso was zzso by zzso zzso Based on the flow zzso technology, the zzso of zzso was detected in these cells by measuring zzso mean zzso intensity zzso 

zzso cells were zzso times more resistant to zzso in comparison with zzso zzso zzso at the zzso of zzso zzso zzso had no obvious zzso to zzso and zzso zzso After simultaneous treatment with zzso at the zzso of zzso zzso and 10 zzso the zzso of zzso to zzso cells decreased from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, thus, increasing the zzso sensitivity by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso study of zzso simultaneous incubation of zzso cells with zzso significantly increased the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso No such results were found in parental zzso zzso 

zzso at zzso zzso can effectively circumvent resistance of zzso cells to zzso by increasing zzso zzso zzso
