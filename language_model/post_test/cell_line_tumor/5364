Solid zzso zzso zzso of zzso were prepared by modified Hot homogenization method using zzso zzso zzso The zzso were characterized for its zzso characteristics such as mean particle size, percentage zzso efficiency and zzso potential, which were found to be 226 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso studies showed that prepared zzso were of zzso zzso The drug zzso efficiency of the zzso zzso was better in pH zzso compared to pH zzso The release profile showed a tendency to follow zzso diffusion pattern at pH zzso and zzso model at pH zzso zzso zzso carried out using zzso cell lines showed that zzso activity of zzso was not hindered due to zzso
