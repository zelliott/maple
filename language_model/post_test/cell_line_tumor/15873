The current study was focused on the induction of zzso effects of zzso along with the combination treatments of zzso and transforming growth zzso zzso against the human zzso cancer cell line zzso To determine the extent of zzso following the zzso treatments, we assessed the execution of zzso events that proceed via zzso zzso and zzso c zzso We estimated the zzso and -9 activities using a direct zzso zzso that measures the zzso of synthetic zzso zzso zzso Our experiments showed an increase in zzso and -9 activities in the cells that were treated with the combination of zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso Since zzso of zzso by zzso requires the release of zzso c into the zzso we measured the levels of zzso c in the zzso by western zzso zzso The data indicated a considerable increase in zzso and zzso c levels when cells were treated with drugs for 24 zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso also confirmed the induction of zzso in all the zzso treatments done at 24 and 48 zzso These results support our hypothesis that zzso combination can induce programmed cell death at doses that are less than half of what is typically needed for zzso and zzso to induce zzso
