B cell zzso often develop in the central nervous system zzso Although zzso zzso has been widely used for most B cell zzso the efficacy for zzso zzso has yet to be zzso A major concern is that zzso might not reach zzso zzso and either the zzso cellular zzso or zzso zzso might not substantially operate in the zzso zzso Here we investigated the potential usefulness of zzso zzso and human serum zzso in nude rats carrying human B cell zzso in the zzso zzso a zzso zzso cell line, was zzso into the zzso of zzso zzso nude zzso After several days, zzso and human serum were delivered into the zzso lateral zzso via a zzso zzso administered zzso was localized specifically at the zzso zzso indicating that zzso penetrated the zzso layer of the lateral zzso to reach the tumor zzso where it specifically bound to the zzso zzso The combination of zzso and serum zzso zzso zzso but not zzso alone zzso zzso zzso significantly extended the survival of the rats zzso zzso zzso zzso administration of zzso and serum in a zzso zzso zzso model might be a potential novel treatment for zzso zzso of B cell zzso Clinical trials are zzso
