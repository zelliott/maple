To determine pathways cooperating with zzso in cellular zzso when the zzso protein zzso zzso is zzso we zzso zzso the zzso zzso rat zzso cell line with a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso a switch in pocket protein expression from zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso the cells in late zzso early zzso at high levels of zzso zzso Maintenance of the arrest depends on the functions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cultures restores the pocket proteins to initial levels and zzso progression into zzso but the cells fail to resume zzso likely due to DNA damage becoming apparent in the arrest and zzso zzso subsequent to the release from zzso growth zzso The data indicate that zzso can cooperate selectively with zzso to induce cellular zzso a zzso that may be relevant when the zzso zzso is zzso
