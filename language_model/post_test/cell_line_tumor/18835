zzso zzso is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality in the zzso Recent studies have demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are involved in the early development of zzso zzso zzso together with zzso has been shown to improve the survival of patients with zzso C colon zzso This study examined the effect of zzso on zzso production and zzso gene zzso in immortalized human colon zzso 

zzso 205 cells, a human zzso cancer cell line, were exposed to zzso coli zzso (1 zzso in the presence of zzso (1 zzso to 1 zzso The zzso production was determined by zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso II zzso zzso expression and zzso protein were measured by the real-time reverse zzso zzso chain reaction and Western zzso zzso zzso zzso factor nuclear factor zzso activity of the nuclear and zzso proteins was determined by Western zzso zzso with a zzso zzso 

zzso 205 cells produced significantly more zzso when zzso by zzso zzso inhibited zzso production by zzso colon 205 cells in a zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso expression and zzso protein induced by zzso were also reduced by zzso Finally, zzso zzso of zzso colon cells was inhibited by zzso 

zzso zzso zzso production by zzso colon 205 zzso The zzso of zzso occurs at the zzso level of zzso gene and is regulated through zzso zzso
