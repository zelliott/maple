zzso zzso toxin zzso is produced by zzso bacteria of several zzso It is composed of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso being the zzso zzso We fused zzso from zzso zzso to the zzso 255 zzso acids of zzso zzso toxin lethal factor zzso to design a novel, potentially potent zzso zzso As a result of this fusion, zzso was transported into the zzso of targeted cells via the efficient delivery mechanism of anthrax zzso The fusion protein efficiently killed various human tumor cell lines by first inducing a complete cell cycle arrest in the zzso phase, followed by induction of zzso The fusion protein showed very low toxicity in mouse experiments and impressive zzso effects in a Lewis Lung zzso model, with a zzso cure zzso This study demonstrates that efficient drug delivery by a modified anthrax toxin system combined with the zzso activity of zzso has great potential as zzso treatment and should be considered for the development of novel zzso zzso
