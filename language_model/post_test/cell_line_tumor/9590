Unlike the intact zzso zzso zzso some zzso or zzso fragments of zzso possess zzso activities on zzso providing potential strategies in tumor zzso Using the zzso gene delivery technique, we demonstrated that the treatment by in zzso expression of a zzso zzso zzso of zzso designated as zzso strongly inhibited the tumor growth, tumor invasion and zzso Such zzso effects of zzso on tumor were partly ascribed to its influence on the activities of zzso and zzso zzso The in zzso expressed zzso decreased both the production and the activity of zzso in tumor zzso zzso also zzso zzso expression in tumor cells and zzso cells in zzso The decreased activity of zzso zzso was proved by its reduced binding ability to zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso The gene therapy with zzso not only prolonged the survival of mice bearing zzso in the liver, but also suppressed the growth and invasive ability of tumor in zzso and its zzso to zzso Taken together, these findings suggest a prospective utility of zzso in the gene therapy of liver zzso
