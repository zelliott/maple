zzso zzso zzso zzso is an aggressive zzso associated with zzso zzso Although expression and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso have been reported in most zzso specific zzso zzso showed less than the expected response in zzso zzso To determine whether the lack of response of zzso zzso was due to cooperation with other zzso we determined zzso status of zzso and other zzso including zzso growth factor zzso zzso family of 20 zzso cell lines, and tested whether dual zzso zzso is an effective therapeutic zzso We detected zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicating zzso in 14 zzso and 13 zzso cell lines, but treatment with zzso zzso showed weak or modest effect of suppression in most of the cell zzso zzso array analysis revealed that zzso was simultaneously activated with other zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso Combination of zzso and zzso zzso triggered stronger zzso on cell proliferation and invasion of zzso cells than that of each in zzso These results indicated that zzso of zzso was essential in zzso cell proliferation and/or survival, thus suggesting that simultaneous zzso of zzso may be a more effective strategy for the development of molecular target therapy for zzso
