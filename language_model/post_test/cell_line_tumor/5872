zzso or weight loss despite adequate nutrition, significantly zzso quality of life and response to therapy in cancer zzso In cancer patients, skeletal muscle zzso weight loss and mortality are all positively associated with increased serum zzso particularly zzso zzso and the presence of the acute phase zzso Acute phase zzso including zzso and serum zzso A zzso are zzso by zzso in response to zzso as part of the innate immune zzso To gain insight into the relationships among these zzso we studied mice with moderate and severe zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and severe zzso zzso was associated with high serum zzso and zzso family zzso and highly similar patterns of skeletal muscle gene zzso The top zzso pathways zzso in both were the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso zzso was associated with increased muscle zzso and increased zzso zzso in zzso zzso target zzso including zzso zzso and acute phase response zzso were highly induced in zzso zzso zzso treatment and zzso zzso both also induced zzso in cultured zzso zzso zzso of muscle versus liver zzso and zzso protein levels indicates that muscle contributes a large fraction of serum acute phase proteins in zzso 

These results suggest that the zzso zzso is a major mechanism for wasting in zzso Through zzso zzso skeletal muscle is induced to zzso acute phase zzso thus establishing a molecular link between the observations of high zzso increased acute phase response proteins and muscle wasting in zzso These results suggest a mechanism by which zzso might zzso influence muscle wasting by altering the profile of genes expressed and translated in muscle such that zzso acids liberated by increased zzso in zzso are zzso into acute phase proteins and exported into the zzso
