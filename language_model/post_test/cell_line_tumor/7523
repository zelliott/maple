The zzso structures and zzso properties of zzso and zzso complexes having zzso zzso zzso Schiff base zzso have been investigated in this zzso zzso of these complexes was carried out using zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis, mass and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses and zzso zzso have also been carried out to determine the mode of zzso The shift in zzso zzso and zzso values explores the interaction of CT DNA with the above metal zzso zzso of zzso and their complexes with DNA revealed an zzso mode of binding between zzso zzso studies showed an effective zzso activity of the metal zzso after coordination with the zzso The zzso properties of the Schiff base zzso and their complexes were evaluated in a series of in zzso tests by using zzso zzso and zzso free radical zzso In zzso and in zzso zzso functions of the complexes against zzso zzso zzso tumor model have also been zzso All the results support that zzso derived zzso zzso Schiff base complexes may act as novel zzso drugs and suggest that their potent cell life zzso may contribute to their zzso zzso
