There is increasing demand for automated image analysis of cell zzso to be fast, objective and zzso Here, we have developed a high content analysis method for zzso zzso zzso within any given population of zzso To demonstrate the utility of this method we zzso the effect of zzso acid zzso on zzso zzso zzso levels in zzso cells, a human zzso cell zzso zzso commonly used for treatment of bipolar disorder and zzso has also been shown to act as a zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and to maintain the zzso of susceptible zzso in an zzso and zzso active zzso The zzso zzso zzso platform was used for automated image acquisition of zzso zzso Multiple parameters of zzso zzso were zzso in zzso s per image using the built-in count zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso image analysis zzso Data were presented in two zzso summary zzso or zzso profiles using frequency zzso within zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso increased zzso zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso manner in zzso zzso The same analysis was shown to accurately zzso zzso zzso changes in human tissue sections zzso zzso A, a known zzso was used to validate zzso zzso Western zzso was used to validate the specificity of the zzso zzso these data demonstrate that this novel method for zzso average treatment effects and the zzso within any given population of cells, is fast, zzso and can be applied to many different cellular contexts zzso and zzso
