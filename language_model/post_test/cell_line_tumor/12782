The zzso tumor zzso is zzso regulated by zzso double minute 2 zzso which binds to zzso and promotes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso a small zzso zzso zzso was recently reported to disrupt zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso and suppression of tumor cell growth both in zzso and in zzso This study tested the efficacy of zzso against a panel of lung cancer cell lines alone or in combination with zzso zzso an zzso inhibitor of zzso protein zzso zzso or a zzso drug, zzso When acting alone, zzso selectively inhibited growth of zzso zzso zzso lung cancer cells by induction of zzso or zzso arrest in a zzso manner, but had a minor effect on zzso zzso immortalized zzso zzso zzso had a minimal effect on zzso induced growth zzso Although zzso increased zzso zzso zzso of zzso via zzso a zzso zzso compound, did not selectively enhance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lung cancer cells to zzso cell zzso This study revealed that, when acting alone, zzso selectively zzso the growth of lung cancer cells harboring a zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso was not affected by zzso zzso nor by a zzso zzso but zzso zzso cancer cells to zzso suggesting zzso could serve as a zzso zzso
