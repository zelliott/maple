zzso a member of the zzso family, serves as a master switch between zzso and zzso cycle zzso virus zzso gene zzso zzso influences the activity of another viral zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Some early zzso cycle zzso such as zzso are activated in zzso by zzso and zzso However, zzso suppresses zzso ability to activate a late zzso zzso Here we show that this repressive activity is dependent on the zzso state of zzso We find that two zzso of zzso zzso and zzso that are zzso by zzso zzso 2 zzso in zzso are also zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso either by zzso zzso or by use of a specific inhibitor of zzso abolished zzso capacity to repress zzso zzso of the zzso zzso but did not alter its ability to initiate the zzso cycle or to zzso with zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso These studies illustrate how the zzso state of a zzso zzso can zzso its behavior as an zzso or zzso of gene zzso zzso of zzso at its zzso sites is likely to play an essential role in proper zzso control of the zzso zzso life zzso
