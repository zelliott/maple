To evaluate the zzso activity and zzso toxicity of zzso in zzso cells maintained in short-term zzso 

zzso Three zzso cell lines from patients were treated with 25 or 50 zzso zzso for up to 12 zzso The effect of zzso on the cell growth was zzso zzso A zzso oxygen zzso was used to determine the effects of zzso on zzso oxygen consumption of six zzso cell lines from zzso zzso Cellular zzso zzso in three zzso cell lines from patients were measured by zzso liquid zzso 

zzso of the zzso cells was inhibited by 25 and 50 zzso zzso zzso of the zzso cells was inhibited by 10 zzso zzso Cellular zzso was detected in the zzso cell lines that were treated for 24 h with 10 and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso a potent toxicity on cultured zzso zzso
