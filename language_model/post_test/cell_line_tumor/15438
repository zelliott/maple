zzso 5A, a member of the zzso family, was originally identified as an zzso guidance factor functioning during zzso zzso Previously, we showed that the expression of zzso zzso might contribute to the zzso of gastric zzso However, less information is currently available as to the involvement of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and invasion of gastric cancer zzso 

The present study was designed to test whether zzso zzso mediates the invasion and zzso of gastric cancer via zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso cell was established from the gastric cancer cell line zzso The effect of zzso zzso on the expression of zzso was evaluated by zzso and Western zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso or natural zzso and zzso zzso were used to determine the zzso relationship between zzso 5A, zzso and zzso in the invasion and zzso of gastric zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso enhanced the expression of zzso and synthetic or natural zzso of zzso abolished zzso zzso cell migration and zzso zzso zzso zzso promoted the zzso of zzso zzso effects of zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso abolished the ability of zzso zzso to induce zzso expression and cell invasion and zzso 

zzso zzso could promote invasion and zzso of gastric cancer through the zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso and its regulated molecules could be the potential targets for cancer zzso
