zzso zzso belongs to the zzso family of genes that zzso zzso proteins associated with the zzso zzso zzso and exert regulatory effects at the cellular zzso zzso of zzso was shown in zzso melanoma cells compared with cells of the primary tumor from the same zzso Analysis of short-term cultures from 50 primary and zzso zzso revealed a zzso expression pattern of both the zzso full-length zzso protein and the zzso zzso zzso The different protein expression patterns were not associated with gene zzso or zzso Like the zzso cells expressing high levels of the zzso zzso cells zzso to zzso zzso showed increased zzso to zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso expression by small interfering zzso decreased zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso induced increased expression of zzso and zzso zzso receptors alpha 7 beta 1 and alpha v beta 5 by increasing their zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso by melanoma cells acted as an zzso zzso protein for melanoma cells zzso Analysis of zzso protein expression with respect to melanoma progression detected the protein in all visceral zzso tested and in most zzso zzso from zzso patients but in only a few zzso zzso from zzso patients and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice showed a higher zzso potential of melanoma cells zzso zzso Together, these data indicate a role for zzso in melanoma cell interaction with the zzso by regulating zzso zzso resulting in altered cell zzso and leading melanoma progression to aggressive zzso
