The combination of viral vaccination with zzso zzso administration of zzso zzso is yet to be investigated as an zzso treatment for solid zzso Here, we show that such a treatment regime can benefit survival of zzso zzso zzso mice bearing zzso zzso zzso zzso tumors were zzso vaccinated with zzso type 5 zzso zzso zzso and the tumors subsequently injected with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4, 7, 10, and 13 days zzso This therapeutic combination resulted in enhanced mean survival times that were more than zzso longer than zzso mice, and greater than zzso of mice were cured and capable of resisting subsequent tumor zzso This suggests that an zzso immune response was zzso Both zzso and zzso + zzso IT treatments led to significantly increased levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the peripheral blood and zzso zzso depletion studies performed in zzso implicated both zzso cells and zzso zzso as zzso to the therapeutic zzso Analysis of tumor zzso zzso zzso on day 12 zzso challenge revealed that mice treated with zzso + zzso IT possessed a significantly reduced percentage of regulatory T zzso zzso within the zzso zzso population, compared with zzso isolated from mice treated with zzso zzso In addition, the proportion of zzso zzso that were zzso was zzso higher in the mice treated with zzso + zzso IT compared with other treatment zzso These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of combining zzso zzso and vaccination with virus zzso tumor zzso
