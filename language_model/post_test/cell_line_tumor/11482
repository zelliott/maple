zzso is reported to be zzso zzso in nuclear zzso factories with clusters of zzso zzso II zzso zzso However, little is known about when these zzso assemble or their relative zzso We developed a quantitative zzso approach to characterize protein zzso organization, with zzso sensitivity in live zzso zzso We observed that Pol II clusters form zzso with an average lifetime of zzso zzso zzso seconds, which zzso the notion that they are zzso assembled zzso zzso affecting zzso yielded zzso changes in the dynamics of Pol II zzso which implies that zzso is regulated and plays a role in the cell's ability to effect rapid response to external zzso Our results suggest that transient crowding of zzso may aid in zzso steps of gene zzso
