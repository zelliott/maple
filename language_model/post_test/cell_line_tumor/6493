The sodium zzso zzso zzso mediates the active zzso zzso in the zzso zzso as well as zzso breast zzso Recently induction of functional zzso expression was reported in the zzso zzso human breast cancer cell line zzso by zzso zzso acid zzso treatment in zzso and in zzso which might offer the potential to treat breast cancer with zzso 

In the current study, we examined the effect of zzso zzso on zzso zzso expression and therapeutic efficacy of zzso in zzso zzso 

For this purpose, zzso zzso and protein expression levels in zzso cells were examined by Northern and Western zzso analysis after incubation with zzso zzso to zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso using a mouse zzso human zzso zzso In addition, zzso functional activity was measured by zzso zzso and zzso zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso was examined by in zzso zzso zzso 

After incubation with zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso levels in zzso cells were zzso up to zzso in a zzso manner, whereas zzso protein levels increased up to zzso and zzso zzso was zzso up to 3- to zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was modestly decreased after stimulation with zzso in the presence of zzso Furthermore, in the in zzso zzso zzso selective zzso of zzso was significantly increased from approximately zzso in zzso cells treated with zzso alone to zzso in zzso cells treated with zzso in the presence of zzso 

Treatment with zzso in the presence of zzso significantly increases functional zzso expression levels in addition to zzso zzso zzso resulting in an enhanced selective killing effect of zzso in zzso breast cancer zzso
