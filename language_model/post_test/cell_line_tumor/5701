Surface zzso and water zzso of magnetic zzso are crucial for zzso Here, we describe a synthetic approach for direct preparation of a wide range of zzso and zzso magnetic zzso particles zzso that is both simple and general and involves using different zzso as the source of functional zzso This simple strategy of changing the zzso used in the reaction can give rise to a wide variety of zzso zzso with a high number of functional zzso For the purpose of zzso we zzso three types of zzso with typical functional groups, such as zzso groups zzso zzso groups zzso and zzso groups zzso and further characterized these zzso by transmission electronic zzso zzso scanning electronic zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso X-ray powder zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso transform infrared zzso zzso The magnetic zzso of the zzso was also studied and was adequate for most zzso zzso were shown to have good zzso using cell proliferation and zzso zzso Two types of zzso with different functional groups were used successfully for zzso imaging and zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that this simple and general synthesis strategy has potential for designing zzso magnetic zzso with zzso that cater for a range of zzso
