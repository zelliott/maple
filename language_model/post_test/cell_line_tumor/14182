Brain iron zzso and its association with zzso precursor protein zzso plaque formation are implicated in Alzheimer's disease zzso pathology and so iron zzso could be considered a rational therapeutic strategy for zzso Here we analyzed the effect of the main zzso constituent of green tea, zzso zzso which possesses zzso and zzso properties, on the regulation of the iron zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited potent zzso activity comparable to that of the zzso iron zzso zzso and dose zzso zzso zzso increased zzso protein and zzso levels in human zzso zzso zzso Both the immature and full-length cellular zzso were significantly reduced by zzso as shown by two-dimensional gel zzso without altering zzso zzso levels, suggesting a zzso zzso Indeed, zzso suppressed the translation of a zzso reporter gene fused to the zzso zzso zzso region, encompassing the zzso zzso zzso The finding that zzso reversed the action of zzso on zzso and zzso proteins reinforces the likelihood that these effects are zzso through zzso of the zzso iron zzso Furthermore, zzso reduced toxic zzso zzso generation in Chinese zzso zzso cells zzso the zzso zzso zzso Thus, the natural zzso zzso zzso may provide a potential therapeutic approach for zzso and other zzso zzso
