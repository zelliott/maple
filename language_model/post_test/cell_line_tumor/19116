Two new zzso zzso zzso D zzso and zzso D zzso and three known compounds, zzso A zzso B zzso and C zzso were isolated from the zzso of zzso zzso The structure of the new zzso was established as zzso zzso and zzso zzso on the basis of zzso zzso In addition, the isolated compounds were evaluated for their zzso against the lung zzso cells zzso and leukemia cells zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso Of these, compounds 3 and 4 exhibited the most activity with zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso respectively, whereas 5 was inactive against zzso cells and 1 was inactive against both cell lines up to a concentration of zzso zzso This shows that both the zzso substitution and orientation of zzso zzso group in the zzso ring of zzso to zzso seem to play an important role in the zzso activities of human lung zzso and zzso
