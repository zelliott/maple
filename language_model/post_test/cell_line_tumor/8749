zzso gene zzso which result in zzso of an zzso zzso factor, are considered driving zzso in approximately half of all prostate zzso zzso of zzso zzso factors is also known to exist in Ewing's zzso breast cancer, and acute zzso zzso We previously discovered that zzso the zzso zzso family member in prostate cancer, interacts with the DNA damage response protein zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso in human prostate cancer zzso zzso we hypothesized that the zzso interaction may zzso radiation resistance by increasing DNA repair efficiency and that this zzso could be reversed through zzso zzso Using zzso approaches, we established zzso models of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso prostate cancer cell zzso In both cell lines, zzso zzso increased zzso survival following radiation by zzso zzso fold zzso zzso zzso and also resulted in increased zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso cells by a factor of zzso zzso relative to zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso and alkaline zzso zzso and zzso zzso assessing zzso zzso showed increased zzso and long-term efficiencies of DNA repair, respectively, following radiation that was zzso reversed by zzso zzso These findings were verified in an in zzso zzso zzso Our findings demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso radiation resistance through increased efficiency of DNA repair following radiation that can be reversed through zzso of zzso These results motivate the use of zzso zzso as zzso in patients with localized zzso zzso zzso
