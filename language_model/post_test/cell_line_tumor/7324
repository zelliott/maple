zzso instability zzso refers to high rates of zzso gains and losses and is a major cause of zzso instability of zzso It is thought that zzso caused by loss of zzso checkpoint contributes to zzso In this study, we evaluated the competence of zzso checkpoint in zzso cells and investigated the cause of zzso checkpoint zzso We found that 6 zzso of the 11 zzso cell lines were defective in zzso checkpoint control as monitored by zzso zzso and zzso analysis after treatment with zzso zzso Interestingly, all 6 zzso cell lines with defective zzso checkpoint showed significant zzso of zzso arrest deficient 2 zzso a key zzso checkpoint zzso The level of zzso zzso was significantly associated with defective zzso checkpoint response zzso zzso zzso In addition, no zzso were found in the coding sequences of zzso in all 11 zzso cell zzso Our findings suggest that zzso zzso may cause a zzso checkpoint zzso in zzso zzso
