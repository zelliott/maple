zzso zzso of zzso zzso contributes to abnormal cell proliferation by altering the zzso zzso signaling and constitutes a crucial impetus for zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso mechanism for the zzso of zzso in zzso In this study, several zzso potentially binding to the zzso region of human zzso zzso were screened by zzso reporter zzso Among these zzso zzso was embedded in a zzso island and zzso zzso by promoter zzso in acute zzso leukemia zzso cell lines and primary zzso zzso but not in normal bone zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso correlated with zzso levels measured in 9 leukemia cell lines and 27 primary zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells harboring zzso zzso and/or zzso either by synthetic zzso zzso or by DNA zzso agent zzso zzso treatment, resulted in a significant reduction in zzso expression at both zzso and protein levels and zzso of cell zzso The zzso activity of zzso was associated with zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso reduction could be partially blocked by zzso zzso leading to a reversal of zzso and zzso effects of zzso These data reveal a critical role for zzso zzso in zzso zzso and the therapeutic promise of zzso zzso expression for zzso zzso
