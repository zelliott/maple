An inverse correlation has been established between tumor levels of the DNA repair protein zzso zzso zzso and a positive outcome after zzso zzso zzso imaging of zzso could provide important information for zzso cancer zzso Several zzso zzso of zzso zzso a potent zzso zzso have been developed and shown to be capable of labeling pure zzso zzso zzso two of these zzso zzso and zzso zzso further evaluated in two zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso also was investigated as an alternative zzso 

Several zzso studies of zzso zzso and zzso were performed in zzso human zzso and zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso Mice were treated with zzso or its zzso analogue zzso to zzso the tumor zzso zzso The effect of zzso zzso and that of zzso zzso an inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso zzso on the tumor zzso of the zzso was zzso The zzso of zzso along with that of zzso in zzso cells in zzso was determined in the presence and absence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of mice either with zzso or zzso failed to reduce tumor levels of zzso or zzso even though such treatments completely depleted tumor zzso zzso Treatment of mice with zzso increased tumor zzso of zzso by zzso however, differentiation of tumors with and without zzso still was not zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso had a higher zzso in zzso in zzso tumor zzso However, its zzso like that of zzso was blocked by zzso 

Taken together, these results suggest that labeled agents that are more specific for cellular zzso and that are more metabolically stable are zzso
