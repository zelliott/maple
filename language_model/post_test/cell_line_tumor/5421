Alzheimer's disease zzso is characterized by the formation of zzso senile plaques in the brain, whose major component is a small zzso called zzso zzso zzso use of zzso zzso drugs zzso has been found beneficial for zzso and several reports suggest that zzso reduce the generation of zzso especially the more zzso form zzso However, the exact mechanism underlying zzso effect on zzso risk remains largely zzso and all clinical trials using zzso for zzso treatment show negative results so zzso Recent studies have shown that some zzso can bind to certain nuclear zzso suggesting that nuclear receptors may be involved in zzso effect on zzso zzso Here we find that zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso can significantly reduce zzso zzso but at the same time, increases the level of zzso zzso In addition, we find that a nuclear zzso zzso X zzso alpha zzso can regulate zzso generation and that zzso of zzso significantly increases zzso zzso We also show that zzso can interfere with the interaction between zzso and zzso acid, and that zzso acid decreases zzso reduction of zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso effect of zzso on zzso is abolished upon zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso can regulate zzso generation and is also required for zzso zzso zzso
