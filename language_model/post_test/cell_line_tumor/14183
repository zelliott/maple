zzso is a key zzso involved in the processing of the zzso precursor protein into zzso zzso zzso zzso accumulates and forms plaques in Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso A progressive zzso and cognitive decline occurs during the course of the disease, and zzso is believed to be central for the molecular zzso of zzso zzso has been implicated as one of the mechanisms behind the zzso cell loss seen in zzso We have studied preservation and activity of the zzso complex during zzso in zzso cells zzso exposed to zzso zzso We report that the known components zzso zzso zzso and zzso interact and form active zzso complexes in zzso zzso In addition, the fragments corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to form active zzso complexes when zzso in zzso zzso knockout zzso Interestingly, zzso replaced the normal zzso zzso zzso and was zzso with the zzso complex in zzso cells exposed to zzso In addition, zzso was detected in medium from zzso zzso zzso zzso Together, the data show that zzso complexes containing zzso are active, and suggest that this zzso activity is also important in dying cells and may affect the progression of zzso
