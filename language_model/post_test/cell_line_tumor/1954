Although the zzso zzso cell of the normal zzso zzso hierarchy has been proposed as the zzso for zzso breast zzso finding the cancer stem cell zzso zzso for this zzso has proven a difficult task, mostly due to the lack of specific zzso Recently, zzso sporadic and familial cases of breast cancer have been linked to zzso gene zzso which enables the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso an important zzso of zzso breast zzso Previously, we demonstrated that zzso zzso can mediate aggressive behavior in these zzso Thus, our aim was to test whether zzso mediates stem cell properties in zzso breast zzso Using a series of breast cancer cell lines and primary tumors, we showed that zzso was directly associated with the expression of the breast stem markers zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1 in the zzso zzso Moreover, cell population enriched for zzso expression comprised increased in zzso zzso efficiency and capacity to grow colonies in three-dimensional cultures as well as greater zzso zzso an association was found with zzso zzso of the breast, including the zzso zzso population, zzso zzso Additionally, zzso expression zzso resistance to zzso cell death, sustaining a role for this zzso in another stem cell zzso In zzso we demonstrated, for the first time, that zzso mediates stem cell properties, which could be explored in order to better define the zzso zzso of zzso breast tumors and the zzso of this zzso
