Clinical trials of therapeutic zzso for the treatment of cardiovascular zzso have failed to meet the expectations with the use of single growth factors, namely zzso and zzso We show here that a bovine zzso growth factor mixture zzso of zzso zzso and no more than zzso zzso can initiate a zzso zzso response in zzso implanted Growth Factor zzso zzso plugs that includes abundant smooth muscle zzso positive zzso tubes and functional zzso red blood cell zzso zzso zzso forming activity of the single factors, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were comparable to zzso but only the zzso factors were able to create a larger fraction of zzso tubes than zzso alone at an equal zzso Basic zzso formed a greater number of zzso zzso within the plugs than zzso or zzso at the highest doses, although zzso created zzso zzso that penetrated deeper into the plugs than zzso However, zzso showed the greatest number of zzso zzso pools, suggestive of vessel zzso and the largest number of plugs showing signs of fluid zzso in the form of large, zzso zzso in the zzso zzso showed less zzso pools, but a significant number of implants with signs of fluid zzso At high doses of zzso penetration by blood vessels and zzso cells was zzso by cartilage development within the plugs accompanied by a prominent band of zzso zzso tissue with abundant zzso zzso zzso the zzso Thus, zzso is also capable of dramatically zzso the vascular system in the zzso space surrounding the zzso These results show that zzso is capable of inducing the formation of a more mature vascular system than that formed by the single factors zzso and zzso Natural zzso of zzso zzso and zzso may have superior clinical utility in therapeutic zzso zzso
