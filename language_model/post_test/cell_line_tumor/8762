In the present study, we found that zzso inhibited zzso and zzso cell proliferation and zzso in zzso and caused a decrease in the expression of a set of proteins specifically involved in growth, invasion and zzso In addition, zzso treatment caused a zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso signaling pathways in zzso and zzso cells and decreased zzso zzso factor zzso expression in zzso zzso Taken together, these results provide new insights into the zzso action of zzso showing that this zzso affects multiple zzso features and molecular zzso As zzso is a zzso zzso that appears to be devoid of side effects, our results support its exploitation as an effective zzso drug in the management of zzso
