Current knowledge about molecular mechanisms underlying disease progression and drug resistance in multiple myeloma zzso is still zzso Here, we analyzed the potential zzso role of the zzso binding protein zzso in zzso zzso is a member of the zzso domain protein zzso and involved in various cellular functions such as zzso zzso analyses revealed that neither normal bone zzso zzso plasma cells zzso zzso PCs of patients with zzso zzso of unknown significance zzso nor zzso cells with a mature zzso showed expression of zzso in zzso In contrast, zzso was strongly expressed in zzso in normal PC precursor blasts as well as in a zzso subset and in zzso in all of the evaluated zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso cells were characterized by an immature zzso and a highly zzso zzso as defined by Ki 67 zzso We observed that zzso zzso of zzso decreased proliferation and induced zzso in zzso cells even in the presence of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso of zzso zzso resistance toward zzso zzso in zzso zzso Thus, zzso contributes to disease zzso survival, and drug resistance in zzso and might therefore provide an attractive therapeutic zzso
