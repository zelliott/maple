zzso evaluation is essential for a rational design of combination chemotherapy as some agents, with known mechanisms of action and zzso zzso may increase the therapeutic index of zzso drugs, whose clinical success is hindered by side effects and drug zzso The present study investigated new drug combinations with potential outcome for the treatment of zzso prostate zzso This final clinical stage exhibits predominantly zzso prostate cancer zzso cells but also a minority of hormone responsive zzso 

Growth zzso activity of simultaneous and sequential combinations was evaluated by zzso zzso In zzso evaluation of zzso zzso or zzso against prostate cancer cell lines, was performed by the median effect zzso The importance of zzso exposure time, drug ratio, and type of treatment were investigated and zzso 

Most simultaneous combinations of two drugs with different mechanisms of action or of two zzso II zzso resulted in mild antagonism of zzso effects, particularly notorious at high cell zzso zzso and zzso combinations were exceptions, as they yielded zzso and dose reduction index zzso values of zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso combinations zzso or zzso zzso revealed additive growth zzso effects, translated in much higher zzso values (from zzso to zzso zzso zzso was restricted to sequential zzso combinations at high cell zzso 

zzso and zzso significantly improve growth zzso activity of standard zzso drugs in a zzso manner and, therefore, may have an important role as zzso therapeutic agents in a clinical zzso
