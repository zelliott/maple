The effects of BAY zzso a zzso zzso zzso of soluble zzso zzso on zzso zzso and zzso currents were investigated in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in these cells were increased by BAY zzso zzso zzso zzso abolished the BAY zzso increase in zzso After zzso was elevated by BAY zzso zzso zzso subsequent application of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso did not increase zzso zzso In zzso recordings, BAY zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso current zzso with an zzso of 225 zzso 8 zzso At 3 zzso BAY zzso slightly and significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso BAY zzso zzso zzso enhanced the activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso After zzso channel activity was zzso by zzso zzso (30 zzso or zzso (10 zzso in zzso patches, subsequent application of BAY zzso zzso zzso further increased the channel open zzso In the zzso zzso BAY zzso applied to the zzso surface of excised patches enhanced zzso channel zzso Unlike 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso or zzso (10 zzso had no effect on BAY zzso channel zzso BAY zzso caused no shift in the zzso curve of zzso zzso however, it did increase the zzso sensitivity of these zzso At 300 zzso BAY zzso reduced the firing rate of spontaneous action zzso zzso by zzso hormone (10 zzso The zzso channel activity was also enhanced by 300 zzso BAY zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso the BAY zzso increase in zzso is primarily explained by an increase in zzso zzso The BAY zzso simulation of zzso may result from direct zzso of zzso channels and indirectly as a result of elevated zzso
