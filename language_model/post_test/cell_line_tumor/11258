Many studies have provided convincing evidence for zzso as an important diagnostic and zzso factor in human zzso as well as a useful target for zzso zzso Our previous study also revealed that zzso of zzso gene expression by zzso interference inhibited the growth of zzso cells in zzso and in zzso In the experiment, a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso was examined for its effect on zzso zzso channels and its zzso potency was observed in zzso and in zzso The results showed that zzso could block zzso and zzso channels expressed in zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso displayed significant zzso activity in several tumor cell lines and the tumor cells with higher expression of zzso presented higher sensitivity to zzso The zzso progression of tumor cells was markedly suppressed in the presence of zzso through arresting cells in zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited the tumor growth in nude mice at a dosage with slight influence on the cardiac zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso was correlated at least partly with its zzso of zzso channels, which implicated a positive role of zzso zzso channel in tumor cell zzso
