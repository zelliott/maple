zzso represents a major obstacle to successful treatment for zzso zzso with zzso N zzso and N zzso zzso comprise more than zzso of DNA zzso induced by zzso and are processed by the base zzso repair, suggesting that the cellular resistance could be caused, in part, by this efficient repair pathway, although few studies have focused on this zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the cellular responses to zzso treatment associated with zzso zzso of base zzso zzso in zzso cell lines, in order to test the hypothesis that the zzso of base zzso repair zzso might sensitize zzso cells to zzso For all the tested cell lines, only zzso showed significant differences between zzso and zzso plus zzso treatment, observed by reduced survival rates, enhanced the levels of DNA damage, and induced an arrest at zzso In addition, zzso of zzso cells zzso zzso were observed at zzso Western zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso and zzso presented a slightly reduced expression levels under the combined treatment, probably due to zzso sites blockade by zzso thus causing a minor requirement of base zzso repair zzso downstream to the zzso removal by zzso On the other hand, zzso expression in zzso plus zzso cells does not rule out the possibility that such zzso might be related to the zzso of cell cycle zzso as observed at zzso of recovery zzso The results obtained in the present study demonstrated the efficiency of zzso to overcome zzso resistance to zzso zzso
