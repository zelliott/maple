The outer zzso barrier is formed by retinal zzso zzso zzso cells and its disruption significantly contributes to the development of diabetic zzso zzso zzso The aim of the study was to explore whether zzso zzso has beneficial effects on the barrier function of human zzso cells and the main downstream pathways zzso zzso cells were cultured in standard conditions and under conditions leading to the disruption of the zzso zzso zzso zzso plus zzso (10 zzso zzso zzso zzso was added during the last 2 days of the zzso The experiments were repeated in the presence of an zzso zzso zzso and specific zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Distribution of tight junction proteins was examined by zzso Changes in zzso zzso induced by zzso were also zzso zzso treatment was able to prevent but not to restore the increase of zzso induced by high zzso plus zzso The protective effect of zzso on zzso barrier function was completely blocked by zzso and almost completely abolished by zzso In addition, zzso was able to increase zzso zzso with dependence on zzso calcium influx and this effect was blocked by either zzso or zzso zzso We conclude that zzso disruption induced by high zzso plus zzso is prevented by zzso through the downstream signaling of zzso and zzso zzso
