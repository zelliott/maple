The zzso clock gene zzso zzso has been suggested to be a tumor zzso However, detailed zzso evidence has not been provided to support this zzso We found that loss of zzso enhanced invasion and activated expression of zzso transition zzso genes including zzso zzso and zzso This finding was zzso by clinical observation that zzso zzso was associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer zzso We further demonstrated that zzso served as a zzso zzso which recruited zzso proteins zzso and zzso as well as zzso to zzso zzso factor 1 zzso zzso binding sites of the zzso and zzso promoters to repress expression of these zzso zzso zzso a condition commonly observed in tumors, caused zzso degradation and disrupted the zzso zzso complex, leading to zzso of zzso gene zzso This result was further supported by clinical data showing a significant negative correlation between zzso and zzso Thus, our findings clearly demonstrate the tumor suppression function of zzso and zzso a zzso by which zzso promotes zzso via degradation of zzso
