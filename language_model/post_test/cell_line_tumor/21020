Lack of functional zzso zzso zzso zzso causes iron overload predominantly in zzso the major site of zzso expression in the zzso In this study, we investigated the role of zzso in the regulation of both zzso iron zzso and zzso iron zzso zzso in zzso cells, a human zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso decreased both zzso and zzso zzso It also resulted in a decrease in the protein levels of zzso with no evident change in the zzso level of zzso zzso zzso is a metal zzso that mediates zzso into cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso abolished the effect of zzso on zzso zzso To determine if zzso had a similar effect on zzso in another cell line, zzso cells expressing zzso under the zzso promoter were zzso with zzso As in zzso cells, zzso expression inhibited zzso zzso by approximately 50% and decreased zzso protein zzso Further analysis of protein turnover indicated that the zzso of zzso is lower in cells that express zzso These results suggest that zzso decreases the stability of zzso and therefore reduces the iron loading in zzso zzso
