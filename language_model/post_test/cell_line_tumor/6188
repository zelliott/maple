To find the optimal proportion of Composite zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso the bone zzso of breast cancer by way of exploring its acting mechanism viewing from zzso zzso 

The human bone zzso of breast cancer model was established by injecting tumor cells of zzso cell line into the left cardiac zzso of nude zzso The modeled mice were randomly divided into seven groups: the blank group administered with normal saline by zzso the positive control group with zzso acid via zzso injection, and the 5 tested group with zzso in different proportions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B, zzso C, zzso D, zzso and E zzso given by gastric zzso The treatment started from 1 week after modeling and lasted for six zzso By the end of the experiment, the zzso zzso in bone were zzso by zzso tracing method and X-ray zzso and separated for detecting gene and protein expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso of nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso colony stimulating factor zzso by zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso 

zzso of bone zzso gene was displayed to some extent in all the tested groups treated with zzso showing an increased level of zzso zzso expression (It was zzso zzso zzso in the tested group zzso and decreased zzso expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively in the tested group zzso The optimal effect was shown in the tested group C, showing significant difference to that in the blank group zzso zzso zzso Meanwhile, the zzso in the bone zzso zzso could be zzso and protein expressions of zzso zzso in all the tested zzso The optimal effect was shown in the tested group C, with significant difference from those of the normal saline zzso 

zzso could inhibit the bone zzso of breast cancer through zzso zzso zzso Among different proportions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was the best zzso
