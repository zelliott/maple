The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso and zzso inhibitor with zzso and zzso properties, is known to possess zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso and other zzso in zzso however, the mechanism underlying the zzso action remains zzso In the present study we show that zzso selectively activates the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in a zzso manner, causing rapid zzso of zzso (the zzso of zzso translation initiation factor 2) and zzso protein synthesis in zzso zzso and other types of cancer zzso The zzso zzso block was followed by zzso of zzso cell proliferation and zzso zzso zzso did not affect the activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso control zzso and zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and induced zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells, but not in zzso cells or in human zzso zzso cells, identifying zzso as a selective target for zzso zzso zzso The fact that zzso induced zzso activity in zzso an effect reversed by the zzso inhibitor zzso suggests a direct effect of the drug in zzso zzso The results of the present study identify zzso as a novel target of zzso suggesting new scenarios on the molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso activity of this traditional zzso
