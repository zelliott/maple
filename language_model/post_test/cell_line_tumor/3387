Based on the zzso technique, we have developed a new approach that generates transgenic animals capable of mimicking human genetic zzso The new system is a combination of zzso with zzso and zzso It has the characteristics of being stable, zzso and zzso with the zzso able to be transcribed tissue zzso To support the ability of this new method to generate a model for a disease, we created an zzso mouse line that mimics zzso disease under controlled zzso Thus, it should now be possible to rapidly establish human genetic diseases as a whole animal model without the use of embryonic stem cell and gene zzso This system also provides a tool for pathological and pharmacological studies of aspects peculiar to particular human genetic zzso
