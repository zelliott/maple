The zzso protein binds to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso which is a zzso modification associated with active zzso Human zzso is a zzso of the zzso zzso module of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Previous work revealed that the zzso complex is recruited to zzso zzso zzso stress target genes and required for their zzso Here, we report the involvement of zzso in the survival of human cells from zzso zzso zzso zzso results in impaired zzso of the zzso stress genes zzso and zzso Besides zzso zzso zzso we find that zzso is also required for the maintenance of zzso at these zzso which is already present prior to zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso in the absence of zzso correlate with a decreased association of zzso which is a core component of the zzso complexes, to zzso and zzso In conclusion, our results suggest that the zzso protein zzso plays a central and dual role in the zzso stress zzso Prior to zzso stress, the protein coordinates zzso levels, thereby maintaining a zzso zzso state on zzso stress target gene zzso Following zzso stress zzso zzso is required for increased zzso zzso on these zzso which then results in full zzso zzso thereby promoting cell zzso
