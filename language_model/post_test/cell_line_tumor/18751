Id proteins are zzso regulators of basic zzso zzso factors that control zzso cell behavior in many different zzso This study aimed to identify the potential role of zzso and zzso proteins as molecular makers for prostate cancer zzso 

Using the technique of zzso we determined zzso and zzso expression in a panel of 67 human prostate zzso We also manipulated zzso and zzso expression in zzso and zzso prostate cancer cell lines and determined the effects on invasion in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

Both zzso and zzso proteins were zzso during human prostate cancer progression in zzso and were zzso in highly aggressive prostate cancer zzso In zzso zzso expression of zzso and to a lesser extent zzso converted zzso zzso prostate cancer cells into more zzso and invasive cells and increased their zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso expression in highly zzso zzso cells reduced their growth potential and zzso 

We propose that both zzso and zzso proteins control prostate cancer cell zzso and could serve as molecular markers of aggressive human prostate zzso
