As part of an ongoing effort to develop a clinically acceptable zzso zzso targeted against zzso zzso this study compared zzso zzso zzso zzso that were targeted against the zzso zzso zzso via a whole zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus its zzso zzso zzso zzso or an zzso single chain zzso zzso zzso zzso directed against the same zzso Compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso showed increased binding in zzso to zzso zzso cells and, when loaded with zzso zzso increased zzso against zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies using zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso mice showed that zzso targeted via zzso zzso exhibited the same long circulation zzso as zzso zzso targeted via zzso was cleared faster than zzso due to increased liver zzso which was related to the zzso and/or the zzso tags in the zzso zzso zzso targeted via zzso zzso was cleared rapidly from circulation due to zzso zzso in the liver and zzso All three zzso of zzso extended the mean survival time of zzso mice compared to zzso or free zzso zzso targeted via zzso zzso which had the longest circulation zzso appeared to be slightly more effective in zzso survival times than zzso targeted via either zzso or zzso zzso
