A panel of nine zzso zzso zzso zzso A, zzso zzso zzso J, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso C was examined for their effect on zzso resistance, as well as their zzso zzso zzso a zzso resistant zzso which has been reported to zzso zzso zzso protein zzso was used for the experiments together with its parent cell line zzso zzso lung cell zzso We found that zzso zzso and zzso at relatively zzso zzso restored the zzso action of zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso also significantly enhanced the zzso of zzso in drug resistant zzso Both zzso alone had no effect on the cell zzso however, when combined with zzso doses of zzso they induced cell cycle arrest in the zzso phase, which is typical for toxic doses of zzso Our results suggest that zzso and zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso in zzso resistant lung cancer cells zzso by increasing the zzso of zzso inside the zzso The common structural feature of both active zzso is the zzso zzso and the absence of a zzso group at zzso Unlike the reversal effect, the zzso of zzso with the zzso zzso was similar to that observed for zzso with the zzso zzso
