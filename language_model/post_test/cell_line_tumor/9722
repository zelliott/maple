Cell membrane organization is dynamic and is assumed to have different characteristic length zzso These length zzso which are influenced by zzso and protein composition as well as by the zzso can range from below the optical resolution limit (as with zzso or zzso to far above the resolution limit (as with capping phenomena or the formation of zzso zzso The measurement of these membrane features poses a significant problem because membrane dynamics are on the zzso zzso and are thus beyond the time resolution of conventional imaging zzso Fluorescence correlation zzso zzso a widely used zzso technique to measure membrane zzso has the required time resolution but lacks imaging zzso A promising solution is the recently introduced method known as imaging total internal reflection zzso which can probe diffusion phenomena in zzso zzso with good zzso and spatial zzso In this work, we extend zzso to perform zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso areas of arbitrary shape and derive a generalized expression that is zzso to active transport and zzso zzso is applied to model systems exhibiting zzso active zzso or a combination of the zzso To demonstrate its zzso to live cells, we observe the diffusion of a marker, the zzso domain zzso derived from the zzso zzso zzso on live zzso zzso We investigate the organization and dynamics of zzso zzso zzso under the conditions of cholesterol removal and zzso zzso
