zzso zzso cell zzso zzso is one of the deadliest zzso zzso Ying Yang 1 zzso a zzso expressed zzso zinc finger zzso factor, plays a regulatory role in a variety of fundamental biological zzso such as embryonic development, growth, zzso differentiation and zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the expression of zzso in normal and zzso zzso zzso and its function in zzso zzso We found that the expression of zzso zzso was significantly increased in the tumor zzso compared with the zzso or normal zzso zzso The increased expression of zzso in tumor samples was further confirmed by zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso cells and resulted in markedly reduced cell zzso zzso the small interfering zzso zzso of zzso expression in zzso cells resulted in increased proliferation by enhancing the binding of zzso to zzso D1 and zzso a protein complex known to mediate cell cycle zzso Moreover, besides zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified as a zzso downstream zzso as zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso biological function through zzso of zzso zzso expression of zzso could moderately suppress proliferation of zzso zzso The expression of zzso significantly correlated with that of zzso in zzso zzso Taken together, we demonstrated zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and identified zzso as its zzso
