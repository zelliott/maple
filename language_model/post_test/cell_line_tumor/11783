In spite of the growing importance of zzso protein C zzso protein C zzso in tumor biology, their impact on zzso zzso remains largely zzso The objective of this study was to assess whether soluble plasma zzso protein C zzso zzso which is a regulator of circulating zzso is involved in innate immune response in cancer zzso In the zzso zzso cancer line, the role of zzso in zzso of zzso was zzso In zzso in 33 patients, with a diagnosis of zzso zzso cancer, zzso was zzso blood immune cell zzso were determined by flow zzso and plasma zzso were evaluated using a protein zzso zzso rank correlation zzso zzso and zzso significance was determined by a statistical hypothesis test zzso Our results show that zzso zzso induced the zzso of several zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of patients exhibited a concentration of plasma zzso well above the baseline zzso plasma level, 100 zzso 28 zzso zzso comparing immune cell zzso in patients having a normal level of zzso with those having a high level of zzso it was found that zzso levels were correlated with high intensity of cells expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso and low intensity of cells expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso markers zzso zzso zzso and zzso high levels of zzso correlate with high levels of plasma zzso proteins such as zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso inflammatory protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso that have already been proposed as zzso for zzso cancer and particularly those with poor zzso In conclusion, zzso produced by zzso cancer cells, by modulating circulating zzso influences the zzso behavior of tumor cells zzso and zzso zzso zzso in turn acts on the innate immune response by decreasing zzso cells such as natural killer and T helper cells zzso zzso and zzso
