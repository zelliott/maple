zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso acid and sodium zzso show unique near infrared zzso zzso that renders them as a promising candidate for zzso cancer zzso To improve targeting efficiency, we developed a versatile method to allow ordered zzso of zzso on the surfaces of these zzso via a zzso zzso zzso G zzso The zzso zzso was prepared with zzso zzso zzso average zzso 2000 zzso to first allow the zzso of zzso on the zzso subsequently zzso were added to this construct to enable active zzso The zzso zzso were characterized by zzso zzso dynamic light scattering and modified zzso In in zzso studies, the zzso zzso with bound mouse anti zzso zzso zzso G zzso successfully targeted the zzso zzso breast cancer cell, zzso zzso cell death was observed for the targeted zzso line at a low laser power of 540 J (3 W zzso for 3 zzso while the control breast cancer cell zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso as a zzso for zzso of zzso offers a promising strategy to zzso various zzso on zzso for engineering their biomedical applications in cancer zzso
