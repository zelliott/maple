Based on previous data on the zzso zzso effect on highly zzso zzso in the present work we aimed at investigating the zzso potential of the zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso injury and zzso damage in small zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso For that purpose, rats were divided into 4 zzso zzso and zzso groups received a daily subcutaneous zzso injection (10 zzso starting 24 h before zzso zzso groups received a single dose of 5 zzso on zzso using zzso source and were sacrificed 3 or 30 days after zzso zzso were removed, zzso stained with zzso and zzso or zzso zzso and zzso characteristics were zzso zzso and zzso markers were studied by zzso while zzso zzso was performed to evaluate DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso function was evaluated by zzso zzso zzso indicate that zzso treatment diminished zzso zzso and preserved zzso and the number of zzso after radiation exposure zzso zzso zzso zzso This effect was associated to a reduced zzso and DNA damage in zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso preserving zzso components and reducing formation of zzso and also it accelerated bone zzso zzso Furthermore, it reduced zzso frequency in peripheral blood zzso zzso zzso in 1,000 zzso zzso zzso completely reversed zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso mass with normal zzso appearance and reducing zzso and zzso of zzso zzso exhibits zzso effects against zzso zzso and zzso damages in small zzso zzso and zzso zzso and, thus, could be of clinical value for patients undergoing zzso
