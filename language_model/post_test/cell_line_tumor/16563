zzso acids were transformed and coupled to zzso a well-known zzso agent, in an attempt to create new zzso drugs with selectivity for breast cancer zzso Among the zzso acids available, zzso was selected to act as an zzso zzso It is hypothesized that zzso which shows some structural zzso with zzso could possibly mimic the natural hormone and, zzso bind to the zzso zzso In this exploratory study, several zzso zzso have been zzso Thus, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso in order to generate new zzso drugs with structural diversity, more specifically in regards to the zzso group zzso These new zzso were produced in good yield following efficient synthetic zzso All the zzso hybrids were more effective than the parent drug, zzso In zzso biological evaluation on zzso zzso positive and zzso zzso negative zzso and zzso breast cancer cell lines revealed an enhanced zzso activity for compounds with the zzso function located at position zzso zzso zzso calculations were performed for the pure zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The synthesis of all zzso hybrid zzso and their biological activity are reported zzso zzso zzso within the targeted protein zzso zzso alpha zzso are discussed in relation to the biological zzso
