This paper presents a zzso model to calculate the electric current zzso and the zzso differences generated due to a breast zzso cell during the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The proposed model is based on semiconductor zzso analysis, and aims to understand the zzso associated with growing breast zzso zzso The effect of the duration of the zzso transition, and the zzso and the mobility of the zzso cell boundary is zzso The results show that shorter zzso transition zzso and higher zzso and mobility at the cell boundary provide higher magnitude of the electric zzso
