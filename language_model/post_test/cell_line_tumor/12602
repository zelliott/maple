To clarify the source of zzso of drug combination effects evaluated with different drug interaction mathematical models, the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and their combinations were observed in a series of human cancer cell lines and a normal cell zzso The combined effects were evaluated with three drug interaction models: zzso zzso zzso Bliss Independence zzso and zzso Median Effect zzso The evaluations with three different models were further compared with each zzso We demonstrated that when zzso zzso were fitted with the same method, similar evaluated results for drug combinations would be derived with different zzso The zzso of evaluated effects of drug combinations were attributed to different curve fitting methods used rather than the models zzso The effects of drug combinations showed discrepancies on different cell lines, and at different combined drug zzso on same cell zzso
