zzso zzso into normal brain from zzso brain tumors are protected by the blood brain barrier zzso which prevents the delivery and limits the effects of zzso zzso We have evaluated the ability of zzso zzso zzso to limit the effects of an agent known to broadly open the zzso to a target region of the zzso The zzso relocation and zzso of zzso into the cell zzso has the advantage of minimal side effects since the effect is localized to the area exposed to light, allowing the access of zzso agents only to these zzso zzso tumor bearing zzso Fisher rats were treated with zzso and a nontoxic zzso dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by light zzso zzso zzso zzso scans were used to monitor the degree zzso zzso zzso tumor cells were implanted into the brains of other animals that were subsequently treated 24 h later with zzso zzso opening followed by the zzso administration of zzso zzso zzso delivery of zzso at low zzso levels demonstrated significant zzso zzso No effect on the zzso was observed if zzso and light was given in the absence zzso The survival of animals implanted with zzso tumor cells was significantly extended following zzso zzso opening and zzso therapy compared to zzso zzso delivered zzso was effective in opening the zzso in a limited region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso opening clearly increased the efficacy of zzso zzso
