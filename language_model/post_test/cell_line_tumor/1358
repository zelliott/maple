The zzso target of zzso zzso is frequently activated in colon zzso due to zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso of zzso such as zzso reduces colon cancer progression in several experimental zzso Recently, a new class of zzso zzso that act as zzso zzso of zzso has been zzso The effectiveness of these drugs in colon cancer cells has however not been fully zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso colon cancer cell lines were treated with zzso an zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso a dual zzso inhibitor or zzso zzso cell growth, proliferation and survival were assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso incorporation or by zzso of DNA fragmentation zzso In zzso the zzso activity of zzso zzso was evaluated on nude mice bearing colon cancer zzso 

zzso and zzso reduced the growth, proliferation and survival of zzso and zzso colon cancer cells more efficiently than zzso Similarly, zzso and zzso also decreased significantly the proliferation and survival of zzso cells which were resistant to the effects of zzso In zzso zzso and zzso reduced the growth of zzso generated from zzso and zzso zzso Finally, we also observed that the efficacy of zzso zzso of zzso was enhanced by zzso a zzso zzso 

Taken together, these results show that zzso zzso of zzso are effective in blocking colon cancer cell growth in zzso and in zzso and thus represent a therapeutic option in colon cancer either alone or in combination with zzso zzso
