zzso cell zzso of head and neck zzso are a result of multiple genetic and zzso zzso zzso zzso of tumor zzso genes is an important event in head and neck zzso Here we analyzed the promoter zzso of 15 genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in 54 zzso and in matching 23 normal zzso zzso of these zzso genes zzso was significantly more frequent in zzso zzso compared to normal samples zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was often found in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was less frequently zzso A trend of increased zzso zzso in more advanced tumor stages and less differentiated zzso was zzso zzso of zzso was significantly higher in poorly differentiated zzso zzso and zzso zzso occurred zzso in advanced tumor stages ( zzso zzso of zzso was higher in patients with zzso zzso zzso than patients without zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in head and neck cancer cell lines was observed at similar frequency as in primary zzso In zzso frequent zzso of zzso genes in zzso was detected and this zzso zzso event may have an essential role in head and neck zzso
