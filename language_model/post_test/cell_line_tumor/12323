zzso necrosis zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that has zzso zzso and zzso effects on zzso zzso However, clinical trials have revealed high systemic toxicity and this has hampered its zzso as an zzso zzso In this study, a human zzso zzso was created and tested for its zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso was prepared by protein engineering in which zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso at positions 8, 9 and 10 of zzso were zzso by zzso zzso and zzso and C terminal zzso was zzso by zzso along with deletion of the first seven zzso zzso zzso zzso expression zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso was constructed and transformed into zzso coli zzso The zzso was expressed in a partially soluble form in zzso zzso from the zzso of cell zzso by zzso zzso zzso and two sequential zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso was zzso pure by zzso stained with silver and zzso size exclusion zzso zzso Its yield was about zzso zzso wet cell zzso The zzso zzso exhibited an approximately zzso increase in zzso relative to the zzso zzso on the mouse zzso cell line zzso in a standard zzso test, and at least and at least 50 times higher zzso as wild type zzso in zzso In zzso biological activity studies carried out on tumor cell transplanted mice and nude mice also showed a more effective zzso of zzso than zzso 

These results suggest that zzso has potential for developing an effective zzso zzso for some zzso
