A number of trials of adoptive transfer of zzso T zzso have been performed in the last 20 years in zzso melanoma, with increasingly encouraging results as the relevant melanoma zzso were identified and the zzso of injected T cells zzso We have previously described a sorting method of zzso T zzso that uses magnetic beads coated with zzso complexes and we suggested that this method could be applied to a clinical zzso In the present work, we provide a detailed description of the whole zzso process of sorting and amplification of clinical grade T cells specific for the melanoma zzso zzso and zzso All the zzso used in this process including the sorting zzso were produced in zzso conditions and we document the zzso of the different steps of the process such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso validated in 3 blank runs in a clinical setting, allowed the production of at least zzso pure zzso zzso and zzso T cells within 28 days starting with 100 zzso of blood from zzso melanoma zzso This zzso process is thus ready to be used in an upcoming phase zzso clinical trial on zzso melanoma zzso
