zzso stem cells zzso are generally used in tissue engineering, zzso medicine and therapy for immune disorder zzso zzso are also employed as drug carriers for tumor therapy due to their ability to migrate to tumor zzso However, due to the zzso function of zzso the application of zzso in prostate cancer therapy remains zzso In this study, we investigated the underlying mechanism by which zzso enable prostate cancer cells to escape from immune surveillance in the inflammatory zzso zzso we demonstrated that compared with the control groups, zzso zzso with zzso effectively promoted the growth of the mouse prostate cancer cell line zzso zzso Furthermore, when zzso prostate cancer cells were zzso with zzso zzso with zzso tumor zzso significantly increased in zzso zzso In addition, we investigated the mechanism through which zzso promote the ability of zzso cells to escape from immune zzso The results revealed that zzso led to the zzso of zzso in zzso The inflammatory zzso zzso effect of zzso on zzso cells in zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso The results of our study suggest that inflammatory zzso induce the zzso function of zzso which enables prostate cancer cells to escape from immune zzso
