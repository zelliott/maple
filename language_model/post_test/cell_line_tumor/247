zzso a zzso interacting zzso plays a central role in several zzso zzso pathways through its functional and physical interactions with various biologically important zzso Identification of the zzso protein network should be useful to further our understanding of zzso zzso For the first time, we performed zzso zzso and identification of zzso expressed proteins between zzso and zzso zzso clones using a newly developed quantitative mass zzso analysis zzso This strategy is based on forward and reverse differential isotope labeling of the zzso zzso of two comparative cells, followed by two-dimensional liquid zzso separation and automated zzso deposition to zzso laser zzso zzso sample plates for zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequence zzso We zzso and identified 200 zzso expressed proteins involved in various cellular zzso Through zzso analysis, four groups of zzso expressed proteins were highlighted for the association with zzso zzso zzso transition channel zzso zzso regulator zzso heat shock protein family members, and zzso zzso zzso These results indicate the functional diversity of zzso and provide new research directions to study the biology of zzso zzso
