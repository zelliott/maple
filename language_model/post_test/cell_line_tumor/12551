In this study we evaluated efficiency of zzso to zzso zzso of cancer cells, an important factor in the progression and zzso of zzso For this purpose we targeted zzso zzso that are zzso adhesive receptors in various zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To evaluate zzso of cancer cells, we used a zzso migration zzso that allowed analyzing zzso migration of colon zzso cell lines across an zzso zzso Their adhesive properties were also characterized by the analysis of zzso to zzso zzso and zzso In addition, the expression of major zzso zzso selected intact zzso zzso and other adhesive receptors zzso zzso zzso was analyzed by flow zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression by zzso to zzso zzso almost abolished the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells in zzso These data show that zzso to zzso zzso zzso can be used to inhibit zzso of zzso zzso
