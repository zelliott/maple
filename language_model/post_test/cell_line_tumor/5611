Most deaths from zzso cancer are due to zzso that are resistant to conventional zzso But the factors that regulate the zzso process and zzso of zzso cancer are poorly zzso In the current study, we investigated the zzso expression of human zzso protein 17 zzso in human zzso zzso cancer cells and tried to analyze its influences on the cell behaviors like migration and zzso 

zzso and zzso were used to identify zzso in zzso embedded zzso zzso tumor specimens and zzso zzso zzso zzso Then we examined the effect of zzso zzso on the zzso migration, and zzso of zzso cancer cells to zzso and zzso in a human zzso zzso cell line, zzso 

We found that zzso was zzso expressed in zzso zzso of the patients with primary zzso zzso zzso and in all of the zzso cancer cells of zzso from 8 zzso The zzso expression was also detected in the zzso zzso the same as in zzso zzso None of the 7 zzso tumors primarily developed in the zzso was zzso for zzso zzso of zzso increased the migration but decreased the zzso of zzso zzso cells to zzso and zzso 

zzso is zzso expressed in a significant proportion of zzso zzso zzso Our results strongly suggest that zzso plays a role in zzso disease and resistance of zzso zzso zzso to zzso
