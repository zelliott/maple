Cellular differentiation and programmed cell death are tightly controlled to maintain tissue zzso and proper organ zzso In a screen for zzso specific gene products, we isolated an immediate early zzso response gene from zzso stem cells that appears to play a key regulatory role in a number of cell types and may be of particular importance in cells of the central nervous zzso The zzso 28 zzso protein product interacts with the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso beta 1 zzso and was therefore named zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso with zzso zzso to zzso and the zzso zzso and is predominantly expressed in excitable zzso including polarized zzso and the central nervous zzso zzso has been characterized as an zzso zzso of the zzso as reduction of zzso in zzso cells significantly increases zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso induced rapidly zzso cell zzso zzso zzso induced growth zzso zzso zzso which was associated with zzso zzso of the zzso factor zzso Thus, we have identified zzso as an important novel protein that interacts to the zzso complex, influencing cellular zzso balance, induction of zzso and zzso zzso
