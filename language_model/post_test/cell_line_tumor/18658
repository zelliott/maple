We describe in this study a strategy to produce synthetic vaccines based on a single zzso capable of zzso strong immune responses to a combination zzso and zzso zzso with the purpose of treating zzso or preventing infectious zzso This strategy is based on the capacity of Trojan zzso to deliver zzso zzso into the zzso zzso where processing into zzso peptides takes zzso Our previous work demonstrated that Trojan zzso containing a zzso zzso localized to zzso zzso where zzso class zzso peptides were generated in a zzso fashion by the action of various zzso and the zzso zzso In this study, we report that Trojan zzso containing several zzso zzso joined via zzso zzso generated all of the corresponding zzso class zzso zzso which were recognized by zzso However, Trojan zzso prepared with zzso zzso failed to produce the zzso class zzso zzso We also present data indicating that Trojan zzso bearing both zzso and zzso zzso can generate the corresponding zzso class zzso and zzso zzso which are capable of stimulating T cell zzso Most significantly, in zzso vaccination of mice with a single injection of zzso Trojan zzso resulted in strong zzso and zzso responses that translated into significant zzso responses in a model of zzso zzso The overall results indicate that Trojan zzso prepared with zzso zzso are ideal candidates for producing synthetic zzso vaccines for the induction of zzso and zzso responses that could be used against a variety of diseases, including zzso
