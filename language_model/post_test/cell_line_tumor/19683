The molecular mechanisms of zzso Pulmonary Fibrosis zzso remain zzso zzso Growth Factor beta zzso is a key zzso zzso in the development of lung zzso We used zzso and zzso biology strategies to identify genes whose expression is significantly altered in zzso zzso cells zzso in response to zzso zzso and zzso and Epstein zzso zzso zzso cells were exposed to 10 zzso zzso zzso and zzso at serial time zzso Total zzso was used for zzso to zzso Human Genome zzso zzso Each in zzso zzso was studied in duplicate and an average zzso value zzso zzso data for each time point was compared to control and a signal log ratio of zzso or greater taken to identify significant differential zzso Using zzso zzso values and zzso Average zzso zzso zzso zzso a list of 312 zzso zzso zzso proteins or zzso of zzso turnover was curated via zzso and zzso zzso databases for zzso cluster analysis of zzso associated zzso zzso of the zzso using zzso zzso focused cluster analysis revealed coordinate differential expression of a large cohort of zzso zzso associated zzso Of this grouping members of the zzso (A zzso and zzso domain zzso family of genes were zzso zzso zzso gene expression was also identified in zzso infected zzso cells as well as zzso and zzso zzso zzso We zzso zzso activities zzso and functional zzso of zzso and zzso using zzso and collagen zzso zzso of these genes resulted in diminished production of collagen in zzso cells exposed to zzso suggesting a potential role for these molecules in zzso zzso in zzso
