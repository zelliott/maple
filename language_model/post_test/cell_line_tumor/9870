In an effort to discover novel selective zzso zzso zzso B zzso with favorable zzso and zzso profiles, zzso bearing properly selected polar zzso at position 4 were zzso zzso and evaluated as zzso zzso Several compounds with zzso zzso activity in the zzso range and excellent zzso selectivity zzso index zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso relationships and zzso simulations provided valuable insights into the zzso binding interactions at position 4, which has been poorly zzso Furthermore, zzso and experimental studies led to the identification and zzso characterization of zzso zzso zzso zzso as an in zzso and in zzso potent and selective zzso zzso with rapid zzso barrier zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity, slight zzso of selected zzso zzso and low in zzso zzso On the basis of this preliminary zzso profile, inhibitor zzso might be viewed as a promising clinical candidate for the treatment of neurodegenerative zzso
