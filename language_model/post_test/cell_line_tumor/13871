The zzso zzso zzso type 9 zzso gene is involved in the zzso regulation of the zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso in the zzso gene have been associated with both zzso and zzso through zzso and zzso mechanisms, zzso We have studied the effect of the four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso on the zzso activity of zzso as well as on the amount of the cell surface zzso and zzso of LDL in zzso zzso zzso zzso The two groups of zzso did not differ with respect to zzso activity of zzso but they did differ with respect to the amount of cell surface zzso and zzso of zzso The four zzso zzso had a zzso increased level of cell surface zzso and a zzso increased level of zzso of LDL as compared with zzso The two zzso zzso had a zzso decreased level of cell surface zzso and a 38% decreased level of zzso of LDL as compared with zzso Our studies have also shown that transfer of media from zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso cells, reduces the amount of cell surface zzso and zzso of LDL in the zzso cells within 20 zzso of media zzso Thus, zzso or a factor acted upon by zzso is zzso from the zzso cells and degrades zzso both in zzso and zzso zzso
