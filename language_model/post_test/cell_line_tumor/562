zzso a zzso zzso belongs to the zzso family of zzso zzso and is known to have zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso between zzso findings and zzso expression in oral zzso cell zzso zzso 

Using zzso techniques to examine the expression levels of zzso in zzso zzso expression in zzso was detected in 46 zzso of 71 zzso We also compared the zzso features of zzso cases with zzso expression zzso Moreover, we examined expression of zzso in eight cell lines derived from zzso using reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and Western zzso 

There was a significant correlation between decreased zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and mode of invasion zzso zzso zzso Patients with positive zzso expression had a significantly better prognosis zzso zzso zzso Lower expression of zzso was also seen in cell lines derived from grade zzso which shows stronger invasive potential than other grades of zzso 

zzso may be a useful marker to identify the potential for progression in zzso
