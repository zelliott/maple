The lack of specific delivery of zzso zzso represents a significant limitation of zzso therapy zzso of zzso The zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso has attracted considerable attention as a target for imaging and therapeutic applications for prostate zzso Although recent efforts have been made to zzso zzso of zzso with imaging agents, there have been no reports on zzso zzso zzso for targeted zzso of prostate zzso The present study focuses on the use of a zzso zzso of zzso zzso 2) for targeted zzso to achieve zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso laser scanning zzso with a combination of nuclear zzso and zzso methods were employed to monitor the specific imaging and zzso zzso effects on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Our results demonstrated that zzso effects by zzso 2 were specific to zzso cells, but not zzso zzso Cell zzso was detected as early as 2 zzso by zzso double zzso becoming more intense by 4 zzso Evidence for the zzso zzso cascade being activated was based on the appearance of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso zzso detected DNA fragmentation 16 zzso zzso confirming zzso zzso 

Cell zzso by zzso double zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso confirm cellular zzso in zzso cells when treated with zzso zzso 2 and subsequently zzso It is expected that the zzso targeting zzso of this zzso can serve as a delivery vehicle for zzso and other therapeutic applications for prostate zzso
