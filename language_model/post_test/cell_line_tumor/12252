The zzso of bone tissue is strongly influenced by physical forces, including magnetic zzso Recent advances in tissue engineering has permitted the generation of three zzso zzso zzso We have investigated the effects of electromagnetic stimulation on human zzso cells grown in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso by zzso electromagnetic fields in a zzso zzso bone protein expression and zzso zzso production by zzso were measured using zzso zzso In zzso cultures, the number of cells was significantly higher compared to zzso zzso zzso In both zzso and control cultures, cells were zzso to zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso thus suggesting that the expression of zzso markers was maintained throughout the in zzso zzso zzso analysis of von zzso sections revealed that stimulation with electromagnetic field significantly increased zzso zzso The data lend support to the view that the application of a magnetic field can be used to stimulate cell growth in zzso zzso in zzso This finding may be of interest for the production of zzso designed for clinical zzso
