The zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role in prostate cancer zzso zzso however, the molecular mechanisms by which the zzso regulates cell proliferation in zzso and zzso zzso are incompletely zzso We report that zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso expression increases and becomes nuclear or zzso in advanced zzso In the zzso zzso zzso of mouse zzso model of zzso zzso expression increases with zzso progression with many cells exhibiting nuclear zzso zzso expression is higher in human zzso tumor zzso compared with zzso zzso and is markedly higher in the zzso zzso cell line zzso compared with cell lines that are zzso and/or zzso In zzso cells, zzso induced zzso zzso and protein expression and zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso withdrawal suppressed zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso reduced zzso cell proliferation and increased percentages of cells in zzso phase, whereas zzso reducing percentages in S phase, of the cell zzso zzso zzso reduced expression of the zzso target gene zzso zzso at both zzso and protein levels, zzso zzso activity driven by zzso responsive elements from the zzso zzso gene promoter and levels of the zzso cell cycle zzso zzso D1 and zzso zzso Our results suggest that in zzso zzso zzso and the zzso are in a feedback loop in which zzso is induced by the zzso to maintain zzso activity, zzso cell cycle control, and continued cell zzso
