In the mast cell signaling zzso the binding of zzso E zzso to zzso its zzso zzso is generally thought to be a passive zzso In this study, we examined the effect of zzso alone, that is, without zzso zzso on the zzso in mast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alone increased zzso zzso level zzso and induced zzso in rat zzso leukemia zzso mast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alone also increased zzso and induced zzso in bone zzso mast zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso zzso alone, in zzso too low to induce zzso increased zzso zzso content in zzso mast zzso We next examined whether zzso dynamics affect the zzso zzso zzso mast cell zzso zzso zzso D inhibited the ability of zzso alone zzso zzso to induce de zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso alone increased zzso and induced zzso We have summarized the current findings into two zzso First, zzso alone increases zzso and zzso zzso in mast zzso Second, zzso at zzso too low to increase either zzso or zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso which serves as a negative feedback control in the mast cell zzso signaling and zzso
