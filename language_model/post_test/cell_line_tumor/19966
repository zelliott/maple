Resistance to zzso drugs is often zzso by the zzso of zzso zzso by the zzso resistance zzso zzso The nuclear zzso steroid and zzso zzso zzso is one of the key zzso regulators of zzso gene zzso A variety of zzso bind to SXR, and stimulate zzso on zzso elements zzso located in the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso is widely used as a zzso for zzso zzso zzso medical zzso Previous studies have shown that a significant amount of zzso zzso from zzso infusion bags and lines during interventions, such as total zzso nutrition, blood zzso and cancer zzso Thus, the leaching of zzso during zzso chemotherapy for cancer patients may facilitate zzso expression in various zzso including cancer cells, which may promote drug zzso To examine such a hypothesis, the effect of zzso on zzso zzso of the zzso gene was studied in the human colon zzso cell line, zzso cells, which zzso express zzso zzso increased the zzso zzso of the zzso gene in zzso zzso The induction by zzso was zzso when a reporter zzso containing zzso zzso motif in the zzso was zzso In a zzso zzso zzso zzso recruited steroid zzso zzso to the zzso domain of zzso Finally, using real-time reverse zzso we showed that zzso increased zzso gene expression in a zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is an zzso of the zzso gene in this cell zzso As such, the leaching of zzso from the zzso medical devices may influence the zzso zzso which may induce resistance to drugs in certain populations of cancer zzso
