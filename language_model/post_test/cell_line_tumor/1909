zzso zzso zzso involves the administration of a tumor zzso zzso agent, which upon zzso with light of an appropriate wavelength leads to the destruction of the tumor zzso The aim of the present study was to determine the efficacy of zzso as a zzso for the zzso of oral zzso The drug zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso oral zzso cells and their zzso to zzso zzso was studied along with the determination of the zzso zzso of zzso This was followed by initial investigations into the mechanism of cell killing induced following zzso involving both high and low zzso of zzso The results showed that at 37 zzso the zzso of zzso by both zzso and zzso cells increased in an zzso dose dependent zzso However, the percentage of cell killing observed following zzso differed between the 2 cell zzso a maximum of zzso of zzso cell killing was achieved as compared to zzso killing for zzso zzso Both the zzso and zzso cell types exhibited predominantly zzso zzso of zzso but the zzso zzso potential zzso studies showed that the zzso cells were far more resistant to the changes in zzso when compared to the zzso cells and this might be a factor in the apparent relative resistance of the zzso cells to zzso Finally, cell death zzso and zzso activity analysis studies demonstrated the occurrence of extensive necrosis with high dose zzso in zzso cells, whereas zzso was observed at lower doses of zzso for both cell zzso For zzso cells, high dose zzso produced both zzso as well as zzso zzso This is the first instance of zzso zzso usage for cancer cell zzso
