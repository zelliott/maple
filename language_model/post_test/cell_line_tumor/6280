A systematic study on the interaction of zzso zzso zzso with human cells has been carried out in the present zzso zzso and zzso are identified as major pathways for zzso entering, and zzso the cells, zzso Most of the zzso are found to be enclosed in membrane bounded zzso which are fairly stable (against zzso as very few zzso are released into the zzso The zzso interaction is a dynamic process, and the amount of zzso inside the cells is affected by both the amount and zzso zzso of zzso of zzso in the zzso These interaction characteristics determine the low zzso of zzso zzso at low feeding zzso
