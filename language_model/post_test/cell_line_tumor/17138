zzso of primary zzso by zzso occurs during normal zzso as well as in several pathological conditions, including exposure to specific zzso zzso The mechanisms that regulate the death and survival of primary zzso however, are still not well zzso The recent zzso of zzso zzso beta zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso suggests a role for zzso in this step of zzso Using a well-known model of zzso zzso zzso in adult rats consisting of the administration of zzso acid zzso we investigated the participation of zzso during the initial phase of zzso prior to germ cell zzso Adult rats were treated with a single zzso dose of zzso and DNA zzso analysis confirmed zzso cell death in the zzso In enriched germ cell zzso and zzso from zzso animals, zzso zzso increased significantly at 3 and 6 hours, zzso Next, zzso induction of zzso zzso was demonstrated by use of laser capture zzso of zzso zzso in combination with zzso reverse zzso chain zzso The zzso protein also increased significantly after 6 hours and was mainly zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso of afflicted zzso The zzso zzso was confirmed by Western zzso analysis of isolated zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso zzso Finally, the zzso zzso of zzso was tested in zzso in zzso cells zzso with zzso and a reporter construct that contained a consensus zzso responsive zzso zzso of zzso at similar doses used in zzso zzso a similar zzso zzso as did zzso at 1 zzso zzso The present results raise the possibility that zzso zzso zzso in the zzso process of zzso zzso induced by zzso Whether zzso interacts with zzso in the zzso of primary zzso preventing the progression of the first zzso division, however, remains to be zzso
