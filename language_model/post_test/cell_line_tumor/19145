zzso a clinically used zzso zzso zzso has been shown to prevent zzso zzso damage connected with the zzso of zzso zzso In the present study, we examined the effect of zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso cell line which does not possess functional zzso zzso zzso recordings and toxicity studies showed no response to zzso currents in this cell line, irrespective of the stage of its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso as evidenced by reversal of the changes in zzso membrane potential zzso and decreased zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso release and DNA zzso zzso (10 zzso and zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso of zzso zzso reversed the zzso effect of zzso on the zzso zzso release, suggesting that the zzso zzso zzso is a possible target for zzso action of zzso zzso at low zzso zzso also attenuated zzso and zzso zzso release and DNA zzso but only in the case of zzso was this effect accompanied by a decrease in zzso zzso The present data indicate that zzso zzso the toxic effects of various zzso agents and the zzso effect of zzso does not seem to be connected with its action on zzso zzso but rather with its influence on zzso pathways engaged in cellular zzso zzso
