zzso zzso which are suggestive for the presence of tumor zzso zzso represent a common event in zzso cancer zzso Previous zzso studies for human zzso zzso identified a candidate deletion zzso at zzso which we further narrowed to a zzso region at zzso bounded by markers zzso and zzso Using a zzso candidate approach, we identified three alternative transcripts of a novel human zzso zzso zzso zzso candidate 2; zzso zzso One of such zzso zzso encodes a short protein of 102 zzso acids with no similarity to any other known gene zzso Three zzso zzso zzso were identified in tumor DNA from 44 zzso zzso While zzso and zzso zzso are sequence zzso with unknown functional significance, zzso is a zzso with a zzso effect on the predicted protein zzso zzso zzso studies by real-time zzso on several normal and tumor cells revealed that zzso zzso is zzso in cancer, suggesting that it may act as a potential tumor zzso zzso The very low zzso rate seems to also indicate that zzso of zzso might probably be due to mechanisms different from genetic zzso
