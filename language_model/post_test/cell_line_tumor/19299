High mobility group box 1 protein zzso originally characterized as a nuclear zzso zzso has also been described to have an zzso role when it is involved in cellular zzso and zzso zzso In this study, zzso zzso was zzso expressed in the presence of culture media with or without added zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso from cells grown in culture media alone only minimally increased zzso production by zzso zzso and had no effect on zzso zzso In contrast, zzso isolated from cells cultured in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso had enhanced zzso activity, resulting in increased production of zzso and zzso by exposed zzso zzso was bound to zzso isolated from cells cultured with this zzso and zzso zzso incubated with zzso zzso acquired zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso to cell cultures blocked the zzso activity of zzso zzso from zzso cells, indicating that such activity was dependent on interaction with the zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso acquires zzso activity through binding to zzso zzso such as zzso
