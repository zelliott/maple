The aim of the study was to verify the hypothesis that the zzso zzso is implicated in zzso and novel drug resistance in multiple zzso 

We have evaluated the expression levels of zzso zzso and the activity of the novel selective zzso inhibitor zzso in multiple myeloma cells, either sensitive zzso and zzso or resistant zzso and zzso to zzso myeloma drugs, in primary plasma cells and in multiple myeloma zzso zzso 

We found that resistant zzso and zzso cells presented with higher zzso zzso thus leading to zzso zzso of zzso signaling zzso zzso cells exhibited a higher zzso to the zzso zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso zzso and to its zzso zzso zzso was able to zzso drug resistance in zzso zzso zzso but not zzso cells displayed zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso The zzso and zzso expression was higher on plasma cells from patients with multiple myeloma at zzso or on drug resistance than on those from patients at diagnosis, zzso zzso or from patients with zzso zzso of unknown zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso or paired bone zzso zzso cells of plasma cells from relapsed or resistant patients was markedly inhibited by zzso zzso zzso showed higher therapeutic activity in zzso than in zzso zzso In zzso tumors, it caused zzso and necrosis and reverted zzso zzso 

Our findings suggest that the zzso zzso is zzso activated in relapsed and resistant multiple myeloma where it may also be responsible for induction of drug resistance, thus providing the zzso rationale for targeting zzso in patients with zzso multiple zzso
