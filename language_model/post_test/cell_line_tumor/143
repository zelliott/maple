zzso of growth zzso 4 is a member of the ING family zzso It has been shown to play an important role in cell cycle, zzso and zzso but the molecular mechanism of zzso on tumor growth zzso has not yet been zzso The goal of this study is to investigate the zzso effects of zzso on zzso and its mechanism by zzso of zzso zzso into zzso zzso 

The effect and mechanisms of zzso on proliferation and zzso of zzso were evaluated in zzso by zzso zzso zzso analysis, zzso zzso Western zzso analysis and animal zzso 

The level of zzso was markedly reduced in zzso zzso and the extent of reduction correlated with the progression from lower to higher grades of zzso It was observed that zzso with zzso zzso gene presented with growth suppression, zzso enhancement and the deregulation of cell zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso has a potential role on the growth suppression and zzso enhancement in zzso zzso via the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and the hindrance of the cell cycle zzso The low expression and dysfunction of zzso might be correlated with the zzso and progression of zzso
