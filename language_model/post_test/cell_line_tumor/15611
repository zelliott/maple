The degradation of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso is crucial in zzso and pathological cell invasion zzso zzso occurs at specific sites where invasive cells make contact with the zzso via specialized plasma membrane zzso termed zzso zzso we show that the zzso 2 zzso a zzso implicated in the control of zzso zzso zzso events and membrane zzso is necessary for zzso zzso degradation at zzso zzso was inhibited by using two zzso 1) expression of dominant negative zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and 2) zzso of the zzso regulator zzso by zzso zzso In both cases, the number and extension of zzso degradation zzso were drastically zzso To understand the site and mechanism of zzso action, the cellular structures devoted to zzso degradation were analyzed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to be organized into a previously zzso zzso structure consisting of a large zzso of the zzso plasma membrane surface in close spatial relationship with the zzso zzso zzso seemed to be concentrated at zzso
