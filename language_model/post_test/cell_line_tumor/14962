zzso with platinum agents is the standard of care for zzso lung cancer zzso however, novel zzso agents like zzso have been approved for advanced zzso including zzso cases previously treated with zzso zzso Although these agents show zzso activity through distinct mechanisms and elicit positive initial responses, tumors invariably develop zzso Recent studies have revealed mechanisms by which both types of agents induce acquired zzso However, little is known about whether zzso treatment with either type of agent affects cancer cell zzso and development of resistance against subsequent treatment with the zzso Using in zzso drug-resistant zzso cell models, we provide evidence that acquired zzso resistance may reduce the sensitivity of cancer cells to subsequent treatment with a zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso treatment influenced the mechanism by which cancer cells developed resistance to subsequent treatment with a zzso zzso The influence of zzso on acquisition of resistance to a zzso agent was associated with zzso transition zzso zzso such as increased expression of zzso zzso zzso change, and zzso zzso zzso increased cell zzso Our findings indicate that the influence of zzso chemotherapy on zzso therapies and the involvement of zzso and zzso zzso should be considered when developing therapeutic strategies using zzso agents, especially in the context of sequential zzso
