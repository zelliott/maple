zzso conversion of the zzso zzso zzso is a frequent feature of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor receptors zzso In this study, we have studied zzso mechanism of action in zzso and zzso human zzso cell lines, carrying zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blunted zzso cell proliferation and zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso Single zzso zzso by zzso interference showed that zzso cells depended on zzso for zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso rescued proliferation of zzso cells under zzso treatment, showing that zzso is a key zzso target in these zzso zzso Upon zzso zzso adoptive stimulation of zzso partially rescued zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and expression of zzso zzso This suggests that simultaneous zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso may overcome the risk of zzso cells to escape from zzso blockade through zzso zzso of zzso
