We report here the zzso characterization of a novel zzso zzso zzso located on human zzso zzso zzso open reading frame zzso zzso codes for an approximately zzso protein zzso zzso acids zzso localized predominantly in the zzso and to a lesser extent in the zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso also was found in both the zzso and zzso zzso expression of zzso caused zzso cell death in three different cell lines as evidenced by enhanced zzso zzso DNA zzso or an enhanced number of cells in the zzso zzso In human prostate cancer cells zzso zzso DNA fragmentation was blocked efficiently by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso into zzso cells in the presence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 24 zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso expression correlated with the zzso of zzso and zzso An zzso deletion zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking a zzso domain zzso zzso zzso or zzso containing a zzso zzso domain zzso zzso failed to induce zzso whereas a zzso deletion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso retained the zzso activity comparable to the full-length zzso Finally, the treatment of zzso cells with zzso or hydrogen zzso zzso led to an increase in the zzso zzso zzso level of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso approximately zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso functions as a zzso zzso and suggest that zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso of cell zzso
