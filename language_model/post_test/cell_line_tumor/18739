In this study, we investigated the effects of exposure to an extremely low frequency magnetic field zzso on hormone zzso from an zzso derived zzso cell line, zzso We zzso zzso cells to zzso insulin under exposure to an zzso using our established system for the exposure of cultured cells to an zzso at 5 zzso and 60 zzso or under sham exposure conditions for 1 h and observed the zzso In the presence of a zzso concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso exposure to zzso significantly attenuated insulin release from zzso cells, compared to sham exposed zzso Treatment with zzso reduced the difference in insulin zzso between cells exposed to an zzso and sham exposed zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso associated protein of 25 zzso zzso and zzso 1, which play a role in zzso in hormone zzso and influx of calcium zzso decreased with exposure to an zzso in the presence of 45 zzso zzso These results suggest that exposure to zzso zzso insulin zzso from zzso cells by affecting calcium influx through calcium zzso
