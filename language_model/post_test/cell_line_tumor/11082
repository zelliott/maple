The zzso effect and mechanism of zzso coupled protein on gastric tumor was zzso The target cell zzso was treated with zzso zzso chemically or SEA respectively for 24 zzso 36 h or 72 zzso zzso cells served as zzso The zzso index of zzso against zzso cells was zzso In the mouse gastric cancer models zzso zzso zzso zzso SEA and normal saline was injected in experimental group, SEA group and control group zzso The occurrence and weight of tumor was zzso The results showed that the zzso index was significantly higher in the zzso zzso and SEA group zzso zzso than in zzso group zzso with the difference being significant zzso zzso zzso And there was significant difference between zzso group and SEA group zzso zzso zzso The tumor weight in zzso SEA and control groups was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso g and zzso zzso zzso g respectively with the difference being statistically significant between the zzso group, SEA group and the control group zzso zzso zzso In the zzso and SEA groups, there were zzso T and zzso T cell zzso but in the zzso group, no or few T zzso were seen in the mouse tumor zzso It was concluded that zzso was more effective to activate T zzso to kill the tumor cells than SEA used zzso It was feasibility by using the zzso zzso as carrier to perform the targeted zzso of zzso zzso
