zzso of zzso zzso and zzso is a common event in zzso tumors zzso suggesting the presence of zzso zzso The aim of this study was to identify the target genes residing in the minimally deleted regions on zzso zzso that might be involved in zzso A novel gene zzso zzso zzso zzso was found frequently zzso with 37 of 58 zzso zzso examined showing reduced expression compared with normal zzso zzso zzso loss and zzso modifications were the major mechanisms contributing to zzso zzso The role of zzso in zzso was also zzso zzso zzso had no effect on sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso and zzso but could induce zzso resistance in zzso cells harboring zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso 1 zzso exhibited significant zzso while zzso showed partial zzso in zzso cells after zzso treatment, suggesting that zzso of zzso genes contributed in part to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso the induced zzso zzso Moreover, our data suggested that zzso might function as a zzso zzso zzso these findings suggest that zzso deregulation may play a role in OT development and that zzso may possess the capacity to zzso zzso via regulation of zzso zzso zzso
