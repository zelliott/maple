zzso zzso and zzso are associated with many neurodegenerative diseases, including zzso zzso The cellular machinery for maintaining zzso includes molecular zzso that facilitate protein folding and reduce zzso zzso the protein folding capacity of cells through manipulation of zzso zzso has been shown to suppress zzso and zzso zzso toxicity in cells and zzso However, to date these promising findings have not been translated to zzso models of zzso To address this issue, we developed transgenic mice that zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and crossed them with the zzso mouse model of zzso zzso zzso of zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso and enhanced zzso Surprisingly, this was zzso through specific association with zzso zzso zzso zzso higher order zzso zzso zzso that decreased their ability to zzso further zzso This was dependent on zzso client binding ability, zzso interaction and functional zzso with zzso zzso these changes in zzso zzso zzso and zzso led to improved neurological performance in zzso zzso These data reveal that prevention of further zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is an additional level of quality control for late stage zzso zzso Furthermore, our findings represent an important proof of principle that zzso manipulation is a valid therapeutic approach for intervention in zzso zzso
