zzso emerged recently as a potential therapeutic target for zzso Since some zzso zzso such as Ewing's zzso show characteristics of neuroendocrine zzso we wondered whether zzso with zzso properties and/or zzso origin, such as zzso small cell lung cancer and melanoma, may express zzso zzso protein expression was surveyed in zzso small cell lung cancer and melanoma in human clinical specimens by zzso zzso and in human cell lines by flow zzso Side population cells were examined to determine whether cancer stem cells can express zzso zzso zzso cell lines were implanted in zzso mice and allowed to zzso The zzso tumors were zzso and tested for zzso expression by zzso In human clinical zzso vascular zzso zzso was observed in zzso small cell lung cancer and zzso zzso cell zzso was strongest in zzso weak in melanoma and rare in small cell lung zzso In human cell lines, zzso was detected in zzso cell lines, including cancer stem zzso side population zzso cells, but was absent in melanoma and was both rare and weak in small cell lung zzso Human zzso zzso tumors were found to be positive for zzso Our work suggests that zzso may be a suitable therapeutic target for zzso
