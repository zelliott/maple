Patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have an increased risk of developing rapidly progressive and zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso It is unclear why these SCC behave more aggressively than sporadic zzso zzso zzso zzso are a family of zzso that contribute to growth, invasion and zzso of zzso The role of zzso in zzso SCC is not zzso 

To investigate the expression of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso SCC in comparison with sporadic SCC and zzso zzso 

zzso analysis of 25 zzso zzso 61 sporadic SCC and 28 sporadic zzso of zzso disease was carried out using zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso 

zzso was detected in all zzso zzso in zzso cells within the invasive edge, where zzso and zzso were markedly diminished or zzso zzso expression was also observed in zzso of sporadic SCC and in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly stronger in zzso SCC than in sporadic zzso and was most abundant in poorly differentiated zzso zzso was detected in zzso cells in zzso of zzso SCC and in all sporadic zzso zzso zzso was detected in the inflammatory cells in all SCC zzso 

These results identify zzso and zzso as zzso zzso markers for SCC progression and as potential therapeutic targets in zzso zzso The pattern of zzso suggests that zzso may shed zzso and zzso from the SCC cell zzso
