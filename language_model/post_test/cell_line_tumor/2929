zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso has been identified in several human tumors and in patients with a variety of neurodegenerative zzso However, the function of zzso is zzso We show here that zzso increases the expression of zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso a key zzso for zzso zzso of zzso led to an increase in the zzso responsiveness in human zzso zzso induced zzso zzso through enhanced binding of zzso complexes to the zzso zzso zzso levels correlate zzso with zzso in cancer zzso The zzso of zzso zzso in pancreatic cancer cells markedly suppressed zzso expression and invasion in response to zzso while zzso of zzso restored zzso In zzso cells, the zzso increase in zzso responsiveness not only zzso zzso outgrowth but also protected the cells from zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our results show that zzso is a novel zzso regulator of zzso zzso and they also suggest that zzso zzso expression may play important roles in pancreatic cancer progression and zzso cell zzso
