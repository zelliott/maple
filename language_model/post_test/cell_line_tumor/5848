Regulatory T cells zzso are critical in maintaining immune tolerance and suppressing zzso The zzso factor zzso serves as a master switch that controls the development and function of zzso zzso expression is zzso regulated by DNA zzso and DNA zzso zzso zzso can induce zzso expression in zzso zzso T zzso We showed that zzso a major green tea zzso could act as a dietary zzso zzso and induced zzso and zzso expression in zzso zzso T cells at zzso relevant zzso in zzso We further showed that mice treated with zzso in zzso had significantly increased zzso zzso and numbers in zzso and zzso zzso and had inhibited T cell zzso zzso of zzso expression correlated with a zzso reduction in zzso expression and a decrease in global DNA zzso Our data suggested that zzso can induce zzso expression and increase zzso frequency via a novel zzso zzso While the zzso zzso effects of zzso was not as potent as zzso agents such as zzso the ability of dietary agents to target similar mechanisms offers opportunities for potentially sustained and longer-term zzso with lower zzso Our work provides the foundation for future studies to further examine and evaluate dietary strategies to zzso immune zzso
