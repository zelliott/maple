zzso an zzso binding protein involved in the zzso regulation of a wide spectrum of zzso has been demonstrated to be a zzso of zzso and tumor aggressiveness in several cancer zzso In this study, we investigated the role of zzso in the zzso and in the zzso induced by the widely used zzso drug zzso in human breast cancer cells zzso 

We showed that zzso acts in the early phase of cell response to zzso being induced to zzso into the zzso upon zzso zzso zzso levels diminished the zzso response to zzso zzso zzso was also correlated with the presence of zzso in the zzso zzso which was able to block zzso nuclear export, had zzso zzso effects with zzso on cell zzso The zzso activity of zzso was not due to zzso to an active form, as was previously zzso In in zzso selected zzso resistant zzso cells zzso zzso the zzso resistance zzso related zzso zzso we observed a significant zzso zzso that was paralleled by a corresponding zzso of zzso targets and by loss of zzso zzso Restoration of zzso expression in these cells zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso the zzso zzso 

The present study shows that zzso is necessary to elicit the zzso cell response to zzso and that restoration of zzso expression in resistant cells zzso them to the action of this drug, thereby identifying zzso as a key protein in zzso zzso
