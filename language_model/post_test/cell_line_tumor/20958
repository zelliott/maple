We investigated the difference in zzso expression between a zzso lung cancer cell line zzso and its parental counterpart zzso and the influence of zzso targeting zzso on the zzso of zzso zzso targeting zzso was zzso into zzso cells using a zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein expression were significantly higher in zzso than zzso zzso The median zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso in zzso against zzso cells were significantly lower in cells treated with zzso zzso than in control zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression were zzso using zzso V and Western zzso respectively, and showed a significant increase in zzso after treatment with the zzso agents plus specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells to both zzso and zzso Thus, zzso appears to participate in the zzso resistance mechanism of zzso cells and zzso targeting zzso has the potential to increase the sensitivity of drug-resistant cancer cells to zzso zzso
