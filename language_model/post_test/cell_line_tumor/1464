We investigated the zzso of eight vitamin zzso zzso zzso against zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso and normal cell lines zzso zzso vein zzso cells zzso and human zzso zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed especially potent zzso activities against zzso cells compared with normal zzso In a zzso zzso zzso experiment, zzso zzso characterized by cell zzso nuclear zzso and nuclear fragmentation were observed in zzso and zzso cells after 48 h of treatment with zzso M of zzso To clarify the molecular mechanisms of zzso induced by zzso we examined the expression of zzso related proteins using a zzso zzso zzso and western zzso zzso zzso zzso was remarkably increased by zzso compared with the control zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso at 24 zzso Moreover, zzso was induced by zzso at 48 zzso In addition, zzso arrested the cell cycle at the zzso phase in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso exhibited a selective zzso activity via zzso zzso
