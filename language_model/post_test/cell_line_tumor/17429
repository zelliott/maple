New types of selective zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and evaluated for their binding affinity and biological effect on zzso zzso A proposed lead structure zzso was zzso to provide compounds 30 and 44, which showed good zzso binding affinity zzso zzso zzso and 10 zzso respectively), as well as minimal impact on zzso and zzso zzso zzso Introduction of an zzso group in the core structure considerably enhanced zzso affinity of the compounds zzso zzso and zzso relationships of these compounds are zzso
