We report here the genetic engineering of zzso fluorescent cells with one color in the nucleus and the other in the zzso that enables real-time zzso dynamics to be zzso in living cells in zzso as well as in zzso To obtain the zzso cells, red fluorescent protein zzso was expressed in the zzso of zzso human zzso cells, and green fluorescent protein zzso linked to zzso zzso was expressed in the zzso Nuclear zzso expression enabled zzso of nuclear zzso whereas simultaneous zzso zzso expression enabled zzso of nuclear zzso ratios as well as simultaneous cell and nuclear shape zzso Thus, total cellular dynamics can be zzso in the living zzso cells in real zzso The parental zzso and the derived zzso clones had similar cell proliferation rates, suggesting that expression of zzso and/or zzso does not affect cell cycle zzso The cell cycle position of individual living cells was readily zzso by the zzso ratio and nuclear zzso zzso induction of zzso was observed by nuclear size changes and progressive nuclear zzso zzso cells were zzso by zzso imaging after injection in the mouse zzso Common carotid artery injection of zzso cells and a zzso skin zzso enabled the external zzso of the zzso cells in zzso in the mouse brain where extreme zzso of the cell body as well as the nucleus zzso zzso cells in various positions of the cell cycle were zzso in excised mouse lungs after zzso injection of the zzso zzso In the zzso the zzso cells were observed frequently zzso their zzso suggesting a potential novel form of zzso zzso The zzso cells thus are a useful tool for visualizing zzso dynamics in zzso as well as in zzso Drugs that could specifically zzso these processes can now be readily screened in real time in zzso
