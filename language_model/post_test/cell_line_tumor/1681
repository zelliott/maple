zzso zzso methods create significant opportunities to establish highly controlled cell positioning and arrangement for the zzso study of numerous cellular zzso and pathological zzso However, a simple, straightforward, zzso and zzso method for cell zzso is not yet well zzso In the present paper, we report a direct active zzso method using an integrated zzso device with zzso zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso dynamic zzso of cells, as well as for zzso cell zzso We designed and zzso zzso zzso zzso to replace the conventional fixed zzso for zzso zzso zzso dynamics and spatial consistency of the zzso were zzso characterized and zzso zzso Furthermore, we performed a systematic zzso investigation of the zzso zzso at a pressure range of 0 zzso to 20 zzso using three types of popularly applied zzso cells, zzso human lung zzso zzso cells, human zzso liver zzso zzso cells, and human breast zzso zzso zzso The cells were zzso trapped and controlled by the zzso zzso in a zzso and parallel manner, and could be zzso zzso The trapped cells with high viability were zzso protected by the real-time zzso of specifically designed zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso can be applied as an active zzso component for large-scale cell patterning and zzso which could be useful in many zzso tissue organization, zzso and zzso imaging and zzso
