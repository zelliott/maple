The goal of this study was to assess whether zzso zzso zzso are comparable to fluorescent marker imaging in measuring zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso 

zzso expression was zzso using both imaging methods in four cell zzso zzso human zzso zzso cells, which are known to have high zzso zzso two cell lines with lower zzso expression zzso human zzso zzso cells and zzso human zzso zzso zzso and zzso breast zzso cells, which do not express zzso To enhance contrast of the zzso zzso a zzso zzso system was used that includes a custom zzso light zzso 

zzso cells were clearly distinguished from control cells not bound to zzso in that they showed a significant increase in detected intensity under zzso zzso due to zzso zzso The average zzso intensity for zzso cells was zzso counts per cell compared with zzso for zzso cells, zzso for zzso cells, and zzso for zzso zzso The average zzso intensity for zzso cells was zzso counts per cell compared with zzso for zzso cells, zzso for zzso cells, and zzso for zzso zzso A plot of zzso intensity versus zzso intensity for all four cell lines showed that the data agree with a linear relationship given by the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso FL - zzso where zzso is the zzso intensity and FL is the zzso zzso The zzso of the data with the trend line was zzso zzso zzso The average peak wavelength of zzso scattering was zzso zzso for zzso cells, zzso zzso for zzso cells, and zzso zzso for zzso cells (with no clear zzso observed for zzso zzso This spectral trend shows that zzso scattering may reveal additional information about their zzso via zzso index zzso 

zzso zzso can zzso zzso expression with performance comparable to zzso markers and show promise to better characterize zzso expression via their zzso index zzso
