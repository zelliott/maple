zzso is one of zzso zzso proteins in all zzso zzso modification of protein contributes to fine regulation of cellular biological zzso Using large-scale screening of human bone zzso zzso cell zzso zzso library, we isolated a full-length zzso of zzso zzso zzso 380 zzso acids with a zzso domain zzso which was designed as bone zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso In addition to zzso domain at its zzso zzso also possesses a zzso domain at its zzso sharing moderate zzso to some zzso proteins such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso as confirmed by blast search in human zzso zzso zzso is widely expressed in human multiple zzso and various tumor cell zzso Moreover, zzso zzso decreased in zzso zzso with zzso and increased in zzso cells zzso with zzso suggesting that zzso might play roles in regulation of zzso function or cell differentiation through an zzso and zzso zzso
