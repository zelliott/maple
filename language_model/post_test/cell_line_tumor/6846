The activity and stability of the zzso tumor zzso are regulated by the human zzso of the mouse double minute 2 zzso zzso It has been hypothesized that small molecules zzso the zzso complex would allow for the zzso of zzso and result in growth zzso We have identified zzso zzso of the zzso interaction using our proprietary zzso zzso zzso zzso chemistry and zzso drug design led to the development of an zzso series of zzso including zzso and zzso zzso were dependent on the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso as determined by lack of potency in zzso or zzso zzso cell lines or cells engineered to no longer express zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso zzso cell lines with average zzso of 14 and zzso zzso zzso These results correlated with the direct cellular zzso of zzso from zzso zzso observed within 15 minutes in zzso zzso zzso Additional activities of these zzso in zzso include stabilization of zzso protein levels, zzso of zzso target genes in a DNA zzso manner, and induction of zzso in zzso zzso Administration of zzso to mice led to an increase in zzso levels in liver zzso Finally, zzso zzso with zzso both in culture and in an zzso zzso model to decrease tumor zzso Taken together, these data support the potential utility of zzso zzso of the zzso interaction for the treatment of zzso zzso zzso
