To develop zzso zzso that bind to the inactive zzso zzso we conducted zzso drug design using the X-ray zzso structures of zzso starting from an zzso zzso We designed various zzso zzso scaffolds zzso A, zzso possessing an zzso group that forms two hydrogen bond interactions with zzso zzso the zzso of this zzso and the nitrogen atom on the zzso ring of the scaffold was critical for enhancing zzso zzso The selected zzso zzso zzso showed potent zzso activity in both zzso and zzso Solid zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso its oral zzso in rats and showed significant suppression of zzso zzso in an zzso melanoma zzso model in rats by single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso repetitive studies at a dose of 50 zzso in rats confirmed that zzso is a promising zzso inhibitor showing potent zzso zzso
