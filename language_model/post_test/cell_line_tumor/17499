To develop a tumor DNA vaccine zzso a fusion protein of zzso zzso and zzso and to study its ability to induce specific zzso response and its protective effect against zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso gene was cloned from total zzso of zzso cells by zzso A DNA vaccine was constructed by fusion zzso zzso gene and zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso The DNA vaccine was identified by restriction zzso analysis, sequencing and zzso zzso zzso was developed by stable zzso of zzso cells with zzso The frequency of cells producing zzso in zzso harvested from the zzso mice was measured by zzso Mice zzso with DNA vaccine were zzso with zzso zzso cells in back to observe the protective effect of zzso on zzso On the other hand, blood samples were collected from the zzso mice to check the functions of liver and zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned from total zzso of zzso cells by zzso The DNA vaccine zzso a fusion protein of zzso was constructed and confirmed by restriction zzso analysis, sequencing and zzso The expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso The zzso results showed that the number of zzso cells in zzso group was significantly higher than that in zzso zzso and PBS zzso The tumor volume in zzso group was significantly smaller than that in zzso zzso and PBS group, zzso The zzso and kidney functions in each group were not zzso 

zzso DNA vaccine can stimulate potent specific zzso responses and has distinctive zzso effect on zzso zzso The vaccine has no impact on the function of mouse liver and zzso
