Human zzso zzso cells might play an important role during the zzso rejection by producing zzso in response to zzso zzso such as tumor necrosis factor zzso and zzso zzso produced by zzso and zzso cells early after zzso The production of zzso allows inflammatory cells to be drawn into the kidney graft and therefore plays a critical role in the zzso processes that lead to the rejection of zzso zzso In this process, two zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso are the most zzso The zzso zzso target mainly zzso and T zzso while most of the zzso zzso attract zzso We showed in our study that in zzso in zzso cells, zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that attract zzso was zzso and expression of these genes and zzso release were increased in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Most of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 1 beta zzso regulated upon zzso normal T cell expressed and zzso zzso and zzso inflammatory protein zzso showed zzso zzso expression only after stimulation with zzso zzso and not in control zzso zzso seems to induce preferably the expression of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso Alpha zzso zzso while zzso zzso mainly zzso and zzso zzso zzso 78 zzso
