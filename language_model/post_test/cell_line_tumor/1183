In this study, we demonstrate a correlation between T zzso expression on a panel of human zzso cell lines and their sensitivity to zzso zzso cell zzso Specifically, the more T zzso is zzso the more sensitive the cancer cells are to zzso zzso cell zzso Furthermore, this correlation also exists for these cells and their ability to induce tumors in zzso In this zzso animal model, the less T zzso is zzso the more prolific the tumor growth in zzso and vice zzso Using the human zzso zzso cell line zzso we used limiting dilution to clone 2 populations of cells, one expressing high and the other low levels of T zzso clones 143 and 111, zzso In these cloned cells, the clone that expressed more T zzso was more zzso in zzso and zzso induced tumor growth in zzso zzso the clone that expressed less T zzso clone was more zzso in zzso and grew more prolific tumors in zzso Using soluble T zzso in a competitive zzso zzso there was a decrease in zzso zzso cell killing of the T zzso human cell line Colo zzso Taken together, these findings suggest a novel role for T zzso in the zzso cell recognition of cancer cells, specifically as markers for zzso sensitivity in zzso cell zzso The significance of T zzso as targets for zzso zzso zzso is novel and identifies zzso zzso zzso interactions as potentially significant in the zzso of cancer and its associated zzso
