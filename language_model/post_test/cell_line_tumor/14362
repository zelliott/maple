In a recent evaluation by comparative zzso zzso we demonstrated zzso zzso to be frequently deleted in zzso of the zzso zzso This suggests the presence of a tumor zzso gene in the deleted zzso In the present study, we have performed a detailed loss of zzso analysis in 34 zzso junction zzso and 1 zzso zzso Barrett's zzso sample with 37 zzso zzso zzso Thirty-five markers are in the zzso region with a mean distance of 800 zzso base zzso Of 34 tumor samples, 14 zzso showed loss of zzso zzso We identified a minimal region of zzso loss of zzso base pairs between markers zzso and zzso at zzso location zzso Within this region, markers zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed loss in all zzso tumors with zzso zzso The region between markers zzso and zzso contains 7 known zzso The identification of this minimal deletion and the data base information on the genes present in this region facilitate the search for the candidate tumor zzso zzso
