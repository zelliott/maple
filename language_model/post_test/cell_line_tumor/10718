Human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso is zzso in zzso of breast zzso Increased zzso expression is an adverse zzso factor and zzso with decreased patient zzso zzso zzso breast cancer is treated with zzso Unfortunately, some patients are zzso zzso to therapy, and many who do respond initially become resistant within 1 zzso zzso the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso signaling and zzso resistance is essential to reduce breast cancer zzso zzso is a zzso expressed scaffold protein that contains multiple protein interaction zzso By regulating its binding partners zzso zzso signaling zzso several of which contribute to breast zzso We show here that zzso is zzso in zzso breast cancer tissue and binds directly to zzso zzso of zzso decreases zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso effects that are all reversed by zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and blocking this increase zzso the growth zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso in zzso breast zzso cells, and reducing zzso both zzso the zzso effects of zzso and restores zzso sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso function may represent a rational strategy for treating zzso breast zzso
