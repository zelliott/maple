Loss of zzso in breast cancer zzso with poor zzso increased recurrence rates, and higher zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso of which is associated with more invasive zzso is observed in zzso cell lines and invasive breast zzso Here, we are showing that zzso zzso can reverse zzso to zzso transition zzso which is considered to be a first step in the process of zzso zzso zzso breast cancer cells such as zzso and zzso show a zzso zzso characterized by loss of zzso expression and higher expression of zzso markers such as zzso and zzso along with zzso zzso such as twist and zzso When zzso and zzso cells or tumors were treated with zzso zzso zzso was increased along with reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that treatment of zzso and zzso cells increased the zzso of zzso promoter by reducing the association of twist and snail with the zzso promoter and zzso both the snail and zzso zzso also inhibited cell migration in zzso In addition, zzso of zzso was increased, as well as zzso of zzso zzso zzso treatment also reduced formation of zzso zzso which help floating cells attach to other zzso These findings suggest that zzso can reverse zzso and may reduce the formation of zzso
