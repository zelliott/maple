To examine the ability of zzso to suppress growth and regulate zzso activity in the human zzso leukemia cell line zzso 

Cell proliferation was assessed after exposure to zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell cycle progression and zzso were determined by flow zzso The proteins important for cell cycle progression and zzso target of zzso signaling cascade were assessed by Western zzso zzso activity was zzso by zzso repeat zzso protocol zzso The human zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso levels were determined by zzso zzso 

zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso induced zzso phase arrest, zzso the protein level of zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso but had no effect on zzso Treatment with zzso reduced zzso activity, and reduced zzso zzso and protein zzso 

zzso displayed a potent zzso effect in the human zzso leukemia cell line by zzso of cell proliferation through zzso cell cycle arrest and also through the suppression of zzso activity, suggesting that zzso may have potential clinical implications in the treatment of some zzso
