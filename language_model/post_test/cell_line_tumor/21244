zzso evidence suggests that zzso stress resulting in zzso oxygen species generation plays a pivotal role in neurodegenerative diseases, supporting the realization of the use of radical zzso metal zzso agents, such as the natural zzso for zzso In this study, we have focused on specific identification of proteins involved in the zzso activity of the green tea zzso zzso zzso in a progressive model of zzso death, induced by long-term serum deprivation of human zzso zzso zzso The study was designed in attempt to define zzso for the mechanism of action of zzso associated with its iron zzso properties and its ability to regulate zzso energy balance and affect cell zzso By using mass zzso analysis combined with gene expression technique, we have succeeded to identify such genes and proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso F1 complex zzso protein zzso C zzso nerve vascular growth factor zzso precursor and zzso zzso zzso zzso These results strengthen the notion that the diverse molecular signaling pathways participating in the zzso activity of zzso render this zzso compound as potential agent to reduce risk of various neurodegenerative zzso
