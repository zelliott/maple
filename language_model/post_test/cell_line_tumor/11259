The zzso zzso zzso is known to be active in Barrett's zzso zzso we evaluated the efficacy and underlying mechanisms of zzso of cancer cell growth by the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cell zzso Cell proliferation and zzso were evaluated by flow zzso Western zzso zzso and quantitative reverse zzso zzso chain zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso led to reduced zzso zzso activity, resulting in decreased cell proliferation and induction of zzso via the intrinsic zzso in the zzso cancer zzso In conclusion, the zzso zzso may have application as an zzso zzso zzso
