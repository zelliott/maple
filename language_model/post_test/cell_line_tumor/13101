zzso zzso of cells damages not only the zzso cells but also zzso bystander zzso It has been proposed that the bystander effect is caused by zzso and free zzso generated by the zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso protects against cell damage caused by zzso and free zzso Using a novel experimental system that allows zzso of zzso of a human zzso zzso leaving zzso as bystander cells, we investigated the influence of zzso stress and the zzso effects of zzso during zzso zzso The results showed an increase in cell death in both zzso cells and bystander zzso A significant increase in zzso zzso markers and expression of the stress response genes zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso and zzso were zzso zzso of zzso reduced the amount of dead cells and inhibited zzso formation of zzso zzso and zzso of stress response zzso The results emphasize the role of zzso stress in promoting bystander zzso Furthermore, the results suggest that zzso protects zzso cells by eliminating zzso and free zzso generated by radiation and imply that zzso can be used in radiation therapy of tumors to minimize damage to surrounding zzso
