To better understand the molecular basis of zzso zzso zzso we performed global gene expression profiling of rat zzso tumors induced by the zzso alpha zzso zzso and the expression profiles were compared with those of normal zzso zzso The expressions of 72 genes were significantly zzso expressed in the tumors related to zzso These included genes involved in the cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso processes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso function zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso changes of several genes were validated by quantitative real-time zzso zzso zzso all of the identified genes involved in the zzso signaling zzso were known or proposed to be negative regulators of this zzso and were zzso in the tumors, suggesting the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso By using zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso signaling zzso in the tumors was confirmed by observing nuclear and/or zzso zzso of zzso and a decrease in its inactive zzso zzso Furthermore, we found a significant reduction in the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein in the tumors relative to zzso Taken together, these findings provide new insights into the molecular basis of zzso zzso
