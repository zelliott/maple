The effects of zzso pesticides on human zzso remain poorly investigated although an increased risk of pregnancy zzso has been reported in women chronically exposed to these zzso Here, we have addressed whether zzso zzso zzso the expression of genes relevant for zzso zzso Human zzso zzso cells were exposed to increasing zzso zzso up to 100 zzso for 24 and 48 h and cell zzso zzso protein and hormone levels were zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso increased the expression of zzso zzso and, even more significantly, zzso zzso in conditions where cell viability and zzso were not zzso In addition, zzso protein synthesis and zzso were zzso zzso Present results may reflect a zzso zzso effect on zzso cells or a zzso mechanism to preserve its zzso These novel zzso zzso target genes should be considered in future studies of pregnancy outcomes associated with in zzso zzso
