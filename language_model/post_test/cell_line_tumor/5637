Cancer cell characteristics may play a pivotal role in the response to therapy by zzso or zzso different molecular zzso In the present study, we investigated the implication of breast cancer cell features, such as zzso and zzso in the zzso of zzso upon exposure to zzso zzso zzso is among the most important cancer zzso zzso to tumor cells unlimited zzso capacity, increased survival potential and resistance to several types of cellular zzso We investigated possible mechanisms regulating zzso in six zzso breast cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso differing in their zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was evaluated by real-time zzso and zzso activity by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein levels were evaluated by Western zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was achieved by small interfering zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to evaluate zzso zzso zzso status, as well as zzso and zzso zzso factors interaction with the zzso zzso Our results showed for the first time, that only zzso cells, independently of their zzso status, zzso zzso while zzso of zzso increased zzso zzso of zzso also led to increased zzso and zzso of zzso We also demonstrated that zzso and zzso regulate zzso expression in all zzso breast cancer zzso We zzso for the first time, that zzso zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso and zzso zzso to breast cancer zzso
