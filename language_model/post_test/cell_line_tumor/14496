A specific contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging zzso is crucial to brain tumor patients for the surgical operation or the zzso zzso This study explored zzso zzso iron oxide zzso zzso as an zzso contrast agent for the detection of brain zzso in zzso The zzso diameter of about 75 zzso zzso zzso of 51 zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso suggested its zzso for zzso Using a rat model of zzso zzso zzso provided a better picture or more sensitivity to depict brain zzso on MR images than that of zzso zzso enhanced zzso images of brain zzso were documented in zzso with zzso until 48 h after zzso Moreover, zzso were clearly observed around vascular region of the tumor slices after 48 zzso High level expression of zzso receptors was confirmed in brain tumor zzso by zzso and Western zzso compared to normal brain zzso These findings suggested that zzso could be potentially employed as a sensitive and specific zzso contrast agent in the diagnosis of brain zzso
