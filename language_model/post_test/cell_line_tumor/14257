To investigate the effect of zzso an zzso zzso zzso type IV zzso on the development of pulmonary zzso induced by zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was used to detect the zzso of 72,000 and zzso type IV zzso in zzso cells and the activity of these zzso in zzso Experimental pulmonary zzso was induced by zzso administration of zzso in zzso zzso Total lung collagen content was determined by zzso zzso The zzso changes of pulmonary zzso were evaluated by image zzso 

The zzso of 72,000 and zzso type IV zzso in zzso cell was markedly inhibited by zzso at zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The activity of type IV zzso in zzso was also suppressed by zzso The zzso level in the lung was decreased in mice treated with zzso at the dose of 100 zzso down to zzso of that of the zzso model zzso As shown by image analysis, the zzso of zzso zzso the thickness of zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso cells were decreased in zzso treated group in comparison with zzso model zzso 

This study provides evidence that zzso shows zzso effect on zzso induced pulmonary zzso
