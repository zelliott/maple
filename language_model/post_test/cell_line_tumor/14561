We previously demonstrated, using the zzso cell line zzso as an experimental model, that the zzso zzso zzso of the truncated protein zzso zzso the proliferation of these cells in zzso as well as tumor growth and zzso in zzso This study focused on identifying the underlying mechanisms for the observed zzso zzso The present study demonstrated that zzso induced the zzso cascade resulting in a strong expression of the zzso protein zzso leading to tumor cell zzso as demonstrated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso abolished zzso induced zzso Moreover, zzso increased the expression of the death zzso zzso and enhanced zzso cells sensitivity in zzso to TRAIL a zzso zzso with subsequent zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso also enhanced zzso zzso In zzso the combination of zzso and radiation therapy resulted in a striking zzso zzso of the growth of zzso zzso resulting from the potent effect on tumor zzso and tumor cell zzso as determined by zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicated that the inhibitor zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso
