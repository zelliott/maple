zzso zzso zzso and its natural tissue zzso of zzso zzso are involved in cancer zzso This study was undertaken to determine the effects of zzso of zzso on human zzso zzso zzso cell growth, zzso and zzso 

zzso the efficient zzso system, zzso zzso zzso containing full-length zzso of zzso was generated by zzso zzso and amplified in zzso zzso Then, human zzso cell line zzso underwent gene zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and protein expressions of zzso were detected with zzso and Western zzso zzso The zzso was observed with a transmission electron microscope and the proliferation of zzso cells was determined by zzso zzso and growth zzso The potential of in zzso invasion was measured with zzso zzso 

The resulting zzso and zzso cells were generated and the expression of zzso was detected in zzso The cell proliferation zzso and zzso zzso showed zzso zzso growth, and proliferation were obviously zzso The invasion across zzso filters was significantly decreased compared with zzso The suppression rate of zzso cells with zzso zzso was zzso and zzso zzso inhibited by more than zzso of the invasion into the zzso filter ( zzso 

zzso zzso results in the suppression of zzso and invasive potential of zzso cells in zzso This study demonstrates the potential role of zzso as a target for liver cancer gene therapy and has laid a foundation for further study on its zzso zzso
