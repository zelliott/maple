The combination of synthetic zzso and DNA has provided zzso chemists and materials scientists with a fascinating new hybrid zzso The challenges in preparing these molecular zzso were overcome by different synthetic strategies that rely on zzso the zzso acid zzso and the organic zzso in solution or on solid zzso The zzso and functions of the zzso block zzso can be controlled by the nature of the synthetic zzso segment as well as by the sequence composition and length of the zzso Recent developments have expanded the scope and applications of these hybrid materials in a number of different areas including biology and medicine, as well as zzso and zzso Their usage ranges from gene delivery through to DNA detection to zzso zzso for zzso organic zzso
