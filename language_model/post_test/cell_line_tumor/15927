Type I zzso zzso zzso and type II zzso zzso have zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both types of zzso signal through the zzso zzso to elicit zzso activity, yet zzso is thought to do so only through zzso zzso whereas type I zzso activate both zzso and zzso complexes such as zzso gene factor zzso In this study, we show that zzso gene factor 3 containing zzso zzso zzso also plays a role in zzso zzso activity in zzso Using zzso zzso as a marker for zzso zzso Western zzso analysis of zzso human zzso cells revealed that zzso zzso levels peaked at 1 zzso decreased by 6 zzso and remained at low levels for up to 48 zzso zzso treated with zzso showed a zzso zzso response with an early peak at 1-2 h and a second peak at zzso zzso Gene expression zzso following zzso treatment for 24 h indicated an induction of zzso genes that are induced by zzso gene factor 3 and associated with a type I zzso zzso zzso of these genes by zzso type I and type III zzso signaling was ruled out using zzso zzso to these zzso in biological zzso and by quantitative zzso Despite the absence of zzso zzso zzso treatment induced formation of zzso This novel zzso factor complex binds to zzso response element promoter zzso as shown by zzso zzso analysis of the protein zzso R zzso zzso and zzso regulatory factor 9 zzso in zzso cells reversed zzso zzso response element induction and zzso activity, implicating zzso formation as a significant component of the cellular response and biological activity of zzso
