To develop and validate an optical imaging zzso for the discrimination of zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso tumors from surrounding normal zzso that also expresses zzso 

zzso zzso quantum dots zzso were coupled to zzso using zzso zzso to create zzso zzso In zzso binding affinity of these zzso and zzso zzso was evaluated in a panel of cell lines, with and without zzso zzso zzso zzso optical imaging of zzso zzso tumors was done after systemic injection of zzso and zzso 

zzso showed zzso binding in zzso In zzso imaging showed three distinct zzso tumor influx ( approximately 3 zzso clearance ( approximately 60 zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso showed comparable zzso rapid tumor influx and clearance followed by zzso of an apparent dynamic equilibrium at approximately 60 zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso concentration gradually decreased in tumors, zzso progressively accumulated in zzso On delayed imaging at 24 zzso tumor zzso decreased to zzso levels for both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso fluorescence, tissue zzso fluorescence, and zzso microscopic analyses confirmed zzso zzso of zzso at 4 zzso zzso images showed diffuse zzso of zzso zzso within zzso tumor zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso of zzso 

These results represent the first zzso characterization of a robust zzso imaging zzso The measurable contrast enhancement of tumors 4 h after systemic administration of zzso and its subsequent zzso at 24 h imply that this zzso may permit quantifiable and repetitive imaging of zzso zzso
