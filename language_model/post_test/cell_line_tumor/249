We compared the protein expression pattern of zzso breast zzso zzso zzso zzso versus those being positive for zzso and negative for the hormone receptors zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and mass zzso We obtained differential expression patterns for several zzso zzso (as for example zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 8, 9, 14, 17, zzso further structure proteins zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and members of the zzso zzso Western zzso analysis and zzso were conducted to verify the zzso The identified marker proteins may advance a more detailed characterization of zzso breast zzso and may contribute to the development of better treatment zzso
