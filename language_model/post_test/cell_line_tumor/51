zzso zzso involves the growing of a zzso zzso zzso next to the zzso end of each pre-existing zzso zzso zzso The molecular mechanisms that regulate zzso zzso remain zzso We show here that expression of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso is carefully regulated during the cell cycle, with the protein being zzso in late zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso duplication, whereas excess zzso induced the formation of zzso zzso structures zzso which contain stable zzso and several zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that these structures are similar to zzso with zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso that does not bind to zzso zzso significantly inhibited the formation of zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso is a new regulator of zzso length and its intrinsic zzso binding activity is required for zzso zzso
