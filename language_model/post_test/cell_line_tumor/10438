To investigate the expression and regulation of zzso zzso zzso in prostate cancer cells from zzso dependent to zzso zzso 

zzso cells were cultured in zzso serum for 6 months to establish zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso by cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso and protein was analyzed by zzso and Western zzso zzso signaling zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso were used to investigate effects of zzso and zzso zzso on zzso expression in zzso 

zzso exhibit enhanced proliferation and zzso zzso expression compared with zzso During zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in a short early stage and then declined to a stable level in zzso compared with zzso but zzso protein kept in downward zzso The zzso and protein expression of zzso was decreased by zzso zzso zzso protein but not zzso was increased by zzso zzso 

The zzso independent prostate cancer cell line was established by zzso zzso in which the protein expression of zzso was dramatically zzso zzso and protein expression of zzso in zzso was related to zzso signaling zzso and zzso zzso Increased zzso signaling or decreased zzso pathways contribute the decreased zzso protein zzso
