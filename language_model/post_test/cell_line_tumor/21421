To study the influence of zzso zzso of zzso expression on the biological behavior of zzso zzso 

Three pairs of 21 zzso reverse repeated motifs of zzso target sequence with 9 zzso were zzso and inserted into zzso zzso zzso zzso to generate zzso zzso expression zzso After stable zzso into zzso cells, cell growth, zzso cell cycles and plate clone forming efficiency were zzso Expressions of zzso zzso was monitored by the reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso The protein expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected by zzso 

Two zzso expression plasmids with significant zzso specific zzso to the zzso gene were zzso Compared with control cells, zzso cells zzso with the zzso showed zzso phase delay zzso zzso zzso and cell number decrease in the S phase zzso zzso zzso along with an increased zzso rate zzso zzso zzso significant increase of zzso expression and decreased zzso expression zzso or zzso The protein expressions of zzso was higher and zzso was lower than those of the control zzso However, the wild type zzso protein expression was not zzso by zzso zzso 

An altered expression of zzso may be related to the proliferation of zzso zzso through cell cycle regulation involving an altered zzso zzso that may be zzso zzso
