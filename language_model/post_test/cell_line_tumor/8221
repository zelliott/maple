zzso zzso zzso is a zzso factor that belongs to the family of zzso proteins that have essential roles in zzso Indeed, zzso is considered as a zzso gene in different zzso such as zzso zzso or breast zzso zzso Moreover, zzso also zzso in the control of colon and breast cancer cells sensitivity towards zzso zzso Despite its potential interest, very few data are available regarding the roles of zzso in pancreatic zzso 

We have developed a stable pancreatic zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso of zzso were studied in terms of in zzso cell growth, gene zzso migration capacity and zzso 

In zzso zzso growth of zzso cells zzso zzso was significantly decreased by comparison to control zzso An altered expression pattern of cell zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was observed in zzso clones by zzso and western zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso analysis indicated that zzso zzso zzso protein levels by direct binding to and zzso of its zzso Moreover, zzso zzso increased the zzso of zzso cells to low doses of zzso and reduced their in zzso migration zzso 

Our data suggested that zzso zzso could be exploited to decrease in zzso zzso growth of pancreatic cancer cells and to increase their sensitivity to zzso
