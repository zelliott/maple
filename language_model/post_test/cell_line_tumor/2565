The human zzso zzso zzso was shown to regulate many proteins involved in the cell cycle, as well as tumor zzso and zzso Thus, zzso offers a promising, strategic target for cancer zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso protein profiling in living systems, we identified zzso zzso of zzso and demonstrated zzso inhibitor occupancy and selectivity in cancer cell zzso These compounds bind zzso in the active site through a zzso zzso In cancer cells, these zzso zzso were shown to regulate the level of several zzso zzso and thus zzso the zzso zzso zzso that leads to zzso arrest in colon cancer zzso The data presented in this report provide proof of principle that zzso zzso may be a valuable therapeutic for zzso In addition, the discovery of such molecules offers interesting tools for studying zzso
