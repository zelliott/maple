zzso zzso is the zzso cause of zzso infection in the United zzso We characterized the abilities of 21 clinical zzso to form zzso to adhere to zzso and organic surfaces, including stainless steel and human zzso zzso and to zzso The composition of culture media had a significant effect on spore formation, as significantly more spores were produced in brain heart infusion broth zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The spore surface relative zzso zzso varied markedly zzso to zzso and was correlated with the ability to adhere to stainless zzso We observed no correlation between the zzso and the ability to adhere to zzso When the binding of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso spores to human gut zzso cells at different stages of cell development was zzso zzso spores zzso more zzso suggesting the presence of surface properties that aid attachment to human zzso zzso zzso studies revealed the presence of an zzso surrounding zzso spores that was absent from spores of zzso Finally, the ability of spores to zzso was found to be strain and medium zzso While the significance of these findings to the disease process has yet to be determined, this study has highlighted the importance of analyzing multiple zzso when attempting to characterize the behavior of a bacterial zzso
