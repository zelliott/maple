zzso is a member of a zzso of zzso zzso proteins that possess zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein gamma zzso zzso in addition to the hallmark zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso regulate zzso G protein signaling by virtue of the zzso protein activity of their zzso zzso zzso exists in multiple zzso forms with a long zzso or short zzso N zzso a complete or incomplete zzso domain, in combination with various zzso zzso Green fluorescent zzso zzso and zzso forms exhibit predominantly zzso and nuclear patterns of distribution in zzso cells, respectively, and traffic from these sites to zzso in response to stress zzso We undertook a zzso zzso screen for nuclear zzso proteins and here identify zzso as an zzso zzso zzso is a component of the zzso complex involved in repression of newly zzso zzso The zzso of interaction were mapped to the zzso region of the zzso domain of zzso a region distinct from its zzso binding region, and the zzso domain of zzso zzso and zzso did not compete for each other's interaction with zzso zzso studies in zzso cells showed that zzso and zzso but not zzso deletion zzso lacking a zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso in a zzso zzso A zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso from mouse zzso zzso of zzso with zzso promoted nuclear migration of zzso and its zzso with zzso a response not observed with zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso is the first member of the zzso protein family shown to interact with proteins involved in zzso zzso
