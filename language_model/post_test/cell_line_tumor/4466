The zzso of zzso resistance zzso plays a critically important role in the success of zzso The aim of this work is to investigate the effectiveness and possible mechanisms of the reversal of zzso zzso in human breast cancer cells by using zzso complexes zzso assisted by ultrasound zzso zzso is zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso to the surface of zzso zzso via the zzso zzso The resulting zzso complexes are then characterized and incubated with zzso human breast cancer cells and followed by US zzso Our results show the more rapid cellular zzso evident enhancement of nuclear zzso and less drug zzso in the resistant cells treated by zzso than those treated by zzso zzso under the same US treatment or zzso without zzso The enhanced drug delivery and cellular zzso also associated with the increase of zzso against zzso cells, lower zzso cell viability and higher zzso zzso zzso investigations further disclose a significant increase of zzso oxygen species zzso level, enhanced DNA damage and obvious reduction of zzso expression in the resistant cells treated with zzso compared with the control cases of cells treated by zzso zzso or zzso In conclusion, our study demonstrates that zzso in combination with US may provide an effective delivery of drug to sensitize cells to circumvent zzso and to enhance the therapeutic index of the zzso
