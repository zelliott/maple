zzso zzso studies using zzso zzso affinity tags zzso in concert with tandem mass zzso zzso permit unbiased comparisons between biologically distinct zzso We sought to determine the zzso characteristics of zzso studies by examining the cumulative results of zzso separate zzso experiments involving human zzso zzso We found that the number of identified proteins increased with larger numbers of zzso zzso The majority of proteins were identified by single zzso Only 24 to zzso of the peptides contained zzso zzso but zzso of the zzso peptides yielded zzso zzso zzso zzso of all identified proteins yielded zzso data, with 57% of these being zzso expressed by at least zzso The zzso ratios of peptides for proteins with multiple zzso peptides were zzso in trend in zzso of zzso zzso peptides identified proteins in all zzso compartments without significant zzso Analysis of the zzso fraction did not increase the number of peptides identified per zzso Our studies indicate that zzso yields zzso primarily based on single zzso and analysis of zzso peptides does not contribute zzso to the zzso Nevertheless, identifications based on single zzso peptides with zzso ends provide sufficiently reliable protein identifications and zzso information in zzso zzso zzso
