zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso in various cancer cells with little or no effect on normal zzso zzso zzso is a potential zzso chemical agent now in clinical trail phase II, though its molecular mechanism remains poorly zzso In the present study, we report that zzso can promote TRAIL killing activity in the zzso cell line zzso in zzso and zzso manner when jointly used in zzso We showed that the expression of death zzso zzso but not zzso was zzso and the decoy zzso zzso was zzso in the cells treated with zzso and the zzso soluble TRAIL zzso zzso zzso Further experiments demonstrated that zzso inhibitor zzso prevented the cells from zzso induced by zzso with zzso and zzso for 6 zzso however, zzso occurred in the cells cultured for 24 zzso suggesting that zzso induce a zzso and zzso signaling zzso in the zzso zzso This phenomenon was confirmed by zzso analysis of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso oxygen zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso activity test showed that zzso was inhibited in the zzso cells during zzso Our results provided evidence for the first time that zzso zzso the human zzso cells zzso to zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso activity, and signaling by the zzso and zzso zzso
