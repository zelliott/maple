A zzso zzso for the detection of zzso zzso in cancer cells using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a label, has been zzso zzso are small zzso found in plants, animals, and humans that perform key functions in gene zzso and affect zzso cell development, cell zzso and cell zzso zzso are considered useful early diagnostic and zzso markers of cancer, candidates for therapeutic intervention, and targets for basic biomedical zzso However, methods for highly sensitive and rapid detection of zzso directly from samples such as cells that can serve as a suitable zzso platform are zzso In that regard, the zzso of the zzso label, zzso that offers the advantage of high zzso ratio, allows for the development of highly sensitive zzso for the determination of zzso in a variety of zzso In this paper, we have described the development of a competitive zzso zzso zzso for the detection of zzso using the free zzso and zzso zzso that competes to bind to an immobilized zzso complementary zzso The zzso zzso chosen for this study is of biomedical significance because its levels are elevated in a variety of zzso Using the zzso zzso a detection limit of 1 zzso was zzso The zzso was employed for the detection of zzso in human breast zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso The comparison of zzso expression level in two cell lines demonstrated higher expression of zzso in breast cancer cell line zzso compared to the zzso zzso zzso Further, using the zzso developed, the zzso zzso could be performed directly in cell zzso The zzso zzso was developed in a zzso format with a total zzso time of zzso h and without the need for sample zzso zzso The need for early molecular markers and their detection methods in cancer diagnosis is zzso The characteristics of the zzso developed in this work show its suitability for early cancer diagnosis based on zzso as a zzso
