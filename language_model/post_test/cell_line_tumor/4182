Transition protein 2 zzso zzso in removing zzso and the initial zzso of zzso nucleus during zzso This study investigated the relationship between the zzso of the bovine zzso gene and the zzso quality traits of Chinese zzso zzso We detected three single zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene in zzso Chinese zzso bulls, zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), zzso zzso zzso 1), and zzso zzso zzso Association analysis showed that the zzso quality traits of the Chinese zzso bulls was significantly affected by the three zzso The bulls with the zzso combinations zzso zzso and zzso had higher initial zzso zzso than those with the zzso and zzso zzso combinations ( zzso zzso in the zzso zzso binding region of the zzso gene zzso may have contributed to the zzso zzso The zzso differences are caused by the altered expression of the zzso and their zzso zzso analysis predicted that the zzso zzso site in the zzso zzso is located in the zzso binding zzso The quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction results showed that the zzso zzso relative expression in bulls with the CT and zzso zzso was significantly higher than those with the zzso zzso ( zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso also indicated that zzso directly targets zzso in a zzso zzso cell tumor cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso which altered the binding of zzso with zzso was found to be associated with the zzso quality traits of Chinese zzso zzso
