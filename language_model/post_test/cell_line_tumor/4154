zzso zzso in zzso cause a familial form of zzso lateral sclerosis zzso where abnormal zzso of zzso zzso proteins in zzso has been observed as a major pathological zzso Many of zzso zzso have been shown to deteriorate the nuclear zzso signal in zzso and thereby facilitate zzso zzso of zzso zzso Several other zzso however, exhibit no effects on the nuclear zzso of zzso in cultured cells, and their roles in the zzso of zzso remain zzso Here, we show that a zzso zzso zzso significantly increases the zzso for zzso of zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso in zzso formation of zzso zzso zzso was observed in zzso but not zzso zzso and notably, those zzso functioned as efficient seeds to trigger the zzso of zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso did not disturb the nuclear zzso of zzso but facilitated the formation of zzso inclusions in rat zzso zzso with significant zzso We thus propose that zzso zzso of zzso triggered by a subset of zzso zzso is an alternative zzso of zzso zzso zzso
