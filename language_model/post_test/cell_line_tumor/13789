We tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso tumor growth, and that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso effects on cell signaling were assessed in zzso and in zzso Its zzso efficacy was assessed in zzso in a panel of cancer cell lines with differing zzso and zzso zzso Its in zzso efficacy was tested as a single agent and in combination with zzso 

zzso inhibited zzso signaling and zzso zzso and increased zzso in a zzso manner in breast cancer cell zzso Cell lines with zzso or zzso zzso were significantly more sensitive to zzso however, several lines with zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in breast cancer cells increased zzso zzso zzso with increased zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso plasmids into zzso zzso breast cells enhanced zzso zzso Cell lines that were less sensitive to zzso had lower ratios of zzso and had less growth zzso with zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso breast cancer zzso zzso treatment inhibited zzso zzso cell zzso and tumor zzso In zzso zzso showed a synergistic interaction with zzso in zzso cell lines, and this combination had significantly greater zzso efficacy than either agent alone in zzso 

zzso has zzso activity alone and in combination with zzso This activity may be greater in tumors with zzso loss or zzso zzso providing a strategy for patient enrichment in clinical zzso
