To study the expression of zzso zzso zzso and Twist protein and investigate its significance in the occurrence and development of prostate zzso 

The expression of zzso zzso zzso and Twist protein in 59 prostate cancer zzso and 21 adjacent zzso were detected by zzso zzso zzso and the correlation with zzso features was zzso 

Positive rates of zzso zzso zzso and Twist were zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, in prostate cancer zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, in zzso zzso with significant differences between the two groups ( zzso The reduced expression of zzso was related to the differentiation of prostate cancer zzso and zzso level, but was not associated with clinical stage, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The increased expression of zzso zzso and Twist was related to the differentiation of prostate cancer zzso clinical stage, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not to zzso The difference in positive expression of zzso and zzso was significant between zzso zzso group and zzso group, but the positive expression of Twist was not significant between zzso The expression of zzso was highly zzso correlated with that of zzso and also highly zzso correlated with that of zzso The expression of zzso was correlated with those of zzso zzso and zzso 

The reduced expression of zzso abnormal expression of zzso transformation form zzso to zzso and the increased expression of zzso and Twist play an important role in the occurrence and development of prostate zzso
