zzso play an important regulatory role in zzso and cancer zzso Different members of zzso family have been reported to be decreased in human lung zzso However, the effect of specific zzso member on zzso of zzso remains zzso Our current study detected the expression of zzso members in 94 cases of zzso and a significant association was noticed between low levels of zzso expression and zzso zzso invasion, advanced zzso stages and poor survival of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in relatively highly zzso cells remarkably suppressed their migration and zzso zzso of zzso in cells with relatively low zzso potential promoted their zzso and zzso We then analyzed the potential targets of zzso and found that zzso and zzso were directly zzso by zzso Upon restoring the expression of zzso and zzso the effects of zzso on tumor zzso were partially zzso and more importantly, the expression levels of zzso and zzso were zzso correlated with zzso in 64 zzso zzso zzso our results suggest that zzso by degrading zzso and zzso prevents zzso zzso
