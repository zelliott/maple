zzso zzso zzso and its zzso are potent zzso of zzso zzso and display strong zzso activity on both solid tumor and tumor cell zzso Since natural zzso is difficult to zzso and also zzso to an inactive form quite zzso a recently reported new zzso series of zzso zzso was investigated, in the hope of bypassing some of these zzso These zzso appear to offer a valuable tool for zzso research because of their extremely facile synthesis from readily available starting zzso 

The zzso zzso were evaluated by zzso zzso cell cycle analysis, zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Various zzso ring zzso on the zzso skeleton zzso to the two aromatic rings on the zzso zzso zzso quickly demonstrated that the zzso relationships are quite similar to previously zzso zzso zzso The most interesting analog appears to be an zzso compound zzso which was also quite zzso zzso zzso was remarkably potent in all tested tumor cell lines and could strongly inhibit zzso zzso at doses as low as 1 zzso Further experiments with zzso mice indicated that zzso and other potent zzso zzso and zzso were effective in treating human prostate zzso and zzso zzso tumors at well below an oral zzso dose of around 200 zzso body zzso This suggests some zzso by this zzso 

These data strongly support that zzso is extremely zzso readily zzso and apparently suitable for in zzso studies employing transplanted zzso
