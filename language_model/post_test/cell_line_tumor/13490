The zzso cell membrane zzso zzso is highly expressed on the cell surface of several zzso The level of its expression has been found to correlate directly with zzso progression and zzso potential, thus establishing zzso as an important candidate of zzso growth and zzso In order to characterize its expression in human zzso zzso cell lines, we have examined the zzso expression at protein and zzso levels in both normal and zzso zzso cell lines by several zzso Our results indicate that zzso protein is expressed at low levels in normal zzso cells whereas it is highly expressed in all zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso was partially reduced in zzso cells, where the zzso Yang 1 zzso factor, also found zzso in human zzso cells, has been zzso
