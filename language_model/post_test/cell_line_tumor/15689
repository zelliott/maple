zzso is a childhood cancer of the sympathetic nervous system that accounts for approximately zzso of all zzso zzso zzso To identify genetic risk factors for zzso we performed a zzso association study zzso on zzso patients and zzso control subjects of European ancestry from four case zzso Here we report a significant association within zzso domain only 1 zzso at zzso zzso combined P zzso zzso odds ratio of risk zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso The signal was enriched in the subset of patients with the most aggressive form of the zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso regulator, and its zzso zzso zzso and zzso have each been previously implicated in zzso In zzso we zzso zzso DNA copy number zzso in zzso primary zzso We found that the zzso locus was zzso in zzso through a zzso event, and that this event was associated with more advanced disease zzso zzso and survival zzso zzso zzso The zzso single zzso zzso zzso risk zzso and zzso copy number gains were associated with increased zzso expression in zzso cell lines and primary zzso consistent with a zzso role in zzso Short hairpin zzso zzso depletion of zzso inhibited growth of zzso cells with high zzso zzso whereas forced expression of zzso in zzso cells with low zzso expression enhanced zzso These data show that common zzso at the zzso locus are strongly associated with zzso to developing zzso but also may influence the likelihood of further zzso zzso at this zzso leading to zzso zzso
