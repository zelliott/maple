There is growing evidence that zzso II zzso and its smaller fragments zzso zzso and zzso zzso are involved in zzso control in the vascular smooth muscle and in some other zzso including zzso The aim of this paper was to investigate the effects of zzso and its fragments zzso and zzso on the growth of an zzso human prostate cancer cell line in zzso To see whether the conversion of zzso II into its shorter fragments plays a role in the action of the former, we used specific zzso of zzso compound zzso zzso of zzso zzso which blocks the conversion of zzso into zzso and compound PC 18 zzso of zzso zzso which blocks the conversion of zzso into zzso 

Human prostate cancer zzso cells were exposed in culture to different zzso of zzso zzso and zzso separately or jointly with the zzso zzso zzso or zzso To measure cell growth, the zzso method, based on the reduction of zzso salt by viable cells, was zzso 

It was found that exposure of zzso cells in zzso to all the investigated zzso resulted in a moderate, zzso zzso of cell zzso The joint exposure of zzso cells to zzso plus zzso but not to zzso plus PC 18, abolished the effect of zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso peptides zzso as well as its smaller zzso are involved in the negative control of prostate cancer cell zzso
