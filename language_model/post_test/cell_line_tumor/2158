Although a series of melanoma differentiation zzso for zzso targeting has been zzso zzso expression of zzso such as zzso and zzso results from a loss of zzso expression in many late stage zzso zzso loss can represent a means for tumor escape from immune recognition, and a barrier to zzso However, since zzso tumor zzso frequently result from zzso gene regulatory events, zzso enhancement represents a potential therapeutic zzso zzso we have developed a zzso zzso to screen for compounds with the ability to enhance zzso recognition of melanoma zzso This zzso is dependent on zzso of zzso zzso presentation by a melanoma cell line zzso zzso recognition is detected as zzso production by a zzso T cell zzso to express a zzso zzso specific for an zzso restricted zzso of the zzso zzso This cellular zzso was used to perform a pilot screen by using zzso compounds of known biological zzso From the initial zzso primary screen, eight compounds were identified as positive zzso A panel of secondary screens, including zzso zzso was used to validate the primary hits and eliminate false zzso and also to measure the comparative efficacy of the identified zzso This zzso zzso thus, yields consistent results zzso to the screening of larger libraries of compounds that can potentially reveal novel molecules which allow better recognition of treated tumors by T zzso
