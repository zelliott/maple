zzso zzso zzso zzso is an aggressive zzso zzso strongly associated with former exposure to zzso fibers and for which there is currently no effective treatment zzso In human, zzso is characterized by a high local zzso poor prognosis and therapeutic zzso In order to assess molecular changes that specify this zzso we performed a global gene expression profiling of human zzso Using a zzso zzso we analyzed zzso relative gene expression levels by comparing a zzso cell line to either a zzso cell line or tumor zzso To analyze these gene expression data, we used various zzso zzso zzso zzso methods were used to group genes and samples with similar expression in an zzso zzso Genes of known function were further sorted by zzso function and zzso clusters using a supervised software zzso Taken together, these data defined a molecular fingerprint of human zzso with more than 700 zzso or zzso genes related to several traits of the zzso zzso specially associated with zzso zzso protection and resistance to zzso zzso This portrait is meaningful in disease zzso and management, and relevant in finding new specific markers of zzso These molecular markers should improve the accuracy of zzso diagnosis, prognosis and zzso
