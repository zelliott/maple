zzso evidence indicates that tumor zzso cells zzso differ from normal zzso cells zzso Our previous reports also showed that zzso were different from zzso For example, zzso have zzso zzso and zzso properties such as high zzso and zzso zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso acquire a specific character remains zzso To investigate this zzso we focused on zzso zzso zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso contain numerous types of zzso molecules and affect normal zzso cells in the tumor zzso However, most of the functional mechanisms of zzso remain zzso 

Here we showed that zzso isolated from tumor cells were taken up by NEC through zzso In addition, we found that zzso promoted random zzso and tube formation through the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso Moreover, the effects induced by zzso were inhibited by the zzso inhibitor zzso Our results indicate that zzso could zzso zzso properties to NEC partly via zzso 

We for the first time showed that zzso of zzso contributes to tumor zzso These findings offer new insights into cancer therapies and the zzso between tumor and zzso cells zzso by zzso in the tumor zzso
