zzso cancer zzso is one of the leading causes of zzso death zzso Because young age of onset is often considered a poor zzso factor for zzso it is important to identify the poor outcomes of zzso in a younger population and to consider an aggressive approach by implementing early zzso Our aim was to specifically zzso the zzso zzso 19 zzso transcript from zzso patients and investigate its correlation with clinical stage, tumor zzso and zzso 

The zzso of zzso zzso transcript was determined by a quantitative real-time reverse zzso zzso chain in 129 zzso patients zzso younger than 60 years at zzso and 85 healthy zzso The levels of zzso protein were examined both in zzso cell lines and zzso 

The analysis of 45 younger zzso patients (age zzso 60 zzso revealed that patients at the zzso stage had significantly higher expression levels of zzso zzso zzso when compared with healthy controls zzso zzso zzso and patients at the zzso stage zzso zzso zzso Additionally, the degree of consistency between the mean level of zzso zzso zzso and the distant zzso rate in each age zzso was up to zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These results indicate that high levels of zzso zzso zzso represent a potential marker for zzso zzso and for aggressive treatment of younger zzso zzso
