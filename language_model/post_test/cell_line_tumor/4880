zzso of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso 1) activity in tumor cells could be effective in the zzso of tumor cell growth by zzso tumor cells of essential zzso zzso Because of the high level of expression of zzso in tumor cells, zzso zzso would be useful for zzso therapy in suppressing tumor growth without affecting normal zzso In recent years, zzso zzso technique is useful technology for zzso drug zzso It allows identifying and characterizing new targets for developments in cancer drug therapy through the understanding genes involved in drug zzso The present study was designed to investigate gene expression profile induced by zzso inhibitor using gene chip zzso Human zzso zzso cells zzso zzso were treated with classical system L inhibitor zzso 2, zzso acid zzso Gene chip experiment was applied for treated and zzso cells after 3 and 12 zzso Two independent experiments with a high degree of zzso identified the altered expression of 151 and 200 genes after 3 and 12 h zzso zzso Among these zzso 132 and 13 were zzso and 19 and zzso were zzso by 3 and 12 h zzso treatment zzso We found that zzso affected the expression of a large number of genes that are related to the control of cell survival and zzso zzso These data are useful for understanding of zzso signaling of cell growth zzso induced by zzso zzso as candidate for zzso drug zzso
