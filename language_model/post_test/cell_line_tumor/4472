Gene zzso in the zzso zzso region are observed frequently in breast zzso An zzso zzso analysis of this region nominated the zzso gene as a potential therapeutic target in breast zzso This gene encodes zzso protein zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso which has not yet been reported to be associated with zzso genetic zzso We found that zzso was amplified in approximately zzso of breast zzso zzso of zzso expression significantly inhibited cell proliferation and colony formation in zzso breast cancer cell lines zzso and zzso but not in zzso zzso breast cancer zzso zzso of zzso expression in zzso breast cancer cells zzso breast cancer cells to zzso induction by zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso and zzso three commonly used zzso drugs for treating breast zzso In addition, zzso expression of zzso in collaboration with zzso induced colony formation in both primary mouse embryonic zzso and immortalized human breast zzso cells zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso contributes to breast zzso and may zzso resistance of breast cancer cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso may be a valuable therapeutic target in patients with zzso breast zzso and blocking zzso zzso activity with a small zzso inhibitor may sensitize zzso breast cancer cells to zzso
