zzso resistance zzso to zzso agents is a major obstacle to successful treatment in patients with breast zzso Besides zzso of zzso the member of the ABC zzso family, zzso zzso zzso which allows cellular escape from zzso cellular zzso by zzso zzso zzso was considered to be related with zzso resistance zzso in breast zzso To specifically and efficiently reverse zzso of breast zzso cells, two small interference zzso zzso targeted zzso resistance 1 zzso and zzso zzso by plasmids were constructed and zzso into the zzso breast cancer cell line zzso The results showed that both transient zzso and stable zzso of the two zzso plasmids could greatly decrease the relative expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso significantly lower than the controls zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso displayed a zzso reduction in drug resistance for zzso And the reversing effects could keep for a long period (at least 3 zzso Our results demonstrated that zzso of zzso and zzso could more effectively reverse zzso in drug resistant breast zzso cells in zzso
