In resting human zzso cells, zzso oxide zzso zzso is present in its native 160 zzso form in a zzso state predominantly zzso on the plasma zzso via its zzso zzso zzso domain, with zzso zzso zzso and in tight association with heat shock protein 90 zzso Following exposure of the cells to zzso or to zzso zzso zzso zzso removal of the zzso domain being converted into a fully active 130 zzso zzso The newly generated zzso zzso form zzso from zzso and extensively zzso into the zzso in direct correlation with NO zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso are completely prevented in cells preloaded with zzso zzso indicating that these processes are triggered by a zzso zzso of zzso The role of zzso has been confirmed by zzso experiments revealing that also zzso is specifically recruited into the zzso complex following calcium zzso Thus, the formation of clusters containing zzso zzso zzso and zzso represents the limiting step for the operation of the mechanism that links an efficient synthesis of NO to a local increase in zzso zzso
