zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso family which plays an important role in the zzso of nuclear zzso zzso zzso in over zzso of breast zzso zzso has been recently identified as a potential breast cancer zzso The purpose of this study is to examine the therapeutic potential of zzso zzso on human breast cancer zzso 

Eight zzso targeting different regions of the zzso zzso were zzso and the zzso effect was screened by quantitative real time zzso The biological effects of synthetic zzso on human breast cancer cells were investigated by examining the cell zzso migration, invasion, focus formation, zzso zzso soft zzso zzso cell cycle arrest, zzso (via zzso zzso zzso zzso level, and zzso related gene expressions upon the zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso in human breast cancer cells resulted in decrease of focus formation potential and zzso as well as in zzso cell zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso suppressed cell zzso Cell cycle zzso showed that the zzso effect of zzso zzso was zzso by arresting cells in zzso phase, which was caused by zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that zzso of zzso inhibited the zzso zzso activity as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso was not observed in breast cancer cells upon the zzso of zzso The present study provided the first evidence that zzso zzso using synthetic zzso could inhibit the zzso properties and proliferation of breast cancer zzso 

Our results suggested that zzso zzso using synthetic zzso may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for breast zzso
