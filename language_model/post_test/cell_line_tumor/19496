zzso zzso a promising zzso drug, kills tumor cells through either diminishing or promoting zzso oxygen species zzso zzso In this study, it was investigated whether zzso A zzso a specific zzso zzso zzso inhibitor and a new zzso drug, could improve the zzso activity of low zzso of zzso in human leukemia cells zzso zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso or their combinations; cell proliferation arrest, zzso zzso zzso release and cell viability were measured as indicators of cell zzso zzso oxygen species zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso were also zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso increased in a time and zzso zzso Low zzso (no more than 20 zzso diminished the zzso generation in zzso cells, while high zzso zzso and 100 zzso promoted zzso In contrast, zzso showed no influence on zzso zzso When their effects on zzso zzso were determined, low zzso showed no effect, while zzso significantly increased zzso As expected, combinations of low zzso and zzso could not only diminish zzso generation, but also increase zzso zzso and hence showed a more significant zzso in zzso zzso Since the extra zzso generation may also harm normal cells, instead of using high zzso combining low zzso with zzso is obviously a better strategy to improve the zzso activity of zzso
