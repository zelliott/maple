zzso zzso zzso is the most common and lethal primary human brain zzso zzso are characterized by a variety of genetic zzso among which zzso zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso is most zzso zzso harboring zzso have increased proliferation and invasive characteristics versus those expressing zzso zzso zzso To identify the molecular basis of this increased zzso zzso we used zzso differential zzso zzso Among several zzso expressed zzso we selected zzso a protein implicated in cellular invasion that was markedly decreased in zzso expressing zzso for further zzso The differential expression of zzso was confirmed in a panel of human zzso cell lines and operative specimens that express zzso or zzso zzso by quantitative real-time zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso In human zzso samples, decreased expression of zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso resulted in increased invasion of zzso expressing human zzso cells zzso and zzso to those found in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in these zzso zzso cells promoted their ability to invade and was accompanied by decreased expression of zzso Rescuing zzso expression decreased invasion of the zzso zzso cells by tilting the balance between zzso and zzso zzso these results show that the loss of zzso contribute to the increased invasive zzso of human zzso expressing zzso zzso
