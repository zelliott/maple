zzso imaging of lung deposition and gene expression following the pulmonary delivery of a gene zzso is useful for a precise analysis of gene zzso efficiency in zzso As a novel probe for evaluating lung deposition, in this study, a zzso zzso zzso fluorescent probe zzso was newly zzso and compared with zzso green zzso for application to zzso zzso zzso zzso had superior characteristics including a larger zzso shift zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and relatively equivalent zzso intensity compared with zzso zzso affected the zzso properties of zzso complex with a loss of zzso intensity, while zzso did zzso zzso in mice demonstrated that zzso showed greater lung zzso than zzso following pulmonary zzso with zzso complex, indicating the possibility of accurately evaluating lung zzso Moreover, it was clarified that the evaluation of lung deposition by zzso even at zzso could be significantly correlated with gene expression in each mouse following pulmonary zzso with zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is widely zzso to the dual imaging of the lung deposition and gene expression of zzso gene zzso
