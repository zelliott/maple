zzso D zzso is a major constituent of zzso zzso found in the root of zzso zzso Recent studies have demonstrated that zzso is a potentially interesting candidate for use in cancer zzso However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for zzso zzso zzso remain to be poorly zzso In this study, we examined the effects of zzso treatment on zzso activity in different human leukemia cell zzso At zzso between 10 and 20 zzso zzso exerted a zzso direct zzso effect and zzso of zzso activity via zzso of zzso zzso Because zzso and zzso are known to directly regulate zzso of zzso we also evaluated the expression and DNA binding activity of these zzso zzso treatment reduced zzso and zzso protein levels and DNA binding activities in a zzso zzso We also observed that zzso treatment zzso the zzso of zzso thereby reducing the zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso We conclude that zzso has direct zzso effect on human leukemia cells and suppresses zzso activity through zzso and zzso suppression of zzso
