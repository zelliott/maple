Lung cancer, one of the leading causes of death worldwide, is often associated with a state of immune suppression, but the molecular and functional basis remains zzso Evidence is provided in this paper supporting the role of lung zzso soluble zzso zzso as a culprit in zzso cell zzso zzso We have shown that zzso is highly expressed in lung cancer cell lines, together with the serum and surgical samples from lung cancer zzso zzso lung zzso zzso has been shown to alter the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and impair zzso T cell response, zzso with the increase of zzso regulatory T zzso The regulatory effect of zzso is zzso in part, through its ability to zzso in an zzso zzso of DNA binding zzso manner, the expression of zzso in zzso and zzso This effect is inhibited by the addition of zzso which zzso the zzso and functional zzso seen in zzso Of note, significant zzso of zzso was seen in zzso zzso zzso in human lung cancer zzso This was also noted in mice transplanted with lung cancer cells, but not in those receiving tumor cells with zzso zzso Furthermore, a significant reduction was noted in lung cancer zzso and in the levels of zzso zzso zzso in mice receiving zzso tumor zzso These results thus suggest that the zzso functional axis may be crucial in lung zzso immune suppression, and that zzso may serve as a target in the development of lung cancer zzso
