Although zzso has been used as a treatment of zzso brain tumors, it is not yet clear what is the mechanism of the cell growth zzso by heat zzso especially by the temperature which has clinically been applied to zzso zzso zzso degrees zzso zzso we evaluated the change of zzso and zzso human zzso zzso cells after 43 degrees zzso shock comparing with that of 45 degrees zzso First, we observed that cell growth was zzso inhibited after 43 degrees zzso shock for 3 or 5 days, in zzso or zzso cells, respectively, which was followed by zzso During the period of transient growth zzso mild zzso arrest was zzso However, zzso was observed in only zzso or zzso of 43 degrees zzso cells, in zzso or zzso cells, zzso Instead, transmission electron zzso showed the formation of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso Moreover, in the both cell lines, zzso analysis with zzso orange revealed the induction of zzso zzso zzso which was blocked by zzso zzso suggesting the involvement of zzso Furthermore, while zzso did not increase the zzso effect of 43 degrees zzso zzso zzso zzso another zzso zzso did significantly enhance the effect in zzso zzso Taken together, mild heat shock zzso degrees C for 2 zzso causes zzso and mild zzso arrest, but does not induce apparent zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso A1 may increase the zzso efficacy of mild heat shock against some zzso zzso zzso
