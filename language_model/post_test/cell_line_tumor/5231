To construct the zzso expression zzso and establish zzso zzso cell line, which contained the code gene of zinc finger zzso zzso and to observe the effect of zzso gene to the proliferation of tumor zzso 

The zzso DNA was amplified from the template of normal zzso tissue zzso and cloned into the zzso expression zzso zzso The zzso zzso named as zzso was determined by restriction zzso and sequencing zzso Next the zzso zzso zzso was transferred into mouse breast zzso zzso cells with zzso 2000, and the zzso zzso cells were selected by zzso (named zzso The growth condition of cells was observed, and zzso zzso of zzso gene was located by zzso microscope at the same zzso The zzso zzso expression in the zzso cells was detected by zzso and the proliferation of such cells was measured by zzso 

The analysis confirmed that the zzso zzso contained the zzso full-length zzso The zzso zzso was zzso zzso in zzso The growth of zzso was increased obviously when compared with the negative control group and blank zzso 

The zzso zzso has been constructed zzso and the expression of the zzso gene can promote the proliferation of zzso This zzso zzso expression zzso can be used in advanced studies in the biological effects of zzso and zzso gene zzso
