In recent times zzso zzso zzso have been successfully employed in tissue engineering for targeted drug delivery zzso In this review, silk zzso protein from zzso zzso zzso tropical zzso silk cocoons was blended with zzso zzso and zzso in the presence of zzso to achieve zzso zzso zzso capable of carrying both zzso zzso and zzso zzso drug zzso zzso The zzso zzso were subsequently characterized for their size distribution, drug loading zzso cellular zzso and zzso zzso sizes ranged between 100 and 110 zzso in diameter as confirmed by dynamic light zzso Rapid zzso of these particles into cells was observed in in zzso cellular zzso studies using breast cancer zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso against breast cancer cells showed promising results comparable to free zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells was confirmed by zzso and zzso microscopic studies using zzso V zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso and zzso of regulatory protein zzso through Western zzso analysis suggested further drug-induced zzso in zzso This study projects silk zzso protein as an alternative natural zzso for fabrication of zzso zzso in the presence of zzso for successful delivery of both zzso and zzso drugs to target zzso
