Lung zzso is the most common type of lung zzso A close monitor of in zzso tumor development may help to better understand the zzso and pathological processes of this zzso A zzso imaging strategy has been developed, which is a very important tool to investigate the growth and zzso of lung zzso In the present study, we used a combined labeling strategy in zzso cells via zzso the reporter gene zzso In order to zzso identify the growth and zzso of zzso zzso tumor cells, we established and observed subcutaneous and zzso zzso in nude mice by in zzso zzso and zzso imaging, which was verified by our zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso signal was observed for the progression of both subcutaneous and zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso was only observed for the growth of subcutaneous zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso cells allow for the improved identification of implanted cells within host tissue during zzso zzso In conclusion, we presented a combined labeling strategy for zzso zzso cell imaging which leads to improved detection of cellular zzso
