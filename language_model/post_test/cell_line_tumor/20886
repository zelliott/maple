To screen zzso zzso from a zzso zzso library and identify its binding zzso 

The expression of zzso of zzso lines was identified by Western zzso and zzso zzso against zzso were screened with immobilized zzso After five rounds of zzso 30 randomly selected clones were identified by zzso zzso to select specific clones with high zzso The positive clones were selected for zzso soluble expression in zzso and the binding activities were zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso expressed in zzso membrane was confirmed by Western zzso and zzso A zzso zzso named zzso with fine activity to zzso was zzso zzso binding specificity was confirmed by zzso zzso and zzso 

The zzso zzso binding to zzso in zzso provides a promising candidate for the zzso of zzso
