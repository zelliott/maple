Human zzso zzso zzso are needed for colon cancer zzso zzso to allow for repeated zzso zzso zzso zzso being the reference zzso for zzso of these tumors, we developed human zzso zzso 

zzso animals were zzso with zzso Among all the zzso produced, two of them, zzso and zzso were selected for characterization in zzso in comparison with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using flow zzso surface zzso zzso and binding to zzso soluble zzso and in zzso in human colon zzso zzso bearing nude zzso 

zzso zzso analysis demonstrated binding of zzso on zzso cells without any binding on zzso human zzso In a competitive binding zzso using five reference zzso directed against the five Gold zzso zzso zzso and zzso were shown to be directed against the Gold 4 zzso The affinities of zzso zzso and zzso were determined to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, as compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the reference zzso zzso In a soluble phase zzso the binding capacities of zzso and zzso to soluble zzso were clearly lower than that of the control zzso zzso zzso A human zzso concentration of about zzso M was needed to zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso as compared with zzso M for zzso zzso suggesting a preferential binding of the human zzso to solid phase zzso In zzso 24 h zzso zzso demonstrated a high tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso close to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso At 72 h zzso zzso was still concentrated in the tumor zzso zzso zzso whereas the tumor concentration of zzso was significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso At no time after injection was there any zzso of the zzso zzso in normal zzso A pertinent analysis of zzso zzso was not possible in this mouse model in which zzso displays a very short zzso due to zzso zzso expression in the zzso 

Our human zzso zzso is a promising candidate for zzso in intact form, as zzso fragments, or as a zzso zzso
