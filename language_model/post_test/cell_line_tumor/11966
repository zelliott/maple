As high zzso activity is detected in most cancer cells, zzso of zzso by drug or dietary food components is a new strategy for cancer zzso Here, we investigated the zzso effect of vitamin zzso with particular emphasis on zzso zzso vitamin zzso on human zzso in zzso zzso As results, zzso inhibited zzso activity of zzso human zzso zzso cells in zzso and zzso manner, interestingly, with zzso exhibiting the highest zzso zzso zzso inhibited protein zzso C activity, resulting in zzso of zzso and human zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso thereby reducing zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso showed very weak zzso zzso These results provide novel evidence for the first time indicating that zzso acts as a potent candidate regulator of zzso and supporting the zzso function of zzso
