zzso initiation sites of the zzso zzso gene were investigated in human zzso cells after zzso acid limitation by incubation in zzso zzso minimal essential medium or medium lacking zzso zzso incubated in complete minimal essential medium had zzso transcripts with starting positions spanning across the 69 zzso immediately upstream of a previously designated zzso start site zzso whereas the majority of zzso transcripts started at zzso zzso in cells incubated in zzso zzso Similar results were obtained regardless of whether the analysis was by zzso rapid amplification of zzso ends or a zzso protection zzso Low zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso medium was associated with the wide range of initiation sites, whereas preferred alignment of the general zzso machinery at zzso zzso observed in the zzso acid deprived condition, was associated with a concurrent increase in zzso zzso To our knowledge, these results are the first example in a zzso cell of zzso start selection by zzso zzso
