Acute zzso of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and a mixture of both zzso and zzso acid zzso were comparatively investigated in male zzso rats at 5 doses each with zzso dose zzso as zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso and 315 zzso CA at zzso zzso zzso 25, and 250 zzso and zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso + zzso and zzso + zzso zzso No marked adverse effects in zzso function were observed in animals treated with zzso alone or CA alone, but evidence related to zzso was noted in rats administered zzso Renal zzso and increased kidney weights were found in rats 7 d after daily oral administration of zzso Blood zzso nitrogen zzso and zzso were significantly elevated in the high dose zzso groups at zzso or zzso In addition, elevated numbers of white blood cells zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and increased levels of zzso zzso zzso in zzso were found in the zzso zzso Based on these data, the zzso zzso zzso for zzso for zzso was estimated to be zzso zzso body weight zzso zzso plus zzso zzso zzso zzso If a safety factor of 1000 or more were applied to zzso tolerable daily intake zzso would be zzso and zzso zzso or less for zzso and CA, respectively, which is far below the TDI of zzso zzso set by World Health Organization zzso In addition, in zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso human zzso zzso cell line was more sensitive to zzso CA, and zzso than the zzso canine kidney zzso cell zzso The zzso half zzso zzso concentration zzso values for zzso zzso zzso zzso were less than those of CA zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cell lines, suggesting that zzso may be more zzso than zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso value for zzso was found to be 208 zzso in zzso zzso Data suggest that zzso based upon acute zzso parameters for zzso were low, which might require further reassessment of the current zzso
