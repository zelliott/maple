zzso with zzso zzso heat shock proteins zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso has been demonstrated to elicit specific immune responses against the tumor from which the zzso were zzso The effect of zzso zzso is wholly dependent on the presence of functional zzso cells zzso in the zzso host, and zzso receptors on zzso have recently been zzso Here we show that bone zzso zzso cells zzso are able to zzso zzso complex and that peptides are zzso by zzso via the major zzso complex zzso class I presentation zzso In addition, zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso strong zzso T cell zzso responses against multiple zzso peptides in a zzso zzso processing zzso zzso The results of the present study provide strong evidence of an efficient zzso activity of zzso which could be exploited in the development of new and more effective zzso strategies for cancer zzso
