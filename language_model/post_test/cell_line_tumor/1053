zzso is a zzso process during which cancer cells zzso from the site of primary tumors and establish secondary tumors in distant zzso In a search for key regulators of zzso in a zzso breast tumor model, we have found that the zzso factor zzso a master regulator of embryonic zzso plays an essential role in zzso zzso of Twist expression in highly zzso zzso zzso cells specifically zzso their ability to zzso from the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso expression of Twist results in loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and induction of cell zzso suggesting that Twist contributes to zzso by promoting an zzso transition zzso In human breast zzso high level of Twist expression is correlated with invasive zzso zzso a highly zzso tumor type associated with loss of zzso zzso These results establish a zzso link between zzso zzso and tumor zzso
