Several zzso zzso enhance zzso activity, but the mechanisms involved in this enhancement remain zzso In this study, we examined the effect of zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso gene expression and explored the mechanisms involved in these zzso zzso increased gene expression of zzso zzso and also increased zzso zzso zzso activity in a zzso zzso Moreover, zzso treatment with zzso and zzso a zzso zzso markedly reduced the zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso using zzso cells showed a significant zzso by zzso with a reporter zzso containing a region from zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso We found that a putative zzso zzso element zzso between zzso and zzso is located in the zzso gene zzso Their zzso by deletion zzso suppressed the zzso effect of zzso on zzso promoter zzso zzso mobility shift zzso revealed that zzso induced the zzso of the zzso to a form capable of binding specifically to the zzso sequence of the zzso gene zzso Furthermore, zzso increased the formation of the zzso zzso zzso Overall, our results suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and gene expression through zzso zzso and may be involved in zzso
