High rates of local recurrence and distant zzso following surgery of high-grade head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso zzso the use of zzso systemic zzso zzso might be a possible treatment zzso in this zzso The nuclear properties of zzso make it a suitable isotope for treatment of minimal residual disease and small zzso but the conventional zzso label has poor cellular retention and its zzso accumulate in the zzso We attempted to overcome these problems by using zzso derivatives for attachment of zzso 

We investigated the feasibility of targeting an zzso zzso zzso in zzso using a zzso zzso of zzso zzso as zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used in zzso zzso 

The use of zzso enabled tumor targeting and decreased the zzso zzso of the zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso zzso was similar to its zzso counterpart, presumably due to the strong dependence of targeting efficiency on tumor zzso
