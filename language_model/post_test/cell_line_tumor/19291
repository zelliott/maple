zzso (also known as zzso is a liver zzso that interacts with multiple proteins including zzso and zzso degradation of the tumor zzso zzso and zzso We produced a zzso zzso zzso and zzso assessed the zzso significance of zzso zzso in 43 specimens of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso was observed in zzso zzso of zzso which was significantly associated with low zzso stage zzso zzso zzso no zzso invasion zzso zzso zzso no portal zzso invasion zzso zzso zzso and no zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The cumulative survival rate of patients with zzso zzso was significantly higher than that with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were positively stained by zzso in zzso and zzso respectively, of zzso but neither was zzso associated with zzso zzso In the zzso human zzso cell line, zzso of zzso zzso expression of zzso growth factor binding protein 5 zzso whereas suppression of zzso expression by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression inhibited proliferation of zzso cells as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso positive zzso for zzso was observed by zzso in zzso zzso and the level of expression was significantly correlated with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

These results suggest that zzso plays an zzso zzso mainly at the early stages of human zzso and that zzso zzso by zzso zzso may be involved in zzso
