zzso stress zzso plays a pivotal role in the zzso of Parkinson's disease zzso zzso zzso is a zzso used to induce zzso cell death of zzso zzso in experimental models of zzso zzso I, or zzso is a pure compound isolated from zzso zzso zzso that has been reported to have zzso zzso The precise zzso however, remains zzso This study aims to zzso the mechanisms by which zzso I exerts its effects, using zzso zzso in the human zzso cell line zzso In our experiments, zzso with zzso I improved cell zzso and significantly reduced zzso oxygen species zzso Further investigations revealed a reduction of zzso zzso and decrease of the zzso ratio, as measured by zzso expression and protein zzso Taken together, these findings indicate that zzso I protects zzso zzso from zzso toxicity via the reduction of zzso production, and subsequent zzso of zzso zzso and reduction of the zzso zzso
