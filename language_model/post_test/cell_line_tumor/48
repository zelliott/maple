The impact of zzso expression on the zzso of human zzso cell zzso line induced by X-ray and carbon zzso zzso was zzso 

Human zzso zzso cells were zzso with a carbon zzso beam and zzso Cell survival was determined by a standard zzso zzso zzso protein expression was zzso by Western zzso Cell cycle and zzso were performed by flow zzso 

The viability of zzso cells decreased with increasing dose of the carbon zzso zzso and the zzso carbon zzso beam led to the cells getting arrested at zzso zzso Western zzso analyses show that zzso expression increased with increasing radiation zzso The carbon zzso zzso induced cell zzso and significantly promoted the expression of zzso gene compared with the X-ray zzso The zzso rate is correlated with the expression of zzso in human zzso zzso cells after exposure to different doses of X-ray and heavy zzso zzso 

Heavy zzso zzso increases the expression of zzso zzso makes zzso cells arrested at zzso phase and increases cell zzso in comparison with that induced by zzso zzso The zzso expression may be regarded as a protected reaction when the zzso cells suffer a strong stimulus such as zzso zzso The interaction of zzso expression and other zzso in human zzso and the relationship between zzso and zzso zzso remain to be clarified in the zzso
