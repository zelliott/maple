Food zzso is a common allergic zzso in early zzso The avoidance of the zzso food is the only available method to prevent further reactions in zzso zzso A better understanding of the zzso mechanisms involved in this reaction would help to develop therapeutic approaches zzso to the prevention of food zzso 

To establish a zzso in zzso model of zzso zzso zzso that mimics the zzso zzso barrier to study the capacity of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso used as a model zzso 

zzso zzso cell zzso were zzso by zzso zzso and used to examine zzso to zzso transport of zzso by zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso was measured by zzso release zzso This experimental setting was used to assess how zzso added zzso affected these zzso zzso zzso of zzso by polarized zzso cell zzso was zzso by zzso 

zzso loaded with zzso zzso responded to zzso in a zzso zzso zzso transported across polarized zzso cell zzso was found to trigger zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso and zzso coli increased zzso electrical resistance while promoting zzso passage capable to trigger zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso were produced zzso by zzso cells exposed to zzso 

The complex model designed in here is adequate to learn about the consequence of the interaction between zzso and zzso cells zzso the barrier function and zzso zzso two parameters essential to zzso zzso It can further serve as a direct tool to search for zzso with zzso and zzso zzso
