zzso of zzso zzso to zzso B cells activates complement and promotes zzso deposition of zzso fragments on the zzso Previously, we reported that the deposited zzso is substantially zzso with zzso zzso and therefore zzso may block access of zzso zzso specific for zzso We examined the ability of several commercially available zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to bind to B cells zzso in milieu which allow or zzso complement zzso Even when large amounts of zzso labeled zzso are bound to the cells, binding of the zzso zzso zzso is substantially inhibited if zzso is deposited on the zzso However, zzso zzso is still zzso on development with a zzso zzso zzso specific for the human zzso region of zzso Our findings may provide an alternative explanation for data presented in recent reports suggesting that binding of zzso to cells in plasma leads to zzso of zzso and zzso
