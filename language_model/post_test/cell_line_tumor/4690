zzso zzso are central targets for zzso cancer zzso To avoid functional zzso the cell develops mechanisms of drug resistance, primarily based on zzso zzso zzso a drug to target a drug-resistant zzso zzso constitutes a therapeutic zzso We approach the problem by redesigning the zzso drug zzso guided by local changes in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso target introduced by an zzso zzso The zzso is redesigned by zzso the shifting zzso patterns of the zzso The association with the modified zzso overcomes the zzso zzso of the induced zzso zzso the redesigned drug zzso both zzso and zzso zzso The modeling effort is validated through molecular zzso test tube kinetic zzso of downstream zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso zzso cellular proliferation zzso and cellular zzso The inhibitor redesign reported zzso a molecular engineering paradigm to impair routes for drug zzso
