zzso of inflammation or chronic disease is a highly prevalent form of zzso The inflammatory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso concentration in many disease zzso The zzso zzso zzso axis promotes zzso zzso however the full role of zzso in anemia of inflammation is not zzso We previously reported that chronic inflammation had a negative impact on maturation of zzso zzso in a mouse zzso We hypothesized that zzso may be responsible for impaired zzso independent of iron zzso To test the hypothesis we zzso the human zzso zzso cell line to model zzso maturation and exposed them to varying doses of zzso over six zzso At 10 zzso zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso While zzso did not decrease the expression of genes associated with zzso zzso we observed impaired zzso synthesis as demonstrated by decreased zzso zzso We also observed that zzso down regulated expression of the gene zzso which is expressed late in zzso Those findings suggested that zzso zzso of zzso synthesis might zzso We investigated the impact of zzso on zzso zzso decreased the zzso membrane potential at all treatment doses, and significantly decreased zzso mass at the highest zzso Our studies indicate that zzso may impair zzso function in maturing zzso cells resulting in impaired zzso production and zzso zzso Our findings may indicate a novel zzso of action for zzso in the anemia of zzso and draw attention to the potential for new therapeutic targets that affect late zzso zzso
