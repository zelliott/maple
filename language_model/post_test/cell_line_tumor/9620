In Europe, zzso has been studied widely for prevention of zzso and cancer zzso In order to investigate the effects and mechanisms of zzso on the human gastric zzso zzso cell, we carried out in zzso and in zzso zzso After treatment with zzso an effective dose and zzso value of zzso for zzso cells were examined by zzso zzso zzso distribution and zzso rates were analyzed using zzso and zzso was measured using zzso The expression of zzso zzso and zzso were determined using an zzso zzso zzso 50 mice were divided randomly into five zzso Three groups were zzso zzso at dose of 3, 6 and 12 zzso body zzso two control groups were zzso zzso 20 zzso body zzso and zzso 20 zzso body zzso respectively, by zzso zzso The zzso rate was calculated and pathological sections were zzso The growth of zzso cell is inhibited by zzso in zzso with an zzso value at 24 h of zzso zzso and complete zzso concentration is zzso zzso After treatment with zzso at the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso for 24 zzso the expression of zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso trigger gene zzso increases markedly ( zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso cell is induced to zzso in the zzso It is also found that the percentages of S phase are zzso zzso and zzso respectively zzso in control group and zzso in zzso zzso The rates of zzso were zzso zzso zzso respectively, when the nude mice were administered zzso ( zzso or zzso The structure of the tumor showed zzso necrosis and inflammatory cell zzso We therefore conclude that zzso could inhibit cell proliferation in zzso and the growth of human gastric zzso in zzso The mechanisms of zzso zzso may relate to zzso overloading and the expression of zzso zzso
