Gene regulation by DNA binding small molecules could have important therapeutic zzso This study reports the investigation of a zzso zzso zzso targeted to bind the DNA sequence zzso with reference to its potency in a subcutaneous zzso tumor zzso The zzso is capable of trafficking to the tumor site following subcutaneous injection and zzso zzso of select genes in zzso An zzso analogue of this zzso can be detected in zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso deep sequencing zzso of tumor tissue allowed the identification of further affected zzso a representative panel of which was interrogated by quantitative reverse zzso and correlated with cell culture expression zzso
