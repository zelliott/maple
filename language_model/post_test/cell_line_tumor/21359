zzso cells zzso are specialized cells that capture and present zzso to T zzso Recent advances have been made in understanding their origin, zzso and the signals that induce their migration and maturation resident zzso are zzso cells zzso involved in stimulation or zzso of zzso T zzso Generation of DC from zzso as demonstrated ex zzso may support zzso differentiation of brain DC from local, zzso zzso zzso Here, we report the establishment of long-term cultures of rat zzso stem cells zzso using specific supplemented media for zzso These zzso share some zzso characteristics and the zzso capacity of classical zzso and when transplanted into the brain using a rat zzso model survive within the cortex, and are zzso and zzso similar to zzso over 7 zzso Our findings related to the development and differentiation of zzso zzso support the view that zzso are derived zzso from zzso zzso that are distinct from zzso
