We report a facile approach to forming zzso gold zzso zzso zzso through the use of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso modified by zzso acid zzso as zzso for enhanced zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso In this study, by simply mixing zzso zzso with gold salt in zzso solution at room temperature, zzso gold zzso zzso zzso with a mean core size of zzso zzso were able to be spontaneously zzso Followed by an zzso reaction to neutralize the zzso remaining terminal zzso zzso zzso with a mean size of 6 zzso were zzso The formed zzso zzso zzso were characterized via different zzso We show that the zzso zzso are zzso stable in zzso solution under different pH and temperature zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso flow zzso analysis, and cell zzso observation reveal that the formed zzso zzso have good zzso and are zzso at a concentration up to zzso zzso X-ray zzso zzso zzso show that the zzso zzso zzso have enhanced zzso intensity, much higher than that of zzso zzso without zzso or zzso at the same zzso concentration of the active element zzso or zzso The formed zzso zzso zzso can be used for CT imaging of cancer cells in zzso as well as for blood pool CT imaging of mice in zzso with significantly improved signal zzso With the two zzso elements of zzso and zzso incorporated within one zzso the formed zzso zzso zzso may be zzso for CT imaging of various biological systems with enhanced X-ray zzso property and detection zzso
