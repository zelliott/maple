Our first zzso exploration of human zzso 1 began in 2012 zzso zzso and the zzso characterization of the human zzso through public resources revealed that zzso of proteins on zzso 1 remain zzso To characterize all of the missing zzso we applied an zzso analysis of three human liver cell lines zzso zzso and zzso using zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso deep sequencing and zzso zzso contributing mass zzso evidence of 60 additional zzso 1 gene zzso zzso of the zzso information from public databases revealed that zzso of genes on zzso 1 had zzso protein zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the remaining 320 missing genes were either zzso or biologically zzso 128 genes were found to be zzso or rarely expressed in some zzso whereas 91 proteins were zzso mainly due to database zzso diversity, 89 were genes with low zzso abundance or zzso protein properties, and 12 genes were identifiable theoretically because of a high abundance of zzso and the existence of zzso zzso The relatively large contribution made by the identification of enriched zzso factors suggested specific enrichment of zzso protein classes, and zzso could capture zzso missing zzso zzso analyses of the zzso expressed genes indicated that several gene families located on zzso 1 may play critical roles in zzso zzso zzso invasion and zzso All mass zzso zzso data corresponding to our study were deposited in the zzso under the identifiers zzso zzso and zzso
