The mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso zzso increases zzso free zzso concentration zzso remains zzso We measured zzso changes in zzso loaded rat zzso zzso cells, and in primary zzso from rat and zzso A zzso analogue of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso increased zzso in the form of a peak followed by a plateau dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or breakdown products of zzso did not increase zzso The zzso zzso increase was not affected by zzso of zzso but was abolished by zzso and inhibited when zzso C and zzso receptors were zzso MRS zzso and MRS zzso specific zzso of the zzso zzso zzso completely blocked the zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso in zzso human zzso cells zzso that express human zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is a specific zzso of zzso zzso
