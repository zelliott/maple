To analyze the cloning result of zzso zzso from zzso cells, a multiple myeloma zzso cell line, and study the change of the expressions of zzso molecules and the zzso of zzso cells after activated with zzso 

zzso gene zzso in zzso cell was detected by zzso and DNA zzso The cell lines were cultured with zzso zzso soluble zzso (an zzso zzso zzso zzso and their respective zzso Their growth curves, change of zzso and cell cycles were zzso The zzso of zzso on zzso cells were analyzed with laser scanning zzso zzso 

There was a single base substitution zzso in the open reading frame of zzso from zzso cells, resulting in the conversion of a zzso acid zzso Only zzso zzso could inhibit zzso cell proliferation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso and cause zzso arrested zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso was zzso to zzso zzso while zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso in zzso cell might decrease its affinity to zzso leading to the disorder of zzso zzso
