zzso aberrations are distinctive features of human zzso zzso Analysis of zzso changes can illuminate the molecular mechanisms underlying the development and progression of zzso To establish the technique of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso for identifying zzso aberrations in zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso four pools of zzso zzso painting zzso have been designed and zzso on the same zzso spread by four rounds of repetitive zzso zzso zzso zzso was successfully established and the zzso abnormalities in zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso gains occurred at zzso 3, 8, zzso and zzso An zzso zzso was zzso in the cell line, which might be one intermediate mechanism leading to zzso losses and/or zzso zzso Furthermore, 16 structural arrangements were zzso including four zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso regions accounted for approximately zzso of all zzso The results added a more complete and accurate information of the genetic zzso to the classical zzso description of zzso zzso and provided a detailed zzso background data for appropriate use of the cell zzso The established zzso zzso was useful for analyzing zzso in the whole zzso of human zzso
