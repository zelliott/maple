zzso of zzso is one of the most frequent zzso zzso in many solid tumors, including zzso zzso zzso zzso breast, and zzso zzso A candidate zzso to zzso initiation factor zzso zzso a member of zzso initiation factor zzso zzso has been isolated from a frequently amplified region at zzso In this work, the zzso ability of zzso was demonstrated by zzso growth in soft zzso and tumor formation in nude zzso Furthermore, zzso DNA against zzso could inhibit cell growth in zzso cancer cell line zzso with amplification of zzso in form of double zzso Cell growth rate in zzso was also inhibited when the expression level of zzso was decreased by the reduction of the copy number of double zzso The correlation of zzso zzso and clinical features of zzso cancer was investigated using tissue zzso and the result showed that zzso zzso was significantly associated with the advanced stage of zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso plays important roles in zzso zzso
