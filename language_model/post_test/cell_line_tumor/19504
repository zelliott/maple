The tumor zzso zzso is an important cellular zzso which controls cell cycle zzso zzso is one of the mechanisms by which zzso is zzso Here we report the interaction of zzso with another key regulator, zzso which together with zzso zzso forms the positive zzso zzso complex, zzso This complex zzso with the zzso zzso protein to cause the zzso of the zzso terminal domain zzso of zzso zzso II and this zzso the zzso of zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso through their direct physical zzso zzso from zzso interaction zzso revealed that zzso interacts with the zzso domain zzso zzso of zzso while zzso interacts with the zzso domain of zzso zzso and protein binding zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated the ability of zzso to bind and activate the zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso which could be also zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso independently of zzso These studies demonstrate the existence of a zzso between zzso and zzso zzso a novel mechanism by which zzso regulates the zzso zzso zzso
