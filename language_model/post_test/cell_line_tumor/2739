zzso is principally zzso in the zzso zzso of the adrenal by a series of zzso reactions leading to the conversion of cholesterol to zzso zzso II zzso zzso is the major zzso regulator of zzso production acting acutely to stimulate zzso zzso and chronically to increase the capacity of the zzso to produce zzso We previously defined eight zzso factors that are rapidly induced following zzso II treatment using three in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso we investigated the function of these zzso factors in the regulation of the zzso needed for zzso zzso zzso adrenal cells were zzso with expression zzso for each zzso factor and zzso zzso prepared for genes zzso the zzso needed for zzso zzso zzso family members induced promoter activity of zzso type 2 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The importance of zzso in the regulation of zzso was also demonstrated by reduced zzso zzso in the presence of a zzso A pharmacological approach was used to characterize the zzso II pathways regulating zzso of zzso family zzso zzso of zzso members were decreased following zzso of zzso II type 1 zzso zzso protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso II binding to the zzso increases activity of zzso zzso and zzso which act to increase expression of the family of zzso genes as well as zzso zzso II induction of the zzso family members represents an important zzso to increase the capacity of adrenal cells to produce zzso
