The purpose of this study is to investigate zzso in a large series of breast cancer patients for its zzso and zzso value, and to evaluate its functional role in treatment response in zzso zzso levels were measured using quantitative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in primary breast cancer specimens and related to zzso factors and disease zzso zzso expression was zzso with zzso in zzso to assess expression zzso of putative zzso downstream genes and to determine cell numbers after treatment with the zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso patients who did not receive zzso systemic therapy, zzso was not significantly correlated with zzso survival zzso In zzso patients with advanced disease treated with zzso tamoxifen zzso the zzso with highest zzso levels was associated with the lowest clinical benefit zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and with a shorter zzso survival zzso in both zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso analysis, including traditional factors zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso in zzso caused a 38% decrease in cell numbers zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso treatment resulted in a zzso decrease zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso Combining zzso zzso with zzso treatment reduced cell numbers with zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to control zzso zzso zzso was associated with an almost zzso zzso of the zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso has no zzso value in breast zzso High levels of zzso are associated with poor outcome to tamoxifen therapy in advanced breast zzso zzso zzso leads to zzso of the zzso and better response to zzso
