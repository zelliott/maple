We have developed a compact and inexpensive zzso zzso the zzso magnetic zzso to efficiently remove zzso zzso cells from zzso The zzso magnetic filter consists of a zzso channel built directly above a zzso zzso zzso zzso grains of zzso assemble to form alternating magnetic zzso creating a magnetic field with a very strong magnitude B (from the zzso and field zzso zzso (from the zzso in the zzso zzso The magnetic force imparted on magnetic beads is measured to be comparable to state-of-the-art zzso zzso allowing for efficient zzso to be performed in a zzso simple zzso The efficiency of the magnetic filter is characterized by sorting zzso zzso beads from magnetic beads zzso zzso The filter zzso the population of zzso beads to magnetic beads by a factor of zzso with a recovery rate of zzso at 1 zzso zzso The utility of the magnetic filter is demonstrated with a zzso device that sorts tumor cells from zzso using negative zzso selection, and concentrates the tumor cells on an integrated membrane filter for optical zzso
