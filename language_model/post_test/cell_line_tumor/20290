To investigate the biological function of the zzso C virus zzso F protein in zzso 

The full-length F gene was amplified by zzso from zzso zzso zzso and cloned into zzso zzso by restriction zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso were zzso with the zzso zzso zzso or the original zzso zzso zzso and screened with the selective antibiotic, zzso zzso F gene and protein expression was verified by zzso zzso Analysis of cell growth and cell cycle was carried out by zzso zzso crystal violet zzso and flow zzso 

zzso and zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso uniquely expressed the F gene and zzso The zzso and zzso cells showed significantly decreased proliferation rates, compared to the respective control zzso A similar zzso zzso zzso activity was observed by the cell viability zzso Furthermore, cell cycle analysis revealed that the zzso distribution was much lower in zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells than in the respective controls zzso and zzso zzso zzso less than zzso 

zzso expression of the zzso F gene reduced the in zzso proliferation rate of zzso cell lines, indicating that the F protein may function as a growth inhibitor of infected zzso
