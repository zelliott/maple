In a previous paper we reported that the zzso zzso zzso in cells of the zzso zzso cell line could be induced to zzso to the nucleus by exposure to zzso zzso We have extended these studies to determine the fate of zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells where zzso zzso protein resides in the zzso A continuous increase in the nuclear zzso protein was observed in zzso cells beginning 1 h after zzso that persisted for 8 zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso revealed a zzso rapid and sensitive increase in a zzso nuclear zzso zzso using zzso zzso which detects zzso when zzso 376 is zzso The zzso zzso was zzso after exposure to radiation doses as low as zzso zzso and was 10 to 20 times more sensitive compared to detection of zzso protein zzso The results are consistent with a zzso sensitive and rapid zzso of zzso at zzso zzso The rapid increase in the nuclear zzso zzso was blocked by the protein zzso zzso inhibitor zzso A but was not blocked by the protein synthesis inhibitor zzso suggesting that zzso 376 was zzso by protein zzso zzso 1 or 2A acting on pre-existing zzso zzso The data suggest that zzso of zzso 376 on zzso nuclear zzso is a sensitive and early signaling event in the response of cells to DNA damage induced by zzso zzso
