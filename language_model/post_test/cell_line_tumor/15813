zzso zzso a zzso zzso isolated from a traditional herbal medicine zzso zzso is known to possess multiple pharmacological zzso In our previous study, zzso had been shown to inhibit zzso cell lung cancer zzso zzso cell migration and invasion via zzso of zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso Here we demonstrated that zzso inhibited the expression of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in tumor growth, zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso The zzso decrease of cellular protein level of zzso was correlated with a rapid zzso degradation of zzso and was accompanied by increased expressions of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and a later decrease of vascular zzso growth factor zzso upon the treatment of zzso The zzso zzso expression appeared to be a consequence of zzso zzso because its DNA binding activity was suppressed by zzso zzso data showed that all these effects of zzso might be zzso via zzso pathway, as demonstrated by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the usage of a pharmacological zzso zzso Furthermore, we zzso the involvement of zzso in zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells and other zzso cell zzso In conclusion, these results highlighted the potential effects of zzso which may be developed as a zzso or an zzso agent for zzso in the zzso
