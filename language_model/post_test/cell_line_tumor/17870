The majority of human zzso zzso and breast zzso express receptors for zzso hormone zzso Their proliferation is zzso and zzso reduced by zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibit the zzso signal zzso of growth factor receptors via zzso of a zzso zzso resulting in zzso of cancer cell zzso zzso of zzso is not zzso Recently we showed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of nuclear zzso zzso and thus reduces the zzso induced by the zzso agent zzso in human zzso and zzso cancer zzso The zzso reduction of zzso zzso was blocked by zzso of zzso zzso into the zzso The present study was conducted to investigate whether zzso of zzso zzso expression reduces zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso of zzso zzso expression results in an increase of zzso zzso in human zzso and zzso zzso and in the human breast cancer cell line zzso These data further demonstrate that zzso zzso suppress zzso drug-induced zzso via zzso of the zzso zzso in these zzso The situation is different with zzso breast cancer zzso After zzso of zzso zzso expression zzso zzso was zzso indicating that zzso zzso do not suppress zzso drug-induced zzso in zzso breast cancer zzso
