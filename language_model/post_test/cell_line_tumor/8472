In our pursuit to develop new potential zzso zzso we designed a combination of structural units of zzso and zzso zzso and a library of zzso derivatives was zzso and zzso zzso evaluations of these molecules over a panel of three human cancer cell lines were carried zzso Few molecules exhibited potent growth zzso action against the treated cancer cell lines at lower zzso zzso zzso An in zzso zzso investigation of these active compounds using zzso human zzso zzso showed that one of the compounds zzso inhibited the zzso activity of the zzso The in zzso study of zzso exemplified its promising action by reducing the prostate weight to the body weight ratio in prostate zzso animal zzso A remarkable decrease in the disruption of zzso of the prostate zzso isolated from zzso treated animal compared to that of the positive control was zzso The molecular interactions with zzso zzso were also supported by molecular zzso zzso Hence this compound can act as a lead zzso to treat zzso zzso
