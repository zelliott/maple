To inhibit zzso dissemination of tumor cells by destroying hydrogen zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso was injected into the zzso cavity of zzso zzso had about a zzso longer retention time within the cavity than unmodified zzso zzso dissemination was evaluated after zzso zzso of zzso a melanoma clone zzso expressing zzso zzso by measuring zzso zzso An zzso injection of zzso just before tumor zzso significantly reduced the number of tumor cells in zzso zzso zzso was less effective, confirming the importance of the retention of the zzso within the cavity for the zzso zzso injected 3 days after tumor zzso was also effective in zzso tumor zzso A real-time quantitative zzso analysis revealed that zzso significantly suppressed the expression of zzso zzso zzso Daily dosing of zzso for 7 days significantly prolonged the survival of zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso which is retained for a long time within the zzso zzso is highly effective in zzso the zzso and proliferation of zzso zzso tumor cells, and in increasing the survival of zzso zzso
