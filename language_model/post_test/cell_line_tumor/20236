zzso stress and zzso dysfunction are two zzso factors often associated with the neurodegenerative process involved in Parkinson's disease zzso zzso zzso zzso is able to cause zzso zzso in experimental models of zzso by an zzso zzso process, the underlying molecular mechanism remains zzso It has been established that some zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are often altered in zzso which suggests a potential role of these zzso in the onset and/or development of this zzso zzso In this study we have used high-resolution zzso to evaluate the effect of zzso on zzso zzso of isolated rat brain zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso to assess the percentage of cell death induced by zzso in human zzso cell line zzso Our results show that zzso affects zzso zzso by causing a reduction in both respiratory control ratio zzso zzso 200 zzso 15 zzso and state 3 zzso zzso zzso 192 zzso 17 zzso with no significant effects on state zzso An zzso in the activity of both complex I and V was also zzso zzso also caused cellular death in human zzso zzso cells zzso zzso 100 zzso 9 zzso Both zzso and zzso have been shown to protect against the toxic effects caused by zzso on zzso zzso However, whereas zzso protects against zzso cellular death, zzso enhances its zzso The here reported data suggest that both zzso zzso and zzso radical could account for zzso zzso Furthermore, factors reducing the rate of zzso zzso to its zzso appear to enhance its zzso
