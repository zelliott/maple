The X protein of zzso B virus zzso exhibits numerous activities affecting gene transcription, zzso signal zzso cell proliferation and zzso Recent studies showed that zzso induced zzso by causing loss of zzso membrane potential, suggesting that zzso zzso is zzso However, the molecular mechanism of the gene in this zzso is still far from zzso In this study, we demonstrated that introduction of zzso into a zzso zzso cell line, zzso caused zzso and zzso the cell to zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso an zzso zzso family zzso prevented cell death dragged by zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso cells reduced zzso zzso and protein levels, but did not regulate other zzso family zzso zzso zzso itself did not affect zzso distribution of zzso zzso an enhanced release of zzso c from zzso was observed when zzso was zzso Thus, the introduction of zzso into zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells to zzso cell killing, and these processes may accomplish through zzso zzso expression and subsequently promoting zzso c release from zzso
