zzso derivatives have been shown to be able to induce growth zzso in cancer zzso In the present study, we zzso zzso compound, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is a novel zzso zzso zzso displayed zzso effects on several human tumor cell zzso Human zzso zzso cell line was selected as a model to illustrate zzso zzso effect and its potential zzso since it was the highest susceptible cell line to zzso It was shown that treatment with zzso resulted in generation of zzso oxygen species, disruption of zzso membrane potential zzso and cell death in zzso zzso zzso induced zzso could be prevented by zzso vitamin C and zzso zzso transition inhibitor zzso zzso zzso A could also protect the zzso induced collapse of zzso in zzso cells, while vitamin C did not show similar zzso The results suggest that zzso could inhibit zzso cell zzso and the cell death may occur through the zzso of zzso functions regulated by zzso oxygen zzso It appears that collapse of zzso prior to zzso zzso oxygen species arose during the zzso process in our experimental zzso
