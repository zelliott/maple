The expression of zzso characteristic of various zzso very often leads to changes in the zzso adhesive zzso Thus, we sought to find out if zzso expressed in zzso but zzso cells, differs in its functional properties that could contribute to variations in zzso zzso In our work, zzso of an zzso force of a single zzso zzso zzso with the same zzso both on a surface of living zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso of zzso cancer, were carried out with the use of an atomic force zzso The results show the enhanced zzso level in zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso obtained for zzso one), confirmed by the Western zzso and the zzso zzso The effect was accompanied by changes in zzso properties of an individual zzso zzso Lower zzso force values zzso in zzso cells reveal less stable zzso complexes, as compared to zzso cells zzso This suggests the zzso changes in a structure of the binding site of the zzso located at the zzso domain of zzso
