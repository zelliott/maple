Silver zzso zzso have zzso zzso However, whether and how these particles could inhibit the growth of acute zzso leukemia zzso cells is zzso In the present study, we prepared zzso with various sizes and investigated their zzso effect on zzso zzso We found that zzso could inhibit the viability of zzso cells including the zzso from zzso zzso zzso caused the production of zzso oxygen species zzso losses of zzso membrane potential zzso DNA damage and zzso Both vitamin C zzso zzso and zzso zzso could completely reverse the generation of zzso upon zzso however only zzso but not zzso C could protect the cells from losses of zzso DNA damage and zzso zzso Similar results were obtained when cells were treated with silver zzso zzso As zzso was not only an zzso to zzso zzso but also a silver zzso zzso these data supported the model that both generation of zzso and release of silver zzso played critical roles in the zzso zzso effect against zzso zzso Taken together, this work zzso the zzso effect of zzso on zzso cells and their underlying mechanism and might have significant impact on zzso zzso
