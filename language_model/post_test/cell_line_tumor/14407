While zzso II zzso zzso has been shown to inhibit migration of zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso it has remained unclear whether it stimulates or zzso zzso behavior of zzso zzso Since we previously found an involvement of the zzso system zzso in the zzso potential in zzso cells zzso zzso via the zzso II type 1 zzso zzso in the present study we investigated the effects of zzso II on zzso cell zzso in zzso using zzso cell culture zzso zzso II zzso promoted migration and invasion by a zzso cell line and zzso random cell mobility on zzso zzso zzso showed zzso II to activate the zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso II effects on cell migration were abolished by a selective zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso The present results suggest that zzso zzso migration and invasion of zzso cells probably involves zzso following binding to the zzso
