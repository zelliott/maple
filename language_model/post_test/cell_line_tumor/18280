zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein involved in the regulation of transcription, translation, and zzso zzso In recent years, several laboratories have demonstrated that zzso is directly involved in the cellular response to zzso zzso zzso zzso is increased in tumor cell lines resistant to zzso and the level of nuclear expression of zzso is zzso of drug resistance and patient outcome in breast tumors, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso binds to several DNA repair zzso in zzso including human zzso III zzso Human zzso is a zzso DNA zzso zzso involved in base zzso zzso In this study, we show that zzso binds specifically to the zzso domain of zzso providing a mechanism by which zzso stimulates zzso zzso Indeed, zzso strongly stimulates in zzso the activity of zzso toward DNA duplex zzso containing oxidized zzso zzso prone to be present in zzso treated zzso We also observed an increase in zzso complex formation in the zzso zzso zzso cell line treated with zzso light and zzso Such an increase was not observed with zzso C or the zzso I inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso against either zzso or zzso increased cellular sensitivity to zzso and zzso but not to zzso zzso An zzso zzso against zzso increased zzso zzso In contrast, an zzso against zzso did zzso Finally, zzso against zzso zzso zzso in otherwise zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso is a relevant target to zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso tumor zzso
