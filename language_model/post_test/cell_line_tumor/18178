zzso zzso cell zzso zzso is the most common zzso tumor in the oral and maxillofacial zzso The mechanism of zzso of zzso is still zzso In zzso study on zzso cell lines, especially derived from immortalized oral zzso cells, is a very useful strategy to understand the mechanism of zzso Based on our previous human immortalized oral zzso cell zzso line, obtained from normal oral zzso cells by zzso of zzso zzso zzso a new zzso cell line, zzso zzso was established from the zzso by induction with zzso The characteristics of the zzso cells such as cell zzso zzso proliferation ability, invasion ability, and zzso were zzso The zzso cells lost contact zzso with uncontrolled cell division and obvious cell zzso they were zzso in shape and zzso in size with increased ratio between nucleus and zzso Increased zzso ability and invasion ability were confirmed by the cell proliferation analysis and cell invasion zzso zzso The zzso of well to moderately differentiated zzso cell zzso was confirmed in the nude mice experiments zzso Increased expression of zzso zzso proteins and obvious correlation with decreased expression of zzso and zzso proteins was also confirmed by Western zzso Thus, this zzso cell line induced by zzso from the zzso line is a useful tool to study the mechanism of zzso of zzso in zzso for future zzso and zzso zzso It is also the first in zzso zzso cell line of zzso in China derived from immortalized oral zzso zzso
