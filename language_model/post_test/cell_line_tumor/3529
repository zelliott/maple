zzso acid zzso zzso are potentially well suited for the therapeutic targeting of drug zzso controlled release zzso particles in a zzso or zzso zzso We zzso a zzso composed of controlled release zzso zzso and zzso and examined its efficacy for targeted delivery to prostate cancer zzso Specifically, we zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a terminal zzso acid functional group zzso and zzso zzso zzso (as a model zzso within zzso zzso These zzso have the following desirable zzso zzso negative surface charge zzso zzso 3 zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which may minimize zzso interaction with the zzso charged zzso acid zzso zzso zzso acid groups on the particle surface for potential modification and zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso presence of zzso on particle surface, which enhances circulating zzso while contributing to decreased zzso in zzso zzso Next, we generated zzso zzso with zzso zzso that bind to the zzso membrane zzso a well-known prostate cancer tumor marker that is zzso on prostate zzso zzso zzso We demonstrated that these zzso can efficiently target and get taken up by the prostate zzso zzso cells, which express the zzso membrane zzso protein zzso increase in binding versus control, zzso zzso 150 cells per zzso In contrast to zzso cells, the zzso of these particles is not enhanced in cells that do not express the zzso membrane zzso zzso To our knowledge, this represents the first report of targeted drug delivery with zzso zzso
