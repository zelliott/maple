Treatment options for patients with zzso breast cancer zzso are largely limited to systemic zzso which have shown disappointing efficacy in the zzso zzso Here, we undertook a comprehensive evaluation of the activity of zzso a potent inhibitor of zzso in this zzso 

The zzso and zzso activity of zzso was investigated using zzso cell lines and zzso zzso zzso drug analyses were performed with zzso agents and zzso effects on DNA damage and zzso disruption were assessed in zzso zzso efficacy was assessed in zzso zzso and objective tumor responses were evaluated in patients with zzso zzso undergoing zzso zzso 

zzso simultaneously zzso multiple zzso pathways to zzso reduce cell viability in zzso cell lines, and suppressed lung zzso in experimental zzso zzso zzso the zzso activity of zzso via enhanced DNA damage and zzso arrest, zzso superior efficacy to the zzso regimen in zzso zzso zzso also promoted zzso catastrophe and zzso in combination with zzso in zzso and these effects translated to significantly improved zzso activity in zzso zzso tumor shrinkage of zzso lung and zzso zzso were seen in patients on zzso zzso 

The zzso activity profile and clinical evidence of tumor zzso suggest that zzso offers considerable promise as a new therapeutic candidate to target zzso
