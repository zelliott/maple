Data are accumulating to support a role for zzso zzso stem cells zzso in breast cancer zzso however, to date most studies have relied on zzso zzso from zzso zzso There is a particular need to investigate the role of zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso breast cancer, which develops at a disproportionate rate in zzso African-American women with a gain in zzso The aim of this study was to better understand how breast zzso zzso zzso contribute to the progression of zzso breast zzso by relying on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso human cells that upon transplantation into nude mice resemble this tumor zzso In zzso results suggested that zzso may contribute to breast cancer progression in multiple zzso zzso readily penetrate zzso zzso components in part through their expression of zzso zzso 1 and 3, promote the invasion of zzso cells and efficiently zzso zzso cells via a zzso zzso zzso As mixed zzso zzso zzso the growth, invasion and zzso of zzso tumors, yet these resident stem cells showed no zzso effect on the progression of zzso zzso zzso While zzso form zzso structures within zzso both in zzso and in zzso and zzso zzso cells, there appeared to be no difference between zzso mixed zzso and zzso zzso with regard to zzso or zzso zzso zzso our data suggest that zzso may contribute to the progression of zzso breast zzso by stimulating growth and invasion but not zzso or zzso
