zzso was initially identified as a zzso gene in prostate zzso It is a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of membrane zzso As part of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso by negative regulation of zzso However, the underlying regulatory mechanism has not yet been fully zzso zzso protein 1 zzso which was previously known as zzso protein in zzso promoted zzso via enhancement of zzso zzso To better understand how zzso is involved in the negative regulation of zzso we here examined the function of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and the consequences of this process, focusing on zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

We used the human prostate cancer cell line zzso which was devoid of zzso zzso zzso cells zzso clone zzso and zzso zzso clones zzso clone zzso and zzso were picked after stable zzso with zzso zzso and selection in 800 zzso zzso zzso levels were assessed by zzso and zzso reporter gene activity was measured by zzso zzso zzso We followed tumor growth in zzso and zzso was performed for detection of zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso 

We demonstrated that zzso factor zzso zzso and zzso expression were significantly inhibited by restoration of zzso in zzso zzso In response to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and the level of von zzso zzso protein was significantly zzso In an in zzso zzso model, zzso inhibited the expression of zzso and zzso 

These novel observations may indicate that zzso exerts profound zzso activity in the tumor zzso process via zzso of zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso degradation and, ultimately, decreased zzso zzso
