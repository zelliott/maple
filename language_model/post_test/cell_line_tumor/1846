Core 2 zzso zzso forms an zzso branch in zzso zzso 2 zzso of cell surface zzso zzso zzso tumors acquire highly zzso zzso by surviving longer in host blood zzso However, the detailed mechanisms underlying this increased survival remain zzso In this study, we report that the expression of zzso in zzso tumors positively zzso with tumor progression and that zzso tumor zzso zzso 1 zzso carrying core 2 zzso plays an important role in the evasion from natural killer zzso cell zzso In zzso zzso tumor cells, heavily core 2 zzso zzso carries zzso in its zzso and zzso binds to zzso through this zzso The binding of zzso to zzso in zzso core 2 zzso zzso the interaction of the tumor cells with zzso cells and interferes with the access of tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso to the tumor cell zzso These effects of zzso carrying core 2 zzso on zzso cell attack facilitate zzso tumor cells to evade zzso cell immunity and survive longer in host blood zzso We reveal that zzso carrying core 2 zzso thus functions as a molecular shield against zzso cell attack, thereby promoting zzso tumor zzso
