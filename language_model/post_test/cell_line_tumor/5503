zzso zzso is the most common primary zzso bone tumor in children, zzso of whom develop lung zzso despite aggressive zzso Our objective was to develop a mouse model of zzso for zzso studies that zzso incorporates the natural history of zzso including tumor growth in bone and development of lung zzso and zzso is amenable to zzso detection zzso A human zzso cell line that expresses high levels of zzso was zzso Following subcutaneous injection, nine out of ten mice showed tumor zzso Eight out of ten mice showed tumor growth following zzso injection into the zzso zzso Thirty percent of mice showed pulmonary zzso by zzso imaging eight to 10 weeks following zzso zzso Animals receiving zzso treatment showed reduced tumor volume compared to animals treated with vehicle zzso This model allows real-time detection of tumors and can be used to study mechanisms of zzso zzso and test new therapeutic zzso
