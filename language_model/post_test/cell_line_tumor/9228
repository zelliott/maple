Because zzso zzso cells of the tumor zzso represent an interesting target to zzso the zzso effect of zzso therapy, we recently described the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso via a zzso zzso acid zzso to a vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and showed that zzso binds to zzso Because peptides often display low stability in biological zzso we examined the in zzso and in zzso stability of this zzso by zzso liquid zzso and zzso laser zzso zzso of flight mass zzso zzso was stable in zzso in human and mouse plasma for at least 24 h at 37 degrees C but, following zzso injection in zzso nude mice, was zzso in zzso to various rates, depending on the organ zzso zzso was identified as the main zzso product, and zzso studies suggested that its appearance in plasma mainly resulted from the degradation of the zzso zzso into zzso of the zzso zzso According to in zzso cell culture experiments, zzso was also significantly zzso after incorporation in human zzso vein zzso cells zzso mainly into zzso and to a lesser extent into zzso and zzso zzso mostly localized into zzso and when zzso were treated with the zzso zzso inhibitor ammonium zzso this resulted in a significant decrease of the zzso zzso This study provides essential information for the choice of the time of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso not to be exceeded and for the future design of more stable zzso
