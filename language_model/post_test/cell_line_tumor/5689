No circulating markers are routinely used for zzso zzso The objective of this pilot study was to investigate whether zzso media zzso from zzso cancer cell lines contains potential zzso that, when measured in clinical zzso have diagnostic or zzso zzso 

Comparative zzso PAGE profiling of CM from zzso cell zzso zzso and normal zzso cultures identified zzso D that was subsequently validated in urine samples from 239 patients and healthy and benign disease zzso 

zzso zzso D was found to be significantly associated with overall zzso zzso ratio, HR, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso survival zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso patients on zzso zzso An optimal cut point zzso zzso zzso zzso around which to zzso patients by zzso was zzso zzso zzso equal zzso and below this value was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso On multivariable analysis using zzso zzso zzso D showed some evidence of independent zzso value for zzso zzso ratio test zzso although requiring further validation in larger patient numbers with sufficient statistical power to determine independent zzso 

These data establish an important proof of principle and show the potential of zzso zzso zzso D may be of value as a zzso urinary zzso for zzso alone or in zzso
