The dismal prognosis of zzso brain tumors drives the development of new treatment zzso In view of the multiple activities of growth zzso hormone zzso we hypothesized that zzso with a zzso zzso zzso might increase the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells to subsequent treatment with the zzso drug, zzso zzso This concept was zzso by our findings, in zzso showing that the combination of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited the growth of zzso tumors, transplanted into nude mice, more than zzso zzso In zzso the zzso of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso effects of zzso on cell zzso diminished cell size and zzso and promoted zzso zzso as shown by zzso zzso proliferation zzso zzso multiplex zzso and cell zzso zzso zzso studies further revealed that the zzso with zzso zzso evoked differentiation decreasing the expression of the zzso stem cell zzso zzso and zzso the zzso maturation marker, zzso The zzso zzso also reduced the release of zzso regulators of zzso growth, such as zzso basic and zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies confirmed the strong zzso activity zzso in zzso decrease in zzso and zzso and zzso potential zzso in zzso zzso of the combination of zzso zzso and zzso These findings indicate that the zzso zzso can zzso the zzso activity of the traditional zzso drug, zzso by multiple mechanisms including the induction of differentiation of cancer zzso
