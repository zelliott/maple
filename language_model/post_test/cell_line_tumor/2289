zzso of transplanted model of zzso zzso zzso in rabbits and investigation the rule of zzso vessels zzso 

After establishment of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso were transplanted into the zzso zzso zzso in sixty zzso white rabbits to establish transplanted tumor zzso zzso zzso growth zzso zzso label zzso was performed to observe zzso zzso Number density, volume density of zzso periphery region of zzso normal region and zzso region were measured using computer image analysis zzso 

There was no zzso vessels in zzso zzso zzso the zzso vessels number density, volume density in periphery region was much more than normal zzso Their cavities were zzso The zzso had statistical significance ( zzso 

The rule of zzso formation in rabbit zzso zzso zzso model zzso rule of zzso formation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso at periphery region of zzso is associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso of it at periphery region of zzso may be useful in predicting zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso This conclusion provides theoretical basis for utility of the zzso medicines which inhibit zzso formation in animal zzso
