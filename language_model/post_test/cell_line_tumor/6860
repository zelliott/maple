We have investigated the role of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso using the acute zzso leukemia cell line zzso together with zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso stimulation resulted in a rapid zzso zzso of zzso accompanied by a change in its binding preferences to zzso On zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso and associated with zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso confirmed that zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso whereas zzso protein zzso associated with zzso In addition, studies with zzso point zzso revealed a decisive role of zzso and zzso in binding to zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso and zzso was accompanied by strong nuclear zzso of zzso Taken together, this report provides the first evidence that zzso zzso of zzso plays a crucial role in binding to zzso and its zzso zzso Moreover, both effects are zzso by application of zzso
