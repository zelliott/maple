zzso zzso zzso is the most common primary liver cancer and often forms zzso which are the most important zzso zzso For further zzso of the mechanism underlying the progression and zzso of zzso a culture system mimicking the in zzso tumor zzso is zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso ability of zzso cells cultured within zzso gel zzso zzso In the culture system, zzso cells formed zzso by proliferation and maintained in nuclear zzso The gene and protein expression of zzso molecules was increased in zzso zzso compared with the traditional zzso zzso Furthermore, several gene expression levels in zzso zzso culture system were even closer to liver cancer zzso More importantly, in zzso invasion zzso showed that the invasion cells derived from zzso beads was zzso higher than zzso zzso Our results indicated that the in zzso three-dimensional zzso model based on zzso beads increased zzso ability compared with zzso culture, even partly zzso the in zzso tumor zzso Moreover, due to the zzso preparation conditions, steady characteristics and production at zzso the zzso zzso zzso model would become an important tool used in the zzso screening of zzso drugs and the zzso mechanism zzso
