zzso is a zzso zzso that is capable of inducing zzso in a wide variety of cancer cells but not in normal zzso Among various molecular strategies by which cancer cells evade zzso zzso signaling represents a dominant survival zzso In this report, we investigated the role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso death in human zzso cancer zzso We observed that zzso cells had very low level of zzso active zzso and were sensitive to zzso whereas zzso and zzso cells had higher levels of zzso active zzso and were resistant to zzso zzso of zzso active zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso reversed cellular resistance to zzso However, zzso zzso active zzso into zzso cells increased zzso activity and inhibited zzso zzso These results suggest that elevated zzso activity protects zzso and zzso cells from zzso zzso and the zzso signaling might inhibit zzso zzso Thus, the zzso of zzso activity by combining pharmacological drugs or genetic zzso of the zzso expression could induce cellular responsiveness to TRAIL and zzso signaling zzso could serve as a novel target for therapeutic intervention in zzso zzso
