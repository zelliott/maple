The objective of the current study was to investigate the regulation of zzso signaling and tumor zzso by zzso inhibitor zzso in zzso zzso of zzso on zzso zzso zzso cell proliferation and vessel function were evaluated using mouse zzso zzso zzso cell line and zzso zzso mouse zzso We found that zzso efficiently inhibited zzso zzso increased zzso zzso but decreased zzso zzso zzso treatment enhanced zzso cell proliferation when used combined with zzso but exerted no effect if used zzso In zzso zzso mouse models, zzso treatment increased tumor vessel density but compromised vessel function, as evidenced by poor zzso and aggravated zzso zzso zzso treatment results in an zzso of tumor vessel density from vessel function and suppresses zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso presents a novel therapeutic approach for zzso
