We have previously reported that zzso zzso compounds decreased global zzso zzso zzso and silenced the zzso zzso in zzso Chinese zzso zzso However, the nature of this zzso is still not zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso exposure increases global zzso zzso and zzso both of which are critical marks for DNA zzso and long-term gene zzso In contrast to the zzso of global zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased the expression and activity of zzso zzso specific zzso zzso Further investigation demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso with the removal of zzso zzso in zzso and directly decreased the activity of a zzso zzso zzso zzso in nuclear extract in zzso These results are the first to show a zzso zzso zzso activity dependent on both iron and zzso Exposure to zzso zzso also increased zzso zzso at the zzso locus in zzso cells and zzso the expression of the zzso zzso An extended zzso zzso exposure led to increased frequency of the zzso zzso zzso which was readily reversed by treatment with zzso agent zzso zzso our data strongly indicate that zzso zzso induce zzso zzso by increasing zzso zzso zzso and this effect is zzso by the zzso of zzso zzso
