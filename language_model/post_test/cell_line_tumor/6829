The zzso zzso zzso has been previously shown to have zzso effects through unknown zzso In the current study, we examined whether zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was transplanted into the subcutaneous zzso of nude mice, and zzso at varying doses, was zzso zzso and Western zzso were used to analyze the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at doses of 80 zzso 160 zzso and 320 zzso markedly inhibited the growth of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso and protein expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and inhibited the zzso and protein expression of the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso administration was associated with zzso of both zzso (which activates zzso and zzso (which zzso zzso These results are consistent with the possibility that zzso mediates zzso of tumor growth through zzso of the zzso zzso and suggests that zzso should be explored for use as an zzso agent for zzso
