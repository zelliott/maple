zzso zzso scattering zzso zzso was applied to analyze zzso zzso zzso on the plasma membrane zzso of sensitive zzso zzso or zzso resistant zzso zzso zzso The addition of silver zzso to zzso cells revealed an enhanced zzso scattering of zzso zzso of zzso DNA induced a total extinction of zzso zzso intensity for both cell lines, which revealed an zzso of zzso on plasma zzso A zzso higher zzso zzso intensity was observed for zzso zzso suggesting a tight zzso zzso in the plasma membrane zzso Fluorescence zzso zzso confirmed a relative zzso zzso around plasma membrane for zzso zzso After 30 zzso at 4 degrees C, a zzso decrease of the zzso zzso scattering was observed for zzso zzso contrary to zzso zzso zzso with zzso alcohol revealed a zzso decrease of membrane zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso This additional zzso zzso should zzso to the drug bound to an unstable site on the zzso R zzso This study showed that zzso zzso could be a direct method to reveal drug zzso to the membrane environment of living zzso
