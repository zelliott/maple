The next-generation sequencing technology allows identification and cataloging of almost all zzso even those with only one or a few transcripts per zzso To understand the chemotherapy response program in zzso cancer cells at deep transcript sequencing levels, we applied two next-generation sequencing technologies to study two zzso chemotherapy response models: the in zzso acquired zzso cell line model zzso and zzso and the in zzso zzso cancer tissue resistant zzso We identified zzso signatures zzso zzso that are significantly zzso expressed between zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso zzso Our database offers the first comprehensive view of the digital zzso of zzso cancer cell lines and zzso with different chemotherapy response zzso
