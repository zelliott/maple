zzso zzso zzso is a highly potent inhibitor of prostate specific membrane zzso zzso with a rapid in zzso clearance profile from zzso zzso including zzso but its use for imaging of zzso is zzso by an zzso zzso zzso zzso competition, which compromises its specific binding to the zzso zzso of a targeting zzso on a single entity has been recognized as a practical way for imaging sensitivity zzso zzso we demonstrate a zzso approach based on a zzso zzso zzso scaffold to overcome the zzso zzso competition thus enabling the utility of zzso zzso for in zzso detection of zzso and imaging zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso and labeled with zzso for in zzso and in zzso zzso A zzso enhancement of zzso binding affinity was observed for zzso as compared to zzso from the zzso competitive binding zzso performed on zzso zzso In zzso PET imaging studies were conducted on mouse zzso models established with a zzso cell line, zzso and zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso showed significantly higher zzso tumor zzso than zzso at 1, 4, and 24 h zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, tumor zzso of zzso remained steady out to 24 h zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at 1, 4, and 24 h zzso respectively), while zzso showed a great decrease from 1 to 4 h zzso The zzso imaging specificity of both zzso and zzso was demonstrated by their low zzso in zzso tumors zzso and zzso and further confirmed by a significant signal reduction in zzso zzso tumors in the blockade zzso In addition, the zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso of zzso was found to be in a positive linear correlation with the tumor size zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for 1 zzso 4 zzso and 24 h zzso This may render the probe with potential application in the management of patients with prostate zzso
