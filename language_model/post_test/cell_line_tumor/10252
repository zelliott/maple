zzso receptors zzso play an important role in innate immunity against invading zzso Although zzso signaling has been indicated to protect cells from infection of several zzso the role of zzso in zzso virus zzso replication is still zzso In the present study, we examined the replication of zzso zzso 2 zzso by challenging zzso cells zzso with different zzso zzso zzso of zzso showed an zzso effect, while zzso of other zzso zzso (including zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso did not show a significant zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment prior to viral infection or zzso but not zzso significantly zzso virus zzso zzso with zzso reduced viral zzso expression and viral zzso positive cells, accompanying an induction of the type I zzso zzso and type III zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso alone successfully restored the zzso replication of zzso The zzso effects, including zzso induction and zzso suppression, were significantly reversed by zzso zzso further suggesting that zzso is the dominant factor involved in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Our study presented the first evidence to show that zzso of zzso is effective in blocking zzso replication via zzso providing an experimental clue that zzso may be a promising zzso agent against zzso infection and might be zzso for clinical zzso
