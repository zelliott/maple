Multiple myeloma is an incurable disease requiring the development of effective therapies which can be used zzso We have zzso the potential for manipulating the zzso signaling zzso as a target for zzso the growth of multiple myeloma zzso 

As a model system, we primarily used the zzso multiple myeloma cell line zzso which can be grown both in zzso and in zzso Human multiple myeloma cell lines zzso zzso and the zzso precursor acute zzso leukemia cell line zzso were used only for in zzso zzso Cell death was assessed by flow zzso and western zzso analysis after treatment with zzso zzso agents zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso We followed tumor growth in zzso after zzso treatment by imaging zzso zzso cells transplanted zzso in zzso nude zzso 

In contrast to the effect on zzso cells, 50 zzso zzso more than tripled the death of zzso cells after 24 h in zzso zzso induced cell death to a similar extent in the human myeloma cell lines zzso and zzso zzso cell death had all the typical hallmarks of zzso including changes in the zzso membrane potential and zzso of zzso 3, zzso 9 and zzso zzso also inhibited the growth of multiple myeloma cells in a mouse model in zzso 

zzso of zzso levels of zzso kills multiple myeloma cells in zzso and zzso development of multiple myeloma in zzso This strongly suggests that compounds zzso the zzso signaling zzso may be useful in the field of multiple zzso
