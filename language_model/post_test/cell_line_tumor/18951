zzso is a zzso zzso zzso often zzso in human zzso thus making it an attractive drug zzso One mechanism by which zzso deregulation leads to cancer is through zzso zzso zzso small molecules capable of targeting these zzso could offer therapeutic benefits for affected zzso zzso was recently described and reported to inhibit the activity of the zzso and some zzso forms of zzso whereas other zzso are resistant to zzso We identified a novel series of zzso small zzso zzso that are active against multiple zzso previously identified in zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso is active against zzso zzso as well as several zzso zzso zzso signaling in zzso and zzso zzso cells, and zzso tumor growth in these two models grown as zzso The crystal structures of zzso and zzso bound to zzso zzso have been zzso The zzso structure reveals a novel binding mode compared with other published zzso zzso and zzso The zzso binds the zzso zzso and then extends into a new zzso binding zzso This binding site is created by a significant movement of the zzso and so represents an inactive zzso of the zzso zzso Thus, our results demonstrate that it is possible to identify and design zzso that will likely be active against zzso found in different zzso
