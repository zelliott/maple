The effects of the zzso inhibitor zzso on cell viability and proliferation events have been zzso in zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or long-term (7 zzso exposure of zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a zzso zzso of cell proliferation that was not modified by zzso and zzso zzso antagonists, or zzso by zzso and was not related to induction of zzso By zzso the distribution profile of cell populations within the cell cycle following treatment with 10 zzso zzso a reduction of cells in the zzso zzso of the cycle and a parallel increase of the zzso population were zzso In addition, the expression of two zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso E and zzso B, was significantly reduced in zzso zzso In contrast, the expression of the cell cycle inhibitor zzso rapidly (6 zzso increased following exposure to the zzso Finally, zzso increased the expression of the zzso marker zzso in selected zzso of zzso cells, suggesting that the effect on cell proliferation by zzso may correlate to a trend to zzso zzso
