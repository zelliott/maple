To investigate the influence of DNA zzso zzso zzso on the expression of zzso D1 gene and zzso of its promoters and to investigate the function of zzso 

Human zzso zzso cells of the line zzso were cultured and randomly divided into 3 groups: experimental group zzso with zzso to silence the zzso control group zzso with control zzso and normal group without zzso The zzso rate of zzso was detected by zzso zzso zzso method was used to measure the survival rate of the zzso zzso Western zzso and cell proliferation zzso were performed to evaluate the expression of zzso D1 and cell zzso zzso specific zzso zzso was performed to investigate whether the promoter of zzso D1 was zzso 

Fluorescence zzso showed that the zzso rate of zzso was over zzso zzso method showed that 24 h and 36 h after zzso the A value and survival rate of the zzso cells of the experimental group were both significantly higher than those of the control d normal groups (all P zzso zzso Western zzso showed that the expression levels of zzso and zzso D1 of the experimental group decreased significantly compared with the control and the normal zzso MSP showed no obvious change of the state of zzso among the 3 zzso 

zzso may regulate the expression and the function of zzso D1 gene in the human zzso zzso cells, but does not change its zzso zzso zzso may play their role as a signal zzso element rather than as a DNA zzso
