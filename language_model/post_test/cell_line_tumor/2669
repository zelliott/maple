The development of pharmacological agents able to counteract the mechanisms of zzso resistance in zzso has remained a major goal for the past ten zzso Our purpose was to find zzso resistance reversal agents less toxic than zzso among various synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso heat shock 90 inhibitor zzso zzso base zzso of zzso and among some naturally occurring plant derived zzso and zzso zzso The first part of this thesis presents the zzso of zzso resistance through zzso of the zzso zzso pump in various cell zzso In general, the newly identified zzso resistance zzso were able to enhance the zzso activity of selected zzso drugs in a synergistic or additive way in in zzso zzso The in zzso activity of zzso base zzso of zzso was confirmed by further in zzso efficacy studies in zzso zzso As an alternative way of zzso effect, zzso zzso of resistance zzso were zzso The zzso zzso 13 was the most promising zzso zzso on mouse zzso zzso Human zzso was used in a modified in zzso model for characterizing zzso compounds with zzso effect on human lung cancer zzso All the six zzso zzso zzso reduced the promotion in zzso , except zzso D, decreased zzso expression of zzso to prevent progression of tumor zzso
