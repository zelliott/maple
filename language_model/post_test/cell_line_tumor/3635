zzso zzso modifications regulate zzso switching between different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso define different functional zzso zzso and often do so in a zzso zzso The zzso is a unique zzso locus that mediates multiple segregation functions, including zzso formation, zzso movements, sister cohesion and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is embedded in zzso and contains blocks of zzso zzso zzso zzso with blocks of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso that provides a structural and functional foundation for the zzso Here, we demonstrate that the spectrum of zzso modifications present in human and zzso zzso zzso zzso is distinct from that of both zzso and zzso zzso We speculate that this distinct modification pattern contributes to the unique domain organization and three-dimensional structure of zzso regions, and/or to the zzso information that determines zzso zzso
