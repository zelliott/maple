zzso zzso is involved in zzso many important functions relevant to zzso biology through the actions of the zzso receptors zzso alpha and zzso To further understand the mechanisms of zzso regulation, we used zzso and reverse zzso analyses of zzso zzso or zzso cells and identified zzso protein 1 zzso as a major zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso involved in the control of zzso zzso Although zzso zzso levels rapidly increased after 2 h of zzso treatment in both zzso lines, a sustained induction was only observed in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso sequence revealed an zzso response element and a zzso site located within the first zzso zzso zzso analyses demonstrated that zzso zzso binding to the zzso 1 zzso region was zzso whereas zzso binding was zzso consistent with the zzso time zzso Interestingly, transient zzso and zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso induction by zzso only requires the zzso site, whereas zzso zzso both the zzso and zzso response elements binding sites for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing a deletion of the zzso zzso function 1 zzso resulted in a zzso zzso induction profile similar to that of wild type zzso Further, zzso and zzso zzso analyses also demonstrated that zzso zzso induction is zzso for both zzso zzso These results describe an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso which in part, is explained by the differential activity of zzso zzso and zzso element zzso
