Both zzso and Aurora A zzso have been shown to be important targets for intervention for cancer zzso We report here that zzso A zzso a specific zzso zzso interferes with zzso progression and bipolar zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso defects in zzso zzso and formation of either zzso zzso or zzso zzso On the basis of gene expression array studies, we identified Aurora A as one of the genes regulated zzso by zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso pathway, either by zzso inhibitor zzso or by zzso A, dramatically zzso the promoter activity of Aurora A, whereas the zzso target of zzso inhibitor has little effect, suggesting that zzso might be responsible for zzso Aurora A for zzso zzso Further analysis of the Aurora A promoter region indicates that the zzso element but not the zzso element is required for zzso zzso zzso control of Aurora zzso zzso of Aurora A in cells treated with zzso A zzso the zzso arrest and the defects in bipolar zzso formation induced by zzso zzso Our studies suggest that that zzso may promote zzso progression through the zzso regulation of Aurora zzso
