zzso zzso is frequently zzso in zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso mice implies zzso involvement in zzso zzso 

In this study, we first assessed the association of zzso expression with the zzso population in liver zzso from 30 zzso patients using zzso 

The zzso expression was zzso into three patterns - one with zzso zzso and two with zzso zzso (one with unclear membrane zzso and one with clear membrane zzso designated zzso The number of zzso that were stained with resident zzso zzso or zzso zzso markers was counted for each zzso expression zzso 

zzso zzso was observed in zzso of the zzso zzso No significant differences were observed in the number of zzso zzso cells among the three expression zzso In contrast, the zzso pattern showed a significantly higher number of zzso cells compared with the other two patterns, most of which tended to take on the zzso of zzso zzso A second experiment conducted to compare zzso zzso between the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso cell line and its parent zzso cell line revealed that the increase in zzso was zzso by membrane expression of zzso 

The observations suggest that the increased zzso in the zzso pattern are likely to be recruited zzso not resident zzso and that the expression of zzso in the membrane is involved in zzso zzso
