Our recent studies of zzso zzso expression signatures demonstrated that zzso zzso was significantly zzso in zzso cell zzso zzso clinical specimens and was a putative zzso zzso in zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate the functional significance of zzso in cancer cells and to identify novel zzso cancer pathways and target genes in zzso zzso of zzso was significantly zzso in zzso zzso compared with adjacent zzso zzso Restoration of mature zzso in zzso cell lines zzso and zzso revealed significant zzso of cell zzso migration and invasion, suggesting that zzso functioned as a tumor zzso To identify zzso molecular pathways and targets, we used gene expression analysis zzso of zzso clinical specimens and zzso zzso zzso and in zzso database zzso Our data demonstrated that 79 signaling pathways were significantly regulated by zzso zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso career family 2 member 1 zzso was a candidate target of zzso zzso The zzso gene provides instructions for producing zzso zzso protein type 1 zzso zzso reporter zzso showed that zzso directly regulated zzso In zzso clinical zzso the expression of zzso zzso was significantly higher in cancer zzso than in zzso zzso A significant inverse correlation was recognized between zzso and zzso expression zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Loss of zzso zzso enhanced zzso cell zzso migration and invasion through targeting zzso The identification of novel zzso zzso molecular pathways and targets has provided new insights into zzso zzso and zzso
