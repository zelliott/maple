The zzso of highly efficient zzso complexes toward a range of cell lines, including drug-resistant cells, are reported along with preliminary zzso zzso Five zzso complexes were investigated toward eight different human and zzso zzso cell lines, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso skin, and zzso The zzso complexes are more active toward the cells analyzed than zzso and the known titanium compound zzso zzso , and no cell line resistant to the zzso complexes was zzso Moreover, the zzso complexes are highly active toward both zzso zzso and zzso zzso human zzso cancer cell zzso Similarly, the zzso complexes are zzso toward zzso zzso mouse zzso cell lines zzso and zzso zzso minimal or no activity was observed toward primary zzso cells zzso zzso heart, liver, zzso zzso and zzso supporting selectivity for cancer zzso Additionally, the zzso complexes maintain high zzso for up to 24 h following exposure to cell culture zzso whereas reference complexes zzso zzso and zzso zzso rapidly lose much of their activity upon exposure to zzso within zzso zzso The zzso of zzso followed by zzso arrest in zzso phase is likely one mechanism of action of the zzso zzso Taken together, the results indicate that these compounds are selectively toxic to cancer cells and are able to circumvent two independent mechanisms of drug resistance, thus expanding the scope of their potential medicinal zzso
