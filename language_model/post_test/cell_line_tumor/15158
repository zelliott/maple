zzso is an important zzso zzso protein which interacts with membrane proteins and plays a role in the membrane zzso However, it is unknown whether it is involved in the response to zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso In this study we found that zzso and zzso zzso a synthetic zzso not only zzso the expression of zzso alone, but also imposed additive effect on the expression of zzso in zzso cells, primary zzso and lung of zzso Then we investigated whether zzso and zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso by reporter gene zzso and found that zzso but not zzso could increase the activity of a zzso zzso reporter zzso Further deletion and zzso studies demonstrated that a zzso response element zzso within the promoter region mainly contributed to the induction of zzso by zzso Moreover, we found that zzso exposure did not affect zzso zzso but decreased zzso in zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression by zzso zzso significantly decreased dense of peripheral zzso ring in zzso or zzso treated zzso zzso Taken all together, these data indicated that zzso and/or zzso significantly zzso the expression of zzso in zzso and in zzso which could stabilize zzso zzso in zzso We suppose that the zzso of zzso by zzso and zzso may enhance the barrier function of zzso zzso and mediate the zzso role of zzso to zzso
