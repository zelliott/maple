Currently, an zzso in the gross volume of a tumor is used to assess its response to zzso however, this approach provides only a late indication of zzso zzso ex zzso zzso are potentially valuable, but their procurement through zzso is invasive and might be biased by tumor zzso We studied the feasibility of using PET to zzso changes in zzso zzso expression and to predict the response to zzso in zzso breast cancer zzso with zzso zzso zzso 

Mice bearing zzso tumors were given zzso zzso zzso loading dose, 25 zzso maintenance dose, administered zzso twice a week) or saline zzso for a total of 5 zzso zzso size was monitored twice a zzso Animals were scanned before the treatment, at 48 zzso and 2 zzso after the beginning of zzso After the final zzso PET results were correlated with tumor response and zzso assessment of zzso level, as well as with zzso in the treated zzso 

Analysis of PET images indicated that zzso zzso was significantly reduced after 1 dose of zzso compared with zzso suggesting zzso as an early indicator of changes in zzso zzso After 5 doses of zzso the overall decrease in zzso zzso zzso also correlated with tumor response and zzso of zzso expression by zzso zzso However, individual animals had different zzso There was a correlation between bigger PET changes and a higher vessel count in the tumors, suggesting that an increased number of vessels could lead to better zzso zzso We confirmed that the difference in average vessel count in the tumors was not related to the size of the tumors and therefore was not due to the selection of more vascular zzso This finding is consistent with previous findings demonstrating that the number of vessels in a tumor could be a useful zzso marker for treatment zzso 

Our data suggest that zzso PET can zzso provide specific information on changes in zzso expression and could be a valuable strategy for predicting tumor response to zzso
