We have previously reported that zzso zzso zzso a potent zzso for zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso zzso in human pancreatic cancer cell zzso zzso protein zzso zzso are known to regulate zzso in various zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso pancreatic cancer cell zzso 

The effect of zzso on zzso activity was investigated by zzso zzso using the human pancreatic cancer cell line zzso zzso Western zzso analysis was performed to analyze zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso activity and DNA fragmentation zzso 

zzso activated all 3 zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso prevented zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and significantly decreased zzso This effect was zzso by zzso an inhibitor of zzso although zzso alone had no significant effect on zzso zzso In contrast, zzso an inhibitor of zzso significantly increased sensitivity to zzso zzso 

zzso stimulates zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso is increased by zzso zzso but decreased by zzso of zzso
