Lung cancer stem cells are the root causes of lung cancer zzso zzso and potential therapeutic target, the aim of this study is to isolate and characterize the cancer stem cells in the lung zzso cell line zzso so as to provide an experimental basis for further stem cell zzso 

The cancer stem cells were isolated from the lung zzso cell line zzso using zzso And the difference of colony formation, cell proliferation and zzso in zzso were also zzso The expression of zzso and zzso were evaluated by zzso and Western zzso 

The percentage of SP cells was zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso after incubation with zzso The results showed that there were significantly higher expression of zzso and zzso on SP cells than that of zzso zzso And the ability of colony formation, cell proliferation and zzso in SP cell group were remarkably higher than that in zzso cell zzso 

Our results suggested that the cancer stem cells with higher expression of zzso and zzso can be isolated from the lung zzso cell line zzso using zzso and be used in the further research zzso
