The zzso zzso drug, zzso zzso has long been used as a broad spectrum zzso The literature now documents the role of zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso possess substantially enhanced activity in zzso and in zzso We have recently reported the design, zzso and preliminary evaluation of a zzso zzso targeted, via zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding site zzso which are commonly present in breast cancer zzso The lead targeted zzso zzso called zzso was found to possess superior cell growth zzso characteristics relative to clinical zzso and an zzso control zzso especially in zzso zzso resistant zzso zzso The enhanced activity in the absence of zzso zzso raised the possibility that targeting was also zzso via zzso Fluorescence zzso of an zzso zzso cell line as a function of time showed initial zzso zzso in zzso in contrast to initial zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso was taken up by four zzso cell lines to a greater extent than zzso and an zzso zzso zzso Of the four cell lines, three were zzso zzso zzso zzso was inhibited in a zzso manner by the presence of a competing zzso zzso zzso retains zzso of the affinity of zzso for zzso zzso was also taken up by the zzso zzso cancer cell line zzso with these cells zzso was inhibited in a zzso manner by the zzso zzso zzso The data support the hypothesis that zzso of zzso targeted zzso zzso is zzso by both the zzso binding site and zzso zzso
