zzso of urinary zzso for human gastric cancer in a mouse model was investigated using zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso A human gastric zzso cell line (1 zzso zzso zzso was grafted onto the skin of the back of intact male zzso zzso After the zzso tumors developed, urine was collected and analyzed for zzso zzso Global profiling combined with principal components analysis zzso partial least zzso analysis zzso and zzso projections to zzso zzso analysis zzso showed distinct separation of clusters between control and zzso zzso zzso profiling revealed significant changes in zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels in mice carrying human gastric cancer cells compared to normal zzso The levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso mice were significantly zzso whereas the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were significantly increased in urine samples of zzso zzso Data suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso may serve as useful urinary zzso for gastric zzso in a mouse zzso
