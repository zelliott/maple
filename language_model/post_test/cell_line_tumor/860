When human cells incur DNA damage, two fundamental responses can follow, cell cycle arrest or zzso Human zzso zzso and zzso function in both zzso but the zzso relationship between their activities is zzso zzso mediates checkpoint control at zzso by zzso regulation of zzso In this report, we show that zzso like zzso can also regulate zzso at the zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso of zzso leads to increased zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso The promoter region of zzso fused to a zzso reporter can be zzso by either zzso or zzso indicating that zzso regulates the zzso promoter for zzso control of zzso Using an zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso specifically binds to a zzso zzso sequence in the zzso zzso zzso screening coupled with Northern analysis reveals that zzso regulates the abundance of other messages in addition to zzso Our data reveal a previously zzso mechanism for regulation of zzso and demonstrate that zzso can control gene zzso We suggest that zzso and zzso zzso zzso to direct cell cycle progression by similar molecular zzso Furthermore, zzso might regulate other cellular processes as well by modulating zzso of multiple zzso target zzso
