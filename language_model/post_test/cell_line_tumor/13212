zzso zzso is a common pediatric solid zzso and outcomes for patients with advanced zzso remain poor despite extremely aggressive zzso zzso resistance at zzso contributes heavily to treatment zzso The poor survival of patients with high-risk zzso prompted this investigation into novel treatment options with the objective of gaining a better understanding of resistance zzso On the basis of previous work and on data from publicly available studies, the authors hypothesized that human zzso growth factor zzso 4 zzso contributes to zzso 

zzso expression was reduced with zzso zzso zzso to over express zzso zzso and the authors tested its impact on tumor cell survival under various culture zzso The resulting changes in gene expression after zzso zzso were measured by using a zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso expression was zzso in tumor spheres compared with the expression in zzso zzso With zzso zzso zzso cells became less resistant to zzso and serum zzso Moreover, zzso zzso increased the zzso of zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso and activated zzso In zzso array analysis, zzso zzso predominately altered genes related to cell cycle zzso In zzso spheres compared with zzso cell proliferation was zzso and zzso D expression was zzso zzso zzso reversed zzso D zzso zzso zzso zzso slowed the cell cycle and induced zzso 

The current results indicated that zzso protects zzso cells from multiple zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was sufficient to zzso this zzso zzso functions as a cell cycle zzso maintaining resistance to cellular zzso The current findings indicate that zzso zzso may be associated with zzso disease, and zzso may be an important therapeutic zzso
