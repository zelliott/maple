The role of zzso zzso and retrograde transport for the zzso of the highly basic zzso peptides zzso zzso and zzso was zzso The effect of a panel of drugs that interfere with discrete steps of zzso or zzso transport on zzso and cellular distribution of zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso flow zzso and zzso zzso of whole cell zzso The analyses were carried out in zzso zzso cells and in zzso zzso While zzso zzso cells showed some zzso zzso and a pronounced zzso fluorescence, in zzso cells little zzso zzso was zzso In zzso cells the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso A1 abolished the release of the peptides into the zzso zzso into the zzso preserved zzso zzso In addition, cellular zzso of the peptides was inhibited by zzso A, a compound interfering with trafficking in the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso acid, a drug that stimulates the rapid retrograde movement of both zzso stacks and zzso network to the zzso zzso promoted a zzso zzso of zzso peptides in zzso zzso zzso The effects of these drugs on trafficking shared characteristics with those reported for the trafficking of plant and bacterial zzso such as zzso zzso which reach the zzso by means of retrograde zzso A sequence comparison revealed a common stretch of 8-10 zzso acids with high sequence zzso to the zzso zzso The structural and functional data therefore strongly suggest a common mechanism of import for zzso zzso peptides and the zzso
