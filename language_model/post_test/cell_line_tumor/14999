A previous study demonstrated that zzso expression was significantly zzso in highly zzso colon cancer zzso This study was to investigate the biological function of zzso and its regulation of target genes in colon cancer zzso zzso zzso was used to detect zzso expression in colon cancer zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was to measure the changed cell viability after zzso mimics zzso zzso healing and zzso migration and invasion zzso measured capacity of tumor cell migration and invasion of zzso and zzso cells after zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso and Western zzso were used to assess both zzso and expression levels of one of the zzso target genes zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression were lower in colon cancer zzso and zzso cells than in the adjacent normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso mimics significantly reduced colon cancer cell viability compared to NC cells zzso zzso zzso The wound healing and zzso migration and invasion zzso showed that zzso mimics inhibited zzso and zzso cell migration and invasion zzso zzso predicted that zzso is one of the zzso target zzso Indeed, zzso reporter zzso and Western zzso confirmed that zzso is a zzso target zzso zzso of zzso inhibited colon cancer cell viability and reduced tumor cell migration and invasion capacity by its negative regulation of zzso zzso
