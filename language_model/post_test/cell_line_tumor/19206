The zzso zzso zzso and the delta zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso G zzso receptors zzso Both are widely distributed in brain zzso and immune cells, and have key roles in inflammation processes and in pain sensation on zzso nerve zzso We show that in immune cells expressing zzso and zzso simultaneous addition of their zzso zzso and zzso zzso does not trigger zzso zzso This treatment does not affect zzso binding or zzso zzso nor does it promote zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso and zzso form zzso complexes that are zzso regulated by the zzso This is compatible with a model in which zzso zzso leads to suppression of zzso promoting a dominant negative zzso zzso of zzso and zzso signaling by zzso might have repercussions on zzso and pathological processes such as zzso pain sensation and zzso zzso
