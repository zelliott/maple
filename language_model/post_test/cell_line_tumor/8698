zzso zzso seem to play a major role in gene expression zzso In prostate cancer, zzso and its zzso form are implicated in zzso zzso zzso which may act either as tumor zzso or zzso reduces zzso levels in zzso via zzso degradation, and this mechanism might be impaired in prostate cancer cells due to zzso 1 zzso Thus, we aimed to characterize the mechanisms underlying zzso and zzso deregulation in prostate zzso and how they zzso We found that zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso respectively, at transcript level in primary prostate cancer and high-grade zzso zzso zzso compared to normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in prostate cancer cell lines resulted in almost complete absence of zzso zzso of zzso had a modest effect on zzso levels, but zzso zzso prevented the marked reduction of zzso due to zzso 1 zzso zzso cancer cells exposed to zzso zzso drugs zzso A, alone or combined with zzso increased zzso transcript, although with a zzso decrease in protein zzso zzso zzso transcript and protein levels increased after zzso zzso revealed an increase of zzso marks within the zzso region for both zzso zzso zzso of zzso 1 with zzso increased zzso levels, whereas zzso of zzso 1 by zzso led to an abrupt decrease in zzso Finally, zzso zzso showed that exposure to zzso zzso drugs fostered the interaction between zzso 1 and zzso We concluded that zzso 1 and zzso deregulation in prostate cancer are zzso zzso zzso mechanisms, mostly zzso zzso zzso are likely involved and impair zzso zzso zzso of zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso drugs in conjunction with zzso zzso are able to restore the normal functions of zzso 1 and might constitute relevant tools for targeted therapy of prostate cancer zzso
