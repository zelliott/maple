zzso remains one of the most lethal human tumors in spite of the progress in zzso chemotherapy, and surgical zzso Cell differentiation zzso zzso is an extraction from healthy human urine consisting of primary organic acids and zzso and it has been demonstrated to inhibit growth and induce differentiation in zzso and other cell zzso However, the mechanism remains zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso are members of the nuclear hormone receptors zzso which are involved in cellular differentiation and zzso In this study, we investigated if zzso induced differentiation of zzso zzso cells is zzso by zzso zzso induced differentiation of zzso cells was characterized by typical zzso changes, increased expression of zzso zzso of proliferation and zzso cell cycle zzso zzso also triggered zzso of zzso zzso and zzso protein and a reduction of zzso zzso However, the effects of zzso on zzso cells could be partly reversed by zzso an irreversible zzso zzso Our investigation demonstrated that zzso could be a potential drug for tumor differentiation therapy, and zzso of the zzso zzso might be a crucial factor in zzso differentiation induced by zzso
