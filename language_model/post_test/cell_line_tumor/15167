We have developed a measuring system for simultaneous monitoring of zzso and fluorescence, which indicate respectively, zzso generation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso change in the zzso calcium zzso concentration zzso of zzso triggered by the mechanism of innate immune zzso We applied this measuring system for establishing a method to distinguish between zzso actions and zzso actions caused by zzso zzso We evaluated zzso agents zzso zzso zzso and zzso and antioxidants zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso It was shown that zzso and zzso were zzso while zzso and zzso acid were zzso We conclude that it is possible to determine the mechanism of action of zzso compounds using this zzso
