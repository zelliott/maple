Both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are involved in the zzso of human cancer and their functions are closely associated with zzso However, how these two molecules regulate zzso in human gastric cancer is zzso In this study, we studied how zzso and zzso were regulated in two gastric cancer cell lines, zzso with wild zzso and zzso with zzso zzso The cells were treated with zzso and cadmium to induce zzso The result showed that zzso protein was significantly induced by zzso and cadmium in both cells zzso Following the zzso zzso zzso level was also markedly zzso The cells with increased zzso and zzso showed obviously zzso to zzso zzso The levels of zzso and zzso induced were significantly inhibited by zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso Parallel to decreased zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso also significantly attenuated the resistance of the cells to zzso The elevated zzso and zzso was further found to be associated with increase activity of the nuclear zzso and the zzso of zzso led to the block of their zzso The elevated zzso and zzso were also demonstrated to be related to increased cellular inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso It was noted that the above changes observed were not different between zzso and zzso cells, suggesting the functions of zzso and zzso were irrespective of the status of zzso In conclusion, we demonstrate that the resistance to zzso in gastric cancer cells with elevated zzso and zzso is independent of zzso status in a zzso zzso and zzso zzso with elevated zzso and decreased zzso activity and that this zzso is sensitive to the zzso of zzso
