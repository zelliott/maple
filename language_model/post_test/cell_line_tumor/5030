We have demonstrated synthesis and application of a zzso zzso zzso zzso as a fluorescent contrast agent to image cancer zzso This fluorescent zzso targets and images zzso cancer cells in zzso with high zzso To deliver zzso to the cells, folate zzso have been attached to an zzso zzso via an zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso groups gave a zzso zzso zzso The zzso 5 is minimally zzso at zzso of zzso zzso which is sufficient to stain zzso cancer cells zzso zzso 6, devoid of folate zzso did not stain zzso zzso As a low zzso acid zzso zzso control group, zzso zzso zzso cells were incubated with 5 and did not show fluorescent zzso The folate zzso zzso of zzso cells was evidenced by laser scanning zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso stability and ability to sustain zzso provide advantages of zzso over other fluorescent contrast zzso Their minimal zzso makes the zzso superior to the zzso zzso quantum zzso
