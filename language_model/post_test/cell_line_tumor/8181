The zzso zzso zzso is a crucial regulator of zzso zzso which zzso zzso and zzso trafficking to and from the zzso zzso considerable research has been done to zzso the regulation of zzso zzso trafficking, less is known about which trafficking proteins are involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins are zzso known to regulate the trafficking of proteins to and from specific zzso zzso zzso 8 and 11, in particular, are involved in trafficking proteins from zzso compartments to the plasma zzso In this study, we sought to determine whether zzso 8 and 11 would zzso zzso activity and trafficking in zzso zzso zzso We used zzso zzso known to zzso zzso active or dominant negative activity of these proteins to investigate the role of zzso activity in zzso zzso trafficking and zzso We found that zzso active zzso 11 zzso zzso function and surface expression while neither the zzso active nor the dominant negative zzso of zzso 8 had any effect on zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso experiments revealed that dominant negative zzso 11 zzso results in decreased surface zzso indicating a necessary function of zzso 11 in zzso trafficking to the plasma zzso These data show for the first time a functional role of zzso proteins in the zzso recycling of zzso to the plasma zzso
