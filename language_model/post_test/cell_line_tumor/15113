zzso zzso zzso protein 2 zzso has been linked with a variety of human cancer types and may contribute to cancer zzso The current study investigated the importance of zzso in zzso cancer cells, examining the impact of targeting zzso on zzso cell invasion and zzso together with potential mechanisms of zzso 

zzso expression was targeted in zzso cells using a zzso zzso system and successful zzso was verified using reverse zzso chain reaction zzso The impact of zzso knockout zzso zzso on cell growth, zzso zzso and invasion was examined using a number of in zzso functional zzso In zzso invasion zzso were repeated in the presence of zzso zzso integration site family zzso zzso zzso and zzso to investigate the role of the zzso zzso in the regulation of cell invasion by zzso zzso was conducted to measure zzso zzso zzso expression in control zzso zzso and cells containing the empty zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso knockout resulted in a significant increase in zzso cell invasion and zzso ( zzso in comparison to zzso and zzso control zzso zzso zzso knockout had no significant effect on zzso cell growth rate in 3- and zzso incubation and no significant impact on zzso zzso zzso rates zzso zzso analysis of a number of zzso indicated an insignificant zzso of zzso zzso zzso but significant zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells compared to zzso zzso of zzso zzso using zzso and zzso brought about a significant or borderline significant decrease in zzso zzso cell invasion zzso zzso and zzso zzso and negated the zzso effect of targeting zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso knockout significantly increased zzso cell invasion and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and -9 may indicate that zzso regulates invasion and zzso through zzso zzso of invasion by zzso may involve the zzso zzso zzso
