Cellular zzso zzso protein zzso plays an important role in cell zzso researches of zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene may provide a new method or protocol for treatment of human gastric zzso This study was to explore effect of zzso zzso on zzso of human gastric cancer cell line zzso 

Human cervical cancer cell line zzso was used as control, zzso zzso was introduced into zzso cells and zzso cells, reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and Western zzso were used to detect zzso zzso zzso and cellular zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso was created complementary to a sequence that included the start site of zzso open reading zzso After zzso zzso was used to detect cell zzso zzso and flow zzso zzso were used to detect cell zzso and Western zzso was used to detect protein level of zzso 

The zzso zzso and protein of zzso and zzso can be detected in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso significantly inhibited proliferation of zzso cells zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso detected positive zzso zzso specific zzso peak can be detected before zzso peak by zzso and Western zzso revealed that protein level of zzso and zzso decreased significantly zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso and zzso proteins expressed in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso may zzso zzso protein level, and initiate zzso of zzso zzso
