Three new palladium complexes with general formula zzso where zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been zzso and fully zzso including X-ray zzso zzso Their potential zzso effect and zzso have been studied as zzso The viability test performed on human tumor zzso and normal zzso cell lines indicates significant zzso of complexes, which is higher in tumor cells than in normal zzso The lethal doses are comparable with those of standard zzso zzso drugs zzso and zzso These palladium complexes exhibit a higher zzso against tumor cells as against normal cells in zzso A new zzso zzso method was developed and simultaneously the classic zzso test was zzso Complex 2 has an important capacity to induce zzso in tumor zzso The zzso process is triggered due to the interaction of these complexes with secondary structure of DNA in treated zzso The alkaline zzso gel zzso shows that the level of DNA damages induced by compounds 2 and 3 are significantly higher in tumor cells as in normal zzso These studies shown that complexes 1, 2 and 3 have zzso activity, the effect of complex 2 being superior to its platinum zzso attributable to its zzso
