zzso zzso commonly found in patients with zzso type I zzso have a zzso risk of being transformed into zzso peripheral nerve sheath tumors zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene coding for zzso which is a Ras zzso zzso protein zzso and a negative regulator of zzso result in an zzso of the Ras zzso We established a direct connection between zzso zzso and downstream zzso of Ras in cell lines from zzso patients by demonstrating that zzso of zzso expression using zzso in a zzso wild type zzso cell line, zzso activates the zzso zzso and increases zzso binding and zzso We believe this is the first time the zzso of zzso has been linked directly to zzso zzso in a disease relevant zzso cell zzso Previously, we have shown that zzso is zzso activated in cell lines derived from independent zzso from zzso zzso We therefore sought to analyze the role of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso clones zzso expressing zzso zzso show increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression zzso with increased zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways zzso and zzso were further examined in zzso a zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso activity of zzso but not zzso was found to increase zzso zzso These experiments further confirmed the link between the loss of zzso and increased activity of zzso zzso pathways and the zzso of downstream zzso mechanisms in zzso from zzso zzso
