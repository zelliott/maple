zzso zzso a member of the zzso protein family, is zzso expressed and binds to classical zzso together with other zzso to participate in the zzso zzso zzso has numerous zzso generated through extensive zzso and alternative usage of translation initiation zzso Although the involvement of zzso in cell growth control has been zzso little has so far been known about its expression patterns in the skin and zzso zzso 

To identify the zzso expressed in benign and zzso zzso and to analyze the expression patterns of zzso in zzso tumor zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells along with normal skin tissue were subjected to zzso to identify the expressed zzso For zzso study, surgical specimens including 29 zzso cell zzso zzso 4 zzso cell zzso zzso and 4 zzso zzso as well as 3 normal skin samples were stained with specific zzso to detect zzso and zzso 

zzso revealed that the zzso 3A was predominantly expressed with faint expression of the zzso 4 and that there was no difference in expressed zzso between the examined cell zzso zzso zzso indicated that the expression of zzso was significantly reduced in all of the examined zzso cell zzso and that zzso was frequently localized in zzso In benign tumors and normal samples, zzso was properly expressed in zzso zzso Furthermore, there were several zzso where zzso continued to be expressed with no expression of zzso 

zzso expression and zzso zzso of zzso are among the most common events during the development and/or progression of zzso
