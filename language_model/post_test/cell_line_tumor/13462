zzso is a novel zzso growth factor that has shown promising results for the zzso of zzso Moreover, zzso has been used successfully in bone zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso skeleton of both small and large animal zzso Despite increasing evidence of zzso efficacy and future usefulness as an alternative to traditional bone graft zzso much has yet to be understood regarding the mechanisms of action of this novel zzso The zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso has been well studied in the setting of growth zzso changes in zzso zzso 

In this study, we provide evidence of the involvement of zzso zzso pathways in zzso terminal zzso differentiation of zzso human zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways were screened with zzso zzso protein array after zzso human zzso zzso Next, the zzso and zzso zzso levels after zzso stimulation were assessed in the presence or absence of specific zzso zzso 

zzso showed that zzso predominantly increased zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the specific zzso inhibitor zzso blocked zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso zzso showed no zzso 

Thus, zzso of the zzso zzso is necessary to mediate terminal zzso differentiation of zzso zzso cells by zzso Future studies will extend these in zzso mechanisms to the in zzso effects of zzso in dealing with zzso defects caused by skeletal zzso or other zzso
