In the present investigation, we determined the zzso efficacy of zzso zzso a more potent zzso zzso on zzso spontaneously immortalized human normal breast zzso cells and zzso cigarette smoke zzso zzso zzso The results from zzso analysis showed that zzso induced zzso and zzso association in zzso cells, while zzso cells remained zzso Our zzso data further demonstrated that zzso cells were susceptible to zzso catastrophe on exposure to zzso and failed to recover after drug zzso zzso cells exhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso formation, which zzso impaired the alignment of zzso zzso to the equatorial plane and finally culminated in cell zzso Although zzso cells upon zzso treatment showed bipolar zzso with some zzso zzso these cells recovered fairly well after drug zzso Our zzso analysis data zzso that zzso cells were more susceptible to cell death compared to zzso zzso Furthermore, our results suggest that decreased levels of zzso B1 and zzso zzso activity are responsible for zzso zzso cell arrest leading to cell death in zzso zzso This study thus explores the underlying mechanism of zzso zzso catastrophe in zzso zzso cells and its potential usefulness as a zzso agent for prevention of cigarette zzso breast cancer zzso
