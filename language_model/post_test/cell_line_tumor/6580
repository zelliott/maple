The zzso efficiency of zzso virus zzso zzso in various zzso zzso is determined primarily by the viral zzso zzso In contrast to zzso made with zzso type 2 zzso those having type 5 or 6 zzso show high zzso rates in airway zzso cells, in a range that should be sufficient for treating lung zzso Here we have compared the properties of zzso made with zzso or zzso zzso proteins to determine whether their zzso usage is similar, and found several differences between the zzso First, an zzso zzso did not zzso red blood cells, whereas an zzso zzso did, and this property was zzso acid zzso Second, zzso zzso zzso required zzso acid in all cells tested, whereas zzso zzso zzso was zzso acid dependent or independent, depending on the target cells zzso Third, levels of an zzso zzso that zzso with entry of another zzso zzso only poorly inhibited zzso zzso zzso and vice zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso zzso use distinct cellular receptors for cell zzso Although both zzso and zzso zzso exhibited high zzso rates in zzso human airway zzso cultures, they exhibited distinct zzso zzso profiles in mouse lung that may reflect differences in zzso zzso
