The objective of this study was to develop and test computer zzso to export zzso zzso zzso zzso images and to generate zzso geometry and specific zzso rate zzso distribution for heat transfer simulation in magnetic zzso zzso 

Computer zzso were written to zzso and export zzso images of zzso zzso containing magnetic zzso zzso and zzso programs were used to generate a zzso of the zzso zzso The enhancements in the zzso zzso index number due to presence of zzso in the zzso were first converted into corresponding zzso zzso The zzso data were then averaged over three-dimensional clusters of zzso using the zzso zzso This greatly decreased the size of the zzso file, while in the zzso it ensured that the amount of total energy deposited in the zzso was zzso Both the zzso geometry and the zzso file were then imported into the zzso software package to simulate temperature zzso in the zzso and their surrounding tissue region during magnetic zzso zzso 

A linear relationship was obtained to relate individual zzso index numbers in the zzso images to the zzso values under a specific magnetic zzso The generated zzso of the zzso geometry based on only 30 slices of zzso images resembled the original zzso shape and zzso The zzso geometry and the simplified zzso data set were successfully accepted by the zzso software for heat transfer zzso Up to zzso temperature zzso from its baseline temperature were found inside the zzso zzso possible zzso damage to the zzso during magnetic zzso zzso
