zzso and zzso signaling pathways play central roles in zzso stem cell zzso and zzso However, the mechanisms by which these two pathways interact are not well zzso Here, we identified a novel mechanism by which zzso signaling zzso stimulates the zzso output of zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso expression of an zzso zzso zzso which in turn binds and zzso zzso zzso causing an zzso of zzso expression and zzso zzso The newly described mode of regulation of zzso seems to be important to several functions of zzso including survival and proliferation of zzso cancer zzso
