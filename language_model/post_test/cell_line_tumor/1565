Complete cell zzso can be achieved by the introduction of specific zzso factors, zzso zzso known as zzso class 5 zzso 1 zzso zzso region Y zzso 2 zzso zzso factor 4 zzso and zzso viral zzso zzso zzso into terminally differentiated mouse zzso zzso This zzso process may be accelerated or suppressed by various factors, including zzso zzso Introduction of these zzso factors or zzso considerably zzso the zzso zzso of cancer zzso We studied the effect of introducing these zzso factors into two distinct zzso cancer zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso in the presence and absence of zzso 1, zzso type III zzso a critical zzso processing zzso We assessed cell zzso based on the number of cells exhibiting alkaline zzso zzso and an increase in embryonic stem zzso gene zzso indicating the return of cells to an immature zzso zzso zzso cells showed a reduced number of alkaline zzso zzso cells than zzso zzso zzso Before zzso zzso expression of an immature zzso zzso zzso was high in zzso zzso cells, whereas after zzso the expression of this zzso was increased in zzso more than in zzso zzso zzso Our data demonstrate the critical role of zzso in the zzso process and determination of a differentiated zzso of zzso zzso
