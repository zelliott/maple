The zzso factor zzso was originally found to function as a key regulator of zzso zzso In this study, we provide the first evidence that zzso is expressed at higher levels in zzso cancer zzso compared with normal zzso zzso and is significantly associated with high zzso stage and low differentiation state in zzso zzso zzso To this end, we zzso zzso (full length of zzso into the zzso zzso cancer cell line and examined cell biological behaviors including zzso migration and zzso We found that zzso of zzso inhibited cell proliferation by inducing zzso arrest, accompanied by the zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso D1 and zzso On the other hand, zzso increased the migration and invasion of zzso cancer cells, as assessed by zzso zzso zzso migration zzso and invasion zzso zzso of zzso significantly increased zzso but not zzso expression at both zzso and protein zzso It also zzso and zzso zzso and zzso two target genes of zzso involved in migration, zzso Furthermore, knocking down zzso zzso zzso increase in migration and zzso These data suggest that zzso plays an important role in zzso migration and zzso In conclusion, we show for the first time that zzso plays a dual role in the zzso migration and invasion of zzso cancer cells, providing new insights into their zzso
