The zzso growth factor zzso zzso is a validated therapeutic target in zzso cell lung cancer zzso However, current single agent zzso targeting does not achieve a zzso therapeutic effect, and some zzso zzso resistance to current available zzso In the current study we have zzso in different zzso cell lines, the combined effect of zzso interference targeting the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso signaling using different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or a zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cells zzso lines zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso with zzso zzso and/or treated with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and/or with the zzso zzso zzso The reduction of zzso zzso expression was measured by real-time quantitative zzso The zzso of zzso protein expression was measured by western zzso and the zzso zzso zzso activity, and zzso zzso were monitored by zzso zzso and zzso zzso The combined effect of zzso zzso and different drugs was evaluated using a combination zzso 

zzso zzso strongly inhibited zzso protein expression almost equally in all cell lines and inhibited cell growth and induced cell zzso in all zzso cell lines zzso albeit with a different zzso The effects on growth obtained with zzso was zzso different from the effects obtained with zzso The effects of zzso probably correlate with the overall zzso significance of the zzso which is only partly inhibited by the zzso The cells which showed weak response to zzso such as the zzso cell line containing the zzso resistance zzso were found to be responsive to zzso zzso of zzso as were cell lines with downstream zzso resistance zzso The cell line zzso harboring an zzso 19 deletion zzso was more than zzso more sensitive to zzso proliferation zzso and zzso induction than any of the other cell zzso zzso alone had no relevant in zzso activity at zzso zzso in the zzso The addition of zzso zzso to either zzso or zzso zzso enhanced growth zzso and induction of zzso in all five cell lines, independent of the zzso zzso status zzso or zzso zzso or resistant zzso The strongest biological effect was observed when zzso was combined with an zzso zzso 

zzso zzso by zzso further decreases the cell growth of lung cancer cells that are treated with zzso or zzso alone, confirming that single agent drug targeting does not achieve a zzso biological zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso activity that zzso downstream zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso The combined treatment of zzso and zzso zzso agents is zzso The combination of a zzso irreversible zzso inhibitor such as zzso with zzso zzso should be further investigated as a new strategy in the treatment of lung cancer and other zzso dependent zzso including those with downstream resistance zzso
