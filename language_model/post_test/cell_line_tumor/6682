The effects of zzso on zzso currents were investigated in zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso a synthetic zzso zzso increased the density of zzso zzso zzso current zzso with an zzso value of 21 zzso 5 zzso zzso increase in zzso density was suppressed by zzso (1 zzso yet not by zzso (10 zzso zzso (1 zzso or zzso (10 zzso zzso is a blocker of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso channels, while zzso and zzso are zzso of zzso and zzso zzso channels, zzso zzso can block zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso the application of zzso (30 zzso into the zzso surface caused no change in single-channel zzso however, it did increase zzso zzso zzso Its effect was associated with a negative shift of the zzso zzso However, no zzso zzso of these channels was altered by zzso zzso channel activity involves an increase in mean open time and a decrease in mean closed zzso Under zzso zzso zzso decreased the firing frequency of action zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso (30 zzso also increased zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation of zzso presented here that is likely zzso seems to be not linked to a zzso zzso The zzso zzso properties of zzso may partly contribute to the underlying mechanisms by which zzso affect neuroendocrine zzso
