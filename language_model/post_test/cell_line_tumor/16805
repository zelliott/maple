The purpose of this study was to investigate the differential expression and function of organic zzso zzso zzso in breast zzso and breast cancer zzso zzso zzso a zzso for 7 of 11 zzso is a zzso source of tumor zzso in zzso zzso patients with breast zzso zzso of certain zzso zzso zzso reported in breast tumor zzso compared with surrounding normal zzso could contribute toward two to three times higher zzso zzso zzso Little is known about expression and function of other zzso family members among breast zzso and breast cancer zzso We therefore compared gene and protein expression of seven zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in immortalized breast zzso cells zzso zzso breast cancer cells zzso and zzso breast cancer cells zzso zzso and zzso by quantitative zzso chain reaction and zzso zzso zzso of zzso carrier zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is zzso similar, or significantly higher in cancer cells compared with zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso is found to be either exclusive or higher in cancer cells compared with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is observed only in cancer cells, with the highest total zzso in zzso zzso Transport zzso of zzso zzso demonstrates transport efficiency that is 10 times greater in the zzso cells than in the zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso could be a novel therapeutic target for zzso breast zzso particularly in zzso patients, where the major source of tumor zzso is zzso
