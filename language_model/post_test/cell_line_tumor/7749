zzso are well known zzso of zzso breast cancer cell growth and zzso zzso zzso are involved in the normal growth and differentiation of breast cells, they also take part in many pathological processes including zzso The aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of zzso and tamoxifen on the zzso action of zzso on the proliferation of zzso breast cancer cells and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was based on zzso incorporation and the zzso activity of zzso and Ki zzso zzso zzso of zzso was assessed through zzso zzso 

Treatment of cancer cells with the examined compounds and tamoxifen (10 zzso revealed that only zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso decreased cells proliferation compared to the tamoxifen group zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The lowest fraction of zzso positive cells was also observed after the simultaneous addition zzso zzso zzso and tamoxifen (10 zzso zzso zzso compared to the tamoxifen zzso Our results showed that the decrease of zzso zzso expression by zzso zzso zzso M, zzso and zzso zzso M, zzso was zzso by tamoxifen and to a lesser extent by zzso particularly in the case of zzso at zzso or zzso zzso 

This data suggest that tamoxifen zzso the zzso effect of zzso on proliferation and zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso
