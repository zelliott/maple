To investigate the zzso of colon cancer cell line zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso in zzso and the changes in the expressions of zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso cells was subjected to zzso exposure at varying zzso and for different time lengths to induce zzso and the protein expression of zzso induced factor zzso zzso was detected by Western zzso The zzso zzso cells were sorted by magnetic activated cell sorting zzso and their proportion was zzso by flow zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso were exposed to zzso at the optimal concentration with exposure time selected in terms of zzso level, and their tumor stem cell sphere formation ability was zzso zzso zzso was used to compare the zzso expression levels of the surface markers of colon cancer stem cells zzso and zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso 

Exposure to 200 zzso zzso for 8 h resulted in the highest zzso expression in zzso cells, but the same exposure failed to induce zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso subsets, after zzso zzso showed significantly enhanced ability of cell sphere zzso zzso of zzso cells caused significant increases in zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels by zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively ( zzso 

zzso can simulate zzso in colon cancer cells in zzso to induce stable zzso zzso which is zzso and zzso The zzso tumor stem sells show an enhanced sphere formation and zzso and zzso zzso
