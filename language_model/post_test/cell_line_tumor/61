The molecular correlate of zzso zzso channels zzso and their role in proliferation zzso zzso is a matter of zzso We report in this paper that, in zzso zzso recordings, zzso stress zzso zzso zzso increased the zzso zzso of zzso cells from zzso to zzso zzso The effect was zzso inhibited by zzso and zzso known zzso of zzso with some 50% efficiency at 300 zzso In zzso both drugs decreased zzso cell proliferation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and with automatic cell zzso Small interfering zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of the zzso zzso channel zzso reduced zzso zzso currents to zzso whereas the rate of zzso cell proliferation was approximately half of that of the zzso Moreover, zzso zzso inhibited the regulatory volume increase of zzso cells zzso with scanning acoustic zzso by zzso In zzso cell sorting zzso zzso of zzso led to a significant decrease in the zzso and an increase in the zzso phase of the cell cycle, whereas the S phase was not zzso Finally zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso of zzso increased the rate of zzso in zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso is one functional element of the zzso in zzso cells and that the channel is an important zzso of cell zzso likewise, zzso zzso shifts the system from a zzso into a rather zzso zzso This is the first report of a role of zzso in cell zzso
