We recently found that a small zzso zzso zzso could induce zzso and zzso zzso expression in various cancer zzso Here, we found that zzso suppressed the proliferation of zzso cancer cells without inducing zzso zzso we found that zzso could induce zzso arrest and zzso zzso but not zzso at a zzso and zzso but zzso manner in zzso human colon cancer zzso zzso of zzso was also detected after treatment with zzso Moreover, zzso induction was dramatically attenuated by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso arrest and corresponding zzso of zzso were also observed in zzso cells, suggesting that zzso these events were zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso dramatically attenuated zzso zzso zzso Together, our data indicate that zzso zzso correlated with the zzso induction of zzso expression and zzso zzso This finding may have implication for cancer zzso
