zzso central nervous system zzso development is a highly organized process involving the precise and coordinated timing of zzso exit, zzso survival, and zzso These events require proper expression of zzso genes but also repression of alternative cell fates and restriction of zzso gene zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso with zzso basic zzso zzso factors such as zzso zzso and zzso Increased levels of zzso inhibited zzso zzso activity independently of zzso interactions and acted as a direct zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso neural zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso accumulated zzso in the zzso of neural stem cells zzso during early stages of zzso differentiation zzso by zzso zzso factor zzso independent of zzso exit and at times when zzso expression was still zzso In accordance with these zzso zzso and zzso studies showed that zzso zzso zzso differentiation after zzso withdrawal, but exerted little or no effect on zzso zzso differentiation of zzso Our data suggest a novel role for zzso as a zzso zzso of zzso zzso factors and zzso zzso zzso
