zzso human zzso zzso therapy is approved for treating patients with advanced melanoma yet significant responses are observed in only zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in activated human zzso T cells in zzso and expands circulating zzso zzso T cells in melanoma zzso zzso zzso responsive zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso subcutaneous tumor mouse models, we evaluated zzso zzso T cell distribution and changes in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso twice daily for 5 zzso In zzso mice and subcutaneous zzso mouse models, zzso zzso T cells were a rare but naturally occurring cell zzso zzso located in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells expressed both activated T cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Following treatment with zzso a dramatic increase in zzso zzso T cell prevalence was observed in the circulation and zzso zzso zzso zzso of animals bearing zzso zzso tumors, while no significant changes were observed in the circulation and zzso of animals bearing zzso responsive zzso These findings suggest expansion of zzso zzso T cell population in response to zzso treatment may serve as an early marker for tumor responsiveness to zzso in an immune competent zzso Additionally, these data may provide insight to predict response in patients with melanoma undergoing zzso zzso
