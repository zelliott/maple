zzso of the zzso zzso linked to zzso and zzso zzso is a poor prognosis indicator in zzso to zzso of breast zzso In contrast to some well-documented zzso zzso molecular mechanisms leading to zzso zzso zzso remain poorly zzso Gene expression analyses of breast cancer have characterized distinct zzso signatures allowing a molecular zzso of breast zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso genes was originally observed in zzso Both genes are essential for cardiovascular development and zzso has been proposed to control the zzso of critical genes for the differentiation and the function of zzso We determined that zzso small interfering zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso small interfering zzso zzso zzso and activated zzso zzso zzso zzso construct zzso zzso zzso zzso foot printing revealed multiple putative zzso binding sites zzso in zzso within the zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso binds specifically to several zzso gene zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso revealed zzso binding to a zzso consensus zzso zzso zzso confirmed the role of this new regulatory element for the activity of the zzso gene zzso In agreement with a zzso role of zzso on zzso gene expression balanced by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso a negative correlation between the relative levels of zzso and zzso zzso was observed in breast cancer cell lines and breast tumor zzso We propose that the negative feedback loop linking zzso and zzso plays a role in the zzso zzso of zzso gene expression in breast zzso
