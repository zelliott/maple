zzso may be a favorable target for zzso therapy in breast zzso In fact, the zzso zzso zzso currently has entered in phase II clinical trials as an zzso agent in breast and other zzso Since zzso zzso leads to global depletion of zzso proteins involved in multiple pathways we applied global analysis using gene array technology to study new genes and pathways involved in the drug response in breast zzso 

Gene expression profiling using Whole Human Genome zzso array technology was applied to a total of six sensitive and two resistant breast cancer cell lines zzso and treated with the zzso for 24 and 48 zzso 

We have identified a common molecular signature of response to zzso composed of 35 genes which include novel zzso markers of this zzso In addition, different patterns of zzso client zzso changes after zzso were identified associated to the sensitive cell lines, which could be useful to evaluate drug zzso Finally, we have found zzso expressed pathways associated to resistance to zzso We observed significant zzso of zzso and zzso pathways in resistant cells upon treatment, indicating that these pathways could be potentially targeted to overcome zzso 

Our study shows that global zzso expression analysis is a useful strategy to examine molecular effects of drugs, which allowed us the discovery of new zzso of zzso activity and provided more insights into the complex mechanism of zzso zzso
