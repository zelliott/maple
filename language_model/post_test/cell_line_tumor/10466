zzso zzso zzso have a distinct clinical pattern compared with other zzso of zzso zzso Here, we evaluated zzso zzso clinical significance of zzso zzso zzso in a large cohort and zzso the functional role of zzso zzso in zzso models of zzso zzso zzso 

A total of zzso zzso cancer patients including 122 zzso cases of zzso zzso were evaluated for survival zzso Biological effects of zzso zzso zzso were tested using zzso therapy in a novel zzso zzso zzso cancer model zzso 

Patients with zzso zzso zzso cancer had significantly worse survival than those with zzso zzso median overall survival, zzso versus zzso years, P zzso zzso median survival time after recurrence of zzso versus zzso years, P zzso zzso Among multiple zzso cancer cell lines, zzso zzso zzso cancer cells showed the highest zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso treatment induced zzso of zzso zzso This induced activity by zzso therapy was inhibited by concurrent administration of zzso zzso zzso with zzso in zzso showed significant zzso effects in the zzso model but not in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Combination therapy of zzso with zzso further showed significant effects on reducing cell zzso increasing zzso and in zzso zzso effects in the zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that poor survival of women with zzso zzso zzso is associated with resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a combination of zzso and zzso may be an attractive approach for this zzso
