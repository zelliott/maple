V gene zzso class switch zzso and zzso zzso are zzso processes essential to the development of an effective zzso zzso If inappropriately applied, however, these processes can mediate genetic changes that lead to disease zzso zzso A series of control elements within the zzso H chain zzso locus has been implicated in regulating these processes as well as in regulating zzso gene zzso These include the zzso zzso zzso and several elements at the 3' end of the locus zzso zzso zzso and zzso known collectively as the 3' regulatory zzso Although it is clear that the zzso plays a unique role in V gene zzso it has not been established whether there are unique functions for each element within the 3' regulatory zzso In earlier studies in mice and in mouse cell lines, zzso deletion of zzso and zzso had a dramatic effect on both class switch zzso and zzso gene zzso deletion of an element almost identical with zzso zzso however, yielded no discernible zzso To test the resulting hypothesis that zzso is uniquely required for these zzso we induced the deletion of zzso within a bacterial artificial zzso zzso designed to closely approximate the 3' end of the natural zzso zzso When introduced into an zzso cell line, an zzso zzso unit within the bacterial artificial zzso was expressed efficiently and the subsequent deletion of zzso only moderately affected zzso zzso Thus, zzso does not play a uniquely essential role in the zzso of a zzso rearranged zzso zzso zzso zzso
