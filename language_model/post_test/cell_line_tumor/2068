The zzso gene has been reported to be a zzso zzso gene in human zzso The gene product was isolated from human zzso as the zzso of zzso a G zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of 54 zzso acids is called zzso The binding of zzso to zzso has been shown to inhibit tumor zzso in some tumor zzso however, its function remains unclear in zzso zzso We first evaluated zzso expression and zzso expression in 151 patients with upper urinary tract zzso zzso to determine their zzso zzso Next, we examined the role of zzso in the zzso and lung zzso of zzso zzso zzso which is a highly zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso expression was an independent predictor of zzso and overall zzso However, zzso expression was not zzso zzso zzso had a significantly lower level of zzso expression compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment significantly reduced the zzso of zzso cells and inhibited the zzso activity of zzso by blocking its nuclear zzso leading to a reduction in the expression and activity of zzso zzso zzso treatment dramatically prevented the occurrence of lung zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 15; P zzso zzso as well as had survival zzso zzso plays an important role in the prognosis of upper tract zzso zzso and zzso may be an effective inhibitor of zzso in zzso zzso through its blockade of zzso zzso
