zzso with zzso zzso zzso renders host cells resistant to zzso induced by a variety of zzso While zzso of zzso has been extensively studied in cells acutely infected with zzso very little is known on how persistent zzso infection influences host cell zzso Here we show that zzso cells persistently infected with zzso resist zzso induced with zzso or zzso zzso induced the zzso of nuclear factor zzso B zzso and zzso of zzso with a chemical inhibitor or by zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso infected cells for zzso induction by zzso or zzso zzso infection resulted in the zzso of the zzso regulated inhibitor of zzso protein 2 zzso but not inhibitor of zzso protein 1 zzso Interestingly, zzso of either zzso or zzso zzso infected cells, suggesting that zzso play an important role in the zzso resistance of persistently infected zzso
