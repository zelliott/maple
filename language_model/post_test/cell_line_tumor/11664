zzso a zzso zzso has been shown recently to have zzso zzso However, the mechanisms that zzso zzso tumor zzso are not well zzso In this study, we investigated the effects of zzso on expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of vascular zzso growth factor zzso in tumor zzso We found that zzso decreased the expression of zzso by affecting its stability and reduced the zzso of zzso which suppressed zzso in zzso zzso promoted the degradation of zzso by increasing its zzso zzso which depended on zzso zzso zzso and the von zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the binding between zzso protein 90 zzso and zzso In addition, zzso zzso the zzso client proteins zzso zzso and zzso but did not affect the level of zzso zzso also increased zzso of zzso and promoted its degradation in zzso We also found that zzso could inhibit nuclear zzso of zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso showed that zzso decreased the binding activity of zzso consensus DNA zzso with zzso in nuclear extracts from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also revealed that zzso directly zzso to zzso zzso element zzso and this binding was significantly decreased in zzso cells treated with zzso zzso results indicated in zzso activity of zzso against zzso zzso in nude zzso Taken together, the results suggested that zzso was a potent inhibitor of zzso and provided a new insight into the mechanisms of zzso against zzso
