Fourteen novel zzso derivatives of zzso were designed and zzso via zzso zzso reactions of zzso zzso aromatic zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso derivatives was evaluated against zzso zzso and zzso cell lines using zzso reduction zzso zzso compounds demonstrated strong zzso potential in zzso cell zzso zzso zzso was the most potent zzso with zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cells, zzso The results of zzso study indicated that zzso property of these derivatives directly influenced the zzso potential in zzso cell zzso zzso study of compounds, conducted for zzso binding site of zzso zzso zzso demonstrated the key zzso interaction with Met 347 of the hinge zzso
