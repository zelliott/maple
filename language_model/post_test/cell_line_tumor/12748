zzso an zzso zzso zzso has classically been thought of as a nuclear zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso is mainly localized in the nucleus of normal cells, but is predominantly localized in the zzso of the cancer zzso transformed cells we zzso We found this zzso zzso zzso of zzso is regulated by elevated zzso activity and zzso signaling in cancer zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso of zzso is due to increased protein stability and is regulated by zzso zzso In addition, we determined that zzso is required for zzso cancer cell zzso Our study represents the first identification that zzso zzso zzso is one of the specific zzso to zzso that occur in cancer cells, and zzso signaling plays an important role in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso Our findings suggest that the zzso zzso zzso in cancer cells may greatly contribute to its zzso function by working downstream of the zzso signaling zzso
