In recent years, zzso human growth hormone zzso has been increasingly used in patients to help them recover from zzso But zzso as a zzso can promote cell renewal and increase zzso zzso In the current study, we assessed the proliferation of a zzso duct cancer cell line zzso in zzso with zzso and explored the possible relationship with the axis of zzso zzso growth zzso 

zzso cells in the exponential growth stage were harvested and divided into an experimental group zzso zzso and a control group zzso zzso The zzso group was divided into four zzso according to the dose of zzso and culture time zzso zzso for 2 hours, 50 zzso for 24 hours, 100 zzso for 2 hours, 100 zzso for 24 zzso The zzso group was divided into two zzso zzso for 2 hours and zzso for 24 zzso After 2 or 24 hours, IGF-1 and zzso were detected using the zzso zzso zzso The zzso cells cultured for 24 hours with two zzso zzso were made into single cell suspensions and samples underwent subsequent cell cycle zzso zzso zzso of IGF-1 and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were tested with the method of in zzso zzso 

There was no statistically significant difference between the zzso and zzso groups after 2 hours of culture zzso But after 24 hours of culture, zzso zzso cell growth in zzso and also elevated the percentage in S phase and the proliferation index ( zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso in contrast to the blank zzso The expression of zzso increased with the dose of zzso but zzso did zzso 

zzso can stimulate zzso cell growth and proliferation in zzso and the mechanism is most likely by the zzso zzso
