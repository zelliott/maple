zzso of unfolding or zzso proteins within the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso triggers zzso stress, and sustained zzso stress ultimately leads to cell zzso Both of these events are involved in the zzso of zzso protein of 78 zzso zzso also known as zzso zzso protein zzso zzso protein zzso also known as growth arrest and DNA zzso gene 153 zzso and zzso zzso stress has been shown to be involved in neurodegenerative disorders, such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso We previously showed that zzso a natural zzso compound, has a protective effect against zzso zzso zzso Here, we studied the protective effects of zzso on zzso induced in zzso cells by the specific zzso stress zzso zzso zzso TM treatment significantly reduced cell viability in a zzso zzso zzso dramatically rescued the cells against zzso cell zzso In addition, zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso These data suggest that zzso is effective at protecting against neurodegenerative zzso
