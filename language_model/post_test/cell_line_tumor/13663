zzso cells in solid tumors survive under prolonged zzso and can be a source of resistance to current cancer zzso zzso zzso is also associated with a more zzso zzso and poor survival in cancer zzso Recent progress in our understanding of the biology of tumor cells under zzso has led to increased attention on targeting zzso for cancer zzso We report here that a novel zzso zzso zzso but not its parent or related compounds such as zzso A and zzso A, is more zzso to hypoxic cells than to zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso factor zzso and the zzso of zzso were effectively inhibited by treatment with zzso suggesting that the preferential zzso toward hypoxic cells is associated with a reduction of zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibited the growth of human pancreatic cancer zzso cells while sparing normal zzso cells, and significantly inhibited the growth of zzso cells as zzso without apparent adverse zzso zzso cancer cells expressing zzso and zzso exhibited characteristics of stem zzso Treatment with zzso increased this stem zzso population, and this effect was significantly inhibited by zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in pancreatic cancer cell lines compared with zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may be a potential therapeutic agent for hypoxic tumors such as pancreatic zzso
