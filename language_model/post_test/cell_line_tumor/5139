zzso is a versatile method for in zzso or in zzso delivery of different molecules into zzso However, no study so far has zzso the effects of electric zzso used in zzso zzso zzso or electric zzso used in zzso therapy zzso zzso on zzso zzso We studied the effect of zzso and zzso zzso on human zzso melanoma cells in zzso in order to understand and predict the possible effect of electric zzso on gene expression and their possible effect on cell zzso 

We used zzso with zzso different zzso to obtain the expression profile of genes involved in zzso and cancer development in a zzso melanoma cell line zzso exposed to zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso exposed to zzso zzso showed a zzso average survival rate, while cells exposed to zzso zzso showed a zzso average survival zzso Only seven common genes were found zzso expressed in cells 16 h after exposure to zzso and zzso zzso We found that zzso and zzso zzso induce an zzso stress response zzso repress zzso protein zzso a major protein involved in zzso zzso and zzso components involved in protein zzso 

Our results show that zzso does not significantly change the expression profile of major zzso zzso genes or zzso of the cell zzso Moreover, zzso also does not changes the expression of genes involved in the stability of DNA, supporting current evidence that zzso is a safe method that does not promote zzso However, in spite of being considered an zzso method, it does to some extent induce stress, which resulted in the expression of the environmental stress response zzso zzso
