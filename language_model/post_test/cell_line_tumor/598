To investigate the effect of zzso targeting zzso and zzso gene simultaneously on the proliferation and zzso of human colon cancer zzso 

zzso zzso expression zzso targeting zzso and zzso gene simultaneously were constructed and zzso into human colon cancer cell line zzso The effects of zzso zzso expression zzso on zzso cells were detected by zzso Western zzso zzso reduction zzso and flow zzso 

It was confirmed by restriction zzso and sequence analysis that zzso zzso expression zzso targeting zzso and zzso gene simultaneously was constructed zzso The zzso rates of zzso targeting zzso and zzso gene simultaneously on zzso zzso and protein expression were zzso and zzso respectively, and those on zzso zzso and protein expression were zzso and zzso zzso The survival rate of cancer cells was decreased whereas the zzso rate was increased, but the coordinate repression was weaker than zzso and zzso zzso interference zzso 

zzso targeting zzso and zzso gene simultaneously can decrease the expression of zzso and zzso zzso suppress cell proliferation and induce cell zzso in human colon zzso The coordinate repression was weaker than zzso and zzso zzso interference zzso
