Here we use zzso imaging to demonstrate a zzso transition to a zzso state as breast cancer cells zzso Imaging primary zzso revealed zzso in cell zzso and zzso Two distinct modes of zzso were zzso collective and zzso By monitoring the zzso of zzso and the activity of a zzso reporter gene during breast cancer cell zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso is zzso and locally activated in zzso single zzso zzso switches cells from cohesive to single cell zzso through a zzso program involving zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso prevented cells moving zzso in zzso but did not inhibit cells moving zzso zzso restricted to collective invasion were capable of zzso invasion but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso promoted single cell zzso and zzso but reduced subsequent growth in the zzso Thus, transient zzso zzso is essential for zzso zzso
