An zzso zzso super zzso zzso has been used widely for studying genes regulated by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso also zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso in the zzso However, zzso primarily targets zzso and zzso complexes, leaving other zzso protein complexes, such as zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Because these zzso zzso complexes also contribute to gene regulation and are activated in pathological conditions, broad zzso of all zzso species is of significant pharmacological and clinical zzso We have zzso generated, and tested a zzso zzso super zzso We showed that zzso which no longer generates zzso and zzso zzso degradation, effectively zzso all zzso zzso In addition, we also demonstrated that zzso significantly enhances tumor necrosis factor zzso killing of zzso skin zzso cells where zzso zzso activity is zzso Our results suggest that zzso is a broader range and effective zzso super zzso and can potentially be used in cells where a zzso zzso activity is dominant or multiple zzso activities are zzso
