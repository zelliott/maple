An important nutritional question as to whether the ratio of zzso zzso to omega-3 zzso fatty acids plays a role in zzso remains to be clarified in well qualified experimental zzso The recently engineered zzso mice, which can convert zzso to zzso fatty acids and have a balanced ratio of zzso to zzso fatty acids in their zzso and zzso independent of diet, allow carefully controlled studies to be performed in the absence of potential zzso factors of diet and therefore are a useful model for zzso the role of zzso fatty acid ratio in zzso We implanted mouse melanoma zzso cells into transgenic and zzso zzso and examined the zzso of tumor formation and tumor growth zzso The results showed a dramatic reduction of melanoma formation and growth in zzso transgenic zzso The level of zzso fatty acids and their zzso zzso zzso zzso were much higher (but the zzso ratio is much zzso in the tumor and surrounding zzso of zzso mice than that of zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso deleted on the zzso 10 zzso gene was significantly zzso in the zzso zzso In zzso experiments showed that addition of the zzso fatty acid zzso acid or zzso inhibited the growth of zzso cell line and increased the expression of zzso which could be partially attenuated by zzso of zzso production, suggesting that zzso may act as an zzso zzso These data demonstrate an zzso zzso effect of zzso fatty acids through, at least in part, zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso
