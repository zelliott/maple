Recent finding has shown that zzso (also known as zzso functions as a natural regulator of the zzso complex formation and is associated with cell spreading and migration via zzso at focal zzso Here, we report for the first time the zzso zzso of zzso in gastric zzso zzso of zzso was detected in zzso (10 of zzso of gastric cancer cell lines by real-time quantitative zzso and zzso (8 of 10) of the zzso cell lines were associated with zzso island zzso at a zzso region of zzso Furthermore, zzso was restored in its zzso cell lines after treatment with zzso and/or zzso zzso Loss of expression of zzso was also detected in zzso zzso of zzso of primary gastric zzso This decrease in expression level significantly correlated with an increase of the zzso island zzso In addition, the zzso status in any zzso gastric zzso was gradually increased in an zzso manner, suggesting that the positive zzso in zzso gastric zzso can be due to zzso zzso zzso as an early event in gastric zzso Moreover, the transient zzso of zzso significantly zzso cell migration in gastric cancer cells but had no effects on cell zzso These results suggest that the frequent zzso of zzso by zzso zzso in gastric cancer may be important in tumor progression events, such as invasion and zzso Thus, zzso may be useful as a molecular zzso and a therapeutic target by increasing its expression and activity in gastric zzso
