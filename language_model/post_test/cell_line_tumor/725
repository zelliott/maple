We have investigated the expression and regulation of zzso zzso zzso in gastric zzso 

Clinical gastric zzso samples were analyzed by zzso and quantitative real-time zzso for protein and zzso expression of zzso and for zzso status of zzso zzso The effects of zzso zzso and zzso mechanisms on zzso regulation were assessed in gastric cancer cell zzso 

In a gastric cancer cell line with a very low zzso expression zzso the zzso promoter was zzso and treatment with a zzso agent zzso restored zzso zzso In a cell line with a relatively high zzso level of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso This effect of zzso was at least in part attributed to zzso of zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in strong increase of zzso zzso production in zzso cells and increased cell growth of these cells by zzso in zzso zzso In clinical gastric zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso lower in gastric cancer samples when compared with paired zzso zzso zzso zzso 26) and zzso protein was lost in zzso of gastric zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is zzso in gastric cancer, which could potentially lead to accelerated tumor zzso zzso our data indicate that a zzso zzso linked to gastric zzso zzso suppresses zzso expression at least partially by zzso promoter activity of the zzso zzso
