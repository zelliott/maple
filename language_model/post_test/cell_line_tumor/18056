zzso migration plays a critical role in zzso development, zzso and function, as well as in the zzso of zzso zzso including the plasma cell zzso multiple myeloma zzso Here, we demonstrate that stimulation of B cells and zzso cells with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strong migration and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by expression of the dominant negative zzso zzso or of zzso a Ral zzso zzso that sequesters active zzso results in impaired zzso migration of B cells and zzso zzso Of the 2 Ral zzso zzso and zzso zzso was found to mediate zzso zzso We have recently shown that zzso zzso and zzso mediate zzso zzso zzso however, zzso Ral zzso is not affected in B cells deficient in these zzso In addition, treatment with pharmacological zzso against zzso and zzso or expression of zzso Ras did not impair zzso Ral zzso Taken together, these results reveal a novel function for zzso that is, regulation of zzso migration of B cells and zzso cells, thereby providing new insights into the control of zzso zzso trafficking, and function, as well as into the zzso of zzso
