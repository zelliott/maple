Here, we report the identification of a zzso promoting factor by a forward genetic screen in zzso A zzso zzso library was introduced into the zzso cancer cell line zzso which was then zzso transplanted into mouse zzso fat zzso followed by selection for cells that zzso to the zzso The genes zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to promote breast cancer invasion and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which catalyze zzso bond formation, reduction, and zzso have not previously been implicated in cancer cell signaling and tumor zzso zzso of zzso promotes both in zzso migration and invasion and in zzso zzso of breast cancer zzso These effects were shown to involve zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso pathways through zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso subsequently stimulates zzso and zzso which mediate the migration and invasion of tumor zzso zzso of zzso and zzso reverses the zzso induced by zzso Finally, zzso was shown to be zzso in human surgical samples of invasive breast zzso These data identify a link between zzso zzso and tumor development, and provide a mechanism that zzso zzso and zzso signaling in the promotion of cancer zzso
