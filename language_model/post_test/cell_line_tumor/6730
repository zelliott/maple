zzso growth factor zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso cellular zzso and growth in an zzso or independent zzso It also shows zzso activity in zzso We recently found that a zzso zzso is zzso zzso to a zzso form by a zzso zzso zzso zzso changing its biological zzso In this study, we attempted to identify the zzso zzso Of nine human cell lines tested, seven cell lines zzso zzso at high levels, and two of them, zzso clear cell zzso zzso and gastric zzso zzso highly produced the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso effectively blocked the zzso zzso in the zzso cell zzso The zzso medium of zzso cells did not cleave zzso zzso but their membrane fraction had an zzso zzso The membrane fraction contained an zzso zzso zzso which was identified as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso When the membrane fraction was separated by zzso the zzso activity zzso with zzso A soluble form of zzso zzso in an zzso form efficiently zzso zzso at the same site as that found in a naturally zzso zzso Furthermore, small interfering zzso for zzso efficiently blocked both the zzso expression and the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is processed to the zzso form by zzso on the cell zzso
