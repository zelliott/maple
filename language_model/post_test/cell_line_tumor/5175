In our efforts to explore marine zzso as a source of novel zzso compounds, we discovered a zzso zzso linear zzso zzso A zzso which we screened against a diverse set of 59 zzso We describe the structure determination of 1 and two natural zzso zzso B zzso and C zzso using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 selectively inhibited zzso D and E with zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 showed similar potency and selectivity against zzso D and E zzso of zzso zzso and 354 zzso respectively), whereas the truncated zzso analogue zzso C zzso which consists of two fewer zzso than 1 and 2, was less potent against both but still selective for zzso zzso The selectivity of compounds 1-3 for zzso E over D zzso suggests that these natural products may be useful tools to probe zzso E zzso We investigated the structural basis of this selectivity using molecular zzso We also show that 1 can reduce zzso presentation by zzso cells, a process thought to rely on zzso zzso
