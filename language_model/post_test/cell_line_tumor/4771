Recently, we have introduced zzso zzso zzso zzso as a new zzso compound which has promising zzso properties in zzso and in zzso zzso of this study was to investigate the impact of ABC zzso zzso resistance zzso on the zzso activity of zzso Here, we demonstrate that all zzso cell models investigated, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance protein 1), or zzso zzso cancer resistance zzso either due to drug selection or gene zzso were significantly hypersensitive against zzso Using zzso zzso cells as zzso model, zzso hypersensitivity was demonstrated to be based on stronger zzso induction and/or cell cycle arrest at zzso cellular drug zzso zzso did neither stimulate zzso zzso activity nor alter zzso 123 zzso arguing against a direct interaction with zzso zzso several drug resistance zzso did not sensitize but rather protect zzso cells against zzso zzso Moreover, long-term zzso treatment of zzso cells at zzso zzso led within 20 passages to a complete loss of drug resistance based on blocked zzso gene zzso When exposing parental zzso cells to zzso zzso increasing zzso zzso we observed, in contrast to several other zzso no acquisition of zzso zzso zzso our data demonstrate that zzso is zzso in zzso cells and might have zzso properties by blocking zzso zzso Together with the disability of tumor cells to acquire zzso resistance, our data suggest that zzso should be especially active against notoriously drug-resistant tumor types and as second line treatment after standard chemotherapy zzso
