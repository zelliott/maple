A zzso zzso fluorescent probe was zzso and demonstrated to be highly selective in reaction with zzso acid zzso an zzso zzso oxygen species zzso produced by zzso in zzso The reaction with zzso resulted in the zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso and the zzso decreasing at zzso zzso accompanied by the appearance of a new zzso band at 520 zzso The reaction mechanism was carefully examined and proposed to proceed by initial formation of zzso and subsequent zzso This zzso fluorescent probe was successfully applied as a selective and sensitive indicator for zzso on the basis of either zzso or zzso which showed detection limits of zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, the molecular probe was further demonstrated for zzso zzso imaging of zzso in cells and for evaluating the zzso activity of zzso in the zzso generation by measuring zzso zzso
