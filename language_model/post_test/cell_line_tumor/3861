zzso physiology relies on the organization of zzso proteins by molecular zzso such as zzso zzso frequently involves changes in their organization or zzso The zzso zzso is thought to contribute to cancer progression through direct interaction with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, this interaction cannot explain the ability of zzso to control migration in the absence of these zzso or on zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso can regulate tumor cell migration without direct zzso binding and that zzso zzso zzso zzso clinically with tumor progression and zzso zzso zzso through its zzso domain promotes zzso in areas of zzso zzso leading to enhanced zzso and zzso of tumor cell zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso is a strong regulator of zzso even in the absence of zzso expression but requires zzso suggesting that zzso can control migration independent of its zzso zzso The zzso detection of zzso in prostate cancer zzso with poor patient zzso When zzso is present, patients are more likely to recur after radical zzso and progression to zzso disease is zzso zzso analysis identifies zzso as an independent predictor of zzso Moreover, the detection of zzso can zzso survival among patients with elevated zzso zzso zzso zzso these studies demonstrate that a zzso of zzso exists on the surface of tumor cells that can regulate migration independent of its zzso zzso The clinical correlation of zzso with prostate cancer progression suggests that it may contribute to the disease and predict cancer zzso
