zzso zzso zzso greatly improve the zzso and sustained release of zzso drugs and provide a protective environment for the cargo molecules in zzso media, which favors lower drug administration doses, reduces adverse side effects, and increases blood circulation times and passive targeting to specific zzso These capabilities zzso among other zzso on the structure and composition of the zzso zzso zzso and, in particular, block length have been shown to play an important role in the modification of cellular responses such as drug zzso processes or zzso pathways when zzso zzso are in close contact with zzso Here we present a detailed study about the role zzso structure and composition play on cell viability and cellular response of several cell zzso To do that, more than 30 structurally related zzso with zzso and zzso zzso containing different zzso blocks and zzso zzso as the common zzso unit have been analyzed regarding zzso and potential as zzso cell response zzso by testing their influence on the zzso pump zzso mechanism responsible of zzso resistance in zzso zzso An empirical threshold for cell viability could be established at a zzso zzso value above zzso zzso for zzso with zzso structure, whereas no empirical rule could be observed for zzso Moreover, some of the tested zzso zzso zzso and zzso that notably increased and zzso that decreased the zzso zzso zzso were observed to act as efficient zzso of the zzso zzso pump promoting an enhanced zzso zzso zzso inside zzso resistant zzso zzso zzso
