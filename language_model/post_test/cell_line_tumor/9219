The use of in zzso drug zzso zzso for the assessment of zzso interactions that lead to zzso may not take into account the many cellular zzso responsible for combination zzso Administration of the zzso drug zzso for example, is associated with rapid conversion of drug from its active zzso form to the inactive zzso zzso Thus it is difficult to model, in zzso the behavior of this drug when used as a single agent and when used in a combination setting, this factor may contribute to the interactions zzso zzso the objective of this study was to examine the influence of zzso zzso ratio on the cellular zzso of zzso when used as a single agent and under conditions where it is used in combination with zzso 

A fixed ratio experimental design was used and drug ratios of zzso and zzso were judged to be zzso zzso or synergistic to the zzso cell lung cancer cell line, zzso on the basis of the median effect analysis methodology of zzso and zzso The influence of zzso pH on zzso zzso was evaluated at pH zzso and pH zzso when the drug was added immediately to the cells or first zzso at the indicated zzso These studies were completed in the presence and absence of zzso 

When zzso was added as a single agent to cells in pH zzso zzso media, the drug underwent zzso to the zzso zzso however, there was a rapid zzso of the zzso zzso form which peaked at zzso zzso protein by 30 zzso and drops to zzso zzso protein by 24 zzso In pH zzso zzso media, zzso of zzso zzso was substantially lower over a 60 zzso zzso however, the cellular zzso measured at 24 h was comparable to that observed when the drug was added into pH zzso zzso When evaluating zzso zzso zzso in a combination setting with zzso no significant difference in either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso was observed, suggesting that drug interactions that led to zzso were mechanistically zzso zzso are presented which suggest that when zzso and zzso are used in zzso there was a significant zzso of platinum association with DNA compared to results obtained when zzso was used zzso 

These results suggest that the zzso zzso to zzso ratio does not influence the zzso of the active zzso zzso form in zzso cells and that zzso does not influence zzso zzso when used in zzso It is argued, therefore, that the improved zzso between zzso and zzso as determined using zzso zzso has the potential to be preserved in zzso assuming the optimal zzso ratio and concentration can be effectively delivered to the zzso
