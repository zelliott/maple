To zzso map, zzso and functionally validate a novel mouse model for impaired zzso tolerance and insulin zzso 

zzso of the insulin zzso and associated mild insulin resistance has been used to sensitize an zzso zzso screen to identify novel zzso resulting in impaired zzso tolerance and zzso The new impaired zzso tolerance 4 zzso model was selected using an zzso zzso tolerance test and inheritance of the zzso confirmed by generation of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was correlated with zzso information to map the location of the gene and candidates zzso for zzso The function of the zzso high mobility group zzso 4 zzso gene in insulin zzso was tested using another zzso zzso and by small interfering zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

We describe two zzso zzso dominant zzso in the highly zzso zzso box of the zzso factor zzso Previously associated with zzso development, zzso zzso in the adult mouse result in an insulin zzso zzso which exhibits impaired zzso tolerance in association with insulin zzso insulin zzso zzso of the zzso transcript in zzso and zzso cells resulted in the abolition of zzso insulin release similar to that observed for zzso of the key zzso zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso in treated cells indicate that this zzso lies downstream of the zzso zzso channel zzso zzso and calcium zzso 

zzso represents a novel zzso model of insulin resistance coupled with an insulin zzso zzso The zzso gene has a role in insulin zzso in the adult zzso downstream of the zzso zzso
