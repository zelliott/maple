Bone formation and zzso differentiation require the functional expression of the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso is also a zzso of proliferation in zzso by attenuating cell cycle progression in zzso zzso levels are modulated during the cell cycle, which are zzso in zzso and minimal beyond the zzso phase transition zzso zzso and M zzso It is not known whether zzso gene expression is cell cycle controlled in zzso nor how zzso or zzso are regulated during the cell cycle in bone cancer zzso We investigated zzso and zzso gene expression during cell cycle progression in zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein levels are reduced as expected in zzso cells arrested in late zzso (by zzso or M phase (by zzso but not in cell cycle arrested zzso zzso zzso protein levels are cell cycle independent in both zzso and zzso zzso In synchronized zzso zzso progressing from late zzso or zzso zzso levels but not zzso levels are cell cycle zzso However, both factors are zzso elevated throughout the cell cycle in zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso protein levels in late zzso and S in zzso cells, but not in zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso degradation of zzso is zzso in zzso zzso We propose that cell cycle control of zzso gene expression is impaired in zzso and that this deregulation may contribute to the zzso of zzso
