zzso vaccination is an zzso strategy being pursued as a method of enhancing zzso zzso zzso To date, most studies have focused on the use of zzso class zzso zzso and have not shown a correlation between zzso zzso T cell expansion and the generation of protective immune zzso We investigated the effects of zzso zzso vaccination on the ability of zzso T cells to mount protective zzso responses in the zzso tumor model zzso To accomplish this, we extended the zzso acid sequence of the known zzso class zzso zzso rejection zzso from zzso to allow binding to zzso class II zzso zzso with this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso T cell zzso function, but did not directly prime zzso T zzso zzso zzso of zzso mice zzso with zzso were protected from subsequent tumor challenge in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso T cells in zzso mice was detected only after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell function in response to zzso II vaccination allowed a zzso reduction in the number of zzso transferred zzso zzso T cells needed to protect recipients against tumor challenge as compared with previous studies using zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso led to a more rapid and transient expansion of transferred zzso T cells than was seen in zzso zzso These findings illustrate that zzso zzso vaccination zzso zzso zzso but that the number of zzso precursor zzso T cells will ultimately dictate the success of zzso
