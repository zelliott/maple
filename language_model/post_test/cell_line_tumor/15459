Cancer zzso describes the progressive skeletal muscle wasting and weakness associated with many zzso zzso reduces mobility and quality of life and accounts for zzso of all zzso zzso zzso of the zzso system causes skeletal muscle wasting and zzso We tested the hypothesis that treatment with the zzso converting zzso zzso zzso zzso would enhance whole body and skeletal muscle function in zzso mice bearing zzso zzso zzso zzso mice received a subcutaneous injection of zzso zzso saline or zzso tumor cells inducing either a mild or severe zzso The following day, one cohort of zzso mice began receiving zzso in their drinking water (4 zzso zzso zzso ) for 21 zzso In mild and severe zzso zzso increased measures of whole body function zzso strength and zzso and reduced fatigue in isolated contracting zzso muscle strips zzso zzso In severely zzso mice, zzso reduced tumor growth, improved locomotor activity and reduced fatigue of zzso anterior muscles in zzso zzso zzso which was associated with increased zzso zzso capacity zzso zzso p zzso zzso attenuated the increase in zzso and zzso zzso expression and enhanced zzso zzso in severely zzso mice but neither body nor muscle mass was zzso These findings support the therapeutic potential of zzso zzso for enhancing whole body function and reducing fatigue of respiratory muscles in early and late stage cancer zzso and should be confirmed in future clinical zzso Since zzso zzso alone did not enhance body or muscle mass, zzso with an anabolic agent may be required to address these aspects of cancer zzso
