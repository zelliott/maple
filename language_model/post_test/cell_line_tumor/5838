The zzso signaling zzso has been largely unexplored as a potential therapeutic target in zzso The novel 2nd generation zzso small zzso zzso zzso its direct downstream target, zzso zzso in zzso center and zzso center diffuse large zzso zzso zzso cell lines and primary zzso Similar decreased zzso levels were noted despite zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso several zzso zzso zzso were zzso by zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced zzso and zzso zzso and zzso in all zzso cell lines and zzso cells zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso resulted in significantly less tumor compared with control in an in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell death was associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso was zzso In addition, there was stabilization of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and a significant decrease in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso of zzso minimally zzso zzso Finally, manipulation of zzso with zzso of zzso cells with zzso or through chemical zzso zzso had minimal effect on zzso cell zzso Altogether, these findings show that the novel zzso agent, zzso induced zzso in zzso and that cell death was zzso
