zzso a zzso zzso marker, is shed into the cell environment after zzso zzso of its zzso zzso zzso is able to suppress the zzso immune zzso Because high serum levels of zzso and cholesterol-lowering drugs seem to be beneficial in some zzso zzso diseases, we focused on a link between zzso shedding and the amount of cellular zzso zzso depletion of human zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell lines by zzso led to a zzso of zzso zzso and increased release of zzso Additionally, the zzso drugs zzso cholesterol zzso and zzso increased zzso zzso Both the zzso of zzso zzso and the release of zzso were dependent on zzso Using specific zzso we detected zzso converting zzso zzso as the leading zzso responsible for zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso method for zzso raft isolation revealed that zzso was partially present in zzso zzso whereas zzso was localized in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by cholesterol depletion might therefore lead to dynamic interactions of zzso with zzso resulting in enhanced shedding of zzso Our results suggest a possible role of zzso shedding of zzso in the zzso of immune zzso
