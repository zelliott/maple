The zzso serves as the main zzso for breast tumor zzso and is a target of zzso in many tumor zzso In this study, we aimed to determine if zzso vascular properties could help to explain the differences observed in zzso across the intrinsic zzso of human breast zzso Analysis of gene expression signatures from more than 3,000 human breast tumors found that zzso programs that measured vascular zzso vascular zzso and a zzso were the most highly expressed in zzso and zzso zzso The majority of the vascular gene signatures added zzso information to zzso zzso density scores and zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, pure zzso cell lines, and zzso of zzso cells within established zzso cancer cell lines, exhibited zzso zzso when cultured on zzso In zzso zzso found that zzso tumors, but not zzso tumors, extensively zzso injected contrast agent through zzso spaces and zzso zzso zzso Taken together, the zzso characteristics of the cancer cells, combined with both the amount and the zzso state of the zzso contribute to breast cancer zzso zzso We zzso that the genetic signatures we have identified highlight patients that should respond most favorably to zzso zzso
