To explain why zzso zzso is unable to block DNA synthesis and cell cycle zzso and paradoxically enhances progression from zzso into S phase in the zzso leukemia zzso cell line, we studied its metabolism and effects on proteins regulating the transition from zzso to S zzso A low zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso and a lack of zzso induction despite zzso zzso and zzso may account for the inability of zzso to block the cell zzso An alternative zzso involving zzso zzso seems implicated in the zzso increase in zzso to S phase zzso
