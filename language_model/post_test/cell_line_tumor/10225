Changes in the environment of a cell zzso zzso signals and sequential zzso of protein modification and elicit nuclear zzso zzso However, the functional links between zzso zzso gene regulation and zzso regulation by zzso proteins within the nucleus are largely zzso Here, we describe novel zzso regulation by zzso zzso that zzso formation of an zzso zzso zzso complex, zzso zzso Including zzso Assembly zzso an zzso complex containing Williams syndrome zzso factor zzso zzso a specific component of two zzso zzso complexes zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso by the stimulation of zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso in the WAC zzso domain, located close to the N zzso of zzso was identified as a major zzso zzso Using zzso analysis of a zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing cell line, the zzso of this zzso zzso was found to be essential for maintaining the association between zzso and core zzso complex zzso thereby maintaining the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso regulation of vitamin D zzso was consequently impaired by this zzso zzso but the recovery from DNA damage zzso by zzso was not zzso Our results suggest that zzso serves as a nuclear sensor of the zzso signals to fine-tune the zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso mediates a previously unknown zzso step in zzso regulation, and this zzso switching mechanism between the two functionally distinct zzso complexes might zzso the diverse functions of zzso in various nuclear zzso
