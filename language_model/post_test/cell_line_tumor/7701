zzso models are required to estimate kinetic parameters of zzso zzso zzso from magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso or zzso exchange models utilizing a hypothetical approximation to the true zzso input function zzso zzso an ideal zzso zzso have been used zzso We present a method for direct measurement of the zzso in the zzso The zzso zzso zzso signal was measured in zzso blood as it was continuously withdrawn through a small zzso The measured signal was corrected for zzso relaxation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of blood in the chamber to allow for the zzso of the direct zzso Using direct zzso rather than the commonly used zzso zzso provided realistic estimates of the rate constant of conversion of zzso to zzso zzso the rate constant of conversion of zzso to zzso zzso the clearance rate constant of zzso from blood to zzso zzso and the relaxation rate of zzso zzso Since no zzso signal was present in blood, it was possible to use a simple zzso relationship, with the tumor tissue zzso zzso as the input for the zzso zzso This provided a robust estimate of zzso similar to that obtained using a directly measured zzso
