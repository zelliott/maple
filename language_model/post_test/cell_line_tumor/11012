To investigate the growth suppression of zzso expressing zzso on established zzso tumors in nude zzso 

zzso zzso zzso in nude mice were established by tumor tissue mass zzso The successfully constructed zzso zzso zzso carrying zzso gene zzso were directly injected into the zzso tumors in nude zzso Compared to control group, the growth curve of tumor was drawn and the growth zzso rate of tumor was zzso The zzso of tumors was examined by zzso and zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso and zzso was detected in tumors by zzso zzso 

The growth of tumors in gene therapy group with zzso was obviously suppressed compared to control group zzso zzso g vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso rate of tumor growth reached zzso zzso detection showed that the tumors in nude mice were poorly differentiated zzso zzso zzso In addition, the expression of zzso was increased, while the expression of zzso was decreased in tumors after being zzso with zzso 

zzso gene therapy zzso by zzso zzso has a significant zzso effect on zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso expression may be its important zzso
