The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in various tumor types suggests that zzso is an attractive target for cancer imaging and therapy with zzso zzso zzso We recently reported the ability of zzso zzso zzso to be used for dual zzso zzso and zzso zzso To further investigate the synergistic effect of the zzso targeting of zzso zzso we evaluated zzso zzso for PET imaging of zzso 

zzso was coupled with zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso and the zzso were labeled with zzso The in zzso and in zzso characteristics of zzso were compared with those of zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso and zzso had comparable dual zzso zzso and zzso affinities in zzso both of which were slightly lower than zzso for zzso binding and zzso for zzso zzso zzso possessed significantly higher tumor zzso than did zzso zzso the mixture of zzso and zzso or zzso in zzso prostate zzso zzso also showed improved in zzso zzso such as lower liver and zzso activity zzso than did the zzso zzso zzso also outperformed zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso model that expresses zzso on tumor zzso but no zzso in tumor zzso which had no zzso of zzso 

Compared with other zzso zzso showed favorable in zzso zzso and enhanced tumor zzso which warrants its further investigation for targeting tumors that express zzso or zzso or that zzso zzso and zzso for imaging and therapeutic zzso The synergistic effect of zzso zzso observed in this study also encourages further investigations of novel zzso recognizing other cell surface receptors for tumor zzso
