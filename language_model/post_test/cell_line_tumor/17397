zzso a zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in many zzso cellular processes including tumor growth and zzso zzso zzso has been identified in the serum of normal zzso Furthermore, tumor progression is often associated with marked increases in plasma levels of soluble zzso zzso of soluble zzso by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is likely to alter cellular responses to the environment due to modification of the cell surface and the potential for soluble zzso to influence zzso zzso binding to cell zzso Cellular zzso is typically required to induce zzso binding to cell surface zzso but the affinity of zzso soluble zzso for zzso remains zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso M and transforming growth factor zzso zzso which stimulate zzso binding to zzso lung zzso tumor cells, also induce the release of soluble zzso Interestingly, soluble zzso released by zzso zzso cells retained the zzso properties of the zzso zzso In contrast, soluble zzso released from zzso zzso cells differed in its zzso capacity from cell surface zzso expressed on zzso zzso These data indicate that the mechanisms that regulate the generation of soluble zzso may also govern the binding of the released zzso to zzso and therefore determine the impact on zzso zzso and zzso zzso
