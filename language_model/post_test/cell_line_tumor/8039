zzso zzso is pivotal in both of zzso and resistance to zzso zzso We investigated the molecules and pathways of zzso evasion in human zzso cells by irradiating zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and pathways related to zzso responses were identified via zzso approaches followed by reconstruction of zzso Of the zzso defined protein spots, 42 distinct proteins significantly changed their zzso Eleven zzso response proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were involved in 5 zzso zzso including the zzso zzso pathway, protein zzso cellular zzso zzso signaling pathway, and zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression via zzso interference increased tumor cell resistance to zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso or zzso greatly zzso tumor cells to zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso and zzso act as zzso proteins that may serve as therapeutic targets for zzso zzso their expression would increase therapeutic zzso thereby reducing the corresponding doses and zzso of zzso zzso This model of induction of cellular zzso responses to identify zzso zzso via zzso approaches can be applied to other zzso of zzso zzso
