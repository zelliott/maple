The zzso checkpoint zzso zzso is essential in higher zzso due to its role in maintaining zzso stability in zzso zzso zzso gene deletion is zzso zzso and zzso zzso in replicating cells causes zzso defects that eventually lead to zzso replication and zzso collapse, thus generating zzso DNA zzso What is the cause of zzso collapse when zzso is zzso however, remains poorly zzso Here, we show that generation of DNA zzso breaks at replication zzso when zzso activity is compromised relies on the DNA zzso complex zzso zzso we show that zzso DNA zzso than a global increase in zzso zzso the cause of incomplete replication in zzso zzso zzso zzso depletion zzso the zzso progression defects associated with zzso zzso thereby increasing cell zzso zzso protection of replication zzso from zzso even under otherwise unchallenged conditions is therefore vital to prevent uncontrolled fork collapse and ensure proper zzso progression in human zzso
