zzso acute leukemia zzso is a relatively rare zzso of acute leukemia characterized by the presence of both zzso and zzso cell surface zzso We have now screened for transforming genes in zzso blasts with the use of the focus formation zzso with a zzso zzso expression library constructed from zzso blasts isolated from a zzso zzso Some of the zzso zzso recovered from transformed zzso were found to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso G protein zzso 8 zzso The zzso potential of zzso was confirmed with the in zzso focus formation zzso as well as with an in zzso zzso zzso in nude zzso A variety of zzso reporter zzso revealed that zzso increased both the zzso activities of zzso and zzso as well as the zzso activities of the serum response element and zzso fragments of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells of bone zzso showed that zzso expression is frequently increased in leukemia patients, especially in those with zzso zzso Our data thus reveal an abundant expression of zzso in zzso cells and its unexpected role in the zzso of acute zzso
