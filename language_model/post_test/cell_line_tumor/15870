zzso breakage syndrome zzso is a zzso syndrome associated with cancer zzso zzso zzso and growth zzso The zzso gene product, zzso zzso or zzso is a part of the zzso complex, a central player associated with zzso break zzso zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso zzso contributes to transformation through the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso transition through the zzso zzso 

zzso Western zzso analysis, in zzso zzso soft zzso colony formation, and gelatin zzso zzso were zzso 

Here we show that heat shock protein family members, A4 and zzso were induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso decreased the in zzso migration, invasion, and transformation activity in zzso cells zzso zzso However, zzso or zzso induced activity was not zzso through zzso zzso zzso induced the expression of heat shock zzso factor zzso zzso which correlated with the expression of zzso and zzso 

These results identify a novel zzso zzso zzso to induce migration, invasion, and zzso suggesting the zzso of multiple signaling events induced by zzso zzso
