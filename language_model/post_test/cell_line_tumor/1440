Clinical responses to zzso therapies are often restricted to a subset of zzso In some cases, zzso cancer genes are potent zzso for responses to targeted zzso Here, to uncover new zzso of sensitivity and resistance to cancer zzso we screened a panel of several hundred cancer cell zzso represent much of the zzso and genetic diversity of human zzso 130 drugs under clinical and zzso zzso In aggregate, we found that zzso cancer genes were associated with cellular response to most currently available cancer zzso Classic zzso addiction zzso were modified by additional zzso or expression zzso and some frequently zzso genes were associated with sensitivity to a broad range of therapeutic zzso Unexpected relationships were revealed, including the marked sensitivity of Ewing's zzso cells zzso the zzso (also known as zzso gene zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso By linking drug activity to the functional complexity of cancer zzso systematic zzso profiling in cancer cell lines provides a powerful zzso discovery platform to guide rational cancer therapeutic zzso
