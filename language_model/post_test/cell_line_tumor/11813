Small zzso of the zzso factor zzso family, except for zzso mainly zzso to the zzso apparatus, where they trigger formation of coated carrier zzso We recently showed that class I zzso zzso and zzso zzso to recycling zzso as well as to the zzso and are zzso required for recycling of zzso zzso On the other hand, the roles of class II zzso zzso and zzso are not yet fully zzso and the complementary or overlapping functions of class I and class II zzso have been poorly zzso In this study, we find that simultaneous depletion of zzso and zzso zzso extensive zzso of recycling zzso Moreover, the depletion of zzso and zzso zzso retrograde transport of zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso to the zzso network zzso but does not affect the zzso zzso of zzso zzso or inhibit retrograde transport of zzso from late zzso to the zzso These observations indicate that the zzso and zzso pairs are both required for integrity of recycling zzso but are involved in distinct transport zzso the former pair regulates retrograde transport from zzso to the zzso whereas the latter is required for the zzso recycling zzso from zzso to the plasma zzso
