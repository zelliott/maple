zzso zzso zzso therapy zzso provides a novel and promising treatment for zzso zzso However, its specific mechanism has not been fully zzso and its efficacy is remarkably zzso This study investigated the effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso in zzso and zzso to explore optimal zzso and evaluated the significance of cell zzso cell cycle, zzso IX zzso zzso zzso and expression of zzso and zzso zzso in cells to understand the mechanism of zzso for zzso zzso How zzso zzso incubation time, and laser zzso dose influenced the cell proliferation was determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was analyzed by zzso zzso The zzso changes were detected by quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction zzso zzso models transplanted with zzso cells in nude mice were established zzso zzso 10) and killed zzso zzso 4) at 24 h zzso for zzso zzso detection and zzso zzso The remaining mice were measured the tumor size for 3 weeks after zzso Our data show that zzso significantly zzso cell proliferation zzso zzso zzso the zzso efficacy depends on the zzso of zzso zzso incubation time, and laser zzso dose, and the best effect in tumor destruction is at zzso days zzso zzso is localized in zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and arrests cell cycle at zzso zzso zzso is significantly zzso while zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso The results of this study provide references in choosing clinical optimal zzso parameters and help in better understanding the zzso mechanism for zzso zzso
