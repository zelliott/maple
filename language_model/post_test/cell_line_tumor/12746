Nuclear zzso zzso zzso the expression of genes responsible for airway inflammation and zzso in zzso The activity of zzso is tightly regulated by zzso which may be modulated by genetic zzso of the zzso zzso We investigated the association between asthma zzso and zzso gene zzso in a Korean zzso zzso was performed in BA zzso zzso and NC zzso zzso We measured reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso reporter zzso zzso A zzso zzso was associated with asthma development in subjects with zzso asthma zzso ratio zzso zzso p zzso zzso The zzso zzso level was higher in zzso lines with the zzso zzso zzso compared with those with the AA zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity of the zzso T zzso was higher than that of the A zzso zzso zzso The zzso levels of total zzso and zzso zzso were higher in B cell lines of the zzso zzso zzso than those of the AA zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso respectively), whereas nuclear zzso activity in cells with the zzso zzso AA zzso was higher than in cells with the AA zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso may zzso individuals to the development of zzso asthma via regulation of zzso gene expression at the zzso zzso
