The aim of this study was to demonstrate the potential of zzso therapy with the bacterial zzso zzso zzso gene zzso on pancreatic zzso zzso large zzso The in zzso zzso zzso conditions and efficacy were investigated on both subcutaneous zzso of human PC cells in zzso mice and zzso zzso zzso of rat PC cells in zzso zzso After zzso injection of naked zzso DNA, zzso was performed using a zzso array with zzso zzso and either a 300 zzso field strength for subcutaneous or a 500 zzso field strength for zzso PC, parameters providing the best zzso as reflected by the zzso of both zzso activity and zzso zzso As expected, tumors developed sensitivity to zzso treatment zzso zzso or zzso zzso We observed both significant zzso of tumor growth and extended survival of treated zzso In fact, after zzso treatment, PC growth in the subcutaneous model was delayed by zzso for zzso zzso In an zzso pancreatic tumor model, the animal survival was significantly prolonged after zzso zzso transfer followed by zzso treatment, with one animal out of 10 being zzso 6 months zzso The current study demonstrates for the first time on PC the in zzso feasibility of zzso transfer and its therapeutic efficiency using the suicide zzso system, zzso These findings suggest that zzso therapy strategy must be considered for pancreatic cancer treatment, particularly at advanced stages of the zzso
