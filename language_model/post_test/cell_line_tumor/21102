It has recently been shown that cell entry of mouse zzso virus type 2 zzso is zzso through zzso zzso Qiu et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanism underlying zzso entry is not zzso Here we employed multiple chemical and molecular approaches to determine the molecular pathways for zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso gene expression and zzso were significantly inhibited when cells were treated with chemical and zzso zzso of the zzso pathway, such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, viral gene expression was significantly inhibited when cells were zzso with a small interfering zzso specific to the zzso heavy zzso However, these treatments did not affect the zzso and gene expression of zzso demonstrating the specificity of the zzso In addition, zzso of a zzso zzso of zzso 1 did not have any effect on zzso infection, while it significantly blocked the zzso zzso of zzso toxin zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso the zzso but not zzso zzso zzso for zzso Interestingly, when the cells zzso zzso a zzso form zzso of zzso which is thought to be an essential component of the zzso pathway, viral gene expression and zzso were zzso although zzso expression blocked zzso zzso and zzso zzso virus infection, which are dependent on zzso zzso Thus, zzso entry is zzso through zzso but zzso zzso
