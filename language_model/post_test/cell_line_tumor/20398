zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso groups on the zzso rings have been zzso and were used in the synthesis of corresponding zzso complexes of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso Related zzso complexes zzso and zzso have been obtained by zzso using the silver zzso zzso These compounds were characterized by several zzso techniques including zzso and mass zzso zzso and the zzso complexes zzso and zzso were also characterized by X-ray zzso The zzso properties of the zzso complexes have been assessed in various human cancer cell lines, including zzso and zzso zzso The zzso complex zzso was found to be the most active, with zzso values about zzso lower than those achieved with zzso in zzso zzso zzso effects evaluated in human zzso cells revealed a preferential zzso of zzso versus zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso complexes were also evaluated for their ability to in zzso inhibit the zzso zzso zzso zzso The results of this investigation showing that zzso appeared markedly inhibited by both zzso and zzso derivatives at zzso zzso clearly point out this zzso as a protein target for zzso in addition to zzso zzso
