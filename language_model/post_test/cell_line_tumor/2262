The zzso zzso factor is essential for the maintenance of zzso cells in bone zzso colon zzso and zzso zzso zzso malfunction contributes to several types of zzso including breast zzso However, the function of zzso in the zzso spread of breast tumors remains zzso In this study, we report a novel role of zzso in the control of specific zzso that regulate the zzso invasion of breast cancer zzso 

zzso expressed zzso enhanced migration and ability of human zzso and mouse zzso zzso cancer cells to invade zzso but not the collagen I zzso in zzso zzso strongly increased the zzso of zzso D and zzso zzso zzso 9 and significantly zzso zzso The gene coding for zzso D was suggested as the zzso gene and downstream zzso of the zzso function of zzso Finally, we demonstrated that zzso delayed the growth of zzso tumors in zzso mice and affected the zzso potential of breast cancer cells in an zzso zzso 

This study identified zzso as a zzso regulator of invasive behavior of breast cancer zzso
