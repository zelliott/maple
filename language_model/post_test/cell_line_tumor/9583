zzso abnormalities represent a major zzso in zzso disease zzso a fatal neurodegenerative disease caused by zzso repeat expansions in the gene zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated whether defects in the zzso respiratory function are consequences of the expression of zzso zzso or they promote the formation of zzso zzso To take advantage of existing zzso DNA zzso we developed human zzso zzso cells expressing zzso zzso in an zzso manner and found that cells expressing zzso zzso but not zzso zzso exhibited a reduced activity of complex III and an increased activity of complex zzso zzso pharmacological treatments that inhibited complex III activity significantly promoted the formation of zzso zzso This complex zzso zzso of zzso zzso was also observed in a zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso by zzso carrying zzso zzso This effect of complex III zzso on the zzso zzso appeared to be zzso by the zzso of zzso activity, but not by zzso depletion or production of zzso oxygen zzso zzso complex III zzso cells also showed decreased zzso zzso These results suggest the presence of a feedback system connecting the zzso respiratory complex III and the production of zzso zzso Our results suggest that therapeutic interventions targeting complex III and/or zzso could zzso the progress of zzso
