zzso the amount of zzso zzso by administering zzso vitamins offers a possible way to influence zzso side effects in normal zzso zzso we investigated the effect of zzso vitamin C and zzso on zzso zzso in cells in zzso Human zzso zzso cells were zzso with a dose of 3 zzso 1 h after or immediately prior to the addition of vitamins in three zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and 100 zzso Eight hours later, zzso was scored zzso by zzso the nuclear DNA with zzso zzso When given prior to zzso zzso and vitamin E reduced the amount of zzso zzso significantly at zzso of zzso zzso and 1 zzso In contrast, vitamin C did not show any protective effect when given at these two zzso and caused a slight but significant zzso at 100 zzso At zzso zzso all combinations of two vitamins showed a protective zzso This was also observed for the combination of all three vitamins at zzso of zzso and 1 zzso When given immediately after zzso each of the three vitamins showed a protective effect at zzso zzso In addition, the combination of zzso and vitamin C reduced zzso zzso slightly when given at 1 zzso In all other cases, no statistically significant zzso of zzso zzso was zzso In our experimental system, the protective effect of zzso and vitamin E was dependent on concentration and occurred only in the zzso and zzso concentration range, while vitamin C alone, but not in combinations, had a zzso effect, thus arguing for a careful consideration of vitamin zzso in clinical zzso
