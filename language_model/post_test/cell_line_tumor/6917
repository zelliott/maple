In the present study, we investigated whether an unidentified system for zzso zzso transport is expressed by mouse zzso zzso zzso cells, besides zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso and is involved in the zzso and zzso of zzso In a transport zzso involving zzso zzso was found to transport zzso in a zzso manner, and 500 zzso zzso completely inhibited the zzso zzso of zzso via the zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso by zzso cells decreased with 500 zzso zzso only to zzso of the control zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso into zzso cells resulted in a reduction in the zzso zzso of zzso by only zzso although the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso disappeared in the zzso The zzso of zzso zzso an zzso by zzso cells requiring zzso zzso was significantly inhibited by 500 zzso zzso but not 500 zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and the that of zzso by zzso cells significantly increased on zzso with both zzso and zzso and the enhancement of zzso zzso by the zzso acids was reversed by zzso with 500 zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso and zzso which were previously reported to be taken up via the same zzso toward zzso cells was enhanced by zzso with both the zzso zzso zzso it was indicated that an unidentified zzso transport system for zzso is expressed by zzso cells, and contributes to the zzso and zzso of the zzso
