We measured, by zzso zzso protein expression in 212 breast tissue zzso 6 normal samples, 28 zzso zzso (13 with cellular zzso 11 zzso 10 in zzso zzso zzso 144 zzso zzso and 13 zzso zzso zzso was not expressed in normal breast zzso zzso zzso was intense in zzso of zzso zzso with cellular zzso and in zzso of zzso zzso and weak in zzso and in zzso zzso without cellular zzso Because zzso expression was similar among zzso breast zzso with different zzso zzso we evaluated the association between zzso expression and that of other markers of breast zzso invasion zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in 21 cases of grade 3 breast zzso zzso and 7 cases of breast zzso zzso We found that zzso expression tended to be associated only with zzso expression zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso expression might be a novel indicator for the diagnosis and prognosis of human breast zzso
