The DNA damage response zzso zzso and zzso function as barriers to cancer zzso Although commonly regarded as operating independently of each other, some studies proposed that zzso is positively regulated by the zzso zzso to either scenario, we found that in human zzso and cancer cells, zzso suppressed zzso protein levels and activity in a zzso zzso zzso zzso activated protein zzso 1, which antagonized zzso zzso of zzso zzso thereby liberating zzso from zzso and rendering it susceptible to degradation by the zzso zzso zzso In human clinical samples, loss of zzso expression correlated with increased zzso levels and in zzso and tissue culture models, zzso of zzso zzso the zzso effects of zzso These results provide insights into the functional interplay between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso with implications for zzso and treatment of advanced zzso
