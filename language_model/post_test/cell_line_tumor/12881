zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that contributes to the zzso zzso of tumor zzso zzso Emerging evidence suggests that zzso is required to maintain the zzso zzso but the role of zzso function in zzso tumor zzso has not been zzso Here, we show that zzso is expressed in aggressive lung cancer cells, and its elevated expression zzso with poor zzso zzso zzso of zzso in highly invasive lung cancer cells inhibited cell migration and invasion in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso invasive lung cancer cells increased zzso and zzso zzso investigations suggested that repression of the cell zzso zzso zzso zzso the effects of zzso First, zzso zzso of zzso partially relieved zzso suppression imposed by zzso zzso Second, an inverse correlation between zzso and zzso expression existed in primary lung zzso Third, zzso repression was associated with promoter zzso and an enrichment for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced the levels of zzso zzso and decreased the recruitment of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso Our findings establish a functional contribution of zzso zzso with zzso zzso of zzso pathways in lung cancer zzso
