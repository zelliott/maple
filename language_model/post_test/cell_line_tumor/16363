zzso management of cancer surgery may influence zzso zzso The zzso of gene expression by zzso of zzso acid zzso zzso is increasingly recognized as a major hallmark of zzso Next to direct effects of local zzso upon zzso cells, the zzso local zzso zzso has been shown to affect zzso status in several zzso cell lines, promoting the zzso of zzso zzso zzso We sought to determine whether the zzso zzso local zzso zzso influences the survival and zzso status of zzso zzso zzso and zzso breast cancer cell lines in zzso 

Breast cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso zzso were incubated with zzso and zzso as the reference zzso We performed cell count and determined zzso using zzso zzso Further, we assessed global zzso status, and zzso of three known zzso zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso using the zzso zzso and real-time quantitative zzso chain reaction, zzso 

zzso zzso was zzso higher in zzso zzso Here, we observed a zzso decrease in DNA zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso after 72 h ( zzso zzso and zzso zzso The corresponding changes were smaller in zzso zzso Global zzso status was profoundly zzso but the zzso and zzso expression status of three zzso zzso genes was zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso zzso effects of zzso interventions may only be zzso in specific types of cancer due to differential zzso zzso In conclusion, at clinically relevant zzso zzso zzso DNA of breast cancer cell lines in zzso
