The zzso zzso zzso function in processes of zzso zzso including zzso transcription, repair, and zzso zzso zzso interacts specifically with the zzso assembly factor zzso a zzso zzso zzso and with zzso a protein involved in DNA repair, and these interactions are believed to be responsible for the action of zzso in zzso break repair and zzso 

Western zzso and zzso were used to analyze the expression of zzso zzso and zzso in a panel of prostate cancer zzso cell zzso The pattern of zzso in the cell lines was analyzed in zzso zzso and zzso cells were also zzso with zzso utilizing zzso plasmids that could be zzso in zzso with zzso HO zzso to assess the potential contribution of zzso in zzso zzso 

This is the first report of zzso expression in a panel of zzso cell lines and their relationship to zzso Furthermore, expression of zzso in zzso zzso cells rendered them highly resistant to radiation, and conversely, zzso to zzso in expressing zzso reduced their zzso 

zzso appear to be intimately linked to the pattern of resistance to DNA damage, and specifically zzso a finding that was not reported before for any cell lines, and certainly not systematically for human prostate cell zzso
