zzso resistance zzso presents a serious problem in cancer zzso Our previous studies have shown that zzso could reverse zzso through zzso the function and expression of zzso zzso The present study is to further investigate the reversal effects of zzso on zzso in drug-resistant cancer cell zzso The effects of zzso on zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso expression were assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using the zzso fluorescent probe zzso zzso zzso system, and flow zzso technology, zzso The results showed that zzso ranging from zzso to 80 zzso significantly promoted the activity of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso pH of zzso cells was found to be higher than zzso zzso After treatment with zzso zzso 3, 10, 30, 100 zzso zzso pH of zzso cells decreased in a zzso and zzso zzso However, the present study revealed that zzso ranging from 3 to 100 zzso had little influence on zzso gene expression in zzso zzso Further, the zzso zzso zzso cells exhibited a zzso increase in zzso level as compared with parental zzso human breast cancer zzso After treatment with zzso zzso 1, 10 zzso for 48 zzso zzso cells were found to have no change of zzso protein expression zzso zzso might be a potent zzso reversal agent, and its mechanism on zzso needs more zzso
