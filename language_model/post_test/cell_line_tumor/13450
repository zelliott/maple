zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso has been implicated in zzso as both a tumor zzso and zzso Here, we characterized promoter activity of zzso generated an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and evaluated its zzso activity in zzso and in zzso zzso activity of zzso was greatly restricted to tumor cells, and the zzso promoter bound with typical nuclear targets of zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso expression and further activated zzso expression of zzso which was restored by zzso signal zzso in a zzso manner in zzso lung zzso zzso In two zzso tumor zzso animal models, zzso exhibited potent zzso activity, whereas zzso an zzso zzso drug, was active zzso or zzso Combined treatment with zzso or zzso plus zzso resulted in enhanced zzso zzso zzso analysis of tumor sections showed zzso grade signals for zzso and zzso and a reduction in viable cells in zzso zzso zzso these results demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso is a potent inhibitor of zzso and further suggest that zzso is a target gene of zzso signaling zzso in zzso
