zzso zzso zzso a natural plant zzso has gained interest as a zzso zzso agent capable of inducing tumor cell death in a variety of cancer zzso Several studies were undertaken to obtain synthetic zzso of zzso with potent zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of zzso as a new zzso analog on zzso via the zzso zzso in zzso breast cancer zzso A pharmacological dose zzso zzso of zzso exerted a zzso effect on zzso breast cancer cells resulting in zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells by several zzso events including zzso zzso c release, zzso of zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso induced collapse of zzso and enhanced zzso and zzso G release from zzso while undergoing zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso by zzso in zzso cells can mainly be attributed to zzso via a zzso zzso by zzso zzso or contributions of zzso and zzso zzso
