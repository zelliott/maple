zzso are large zzso zzso molecules implicated in various zzso including zzso wound healing, skin blistering and zzso zzso zzso data for the zzso zzso zzso and genetic analyses of the zzso zzso Short stop zzso suggest an important role during zzso Using three parallel zzso culture systems we demonstrate that, like zzso zzso is essential for zzso extension and describe, for the first time, their zzso functions during zzso zzso zzso both zzso and Shot regulate the zzso of zzso zzso a role dependent on both the zzso and zzso zzso This role in zzso zzso is probably the key mechanism underlying the roles of Shot and zzso in growth cone zzso zzso we found a novel role for zzso and Shot in regulating the zzso zzso through their ability to control the formation of zzso This function in zzso regulation requires zzso motifs and interaction with the zzso regulator zzso indicating that the underlying mechanisms are completely different from those used to control zzso Our data provide the basis for the first zzso explanation for the role of Shot and zzso in the developing nervous system and demonstrate their ability to coordinate the zzso of both zzso and zzso networks during zzso zzso
