zzso of zzso zzso is accompanied by increased zzso of the PET zzso zzso The molecular mechanisms responsible for this phenomenon are poorly zzso zzso we studied the regulation of zzso zzso by the human zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso and the zzso zzso expression of that cell zzso The data obtained in zzso were compared with those of a zzso zzso cell line of rat origin zzso 

The expression of the zzso hormone zzso zzso was investigated by zzso and the expression of the zzso zzso zzso was determined by Western zzso zzso analysis of zzso was performed for zzso zzso 12 and zzso The effect of zzso on zzso zzso levels was determined by a competitive zzso zzso zzso were incubated with zzso zzso zzso for 1 zzso and zzso zzso was related to protein zzso The effects of bovine zzso the zzso analog zzso and the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso on zzso zzso were zzso 

The zzso zzso was present in both cell zzso zzso clearly expressed zzso and also zzso In zzso only, the expression of zzso was zzso zzso and zzso had a significant effect on zzso zzso or zzso expression in zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 6) and in zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 42, both P zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso cells revealed a zzso point zzso at zzso 12 of the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso in the zzso zzso cell line zzso is no longer regulated by zzso or zzso or zzso by zzso However, in this cell line, this variable is still governed to some extent by zzso located downstream to the zzso active zzso in the zzso zzso These data suggest that increases in zzso zzso in zzso zzso observed in zzso by PET may reflect zzso of zzso signal zzso zzso by zzso
