The zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso is a member of a zzso zzso of nuclear proteins whose functions are largely zzso In our previous work, zzso was identified as a novel direct zzso for zzso and acted as a negative regulator for zzso cell zzso In this work, we provided the first demonstration that zzso expression was zzso during differentiation induction of zzso cells by zzso zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso expression by specific zzso enhanced zzso zzso cell zzso while zzso expression of zzso attenuated it, indicating an zzso role of zzso against zzso cell zzso Furthermore, zzso reporter zzso revealed that zzso might exert this role through zzso the zzso dependent zzso activity of zzso acid zzso zzso These data will shed new insights into understanding the biological functions of zzso zzso
