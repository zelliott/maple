zzso function of bone zzso derived zzso stem cells in cancer has recently been zzso But the resident zzso stem cells as whole in cancer and in the breast cancer tissue have not been studied zzso In the present work we isolated zzso derived stem cells zzso from breast cancer and normal breast zzso to investigate the expressions of zzso zzso and transforming growth factor zzso in zzso and to see if zzso isolated from patients can zzso the regulatory molecules on peripheral blood zzso Our results showed that zzso and zzso have significantly higher zzso expressions in zzso isolated from breast cancer patients than those from normal individuals zzso value zzso The culture zzso of zzso isolated from breast cancer patients with pathological stage III induced zzso of the zzso expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso In addition, the percentage of zzso T regulatory cells was increased in zzso When the same culture zzso was added to zzso isolated from normal subjects zzso of the zzso expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in normal zzso was also zzso These data collectively conclude that resident zzso in breast cancer tissue may have crucial roles in breast tumor growth and progression by inducing regulatory molecules and promoting zzso reaction within the tumor zzso Further investigation is required to see if the immune suppression induced by zzso is an independent property from tumor cells or zzso gain their zzso potential from zzso zzso
