zzso has been described as a zzso relevant tumor zzso We noted an interaction between zzso and the tight junction protein zzso and here explored the nature of this interaction and its effect on zzso zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso was defined in zzso cells zzso with rat zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso growth zzso and the zzso repeat zzso of zzso or the zzso domain of zzso or zzso did not prevent the zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso with an exchange of the zzso and zzso zzso and an zzso zzso with point zzso in an zzso motif in the zzso region do not associate with zzso zzso cells and the rat pancreatic tumor line zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed that the association of both molecules severely alters the functional activity of zzso zzso zzso is recruited into zzso membrane zzso zzso The zzso zzso complex supports proliferation accompanied by sustained zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and drug resistance, but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may be supported by zzso of zzso with zzso zzso which is only seen in zzso zzso The zzso complex strongly promotes zzso zzso tumor growth, and supports zzso production and zzso zzso zzso High expression of the tumor marker zzso is frequently associated with poor zzso which could well rely on the zzso association that prohibits zzso zzso zzso but promotes migration, zzso zzso resistance, and zzso
