This study aims to identify new zzso agents from zzso zzso using an zzso zzso It also aims to explore their zzso zzso mechanisms, and to evaluate their zzso effects in zzso 

zzso from zzso zzso were tested on zzso cells, and active extracts were separated to obtain zzso zzso their structures were zzso by mass and nuclear magnetic resonance zzso Cell cycle analysis was evaluated using flow zzso zzso formation zzso were performed using zzso zzso 

Based on ecological considerations, the selected extracts were subjected to initial zzso zzso zzso zzso of the active extract afforded two new zzso named zzso A zzso and B zzso zzso 1 and B zzso inhibited growth of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Further study demonstrated that both preparations arrested the cell cycle at zzso phase in a zzso manner, and induced zzso through zzso of expression of zzso zzso and zzso B, and zzso of zzso -9 and zzso These data imply that zzso A zzso and B zzso induce zzso cell zzso through both zzso and intrinsic zzso In addition, in zzso studies showed that they displayed significant zzso effects on cell population growth of melanoma zzso cells implanted into zzso zzso 

zzso A zzso and B zzso are effective zzso agents in zzso and in zzso and should be further evaluated for their potential in clinical zzso
