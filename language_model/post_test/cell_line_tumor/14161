Human zzso zzso zzso system is associated with cancer cell growth and zzso zzso zzso of 1, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso were investigated on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso After treated with zzso a good linear correlation zzso zzso between zzso activity and cell viability exists in each cell line together with cell zzso zzso and zzso through zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that there exists some relationship between zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso in the investigated cell zzso
