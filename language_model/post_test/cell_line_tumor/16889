Several established optical imaging approaches have been applied, usually in isolation, to zzso zzso however, truly useful in zzso imaging may require a simultaneous combination of imaging zzso to examine dynamic characteristics of cells and zzso We developed a new zzso optical imaging system designed to be zzso yielding high sensitivity, and specificity molecular zzso 

We integrated several optical imaging technologies, including zzso intensity, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso into a single system that enables functional zzso imaging in animal zzso 

The approach offers a comprehensive imaging platform for zzso zzso and environmental analysis of highly relevant information, with zzso zzso zzso to small animals in zzso this provides superior monitoring of processes of interest, represented here by zzso therapy zzso 

This new system is versatile and can be zzso for various applications, of which cancer detection and targeted treatment are emphasized zzso
