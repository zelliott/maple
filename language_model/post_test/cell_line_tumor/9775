As the majority of zzso arise through zzso transformation of zzso we aimed at investigating the interaction between zzso zzso cells and zzso in a zzso experimental zzso For this purpose we analyzed the expression of genes and proteins involved in tumor promotion and invasion, such as zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso transforming growth zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and rich in zzso zzso and zzso 43 zzso zzso of human neural stem zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells were performed in a zzso zzso Gene expression was evaluated by real-time zzso and protein analysis was performed by Western zzso zzso and zzso zzso tended to be zzso in zzso zzso with zzso suggesting a zzso response induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso tended to be zzso regulated in zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso at the protein zzso zzso zzso tended to be zzso and zzso protein levels were significantly increased in zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso decreased in zzso zzso with zzso showing lower expression in zzso zzso By contrast, zzso protein expression was strongly induced in zzso of zzso zzso zzso was not zzso Our results suggest that zzso cells elicit zzso modifications in the zzso resident zzso very likely zzso by soluble zzso zzso interaction could possibly trigger an zzso zzso modification consistent with a zzso zzso and zzso a more zzso environment for zzso cells zzso
