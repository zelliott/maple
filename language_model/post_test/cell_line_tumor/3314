zzso zzso is one of the most useful zzso agents for patients with advanced zzso zzso A series of zzso zzso with bulky zzso at the zzso at zzso have been designed to impair interactions between the drug and zzso zzso a zzso drug resistance zzso zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso were selected and their biological properties were compared with zzso and the zzso zzso zzso These novel zzso zzso may have zzso activity beyond zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were used to determine the potency of three structurally altered zzso zzso against a panel of zzso cell lines with and without amplification of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to analyze zzso and cell death and zzso cell lines for surface expression of the zzso protein zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were 2 to 36 times more zzso than zzso for the zzso cell lines zzso The zzso zzso despite its significantly greater affinity for DNA zzso was generally less potent against zzso than zzso In zzso cells, which zzso express zzso greatly enhanced (nearly zzso sensitivity to zzso killing was seen when this zzso was zzso while enhanced sensitivity to zzso was more modest zzso under zzso zzso Treatment with zzso also resulted in enhanced zzso zzso but not cell death, in response to either zzso or zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso suggesting that cell death was not completely dependent upon zzso zzso expression was zzso on five zzso cell zzso zzso was more zzso than zzso against both zzso and zzso zzso 

These findings demonstrate that zzso of the zzso zzso significantly enhances potency against zzso independent of zzso status, zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso demonstrated a unique zzso with zzso for cell killing when this zzso was specifically zzso zzso may be more useful than conventional agents for the treatment of tumor clones that harbor defects in zzso zzso in those with zzso amplification, and in those with drug-resistant zzso
