The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in a wide range of human neurodegenerative zzso zzso molecules that regulate the zzso stress response represent potential candidates as drug targets to tackle these zzso In previous studies we demonstrated that upon zzso the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso family leads to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, by zzso analysis of the whole human zzso we found that zzso is able to specifically regulate gene zzso modulating transcript clusters which have been implicated in the onset of neurodegenerative zzso Interestingly, we show that some of the identified genes were also modulated in zzso in a zzso mouse model zzso zzso These data provide a basis for further investigation of zzso as a potential molecular target for use in therapy and as a specific marker for neurological zzso
