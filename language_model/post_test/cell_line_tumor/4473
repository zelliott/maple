Aurora zzso A zzso zzso is associated with poor prognosis in zzso and has been described to zzso zzso in gastric cancer zzso However, the exact role of zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso remains zzso We zzso that zzso stabilization of zzso may affect zzso expression and zzso in zzso zzso we sought to determine whether zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Cell viability and zzso growth were determined after zzso zzso or after treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to determine zzso zzso Human zzso vein zzso cells zzso were used to assess zzso in zzso Real zzso and zzso were performed to determine zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso significantly reduced cell proliferation and inhibited zzso zzso It also decreased zzso protein levels and nuclear zzso zzso zzso also decreased zzso zzso formation along with zzso zzso and zzso Similarly, zzso treatment decreased zzso zzso in zzso 

Our findings demonstrate that zzso plays a critical role in zzso zzso zzso regulates nuclear zzso of zzso in zzso cells, thus potentially affecting cell zzso zzso cell growth, and zzso zzso zzso might provide a novel therapeutic strategy in treating aggressive zzso
