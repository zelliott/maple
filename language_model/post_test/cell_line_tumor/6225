In the zzso cancer cell line, zzso we previously demonstrated that zzso zzso regions were located in zzso or zzso regions, and zzso these might regulate zzso zzso Three zzso and three small zzso zzso were zzso zzso one, zzso was associated with the progression and prognosis of gastric and zzso zzso In this report we document, by zzso profiling of zzso zzso that zzso is transcribed as zzso of zzso 3 zzso zzso and zzso of this region is correlated with zzso repression and tumor zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cancer cells led to suppression of cell growth, cancer migration, invasion and zzso The zzso one of two mature zzso species derived from zzso is associated with tumor zzso We further identified the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso an zzso protein expressed in aggressive tumors, as a target of zzso We demonstrated zzso is zzso in zzso zzso zzso and cellular depletion of zzso resulted in suppression of cancer zzso The inverse relationship between zzso and zzso expression suggests zzso is a downstream zzso zzso the action of zzso This report identifies DNA zzso zzso zzso and zzso as critical factors in tumor zzso
