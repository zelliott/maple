zzso zzso candidate region zzso zzso is a recently identified zzso protein participating in the regulation of cell cycle progression and zzso zzso of zzso in several types of zzso and increased transforming activity in zzso cancer cells indicated its tumor zzso zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate zzso expression in breast cancer and to investigate the question of whether reduced expression of zzso may have any pathological significance in breast cancer development or zzso In this study, we performed quantitative zzso and zzso to evaluate the expression of zzso and relevance with zzso factors in the invasive zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was reduced in zzso of zzso zzso by a zzso scoring system using tissue zzso zzso zzso was significantly reduced by zzso fold in 15 out of 17 zzso cases of zzso Reduction of zzso was significantly correlated with increased zzso grade ( zzso increased tumor size ( zzso zzso zzso zzso involvement ( zzso and decreased disease free survival ( zzso In addition, we show that zzso of zzso decreases the invasive potential of breast cancer zzso Taken together, our data suggest that zzso may play a role in the zzso progression and biological behavior in breast zzso
