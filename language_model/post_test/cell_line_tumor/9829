To investigate the impact of zzso zzso of major zzso complex class I expression on zzso zzso zzso and zzso trafficking into zzso tumors in zzso 

Restoration of major zzso complex class I expression by zzso treatment enhances killing of zzso zzso To understand the potential of this approach in zzso we developed a novel model of zzso in which zzso zzso zzso mice are zzso with both human T cells and tumor zzso 

Here, we show enhanced killing of zzso cells by zzso zzso T cells in zzso In addition, zzso treatment in zzso zzso efficient zzso of major zzso complex class I expression on zzso tumor cells, and this is accompanied by significantly enhanced zzso of T cells into the zzso In a pilot clinical trial in patients with high-risk zzso we similarly observed zzso zzso trafficking into zzso nests in tumor biopsy specimens obtained from patients after 5 days of systemic zzso zzso 

zzso overcomes critical obstacles to the killing of human zzso cells by specific T zzso Together, these findings provide a rationale for the further testing of zzso as an approach for improving the efficacy of T zzso therapies for zzso and other major zzso complex class zzso zzso In addition, we describe a model that may zzso the zzso screening of approaches aimed at zzso zzso trafficking into human zzso
