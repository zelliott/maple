zzso zzso zzso is a new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study we investigated the cellular growth zzso zzso zzso cell cycle phase zzso and zzso synthesis of zzso compared with those of zzso zzso known to possess both zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity zzso of zzso zzso The zzso values of zzso and zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso and from zzso to zzso zzso respectively, in a panel of 10 human tumor cells, indicating that zzso possesses greater zzso than zzso Using excess zzso cells, zzso and zzso appeared to exert their zzso effects independently of the cell zzso The zzso metabolism and the effect on zzso processing of zzso differed from those of zzso More than 50% of zzso incorporated into the cells was in the unchanged form, while zzso incorporated into zzso was approximately zzso On the other hand, zzso was incorporated in a zzso manner into the cells and rapidly converted to its zzso zzso and zzso form, however, the amount incorporated into zzso fraction was very zzso zzso incorporated into zzso was confirmed to impair the normal processing of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso however, zzso did not affect zzso processing and may be involved in the zzso of the synthesis of zzso zzso We concluded that zzso zzso and retention of the active zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso may contribute to its potent zzso The unique mechanism of zzso activity and intensive cellular metabolism of zzso could contribute to cancer chemotherapy through the pathways different from those of zzso or other zzso zzso
