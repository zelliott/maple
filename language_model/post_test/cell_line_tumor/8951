To determine the zzso mechanisms underlying relative biological effectiveness zzso and the repair efficiencies of DNA zzso breaks zzso as a function of linear energy transfer zzso we exposed cells of the chicken zzso cell line zzso and its zzso repair zzso derivatives to zzso beams produced at the zzso Medical Accelerator in zzso zzso at the National Institute of zzso Sciences zzso zzso zzso The relationship between LET and cell zzso was investigated in the DNA zzso repair gene zzso zzso zzso and zzso and in the zzso zzso We found that zzso stage and activity of the DNA zzso repair pathways influence zzso biological zzso An expected zzso relationship was observed in the cells capable of DNA repair, but no peak was found in the zzso with respect to cell survival in the zzso cells or in zzso cells in the zzso and early S zzso zzso (when no sister zzso were present and zzso zzso could not zzso These findings suggest that the peak in zzso is caused by deficient repair of the DNA zzso
