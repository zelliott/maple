zzso zzso limits zzso and therapeutic activity of zzso zzso Here we show that an zzso zzso can be engineered by structural zzso with a zzso analogue and that the zzso zzso may act as an zzso This strategy has successfully been applied to the zzso human zzso zzso Including only five zzso from the zzso salmon zzso zzso we obtained a zzso polar human zzso zzso whose solution structure was shown by CD, zzso and calculations to be practically identical to that of zzso zzso was also observed to be a potent zzso inhibitor of zzso when mixed with it in a zzso zzso zzso studies of zzso and the zzso mixture zzso the zzso behavior in the zzso and shapes of the zzso with a dramatic reduction with respect to zzso Finally, the effect of zzso alone and of the mixture on the zzso zzso level in zzso cells confirmed for the zzso and the mixture their zzso activity, exhibiting stimulation effects identical to those of zzso the current therapeutic zzso The strategy followed appears to be suitable to develop new forms of zzso with a striking reduction of zzso and improved zzso Finally, the zzso properties of the zzso zzso if confirmed for other zzso zzso may favor a new strategy for controlling zzso formation in a variety of human zzso
