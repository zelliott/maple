To study the effect of zzso zzso zzso and zzso on tumor necrosis factors related zzso inducing zzso zzso induced zzso of gastric cancer zzso 

zzso cancer cells of zzso zzso zzso and zzso lines were cultured in zzso medium and the zzso rates of the cells of 4 lines were observed after treatment of tumor necrosis factors related zzso inducing zzso zzso with a flow zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in gastric cancer cells of 4 lines was analyzed with Western zzso 

After the gastric cancer cells were exposed to TRAIL 300 zzso for 24 hours, the zzso rate was zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Western zzso revealed that the expressions of zzso and zzso were lower in zzso cells than in zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, the expression of zzso was higher in zzso cells than in zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

There is a selectivity of TRAIL potency to induce zzso in gastric cancer cells of different cell zzso The zzso potency of TRAIL is associated with the decreased expression of zzso and zzso and increased expression of zzso of gastric cancer zzso
