Many zzso zzso compounds are used in zzso and medical zzso Their biological effects are due in large part to their zzso properties, zzso they undergo reaction with zzso sites in proteins and zzso zzso Here, we describe a zzso comparison of the zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso and closely related chemical zzso All molecules that contained an zzso zzso group were zzso to human zzso zzso cells, causing zzso cell zzso However, related molecules lacking this chemical zzso were not zzso One of the molecules screened, zzso zzso zzso was considerably more zzso than zzso and other zzso zzso of cell death by zzso was significantly decreased following zzso of cells with zzso suggesting that its zzso with zzso in cells might account for its zzso By use of a model zzso compound, it was found that zzso can undergo addition reactions with two zzso of zzso When the zzso of zzso with proteins was zzso it was determined that zzso zzso zzso of zzso a zzso zzso zzso with highly zzso zzso zzso in its active zzso Our results suggest that zzso functions as a zzso zzso providing a potential chemical explanation for its zzso zzso
