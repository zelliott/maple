zzso zzso acid zzso is an active zzso of Vitamin A, it shows protective effects on zzso including maintains airway zzso integrity, zzso asthma zzso cells zzso zzso immune response, et zzso However, the promoting effect of zzso on zzso response has restricted the clinical application of zzso in asthma zzso zzso is a candidate gene of childhood onset zzso and zzso of zzso is associated with the development of zzso Here we show that zzso increases zzso production in zzso via inducing zzso zzso zzso which in turn binds to the zzso element in promoter region of zzso and zzso zzso zzso This finding is in consistent with the previous reports that zzso could regulate target genes without the presence of zzso acid response element zzso in promoter region but through other signals such as zzso Nevertheless, in the present study, the traditional signal zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso signal zzso pathway, indirectly modulated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso production even though there was no zzso in zzso promoter, zzso or zzso zzso Besides, the signal of zzso might differ from that of zzso since zzso failed to induce zzso zzso In conclusion, our data indicate that zzso zzso zzso production probable through zzso and this may be a starting point for more detailed mechanism researches on zzso and zzso
