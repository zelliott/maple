Monitoring zzso cluster zzso zzso zzso levels in patients treated for chronic zzso leukemia zzso has become an integral part of patient zzso zzso reverse zzso chain reaction is the method of choice for this purpose because of its high zzso sensitivity and zzso Given the variation of zzso quality and quantity in clinical zzso accurate quantitative assessment of zzso depends on zzso of the zzso signal to an appropriate internal zzso However, the controls used by different laboratories vary, and there is no clear consensus on an ideal reference due to limited zzso In this study, we compared nine commonly used control genes for three criteria: zzso zzso levels in zzso and zzso cells, and their degradation zzso in comparison with zzso We found that zzso zzso is the most suitable among the nine genes zzso Although zzso is most widely used, our data suggest that the amount of zzso is different in zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso levels are regulated by cellular zzso These findings have a direct impact on current clinical laboratory practice and patient care because the use of a proper control gene affects the reported levels of zzso transcripts used for patient management zzso
