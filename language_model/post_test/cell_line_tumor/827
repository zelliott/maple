The development of resistance in zzso breast cancer patients and the zzso side effects of tamoxifen have lead to the design of many new zzso The new zzso zzso and its active zzso zzso zzso zzso growth of breast cancer cells and has less zzso effects than tamoxifen on gene zzso A cell line with acquired resistance to zzso zzso was established from zzso zzso zzso cells responded to treatment with tamoxifen and the pure zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso alpha zzso level in zzso cells was lower than in zzso cells due to a zzso of the zzso by zzso A significant reduction in the zzso and protein level of some zzso genes was observed in zzso compared to zzso However, both the level of the zzso and several zzso gene products increased towards parental zzso level upon withdrawal from zzso zzso with an increase in the sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso zzso These data show that zzso resistant cells remain sensitive to treatment with both tamoxifen and to zzso zzso Furthermore, the partial zzso to zzso sensitivity upon withdrawal of the zzso suggests that patients may benefit from a zzso with zzso
