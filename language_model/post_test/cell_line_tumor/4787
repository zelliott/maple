Human zzso leukemia zzso cells were induced to undergo zzso differentiation by long-term treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso The protein level of zzso zzso a zzso zzso was substantially decreased upon zzso zzso In this study, we found that the zzso zzso blocked the decrease of zzso protein in response to zzso suggesting the zzso were involved in the zzso of zzso upon zzso zzso To investigate the signaling zzso in the zzso of zzso during early zzso zzso differentiation of zzso cells, zzso cells were treated with zzso in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso The decrease of zzso protein in the zzso zzso cells was blocked by zzso but not by zzso zzso suggesting the involvement of novel zzso in the zzso of zzso during zzso zzso differentiation of zzso zzso The application of zzso inhibitor zzso upon zzso treatment blocked the zzso decrease of zzso protein and aborted the zzso differentiation but not to break through the cell growth zzso Unlike zzso the degradation of zzso in the zzso zzso cells could not be blocked by zzso while the zzso zzso differentiation was zzso The decrease of zzso protein seems to be more correlated with the novel zzso zzso differentiation than another zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicated that novel zzso zzso was required for the decrease of zzso during zzso zzso zzso
