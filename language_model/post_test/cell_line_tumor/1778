zzso an zzso zzso acts as a key regulator forming zzso feedback loop in transforming growth zzso zzso zzso However, a growing body of zzso suggests that zzso is capable of zzso zzso In the present study, we have demonstrated a zzso function of zzso as a negative regulator of survival protein zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein level was elevated in zzso zzso human lung cancer cells and blockade of zzso zzso zzso the cells to zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso decreased zzso gene expression and its zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso activity and infection with zzso expressing a zzso active form of the zzso reversed the zzso effects of zzso to zzso indicating a negative action mechanism of zzso to zzso survival zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso and these effects were dependent on zzso and zzso zzso Based on these findings, we suggest that targeting zzso may be an efficient strategy for overcoming zzso in cancer zzso
