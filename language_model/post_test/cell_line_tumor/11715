Recent studies have shown the zzso of zzso in the cell nucleus, in addition to its cellular distribution in the zzso and cell zzso Our previous results that a high amount of zzso was detected in gastric cancer cell nucleus and application of zzso drug zzso could reduce zzso nuclear zzso suggest a relationship between nuclear zzso of zzso and tumor zzso However, the mechanism and biological function of zzso nuclear zzso remain zzso The aim of the present study was to explore the zzso zzso for zzso protein entering the nucleus in the human gastric cancer cell line zzso Using zzso zzso we observed not only a partial zzso of zzso with zzso zzso mainly surrounding and on the nuclear zzso but also an intensive zzso of zzso with zzso zzso in both zzso and nucleus, particularly in the cell zzso A strong association between zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso was revealed by zzso and western zzso Moreover, zzso cells treated with the nuclear export zzso zzso B zzso showed an increase of zzso protein amount in the nucleus, indicating an active transport process for nuclear export of zzso Taken together, our results suggest that nuclear zzso of zzso in zzso cells is via active transportation, a process through zzso zzso in a zzso zzso
