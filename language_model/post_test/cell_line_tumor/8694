zzso is an zzso that can suppress the proliferation of various human zzso zzso Although its zzso activities have been suggested by many clinical investigations and animal studies, the underlying mechanisms are not fully zzso In zzso middle T zzso zzso transgenic mice models, zzso or complete zzso expression promotes zzso tumor zzso The present study demonstrated that while tumor development in control zzso mice is associated with a progressively decreased circulating cholesterol zzso zzso deficient zzso mice showed significantly elevated zzso and low density zzso zzso zzso zzso contents in tumors derived from zzso deficient mice were dramatically zzso High fat high cholesterol diet further accelerated the tumor development in zzso deficient zzso zzso The protein levels of LDL zzso zzso were found to be zzso in zzso tumor zzso In human breast zzso cells, treatment with zzso or zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso activity and zzso tumor cell zzso On the other hand, zzso decreased zzso protein expression in breast cancer cells and inhibited zzso tumor cell zzso Both in zzso and in zzso evidence demonstrated a zzso effect of zzso on zzso process, which zzso the zzso of zzso zzso reduction of zzso was blocked by treatment with a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso In conclusion, the study demonstrates that zzso elicits tumor zzso effects by modulating cholesterol zzso and zzso expression in breast cancer cells, which is at least in part attributed to its role in promoting zzso zzso
