The discovery of methods suitable for the conversion in zzso of native proteins into zzso zzso has shed light on the molecular basis of zzso and has provided fundamental tools for drug zzso We have studied the capacity of a small library of zzso zzso to zzso the formation or zzso of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso of the wild type protein was first established in the presence of zzso zzso and confirmed under a more zzso environment including zzso and zzso The latter conditions were also used to study the highly zzso zzso zzso The zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso species through fast exchange interactions involving specific regions of the zzso Cell viability zzso demonstrated that the drug zzso the natural zzso activity of soluble zzso further strengthening a possible in zzso therapeutic exploitation of this zzso zzso can zzso zzso zzso but the zzso is zzso higher than that necessary for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso is a dynamic and zzso process characterized by the early formation of zzso protein zzso that, in a few hours, convert into zzso zzso zzso The efficacy of zzso as a drug against zzso zzso would benefit from the ability of the drug to accumulate just in the skeletal system where zzso is zzso In these zzso the zzso concentration reaches values several folds higher than those resulting in zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso
