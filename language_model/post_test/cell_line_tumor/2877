zzso scaffolds which can support cells to grow as well as deliver growth factors to the cells simultaneously have great potential for the successful zzso of failed zzso As popularly used vehicles to deliver zzso drugs and growth factors, zzso also show many advantages as zzso to guide the growth of zzso zzso we aimed to examine the feasibility of using zzso as ideal scaffolds for liver tissue zzso To determine the capabilities of previously used zzso scaffold to deliver growth factors zzso this work investigated a long-term (about three zzso release of bovine serum zzso zzso from zzso scaffolds zzso by using two different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and a blend of zzso and zzso zzso served as a model for zzso growth factor zzso since both proteins have similar molecular weights and zzso Furthermore, zzso was zzso into the zzso composite zzso with a zzso structure, and sustained delivery of zzso with maintained zzso was achieved for at least 40 zzso The moderate degradation rate (about zzso loss of the initial zzso and zzso structure after three months of incubation indicated that the zzso composite zzso would therefore be more suitable than the pure zzso or zzso zzso as a scaffold for engineering liver zzso
