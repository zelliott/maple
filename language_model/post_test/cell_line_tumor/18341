Heat shock protein 70 zzso a protein induced in cells exposed to zzso heat zzso is present in all living cells and has been highly zzso during zzso The aim of the current study was to determine the role of heat shock proteins in the resistance of prostate zzso cell line zzso to zzso In zzso the expression of zzso by the zzso 145 cell line, when cultured as zzso or zzso zzso was studied using Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The level of zzso in zzso cultures for up to 26 days at 37 degrees C remained similar to zzso zzso However, in samples treated with zzso at 43 degrees C for 120 zzso the zzso cultures expressed a higher level of zzso as compared to zzso zzso Under similar conditions of heat treatment, the zzso showed more heat resistance than zzso cultures as judged by the number of colonies that they formed in suspension zzso The results suggest that cells cultured in zzso zzso showed more heat resistance as compared to zzso cultures by producing higher levels of zzso
