A new class of zzso zzso with zzso zzso and a hollow interior were zzso by using a replacement reaction between zzso zzso and an zzso solution of zzso The zzso zzso zzso were generated by the reaction of zzso with zzso acid in a zzso zzso The zzso resemble a coral shape and are built up of many stems with an zzso zzso Each stem is approximately 400 zzso in length and 65 zzso in zzso The zzso composition of zzso can be tuned by the addition of different amounts of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso process resulted in zzso structures with a wall thickness of zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso indicate that the strongest zzso zzso among the resulting hollow zzso zzso was in zzso The zzso zzso was conducted to evaluate the zzso of zzso zzso hollow zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso It was found that hollow zzso and zzso zzso exhibited good zzso while both zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed zzso zzso Because of zzso in the zzso region, hollow zzso zzso were used as zzso zzso for destroying zzso lung cancer zzso Their zzso performance was compared to that of zzso zzso zzso therapeutic zzso As a result, the particle concentration and laser power required for efficient cancer cell damage were significantly reduced for hollow zzso zzso relative to those used for zzso zzso The hollow zzso zzso zzso show potential in zzso for killing cancer zzso
