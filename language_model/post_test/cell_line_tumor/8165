Recent progress in chemotherapy with platinum agents has improved clinical outcome in zzso cancer zzso but there are no useful markers to predict the efficacy of such zzso DNA zzso beta zzso mediates the efficacy of chemotherapy through DNA repair zzso We analyzed the significance of zzso expression in zzso chemotherapy and its potential as a zzso zzso 

Using zzso zzso was found to be zzso in zzso cells compared with corresponding normal colon zzso zzso We determined the zzso of zzso cells to zzso and zzso We evaluated zzso zzso expression in 97 zzso cases to determine the zzso significance of zzso zzso 

We found the suppression of zzso altered the in zzso zzso to zzso but not to zzso In 97 zzso cases, zzso zzso zzso distant zzso and zzso zzso were significantly greater in the high zzso group than in the low group zzso zzso zzso Patients with high zzso expression had significantly poorer prognosis than those with low expression zzso zzso zzso 

The data indicate zzso is zzso in zzso cases with high zzso zzso We suggest zzso could be useful as a zzso marker for selection of patients responsive to zzso
