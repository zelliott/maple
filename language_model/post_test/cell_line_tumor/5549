zzso has a substantial impact on patients' activities and overall quality of life, but current conventional drugs have debilitating side effects, including gastrointestinal zzso Thus there is a pressing need for new therapies with fewer side effects to alleviate cancer zzso We recently developed a topical herbal formula zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso based on the principles of traditional Chinese zzso and we have received positive feedback from bone cancer pain zzso The aim of this study was to determine the zzso effects and explore the mechanisms of zzso gel in a rat model of bone cancer zzso 

The rat model of bone cancer pain was established by zzso zzso rat zzso cells directly into the right zzso zzso cavity of zzso zzso The rats were randomly assigned to three groups zzso zzso 10 per zzso zzso sham bone cancer control zzso zzso vehicle (PBS) zzso without zzso cells plus topical administration of blank zzso zzso zzso treatment control zzso zzso zzso cell zzso plus topical administration of blank zzso zzso zzso gel treatment zzso zzso zzso cell zzso plus topical administration of zzso zzso zzso gel treatments were applied daily for 7 days starting on day 14 following zzso Outcomes were assessed 21 days after zzso by mechanical zzso zzso zzso and by measuring zzso of type I collagen zzso zzso zzso and zzso alkaline zzso zzso in zzso 

Fourteen days after cancer cell zzso significant mechanical zzso in the zzso hind paw and tumor growth in zzso end of the zzso were observed in the vehicle and treatment groups but not in the sham zzso At day 21, mechanical withdrawal thresholds in treatment group rats were significantly higher zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with those of the vehicle group zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels increased significantly in vehicle group rats zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with those of the sham group zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso gel decreased the level of blood serum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but had little effect on blood serum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso use of zzso gel may have an zzso effect on bone cancer pain, an effect zzso by lowering of zzso levels and zzso bone zzso
