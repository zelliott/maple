Recently, we showed that zzso delivery of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with carbon zzso zzso was more effective than free zzso and not only eradicated zzso zzso zzso but also induced zzso immunity that protected mice from subsequent zzso or systemic tumor zzso Here, we examined whether the same zzso zzso strategy could be applied to the treatment of zzso brain zzso 

Mice with both zzso and zzso zzso were injected zzso with zzso into either zzso zzso responses were assessed by flow zzso zzso imaging, and animal zzso 

When given zzso zzso response was mostly local, and it only modestly inhibited the growth of zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso the growth of not only brain but also zzso zzso Furthermore, compared with zzso injections, zzso zzso zzso a stronger inflammatory response that resulted in more potent zzso zzso and improved in zzso trafficking of zzso cells into both zzso and zzso zzso To investigate factors that accounted for these zzso zzso zzso and cellular inflammatory responses were examined in both tumor zzso zzso zzso retained the zzso particles longer and were infiltrated by zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso cells were more abundant in zzso zzso Although depletion of these cells before zzso zzso therapy enhanced its zzso responses, zzso responses to brain zzso were zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso is more effective than systemic therapy in generating zzso responses that target both brain and systemic zzso
