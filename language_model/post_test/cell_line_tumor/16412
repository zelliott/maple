zzso quantitative zzso is increasingly used in clinical zzso zzso DNA or plasmids containing cloned target sequences are necessary to generate data for standard zzso These data must be zzso to obtain the relative or absolute quantity of the target concentration in a zzso The method chosen for data analysis can strongly influence results of the zzso Absolute zzso is important especially in clinical zzso For different reasons zzso the copy number of the gene of interest based on DNA concentration zzso is vague and tends toward zzso especially if cell lines are zzso 

Data gained by limiting dilution and zzso approach were analyzed using our new zzso distribution based software and were compared with results from DNA concentration zzso Data from different cell sources zzso blood zzso cells and two cell zzso were zzso 

zzso dilution and zzso approach analyzed by a zzso distribution zzso and improves the generation of standard zzso for real time zzso if cell lines are zzso The absolute target copy number in a sample, the standard zzso and a zzso confidence zzso are calculated by the zzso 

With this easy to use program a target copy number can be reliably zzso The program is available free of charge zzso zzso zzso will be activated after acceptance of the zzso
