The zzso mechanisms of regulation, and functional impact of zzso zzso zzso in lung zzso zzso have not been fully zzso 

zzso expression was examined in 96 lung samples zzso zzso 10 normal zzso using zzso zzso and zzso lung samples zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso and 17 normal zzso using zzso The proliferation of zzso cell lines zzso and zzso was examined with zzso zzso after treatment with zzso zzso A, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were also treated with zzso zzso and zzso A to investigate the role of zzso regulation in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso expressed zzso times more zzso zzso than normal zzso In stage I zzso patients, high levels of primary tumor zzso transcripts were associated with worse zzso zzso confirmed higher zzso zzso protein expression in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso compared with normal lung zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated increased proliferation when treated with zzso zzso A and reduced proliferation when treated with zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells was zzso after treatment with zzso A and zzso zzso 

zzso is zzso in zzso relative to zzso zzso zzso may promote cell zzso and its zzso is associated with worse survival in stage I zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso may be affected by promoter zzso and zzso zzso in a subset of lung zzso
