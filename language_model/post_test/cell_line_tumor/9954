Low molecular weight random zzso bearing zzso primary zzso groups and zzso zzso groups in the side chains were zzso and their activities against zzso coli , zzso zzso , human red blood cells, and human zzso zzso cells zzso were zzso The mole fraction of zzso side chains in the zzso zzso and the length of the zzso chains were major zzso of the zzso Against zzso coli cells, activity was diminished as zzso was increased from 0 to about zzso but was then enhanced dramatically as zzso was increased zzso zzso against zzso zzso was diminished continually with increasing zzso The zzso to human zzso zzso cells also decreased with increasing zzso zzso zzso activity showed zzso enhancement with increasing zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso completely inhibited zzso zzso growth at 3 zzso zzso zzso and completely inhibited zzso activity in zzso cells at 10 zzso zzso zzso although it did not induce any zzso zzso up to 645 zzso (2000 zzso zzso dye leakage from zzso provided a zzso basis for understanding the factors which zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso induced by the zzso was enhanced as zzso increased, following trends similar to the zzso activity zzso The ability of the zzso to zzso zzso of zzso and zzso displayed trends similar to trends in their activities against zzso coli and zzso zzso , zzso This was interpreted as evidence that the zzso mechanism employed by the zzso involves disruption of bacterial cell zzso An investigation of leakage zzso revealed that the zzso zzso induced a gradual release of contents from zzso and zzso zzso while the more zzso zzso induced rapid dye zzso The results are interpreted as evidence that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in this study exert their zzso action by fundamentally different mechanisms of membrane zzso
