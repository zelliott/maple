Recent efforts in our study of cancer stem cells zzso in zzso zzso zzso have led to the identification of zzso as a prominent zzso zzso zzso zzso were based on experiments done on cell lines and zzso tumors where expression of zzso was detected at levels as high as zzso Based on the zzso theory, zzso are believed to represent only a minority number of the tumor zzso This is indicative that our previously characterized zzso zzso zzso population is still heterogeneous, consisting of perhaps zzso of cells with differing zzso zzso We hypothesized that it is possible to further enrich the zzso population by means of additional zzso expressed zzso Using a two-dimensional PAGE approach, we compared protein profiles between zzso and zzso zzso isolated from zzso and zzso and identified zzso zzso zzso as one of the proteins that are zzso expressed in the zzso zzso Analysis of the expression of several different zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity in liver cell lines found zzso to be positively correlated with zzso zzso zzso flow zzso analysis found the majority of zzso to be zzso yet not all zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso studies on zzso zzso found zzso cells to be significantly more zzso than their zzso or zzso counterparts, both in zzso and in zzso These data, combined with those from our previous work, reveal the existence of a zzso organization in zzso bearing zzso potential in the order of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed along zzso can more specifically characterize the zzso liver zzso zzso
