Ewing zzso zzso harbor a zzso zzso that zzso the zzso gene to an zzso zzso factor, most commonly zzso leukemia integration 1 zzso The zzso fusion protein acts in a positive feedback loop to maintain the expression of zzso which is involved in repair of DNA zzso Here, we examine the effects of zzso zzso and radiation therapy on Ewing zzso In proliferation zzso the Ewing zzso cell lines zzso and zzso were much more sensitive than zzso zzso cell lines to the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and to radiation zzso 2-4 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with short hairpin zzso zzso or zzso zzso Ewing zzso cells, but not zzso zzso cells, to radiation therapy in both proliferation and colony formation zzso Using the zzso zzso radiation of Ewing zzso cells with zzso compared to without zzso resulted in more DNA damage at 1 hour zzso tail moment zzso zzso zzso and sustained DNA damage at 24 hours zzso zzso zzso This DNA damage led to a zzso to zzso increase in zzso and a zzso to zzso increase in cell zzso The effect of zzso zzso and radiation therapy on Ewing zzso cells was lost when zzso was silenced by zzso A small dose of radiation therapy (4 zzso when combined with zzso zzso stopped the growth of zzso flank tumors zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso in Ewing zzso zzso the level and duration of DNA damage caused by radiation therapy, leading to synergistic increases in zzso and cell death in a zzso zzso
