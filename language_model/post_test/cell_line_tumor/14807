Recent zzso association studies reported strong and zzso associations of multiple genetic zzso in a large zzso region of zzso zzso with zzso to prostate cancer zzso However, the zzso or functional zzso of these zzso zzso and their biological mechanisms associated with PC zzso remain unclear and should be zzso Here, focusing on its most zzso region zzso Region zzso zzso zzso zzso among the multiple PC zzso on zzso we performed fine mapping and zzso of this critical region and identified zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to be most significantly associated with PC zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso , OR zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso we show that this region was transcribed as a zzso zzso zzso long zzso zzso zzso termed zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso 1), and zzso expression was zzso in some of the PC cells as well as precursor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso attenuated the viability of PC cells and the zzso activity of zzso zzso which indicates that zzso could be involved in prostate zzso possibly through zzso zzso zzso These findings could provide a new insight in understanding the zzso of genetic factors for PC zzso and prostate zzso
