It has been proposed that zzso DNA zzso can alter zzso response to therapeutic zzso The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relationship between Ras association domain family protein 1, zzso A zzso and drug resistance or growth of zzso zzso cell line zzso 

zzso status of zzso from zzso gene of zzso was determined with zzso zzso chain reaction and was further verified by zzso treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso was introduced into zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso were analyzed using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Growth of cells was detected by colony formation zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso was zzso in zzso cell line through zzso zzso and zzso of zzso was markedly able to reduce the resistance to some zzso drugs and inhibit the growth of cancer cells either in zzso or in zzso 

These results correlate zzso status of zzso with biological profiles of zzso and thus, associate zzso with cancer zzso zzso may be useful to predict treatment response and help to develop novel treatment strategies for clinical treatment of zzso zzso
