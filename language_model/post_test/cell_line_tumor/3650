We show that the recently discovered tumor zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso via zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso enhances the binding of zzso to zzso which in turn together bind to and repress the zzso zzso zzso of zzso accompanied by a zzso change was previously reported in colon zzso We show that expression of zzso as an indirect zzso of zzso is lost in progressed zzso of zzso breast, zzso and zzso Furthermore, it seems that zzso and expression of zzso directly correlate with tumor zzso Finally, the zzso inhibitor zzso reduces the proliferation of several tumor cell lines, suggesting that zzso of zzso may be a useful strategy against zzso zzso zzso zzso might serve as a novel target for zzso zzso
