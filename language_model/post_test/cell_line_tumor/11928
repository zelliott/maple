zzso prediction of an individual patient's drug response is an important prerequisite of personalized zzso Recent zzso research in zzso prediction has studied the zzso correlation based on zzso zzso However, zzso profiling will more directly solve the current functional and zzso zzso We sought to determine whether zzso signatures of zzso cells were sufficient for the prediction of drug zzso 

In this study, a machine learning model system was developed to zzso cell line zzso exclusively based on zzso zzso Using zzso protein zzso zzso protein expression levels were measured by 52 zzso in a panel of 60 human cancer cell zzso zzso The model system combined several well-known zzso including random forests, zzso and the nearest neighbor methods, to construct the protein zzso zzso zzso The zzso were designed to be independent of the tissue origin of the zzso 

A total of 118 zzso of the complete range of drug responses zzso zzso and zzso were generated for the evaluated zzso drugs, one for each zzso The accuracy of zzso prediction of all the evaluated 118 agents was significantly higher zzso zzso zzso than that of random zzso Furthermore, our study found that the zzso zzso for zzso of zzso were also potential diagnostic markers of colon zzso 

The results showed that it was feasible to accurately predict zzso by zzso zzso This study provides a basis for the prediction of drug response based on protein markers in the zzso zzso
