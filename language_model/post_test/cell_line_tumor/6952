zzso solid zzso zzso zzso have recently been suggested for zzso gene delivery, as these particles consist of well tolerated zzso can bind DNA directly via zzso interactions and mediate gene transfer in zzso We here report the development of zzso complexes, which can be targeted to specific surface zzso A zzso of zzso was prepared by the zzso technique zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a size of approximately 100 zzso and a zzso of zzso These zzso are able to zzso DNA in complexes, which are very stable under zzso conditions, and they display low zzso in cell zzso In addition to binding of DNA, the zzso can simultaneously bind substantial amounts of zzso directly via zzso zzso The zzso zzso complexes are stable and are capable of binding zzso zzso which can interact with surface zzso This method allows for development of a fast and simple method of preparing a targeted zzso gene therapy zzso
