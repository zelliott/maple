The clinical outcome of melanoma depends on the local and distant spread of the disease at the time of diagnosis, as the estimated zzso survival rate is about zzso for superficial melanoma diagnosed early, but less than zzso for melanoma that has zzso to major zzso such as zzso There is a crucial need for new effective methods for the detection and the characterization of zzso In the zzso setting, this will help to understand the factors that contribute to the zzso while the transfer into the clinic will contribute to an early effective treatment of zzso zzso zzso can be detected by electron zzso resonance zzso using zzso properties of zzso zzso As part of the development of zzso imaging to characterize zzso we evaluated in the present study the usefulness of zzso to report on the extension of lung zzso by comparing the method with zzso imaging using zzso melanoma cells expressing zzso zzso melanoma cells were injected zzso or zzso in zzso zzso The primary tumors or the lung colonization by melanoma cells was measured after several delay periods to obtain several degrees of zzso The animals were measured zzso with zzso after zzso injection of zzso The primary tumors or lungs were then zzso After zzso the content of zzso in lungs was measured and zzso by zzso at 9 zzso We observed a direct relationship between the zzso intensity and the zzso zzso Another tumor model zzso zzso zzso but expressing zzso was used to confirm that the zzso signal was directly linked to the zzso zzso present in the zzso
