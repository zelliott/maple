We have previously shown that a nutritional model of B vitamin zzso and homocysteine cycle zzso could lead to increased zzso zzso deposition, due to zzso and zzso zzso and zzso increase in zzso zzso We zzso that nutritional factors causing homocysteine cycle zzso zzso zzso could induce zzso DNA zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso of present study was to analyze the zzso pattern of zzso promoter in zzso zzso cells and zzso mice, in a B vitamin zzso B12 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso status has been evaluated through zzso modification and zzso zzso We demonstrate that B vitamin zzso zzso zzso of specific zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso has been supplemented as zzso donor to reverse this zzso zzso promoter zzso status is correlated with gene zzso These findings pinpoint a direct relationship between B zzso zzso of homocysteine cycle and DNA zzso and also indicate that zzso promoter is regulated by zzso of specific zzso zzso
