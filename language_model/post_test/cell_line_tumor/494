zzso was spontaneously generated from a natural product during zzso In cultured cells, it causes zzso bundle formation, like those caused by zzso With zzso zzso causes formation of an zzso spiral zzso Using zzso and zzso we developed an zzso for spiral formation and applied it to 17 new zzso zzso with either a modified side chain or a different size D zzso There was reasonable correlation between spiral formation and zzso of human zzso breast zzso cell zzso Only one side chain analog was as active as zzso During these studies, we observed that omitting zzso from the reaction mixture caused a major change in the zzso of the zzso zzso with half the observed zzso being zzso and half being zzso This mixed zzso slowly zzso at 0 degrees C, but there was no apparent difference in the zzso of the zzso versus the zzso
