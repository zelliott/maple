Unlimited zzso potential is a hallmark of cancer, and can be achieved through the zzso of zzso maintenance mechanisms zzso Most tumors activate zzso but a significant minority, mainly of zzso origin, uses a zzso alternative lengthening of zzso zzso zzso We investigated the presence of zzso in 34 zzso tumor zzso samples from 30 patients by using two zzso zzso the detection of zzso zzso leukemia zzso nuclear bodies zzso by combined zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso the assessment of terminal restriction zzso zzso length distribution by zzso field gel zzso In zzso zzso activity zzso was determined by the zzso repeat amplification protocol zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso zzso was zzso in five samples as the sole zzso and in six samples in association with zzso zzso samples only expressed zzso and in six cases no known zzso was zzso zzso of zzso length distribution were available in 32 cases, and a zzso between zzso and zzso data in defining the zzso zzso was found in zzso cases zzso The study provides the first evidence of the presence of zzso in zzso and indicates that in a small but defined fraction of cases (about zzso zzso is the only zzso that supports the development of zzso
