We developed a novel zzso zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso zzso zzso cholesterol, and a fatty acid zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso had a zzso zzso shape with a mean diameter of 160 zzso zzso zzso was zzso by the zzso using an ammonium zzso zzso method with a zzso to drug ratio of zzso zzso resulting in zzso loading zzso The zzso exhibited better stability than conventional low temperature sensitive zzso zzso temperature sensitive zzso zzso at 37 zzso in the presence of zzso there was rapid release of zzso in the range of zzso zzso zzso release at 42 zzso within zzso A zzso microscope revealed that zzso zzso in zzso zzso was taken up much better by cell zzso at 42 zzso than at 37 zzso The difference in cell viability between 37 and 42 zzso was zzso relative to zzso and zzso for zzso The zzso zzso and zzso effect of zzso combined with high-intensity focused ultrasound zzso were zzso and compared with zzso An in zzso study demonstrated that zzso is highly stable, with a long circulating property zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice, and resulted in significant tumor zzso for 2 days after intravenous injection of zzso at 5 zzso zzso in combination with zzso These results are better than conventional zzso for which the blood circulation time is short zzso zzso and zzso of tumor growth is zzso These results indicate that the properties of stability at 37 zzso and burst release at 42 zzso of zzso act zzso against zzso
