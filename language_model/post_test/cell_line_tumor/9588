The objective of this study was to assess the zzso efficacy of zzso alone or in combination with zzso in breast zzso A total of 20 human breast cancer lines were examined for expression of various zzso zzso zzso and zzso of their down stream signaling zzso as well as for their invasion and colony forming zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were tested for the zzso on breast cancer cell growth and tumor zzso Seven of the 20 lines displayed an elevated level of zzso others had varying level of zzso IGF-1 or insulin zzso Over zzso of the lines also had zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The lines displayed a wide range of colony forming and invasion zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited the colony forming ability of all of the lines with the zzso zzso lines having a higher zzso A similar trend was observed for zzso of invasion by zzso zzso alone and zzso together with zzso inhibited the breast cancer cell growth especially in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibited tumor growth and zzso tumor load in a zzso model using a zzso zzso and in a zzso transgenic zzso zzso and zzso significantly reduced the level of zzso D1 and D3 and increased the zzso of zzso 3 suggesting an increased zzso Our results suggest that zzso together with zzso has an enhanced zzso effect and could be developed as an improved therapeutic regimen for breast zzso
