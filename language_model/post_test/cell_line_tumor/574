zzso zzso is known to augment zzso zzso zzso activity in cell cultures as well as in brain extracts from several zzso This association between zzso and zzso could contribute to their respective roles in zzso However, the effect of zzso on zzso function in human brain has as yet to be examined as does the contribution of specific zzso zzso 

We examined the effects of zzso on zzso activity and on zzso zzso binding to zzso in human zzso zzso and compared this to its effects on zzso activity in zzso zzso cells following the targeting of zzso pathways using specific chemical zzso 

zzso enhances zzso activity as well as the association of zzso zzso to zzso in human zzso zzso The screening of zzso and zzso cell cultures reveals that zzso activity does not always correlate with the expression of either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of the individual zzso zzso and zzso zzso pathways in zzso zzso cells all augment zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso zzso We also observe the inverse relation between zzso zzso and zzso function in zzso cultures grown to full zzso 

The zzso component to zzso activity is present in human brain and in zzso studies link it to the zzso zzso This means of influencing zzso function could explain its role in zzso as diverse as zzso and zzso
