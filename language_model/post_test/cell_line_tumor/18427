The synthesis of zzso is zzso by two known zzso zzso zzso zzso Although they catalyze the same zzso reaction, these zzso share no sequence zzso and their relative functions are poorly zzso Gene knockout studies in mice have revealed that zzso contributes to zzso synthesis in zzso and plays an important role in regulating energy metabolism but is not essential for zzso Here we show that zzso plays a fundamental role in zzso zzso synthesis and is required for zzso zzso zzso mice are zzso and die soon after birth, apparently from profound reductions in zzso for energy metabolism and from impaired zzso barrier function in the zzso zzso was unable to compensate for the absence of zzso supporting the hypothesis that the two zzso play fundamentally different roles in zzso zzso zzso
