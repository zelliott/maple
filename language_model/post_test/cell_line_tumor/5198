zzso zzso is appropriate for separating pure cells from zzso zzso Recently, we have focused on whole zzso DNA zzso patterns of lung zzso cell zzso zzso and needed to obtain the appropriate counterpart cells of lung zzso However, in some regions of human zzso such as in zzso zzso it is difficult to apply tissue zzso as a means to isolate pure cells from a zzso mixture of zzso zzso we developed the pop brush method to retrieve sufficient amounts of pure zzso zzso from gross lung zzso and this method enables us to study zzso variations of lung zzso
