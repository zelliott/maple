Cellular zzso protein zzso proteins are crucial regulators of the zzso signaling complex zzso and zzso zzso To date, three zzso zzso with distinct functions and regulation have been zzso Our previous studies have shown that the stability of zzso proteins is subject to zzso regulation, but the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been zzso Here, we identify zzso 193 as a novel in zzso zzso site of all zzso proteins and demonstrate that zzso zzso selectively influences the stability of the short zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso the zzso and selectively zzso the zzso of zzso short zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also decreases the zzso of zzso long zzso but, surprisingly, does not affect its stability, indicating that zzso zzso has a different function in zzso The zzso of this zzso is operated by the protein zzso C zzso as zzso zzso is markedly increased by treatment with zzso and decreased by zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso do not affect the ability of zzso to bind to the zzso although zzso zzso is increased by death zzso zzso Instead, zzso zzso affects the zzso level of zzso which then determines the sensitivity to zzso zzso These results reveal that the differential stability of zzso proteins is regulated in an zzso manner by zzso zzso
