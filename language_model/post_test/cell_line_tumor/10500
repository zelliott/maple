The present study demonstrates zzso complexes of zzso silk proteins containing zzso and zzso peptides zzso which are zzso and approximately zzso zzso in diameter, show significant enhancement of target specificity to tumor cells by additions of F3 and zzso zzso We report zzso the preparation and study of novel zzso zzso zzso complexes containing zzso able to home specifically to tumor zzso zzso focus was on how the zzso F3 zzso and zzso enhanced zzso specificity to tumor zzso zzso engineered silk proteins containing both zzso zzso to interact with zzso and the zzso to bind to specific tumor cells for zzso zzso delivery were prepared using zzso coli, followed by in zzso and in zzso zzso experiments into zzso melanoma cells and highly zzso human breast tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso breast zzso cells were used as a control cell line for in zzso zzso delivery zzso These results demonstrate that combination of the zzso silk delivery systems and zzso can serve as a versatile and useful new platform for zzso gene zzso
