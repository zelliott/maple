The zzso zzso gene is a growth zzso zzso which is highly expressed in many human zzso and may be involved in the progression towards tumor zzso However, it is unclear whether zzso plays any role in gastric cancer development or zzso Our studies were designed to clarify the zzso expression pattern and to explore its potential role in gastric zzso 

The expression pattern of zzso was determined in primary gastric cancer specimens and gastric cancer cell lines via zzso and Western zzso To investigate the functional significance of zzso zzso three small interfering zzso zzso expression plasmids were constructed and zzso into gastric cancer cell line zzso The stable cell lines zzso with the zzso targeting zzso zzso plasmids were selected and the biological features of these cells were zzso 

zzso was zzso in zzso of the gastric cancer zzso and all gastric cancer zzso In addition, zzso expression was significantly increased and corresponded with the zzso clinical stage, and was significantly higher in the late stage zzso zzso zzso The zzso expression level was significantly decreased in the zzso cells with zzso zzso expression zzso zzso Furthermore, the stable zzso cancer cells exhibited an increase in the zzso of spontaneous zzso and a decrease in growth ability and zzso in nude zzso 

These results provide strong evidence that zzso plays an important role in gastric cancer cell proliferation and development, and suggests that zzso is a promising target for gastric cancer zzso
