To generate an zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso mouse melanoma cell line zzso preserving the zzso ability in zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso virus entry zzso zzso gene was amplified by zzso from human melanoma cell line zzso and cloned into zzso Easy zzso for zzso The zzso gene was then cloned into zzso zzso to generate zzso for zzso of mouse melanoma cell line zzso zzso After that, the putative zzso cells were selected in full growth medium containing zzso The zzso cells were isolated by zzso zzso zzso The mouse melanoma cell line expressing zzso zzso designated as zzso was zzso The zzso of zzso cells to zzso infection was examined with green zzso protein zzso zzso zzso To investigate the zzso ability of both cells in zzso zzso cells in 100 zzso were zzso zzso into the right zzso of zzso zzso 

In zzso the zzso mouse melanoma cells were shown by zzso zzso capable of being infected by zzso In zzso the zzso cells, like their wild type counterpart, grew to form melanoma in zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso mouse melanoma cell line was zzso Its zzso remained zzso
