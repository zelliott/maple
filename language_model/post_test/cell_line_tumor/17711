zzso of zzso of zzso zzso is one potential mechanism for tumor cells to evade immune zzso To determine whether zzso killing of tumor cells can be enhanced by zzso of zzso zzso 2 novel zzso fusion proteins zzso were introduced into the poorly zzso mouse melanoma cell line, zzso zzso Each fusion protein contained zzso and a zzso site specific for zzso B zzso or zzso 8, thereby targeting the 2 major killing mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of a zzso fusion protein by zzso tumor cells greatly enhanced the zzso to killing by zzso killer zzso cells or zzso zzso zzso killing was increased to a much greater extent when tumor cells expressed the zzso fusion protein with a zzso zzso site compared to a zzso 8 zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso cells, which lack zzso zzso but process normal zzso for death zzso killed zzso tumor cells expressed zzso with zzso 8 zzso site more zzso zzso killing by zzso was also accompanied by processing of the fusion protein and increased zzso zzso These results indicate that killing of tumor cells can be amplified by targeting zzso zzso mechanisms via expression of zzso fusion zzso
