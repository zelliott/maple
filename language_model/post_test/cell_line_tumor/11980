It has been determined previously that zzso zzso or zzso can facilitate melanoma cell zzso through the zzso under zzso zzso The interactions between melanoma cells and zzso are zzso by the zzso expressed by zzso and zzso zzso molecules zzso expressed on melanoma zzso In this study, the zzso of these interactions was studied using a parallel plate flow zzso The zzso rates were calculated under low force conditions for zzso interactions with both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso together and separately by using functional blocking zzso on zzso The zzso of zzso zzso with zzso was also zzso It was concluded that the small number of zzso expressed active zzso on zzso are sufficient to bind to zzso expressed on melanoma cells and that the intrinsic zzso rate for these zzso molecules appear to be more dependent on what method is used to determine them than on what cells express zzso
