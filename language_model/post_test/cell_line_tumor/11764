zzso zzso therapy zzso is necessary for preventing the side effects associated with zzso such as zzso caused by the distribution of zzso into normal zzso In the development of targeted zzso agents, a simple evaluation system of in zzso zzso as well as target cell zzso is absolutely zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso may become a simple and versatile labeling strategy for this zzso 

zzso IX zzso and a zzso zzso zzso that interacts with the zzso zzso zzso zzso were used as a zzso and zzso zzso zzso Then, a zzso of zzso and zzso analog linked via short zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and used as a targeted zzso zzso In addition, a zzso zzso analog was zzso under zzso reaction zzso Lastly, cell zzso study and PET zzso zzso analyses of the zzso analog were carried out in a human prostate cancer cell line, zzso which highly expresses the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

It was confirmed that degradation zzso to be based on zzso occurs, and large amounts of zzso compounds are wasted in the reaction zzso Interestingly, the addition of ethanol into the reaction mixture provides an effective solution for this zzso As for cell zzso study, the zzso analog demonstrated significantly higher zzso for zzso cells than zzso and, in addition, the zzso of zzso analog was significantly inhibited by adding excess cold zzso analog zzso PET zzso zzso evaluation revealed that zzso analog and zzso rapidly accumulate into the liver and zzso circulate in blood for a long time compared with normal zzso and distribute at a low level in the zzso This result suggested that in zzso zzso of zzso analog is mainly dependent on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso distribution after PET studies showed that although there was no remarkable difference in the zzso ratio of zzso between zzso analog and zzso the zzso (an organ that also expresses zzso zzso ratio was significantly higher in the case of zzso zzso 

We report on the successful synthesis of zzso zzso zzso and their zzso zzso zzso under conditions in which zzso is zzso This labeling strategy with zzso zzso may be of value for the rapid development of ideal targeted zzso zzso
