In this study, zzso zzso which was reported to kill cancer stem cells, was used in a combination therapy with zzso zzso to eradicate both cancer cells and zzso cancer stem cells to mitigate the zzso of the zzso Both zzso and zzso were loaded into zzso with sizes below 100 zzso narrow size distribution and high drug zzso The zzso were zzso from a mixture of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso mixed zzso zzso were used to target both cancer cells and stem cells via zzso Cancer stem cells were sorted by a side population zzso from zzso and zzso human breast cancer cell lines, and identified by zzso zzso The zzso of various zzso was evaluated on the sorted cancer stem cells zzso population SP zzso sorted zzso cancer cells zzso population zzso zzso and zzso cancer zzso zzso activity was also evaluated on zzso zzso in nude zzso As compared with zzso cells, zzso suppressed SP cell growth less zzso while zzso and zzso were more effective in the zzso of SP zzso A stronger zzso effect was observed on SP cells with the zzso of free zzso and zzso or zzso and zzso as compared to free zzso or zzso zzso and zzso were capable of lowering the population of SP cells in zzso zzso In the zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso produced the strongest zzso zzso and both zzso and zzso showed strong activity against cancer stem zzso This combination therapy may provide a promising strategy for breast cancer treatment by targeting both cancer cells and cancer stem zzso
