zzso tumor gene zzso which is expressed in human pancreatic cancer zzso is a unique tumor zzso recognized by zzso zzso immune zzso zzso zzso a standard therapeutic drug for PC, was examined for the regulation of zzso expression and the zzso effect on PC cells with zzso zzso immune zzso zzso of zzso was examined by quantitative zzso zzso analysis, and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso presented on zzso class I molecules was detected by mass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso human T cells were used as zzso T cells for the analysis of zzso zzso zzso treatment of human zzso PC cells enhanced zzso zzso levels, and this increase is associated with nuclear factor zzso B zzso zzso tissue from zzso zzso zzso mice also showed an increase in zzso zzso Some human PC cell lines other than zzso showed zzso of zzso zzso levels following zzso zzso zzso treatment shifted zzso protein from the nucleus to the zzso which may promote zzso processing of zzso protein and generation of zzso zzso In fact, presentation of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso increased in zzso zzso cells relative to zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells killed zzso cells treated with an optimal dose of zzso more efficiently than zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso expression in human PC cells and zzso PC cells with zzso zzso zzso immune zzso
