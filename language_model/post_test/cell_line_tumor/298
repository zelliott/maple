It is generally accepted that zzso of the outer zzso membrane is a crucial event in the induction of zzso In order to know how the cell would respond to the damage targeted not to the outer zzso zzso but to the zzso interior, we followed the changes in cell zzso and some zzso parameters triggered by zzso in the zzso inner zzso The experiments were carried out in zzso zzso zzso zzso For zzso production of zzso oxygen in the inner space of zzso we employed zzso treatment zzso zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso O, zzso accumulating in the inner space of zzso At low to intermediate zzso doses (up to zzso reducing cellular viability by zzso zzso did not reveal hallmarks of dead cells, and the decrease of cellular viability could be attributed to cell cycle zzso and enhanced zzso High zzso doses zzso zzso did induce cell death by zzso involving release of zzso c and zzso zzso in addition to enhanced zzso
