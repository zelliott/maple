Despite recent advances in treatment, breast cancer remains a serious health threat for zzso Traditional zzso are limited by a lack of specificity for tumor cells and the cell cycle dependence of many zzso zzso Here we report a novel strategy to help overcome these zzso Using zzso zzso zzso to direct DNA damage zzso to zzso zzso in human breast cancer cells, we show that the effectiveness of the zzso zzso analogue zzso can be improved zzso zzso targeted to the promoter region of zzso directly inhibited gene expression by approximately zzso When used in zzso specific zzso increased the incorporation of zzso at the targeted site approximately zzso presumably due to induction of zzso DNA zzso zzso treated with zzso and zzso in combination showed a reduction in both cell survival and capacity for zzso growth zzso zzso of zzso zzso This combination affected the zzso potential of these cancer cells to a significantly greater extent than either treatment zzso This novel strategy may be used to increase the range of effectiveness of zzso zzso in any tumor which zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso approaches such as this, coupled with zzso gene zzso may lead to more than incremental improvements in zzso treatment of breast zzso
