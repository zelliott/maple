zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is widely used to monitor response to therapy in the clinic and has, more recently, been proposed as an early marker of long term zzso This relies on the assumption that a change in zzso consumption parallels a reduction in viability and long term growth zzso However, cells may zzso zzso other than zzso and as many zzso interfere with zzso metabolism directly, it is entirely plausible that a positive zzso response may be unrelated to long term zzso Furthermore, changes in metabolism and proliferation may take place on different zzso zzso thus restricting the time window in which zzso is zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a master regulator of multiple cellular processes including zzso zzso proliferation and cell zzso zzso of zzso has been shown to reduce zzso zzso in several zzso types but the relative influence of this zzso on zzso metabolism and proliferation is not fully zzso 

We proposed to zzso assess the suitability of zzso as a zzso for measuring response to zzso zzso and zzso determine the optimum imaging schedule, in zzso We used zzso zzso zzso an excellent zzso in zzso model of avascular zzso to investigate the effects of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso and its relation to zzso zzso 

zzso were prepared from two cell lines with a zzso active zzso pathway, zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso and zzso zzso zzso human zzso Treatment consisted of a zzso exposure to either zzso and growth was monitored over the following 7 zzso To mimic potential imaging regimens with zzso average zzso zzso per viable cell was measured zzso directly following the zzso exposure, zzso following an additional zzso recovery period, or zzso following a 48 h zzso 

Growth was restricted significantly ( zzso in a zzso fashion in zzso from both cell lines treated with either zzso In the highly zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso was significantly reduced at all zzso of zzso For the moderately zzso cell line zzso zzso was affected in a zzso fashion, but to lesser zzso To assess the zzso of zzso zzso for long term growth zzso zzso correlation zzso were calculated for each imaging zzso These indicated that the optimal imaging schedules differed between cell zzso 

This study suggests that zzso may be a suitable marker of response to zzso zzso in the cell lines that we have zzso Our data support the hypothesis that imaging schedules should be zzso on a zzso zzso zzso
