zzso activity is one zzso indicating the zzso of tumor zzso zzso has now been extensively studied to clarify the mechanisms of tumor growth and zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso is an zzso zzso expressed by many human and animal zzso We studied the role of zzso in tumor growth by zzso the zzso gene into tumor cells and analyzing the survival period of nude mice implanted with these zzso tumor zzso 

Cell zzso The tumor cell line, zzso was established from human zzso zzso cell zzso and used in this zzso The tumor cells did not produce zzso in the culture zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso with sense zzso zzso or with the zzso zzso The full-length zzso zzso was cloned into an expression zzso zzso The DNA zzso was performed by the zzso method, and the limiting dilution method was used for zzso zzso was used to measure zzso in the culture zzso As a control, zzso cells were zzso with the zzso alone without zzso zzso The tumor cells were zzso injected into nude mice zzso zzso zzso and the survival period and tumor volume were zzso zzso of zzso agent, zzso and zzso zzso on tumor growth and zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso administered to mice implanted with tumor cells once a week and twice a week for 5 weeks, zzso The effects of zzso and zzso zzso were analyzed by examining tumor size and survival rate and zzso using zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cells zzso with sense zzso 165 zzso zzso to as zzso zzso ) produced zzso in the zzso permanently, confirming the establishment of a zzso human cancer cell zzso We observed marked tumor growth and a shortened survival period by nine days in the zzso group, compared to the control zzso The administration of zzso and zzso zzso significantly suppressed tumor zzso The zzso study showed the significant suppression of a number of tumor vessels in zzso zzso zzso 

Our data strongly suggests that zzso plays an important role in tumor growth and that treatment by zzso zzso may be a promising strategy against head and neck zzso
