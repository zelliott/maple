A major obstacle in the successful delivery of zzso zzso to tumor cells is the zzso of target zzso zzso We reported previously that zzso acid zzso is a potent and selective zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso leukemia zzso The purpose of this study was to determine whether the zzso zzso zzso could be a target for an zzso zzso to induce selective killing of leukemia zzso The combination of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso induced a synergistic killing of leukemia zzso Thus, zzso of zzso leukemia cells and cell lines with as little as 1 zzso zzso in the presence of zzso induced substantial killing zzso of leukemia cell zzso More importantly, the blasts of zzso leukemia patients, irrespective of their zzso and zzso features, also responded to the zzso and zzso combination when cultured ex zzso A similar synergistic effect between zzso and zzso was observed against a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso However, another zzso of zzso cells, zzso in which the zzso zzso function has been zzso by a zzso zzso exhibited complete resistance to the zzso killing effect in the presence or absence of zzso Our results suggest that zzso combined with zzso therapeutic agent may offer exciting opportunities for the treatment of zzso zzso despite their zzso of genetic and clinical zzso
