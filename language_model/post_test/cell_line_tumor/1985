The present study examined the effect of dietary zzso a soy zzso on breast cancer patients who take zzso an zzso treatment, using a zzso zzso The interaction of various doses of zzso with tamoxifen on the growth of zzso zzso breast cancer zzso cells was investigated by zzso injecting zzso cells into the flank of zzso zzso zzso Animals were zzso into eight experimental groups with zzso mice per group: control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso E zzso tamoxifen zzso (3 zzso T zzso zzso + tamoxifen zzso + zzso tamoxifen + 500 zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso + tamoxifen + 250 zzso zzso zzso + T + zzso zzso + tamoxifen + 500 zzso zzso zzso + T + zzso and zzso + tamoxifen + 1000 zzso zzso zzso + T + zzso Treatment of tamoxifen significantly reduced the zzso zzso tumor prevalence and tumor zzso This zzso effect of tamoxifen was significantly negated by the low doses of dietary zzso zzso and 500 zzso whereas the 1000 zzso zzso did not have the same zzso zzso harvested from zzso tumors retained zzso responsiveness of their zzso zzso cells, indicating that the zzso effect of zzso on zzso tumor growth was not caused by a diminished tamoxifen response but directly by zzso The low doses of dietary zzso zzso the zzso effect of tamoxifen potentially by acting on the tumor cell zzso ratio and the zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso D1 in addition to regulating the zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso data from the current study suggest that caution is warranted regarding the consumption of dietary zzso by breast cancer patients while on tamoxifen zzso
