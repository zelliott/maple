Fusion zzso zzso like zzso mediate zzso transformation and represent therapeutic zzso Fusion of zzso zzso zzso zzso 6, previously known as zzso to zzso due to zzso has been observed in various zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso display similar activity but they may not be identical in zzso Here we present the generation of an zzso positive human acute zzso leukemia zzso cell line, zzso The cell line expressed zzso fusion transcripts and displayed sensitivity to zzso with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso did not reveal overt zzso suggesting a cryptic zzso Fluorescent in zzso zzso and zzso comparative zzso zzso were performed to characterize the zzso zzso fusion was demonstrated to result from zzso of a duplicated 300 to zzso zzso region of zzso that contained the zzso portion of the zzso zzso into the zzso locus on zzso With this zzso an zzso to 1750 zzso region of zzso that contained the zzso portion of the zzso gene as well the zzso dependent zzso inhibitor zzso zzso gene was zzso Furthermore, the cells displayed a zzso approximately zzso typically associated with loss of zzso and zzso The zzso cell line may serve as a tool for the study of zzso
