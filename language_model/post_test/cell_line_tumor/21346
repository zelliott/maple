zzso infection causes rapid and lasting defects in the population of zzso T zzso To fully describe the impact of zzso we examined zzso samples from zzso patients receiving highly active zzso therapy, who had displayed prolonged viral control and zzso counts above 300 zzso We observed lower zzso of zzso zzso cells in zzso individuals when compared with controls, coupled with an increased proportion of zzso zzso These changes were common among 24 zzso patients and were not related to zzso cell count or viral zzso zzso zzso cells from zzso individuals had lower expression of zzso B and displayed reduced zzso against zzso targets after in zzso zzso There was increased expression of zzso zzso on zzso cells from zzso zzso that may be a mechanism for depletion of zzso cells during zzso In addition to the zzso defects in the zzso repertoire and functional responses to zzso the proportion of zzso zzso T cells after zzso zzso stimulation was reduced sharply in zzso donors versus zzso Thus, zzso infection has multiple impacts on the circulating zzso T cell population that combine to reduce the potential zzso activity in terms of tumor zzso Changes in zzso T cells, along with zzso effects on zzso and zzso cells that also contribute to tumor zzso may be important factors for zzso the risk of zzso during zzso
