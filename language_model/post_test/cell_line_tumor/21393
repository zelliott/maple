The zzso class zzso zzso zzso can catalyze the reduction of zzso zzso zzso species and is responsible for the zzso of potentially toxic zzso We investigated the cause of zzso zzso in the zzso breast cancer cell line and found that the cell line is zzso for a zzso zzso that encodes the deletion of zzso Northern and Western blots show that zzso cells contain zzso zzso but no zzso protein suggesting that the deletion of zzso causes zzso zzso in zzso In further support of this contention we found that zzso cell lines from subjects who are zzso for the deletion of zzso have only zzso of normal activity with the zzso specific zzso zzso zzso zzso studies showed that the deletion of zzso causes increased turnover of zzso in zzso zzso These data establish the fact that the zzso deletion of zzso can cause zzso zzso in zzso zzso expression is elevated in some cell lines that are resistant to the zzso cancer drugs zzso zzso and zzso but its specific contribution to zzso drug resistance has not been zzso In this study zzso deficient zzso cells were used to determine if zzso contributes directly to zzso and drug zzso We established stable expression of normal zzso in zzso cells and found that this did not alter sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso
