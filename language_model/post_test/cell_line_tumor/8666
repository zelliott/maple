Brain zzso nervous system; zzso zzso pose a life-threatening problem for women with advanced zzso breast zzso It has recently been shown that the zzso within zzso brain zzso model markedly restricts zzso delivery in approximately zzso of zzso zzso Therefore to improve zzso we have developed an zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that can passively diffuse across the leaky zzso barrier and then be taken up into cancer cells zzso via zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso as an zzso zzso zzso was able to bypass zzso zzso on the surface of the cancer zzso In zzso zzso of the zzso and free zzso were similar in that they zzso both caused zzso arrest in the zzso phase, zzso showed similar degrees of zzso induction zzso zzso and zzso had similar zzso values when compared with zzso in zzso zzso A zzso model of brain zzso of breast cancer using zzso injections of zzso zzso zzso cells was used to evaluate in zzso efficacy of the zzso The animals administered with zzso zzso had significantly longer overall survival compared with the control and the zzso group zzso zzso zzso This study suggests that the small molecular weight zzso zzso can improve standard zzso drug efficacy in a zzso model of brain zzso of breast zzso
