zzso acid response zzso zzso is activated when cells are deprived of zzso zzso In the present study, using the human colon cancer cell line zzso we observed that zzso an zzso of the zzso pathway, was significantly induced at the zzso level after the removal of zzso acids from the zzso zzso of the zzso alcohol zzso which prevents the formation of zzso also increased zzso zzso to a level similar to that observed when cells were deprived of all zzso zzso zzso activity and stability of zzso zzso were both increased in the zzso zzso zzso The induction of zzso gene expression was confirmed by the increased zzso zzso of the zzso protein in the zzso acid deprived zzso Although zzso zzso zzso showed increased zzso zzso II binding at the zzso promoter in zzso zzso conditions, zzso binding to the promoter is zzso zzso reporter zzso did not detect any functional zzso within the zzso gene zzso zzso of zzso by zzso did not affect the increase of zzso zzso during zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso zzso abolished the induction of zzso Our study revealed that zzso is a novel target gene in the response to zzso acid zzso and that the expression of zzso is zzso through an zzso and an zzso zzso
