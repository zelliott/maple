zzso are emerging as important regulators of zzso zzso Our studies show that zzso zzso is zzso in human zzso cancer relative to normal zzso and zzso of zzso suppresses cell growth in zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso zzso is found to be regulated directly by zzso demonstrating that zzso is a functionally important target of zzso in zzso cancer zzso When zzso is zzso in zzso cancer cells, the zzso and protein levels of zzso are both zzso whereas zzso of zzso results in an increase in the zzso expression zzso zzso cancer zzso display significantly low expression of zzso and a high level of zzso compared with normal zzso indicating that regulation of zzso by zzso is an important mechanism for zzso to inhibit zzso cancer zzso
