zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso tumor invasion, and zzso in many types of zzso including gastric zzso Recently, much interest has been focused on the role of zzso in tumor zzso Our previous studies have shown that zzso is zzso and associated with mean zzso density in, the tissue samples of patients with gastric zzso In the present study, we aimed to further determine and provide evidence for the role of zzso in zzso zzso by diminishing zzso expression in gastric cancer cells using the small interference zzso method, and then evaluate the effects of zzso on gastric zzso zzso by in zzso and in zzso zzso Our results revealed that reduced zzso production by gastric cancer cells would reduce the zzso migration, and tube formation of human zzso vein zzso cells, and lead to a lower zzso density, zzso zzso in transplanted tumors of zzso These data confirm the positive role of zzso in zzso zzso
