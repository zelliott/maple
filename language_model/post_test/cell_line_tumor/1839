The zzso interacting protein zzso and the zzso zzso with coiled zzso zzso and zzso repeats zzso belong to zzso regulators of the zzso apparatus, but their role in zzso and progression of zzso cell lung zzso zzso is not zzso Previous studies demonstrated that zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso of zzso from the zzso into the zzso Here, we report for the first time that the expression of zzso and zzso genes is zzso on the level of both zzso and protein in zzso cells and zzso In particular, the expression of zzso protein was zzso decreased and the expression of zzso zzso and protein was frequently zzso in zzso zzso of different zzso zzso Moreover, stage zzso zzso zzso showed significantly lower expression of zzso zzso compared to higher stage zzso The weak increase of both zzso and zzso zzso levels in the zzso zzso cells indicates that mechanisms other than DNA zzso are involved in the regulation of zzso and zzso gene expression in these cancer zzso Taken together, the zzso of zzso and zzso expression suggests that the threshold to activate the zzso apparatus may be decreased in zzso cells due to the lack of zzso suppression and zzso zzso nuclear zzso Moreover, the loss of zzso zzso nuclear zzso may zzso the failure of DNA damage checkpoint zzso in zzso cells leading to their zzso zzso
