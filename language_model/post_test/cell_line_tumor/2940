The purpose of this study was to examine whether a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could be an effective imaging probe for zzso melanoma zzso 

zzso was prepared and zzso by zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso The zzso and zzso of zzso were examined in zzso melanoma zzso The zzso of zzso was determined in zzso pulmonary zzso zzso and normal zzso zzso Pulmonary zzso melanoma imaging was performed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso as an imaging probe and compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was readily prepared with greater than zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed rapid zzso and extended zzso in zzso zzso zzso exhibited significantly ( zzso higher zzso zzso at 2 h zzso and zzso at 4 h zzso in zzso zzso lung than that in normal lung zzso and zzso at 2 and 4 h zzso zzso The activity zzso in normal zzso was low zzso except for the zzso 2 and 4 h zzso zzso pulmonary melanoma zzso were clearly zzso with zzso 2 h zzso rather than with zzso 1 h zzso 

zzso exhibited favorable zzso zzso and zzso properties, highlighting its potential as an effective imaging probe for zzso melanoma zzso
