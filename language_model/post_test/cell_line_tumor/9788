The thorns of zzso zzso have traditionally been used in the treatment of several diseases, which includes their use as zzso agents, but there has been no scientific evidence of this zzso zzso However, the present study has identified a novel mechanism for the zzso effect of zzso zzso thorns in the treatment of colon zzso Treatment with the ethanol extract of zzso zzso thorns zzso resulted in significant growth zzso together with zzso cell cycle arrest at a dose of 600 zzso zzso in zzso zzso In addition, treatment with zzso induced zzso expression and zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso treatment induced zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Among the pathways zzso only zzso zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso zzso Similarly, suppression of zzso function reversed zzso cell proliferation zzso and decreased cell cycle zzso In addition, tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was inhibited by zzso treatment via decreased zzso activity of both zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso Finally, zzso treatment significantly reduced tumor sizes in zzso zzso tumor zzso which was associated with the changed levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Overall, these results have identified a novel molecular mechanism for zzso in the treatment of colon cancer and might provide a theoretical basis for the potential therapeutic use of zzso in the treatment of zzso
