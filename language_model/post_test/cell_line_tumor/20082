zzso zzso zzso are an effective therapy in treating zzso zzso breast zzso Nonetheless, a significant percentage of patients either do not respond or become resistant to zzso zzso dependence on zzso and increased dependence on growth factor zzso signaling zzso particularly human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso have been implicated in zzso zzso However, the role of growth factor signaling remains zzso This current study investigates the possibility that signaling either through zzso alone or through interplay between zzso growth factor zzso 1 zzso and zzso mediates zzso resistance by increasing the tumor initiating cell zzso zzso in zzso cells via regulation of stem cell zzso such as breast cancer resistance protein zzso zzso and zzso are both known to be involved in drug zzso zzso from in zzso analyses of zzso versus zzso cells and zzso zzso cells, as well as from in zzso zzso tumors, indicate that zzso zzso cells zzso both zzso and zzso and exhibit increased zzso characteristics compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and/or zzso decrease zzso characteristics in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and its zzso partner zzso are involved in the regulation of zzso Overall, these results suggest that reducing or eliminating the zzso zzso with agents that target zzso zzso zzso and/or their downstream zzso pathways could be effective in preventing and/or treating acquired zzso zzso
