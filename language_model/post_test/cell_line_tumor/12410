To study the influence of vaccine of zzso fusion gene zzso on zzso zzso tumor cells in mice, zzso mice were zzso with zzso zzso zzso respectively, then zzso cells expressing the zzso of zzso fusion gene were zzso zzso into the groin of zzso mice in order to observe the effect of vaccine on growth of zzso zzso tumor zzso The results showed that there were distinct differences on the time of tumor growth, the time of tumor zzso tumor volume and survival time of mice bearing tumor between two zzso groups and two control groups zzso and vacant zzso zzso The mice zzso with zzso lived longer as compared to mice zzso with zzso The tissue of zzso tumor was more zzso tumor organ was larger, tumor form was irregular in 2 control groups, while the tissue of zzso tumor was zzso tumor volume was smaller, and with mass inflammatory zzso in two zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso tumor cells were found in the zzso of control groups, but not observed in two zzso zzso It is concluded that the protection occurred in zzso mice which inhibited the growth of zzso tumor cell in zzso
