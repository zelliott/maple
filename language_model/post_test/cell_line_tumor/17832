Despite a high initial response rate to zzso zzso chemotherapy, most women with zzso zzso cancer zzso with zzso disease that becomes zzso to further zzso zzso We have previously shown that the zzso zzso zzso zzso a regulator of DNA damage responses, is amplified and zzso in zzso zzso zzso Given that DNA damage pathways are linked to platinum resistance, the aim of this study was to determine if zzso expression was associated with disease recurrence and platinum sensitivity in zzso zzso zzso High nuclear zzso zzso as determined by zzso in a cohort of 151 women with zzso zzso zzso was associated with an approximately zzso increased risk of disease recurrence and death in patients who initially responded to zzso chemotherapy, independently of disease stage and zzso zzso Although zzso expression was not directly correlated with relative zzso sensitivity of zzso cancer cell lines, sensitivity to zzso was partially restored in zzso zzso zzso cancer cells following zzso zzso of zzso zzso These results identify zzso as a new independent zzso marker for outcome in zzso zzso cancer, and suggest that pathways involving zzso including DNA damage responses, may represent new therapeutic targets for zzso zzso zzso
