zzso zzso plays a major role in numerous neurodegenerative disorders, such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's zzso zzso inclusions containing zzso zzso have been reported in Alzheimer's and Parkinson's affected zzso Moreover, a zzso zzso of zzso the so-called zzso component of Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso was found to be an integral part of Alzheimer's zzso related zzso Despite the extensive research on this topic, the exact toxic mechanism of zzso remains zzso We have taken the advantage of an zzso zzso zzso cell line and investigated the effects of classical zzso factors zzso zzso zzso B and zzso zzso and zzso zzso peptides on cell viability compared to wild type zzso zzso It was found that zzso zzso cells are more sensitive to zzso peptides treatment than normal expressing zzso In contrast, cells containing elevated amount of zzso were less vulnerable to classical zzso zzso than wild type zzso In addition, zzso zzso is accompanied by altered zzso attenuated proliferation zzso increased zzso zzso and decreased cell zzso Based on these results, the zzso zzso cell lines may represent a good and effective in zzso model for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's zzso
