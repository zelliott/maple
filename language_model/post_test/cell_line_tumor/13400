To determine the signaling pathways leading from Met zzso to zzso and poor zzso we measured the kinetic gene zzso in breast cancer cell lines in response to zzso Using a network zzso tool we analyzed the putative zzso interaction pathways leading from Met to these genes and studied their specificity to Met and zzso zzso We identified a Met kinetic signature consisting of 131 zzso The signature zzso with Met zzso and with response to zzso therapy ( zzso in zzso zzso It also identifies breast cancer patients who are at high risk to develop an aggressive disease in six large published breast cancer patient zzso ( zzso zzso Moreover, we have identified novel putative Met zzso which correlate with Met activity and patient zzso This signature may facilitate personalized therapy by identifying patients who will respond to zzso zzso Moreover, this novel approach may be applied for other zzso zzso and other zzso
