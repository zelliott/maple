zzso zzso zzso is the most common type of primary brain tumor and a highly zzso and zzso zzso Current conventional therapies fail to eradicate or curb zzso cell zzso zzso exploring the cellular and molecular basis of zzso cell growth is vital to develop novel therapeutic zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso expressed by zzso zzso and is strongly linked to cell proliferation in the normal zzso By using zzso as a zzso we identify a zzso cell population zzso zzso zzso with robust zzso zzso and zzso zzso We show that a significant proportion zzso zzso of cells zzso in the tumor mass express zzso and that over 50% of zzso zzso cells are zzso Compared with the zzso zzso cells from the same zzso the zzso of zzso cells zzso genes associated with aggressive zzso including zzso of zzso and Cell zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which have been previously shown to correlate with poor survival in zzso We also show that the zzso pattern of zzso with other zzso zzso markers in zzso does not zzso that described in the normal zzso The expression of zzso by such an aggressive and actively cycling zzso population combined with its location on the cell surface identifies this cell population as a potential therapeutic target in a subset of patients with zzso
