G zzso zzso 30 zzso has previously been described to be important in zzso growth and to inhibit cell zzso Here we investigated whether the effect of zzso on cell growth is dependent on steroid hormone zzso We zzso introduced zzso in immortalized normal zzso zzso zzso cells using zzso for gene zzso zzso inhibited the growth and proliferation of the zzso They expressed zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso factor 2 zzso analyzed using quantitative zzso analysis, and also diminished the expression of zzso at protein level analyzed by Western zzso using nuclear extracts from zzso zzso zzso When zzso cells were zzso zzso with the zzso response element zzso reporter zzso stable expression of zzso resulted in the abolition of zzso zzso of the zzso In zzso cells, transient zzso of zzso with zzso zzso alpha resulted in an zzso of the zzso and zzso reporter activities induced by zzso The results suggest a novel mechanism by which zzso signaling interferes with steroid zzso
