The zzso of the zzso growth factor 1 zzso gene generates three zzso zzso namely zzso zzso and zzso (or zzso zzso growth zzso zzso we analyzed the expression of IGF-1 zzso in zzso and zzso zzso (red zzso and zzso zzso of women with zzso and we characterized the actions of a synthetic zzso zzso on zzso zzso Our data documented that all three zzso gene transcripts are expressed in the zzso cells of the zzso and zzso zzso however, zzso zzso contained significantly lower IGF-1 zzso zzso both at the zzso and protein level, as was shown using zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the zzso cells of the zzso zzso did not express any of the IGF-1 zzso however, the zzso cells of the zzso zzso (red zzso did express the zzso at zzso and protein zzso Furthermore, synthetic zzso zzso which comprised the last 24 zzso acids of the zzso zzso the growth of the zzso zzso Experimental zzso of the type 1 zzso zzso zzso and insulin zzso expression of zzso cells zzso zzso zzso did not alter the zzso action of the synthetic zzso zzso revealing that zzso zzso stimulates the growth of zzso cells via an zzso and insulin zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso transcript might zzso apart from mature IGF-1 zzso another zzso zzso product that may have an important role in zzso zzso
