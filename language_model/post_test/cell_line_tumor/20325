zzso an zzso zzso zzso that has a structurally divergent zzso pocket, zzso action model, and unique characteristic of short life zzso complete resistance to the zzso zzso zzso zzso we used S1, previously identified as a zzso dual inhibitor and a pure zzso zzso to explore the mechanism of zzso action and supply a strategy to challenge zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cells demonstrated that zzso can effectively challenge zzso zzso zzso zzso we discovered an unexpected dynamic change of zzso that directly zzso with resistance or commitment to zzso induced by both zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso increase results from zzso trafficking from zzso to zzso while subsequent zzso released by zzso determines zzso decrease and full-blown zzso Further experiments using zzso zzso testified that zzso accounts for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells are sensitive to S1, whereas zzso zzso cells are significantly more zzso The in zzso model could be extended to an in zzso mouse zzso model in which zzso zzso resistance by increased protein level, and the release of zzso could serve as a zzso of zzso
