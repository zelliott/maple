zzso and initial characterization of zzso drugs are typically performed using zzso cultures of tumor zzso It is well established that such zzso cultures do not represent the characteristics of zzso solid zzso The zzso tumor zzso model is of intermediate complexity between in zzso tumors and in zzso zzso cultures and would be more suitable for drug zzso The authors describe a procedure in which zzso zzso are used to screen for compounds that induce tumor cell zzso zzso zzso were generated in zzso plates, and zzso was determined using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso factor of approximately zzso was observed for zzso colon zzso zzso using zzso to induce zzso This procedure is attractive for secondary screening of hits from larger zzso zzso
