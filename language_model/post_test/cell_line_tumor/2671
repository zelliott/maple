zzso zzso play pivotal roles in controlling cell proliferation and zzso zzso zzso expression in human is becoming recognized as a new molecular mechanism of zzso However, the causes for zzso in zzso expression remain largely zzso zzso with zzso human zzso types 16 zzso and 18 zzso can lead to cervical and other zzso zzso Here, we have demonstrated that cervical cancer zzso and cervical zzso cell lines containing zzso zzso display reduced expression of zzso zzso The reduction of zzso expression in zzso zzso derived from zzso primary human zzso zzso with the early productive phase and is attributed to the expression of viral zzso which zzso the tumor zzso zzso a known zzso zzso zzso of viral E6 expression in zzso and zzso cervical cancer cell lines by zzso leads to an increased expression of zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso in zzso phase zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso cells results in a substantial induction of cell growth zzso and a moderate cell zzso Together, this is the first time a viral zzso has been shown to regulate cellular zzso zzso Our data have provided new insights into mechanisms by which high-risk zzso contribute to the development of cervical zzso
