The zzso signaling zzso is functionally zzso in zzso zzso and zzso and its proposed function is to control tissue zzso by regulating cell proliferation and zzso The core components are composed of a zzso cascade that culminates with the zzso and zzso of zzso protein 1 zzso zzso is retained in the zzso In the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso to the nucleus, associates with zzso zzso and functions as a zzso factor promoting the expression of key target zzso zzso of the zzso zzso are zzso in human zzso and deregulation of this zzso plays a role in zzso Loss of the zzso tumor zzso gene is the most common genetic zzso in zzso and the zzso gene product, zzso acts upstream of the zzso zzso Here, we show that primary zzso tumors have high nuclear expression of zzso In zzso cells, zzso expression is associated with zzso of zzso Using an zzso transient zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells, we show that suppression of zzso impaired cell proliferation and zzso zzso zzso zzso led to a strong augment of cell proliferation and zzso growth and restriction of zzso zzso In addition, expression of zzso in zzso zzso cells led to the development of tumors in nude zzso Together, these findings suggest that in zzso deregulation of the zzso zzso is largely observed in primary tumors and that zzso functions as an zzso promoting zzso zzso
