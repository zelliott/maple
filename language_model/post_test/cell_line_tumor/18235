zzso zzso zzso an analog of zzso induced characteristic changes of zzso in human zzso zzso zzso zzso It was reported that zzso zzso an active ingredient of zzso ameliorated learning deficits in aged zzso The present study was aimed to investigate whether zzso zzso can delay the premature zzso of zzso cells induced by zzso and to explore the underlying molecular zzso First, zzso zzso markedly reversed zzso zzso changes in zzso cells induced by zzso Second, zzso treatment alone resulted in an increase in the protein levels of zzso and zzso and a decline in zzso zzso zzso zzso level and zzso complex IV zzso zzso zzso zzso had significant effects of attenuating these zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso has an zzso effect on zzso premature zzso in zzso zzso This effect may be zzso by regulating cell cycle proteins and enhancing zzso zzso
