Cancer stem cells zzso possess the ability for zzso zzso and zzso and play a role in cancer recurrence and zzso zzso are usually sorted in analysis into side population zzso cells using ultraviolet zzso laser zzso zzso zzso they cannot be stained with zzso zzso because of their zzso zzso However, it is difficult to avoid cell damage using a zzso zzso zzso we attempted to isolate zzso using a violet laser zzso zzso zzso to avoid cellular DNA zzso We sorted SP cells and main population zzso cells from a human zzso cancer cell line using the zzso system equipped with a violet laser and analyzed the biological properties of these zzso SP cells exhibited drug zzso zzso differentiation abilities, and zzso It was found that zzso Kirsten rat zzso viral zzso zzso zzso expression was significantly higher in SP cells than in zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso exist in the SP fraction sorted using the zzso system equipped with a violet laser, which presents a useful tool to isolate small populations of viable putative zzso from solid tumors and can be used to identify and characterize zzso
