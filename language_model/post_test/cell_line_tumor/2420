zzso zzso cancer zzso is the leading cause of zzso cancer death in the United zzso zzso is a DNA damaging agent initially effective against zzso but limited by zzso zzso plays a critical role in cellular response to DNA damage and has been implicated in zzso response to platinum zzso In this study, we examined the role of zzso status in zzso response to a novel combination of zzso sodium zzso and zzso Human zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso zzso sodium zzso at zzso or zzso for 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 432 and zzso cells to zzso zzso small interfering zzso zzso zzso zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso a critical DNA damage recognition protein in global zzso repair pathway, was induced by zzso only in zzso zzso zzso zzso with sodium zzso zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso suggesting that sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is a mechanism by which zzso zzso cells are zzso to zzso zzso zzso sodium zzso enhanced cellular and DNA zzso of platinum in zzso zzso zzso Only zzso enhanced platinum zzso in zzso zzso In conclusion, sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso by suppressing DNA repair protein zzso and increasing cellular and DNA platinum zzso
