Recent studies have demonstrated that the majority of zzso zzso type 1 zzso receptors do not reach the cell surface but are instead associated with zzso and zzso zzso Using calcium imaging and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, we provide evidence that zzso acting on zzso receptors increases zzso calcium concentration when administered zzso but not zzso The zzso effect of zzso zzso was zzso and abolished by zzso with zzso a zzso zzso zzso The zzso calcium increase was reduced by blocking zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso calcium release and abolished when both zzso and zzso zzso calcium release pathways were zzso Taken together, our results indicate that, in zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso receptors are zzso they are located in zzso calcium stores zzso zzso of zzso zzso receptors releases calcium from zzso zzso and zzso calcium zzso In addition, our results support a novel role for zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso calcium zzso
