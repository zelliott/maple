To test the zzso effect of zzso zzso generated from the zzso zzso of bacteria zzso zzso gene on zzso zzso zzso 

zzso gene was liberated from zzso and zzso into shuttle zzso which formed the zzso of zzso The zzso zzso was then zzso with zzso I and zzso into zzso bacterial cells with zzso zzso DNA zzso of zzso The zzso zzso zzso DNA was zzso with zzso I and zzso to the zzso cells to package the zzso zzso zzso The infection rate of the zzso zzso the target gene expression in the zzso cells, the survival rate of the zzso treated zzso zzso cell zzso infected with zzso zzso and the bystander effect were zzso 

The zzso of zzso Ad was 2 zzso zzso zzso More than zzso of the zzso cells were infected when the zzso reached zzso Target gene expression was detected in the infected zzso The zzso cells infected with zzso were very sensitive to the zzso zzso with zzso less than zzso zzso zzso bystander effect was zzso 

The constructed zzso virus can efficiently zzso the zzso zzso cells and enable the zzso cells to express the zzso zzso The bystander effect has improved the zzso effect of the zzso zzso which makes the clinical application zzso
