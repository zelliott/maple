zzso in the zzso gene are responsible for the majority of zzso zzso zzso The functional significance of many zzso zzso identified during the screening of high-risk individuals is difficult to predict due to the lack of in zzso functional tests zzso sequence zzso with a risk of cancer zzso zzso interference is a promising tool in analyzing functional properties of zzso zzso Here we designed and functionally analyzed zzso directed to zzso of zzso zzso that may be used to zzso expression of zzso zzso Using zzso infection, we achieved long-term zzso of zzso in a zzso specific zzso We propose that zzso zzso coupled with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso may constitute a versatile system for the functional analysis of zzso gene zzso
