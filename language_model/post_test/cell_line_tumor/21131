zzso T zzso and natural killer cells zzso induce cell death in leukemia cells by the zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Resistance to zzso may be involved in immune evasion of leukemia zzso The delivery of active zzso into the zzso is dependent on the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso We developed a rapid method for the isolation of zzso to investigate zzso cell death in primary leukemia zzso We isolated zzso containing zzso zzso complexes and zzso by zzso free zzso zzso of the human zzso cell leukemia line zzso The zzso induce zzso zzso zzso in live zzso The human leukemia cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso treated with zzso zzso zzso and underwent cell zzso In primary leukemia cells analyzed ex zzso we found zzso leukemia cells in three out of seven patients with acute zzso leukemia and one out of six patients with acute zzso zzso We conclude that our method is fast zzso 1 zzso and yields active zzso that induce zzso cell zzso Furthermore, resistance to zzso can be observed in acute zzso and may be an important mechanism contributing to leukemia cell immune zzso
