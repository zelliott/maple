The zzso zzso zzso important for maintaining tissue zzso is zzso expressed in zzso tumors and additionally plays a crucial role in zzso We zzso that breast cancer cells zzso deposit zzso that supports unique patterns of vascular zzso of zzso cells zzso zzso of zzso expression revealed that a zzso cell line zzso a zzso cell line zzso and a zzso cell line zzso express zzso I and IV, zzso and zzso with zzso limited to zzso and zzso The amount of zzso deposited by zzso was found to be higher in zzso compared with zzso and zzso with all zzso differing in their gross structure but similar in mean fiber zzso Nonetheless, deposition of zzso from zzso lines was overall difficult to detect and insufficient to support zzso structure zzso formation of zzso zzso a zzso approach was undertaken in which individual zzso lines were zzso with zzso Variation in abundance of deposited zzso deposition of zzso zzso such as absent collagen I deposition from zzso zzso and zzso organization was zzso zzso zzso from zzso and each zzso supported rapid CLS formation of zzso zzso of zzso properties revealed that CLS grown on zzso deposited from zzso zzso possessed significantly larger zzso zzso occupied the greatest percentage of area, expressed the highest levels of von zzso factor, and expressed the greatest amount of zzso which was zzso independent of exposure to zzso To our knowledge, this is the first study to report tumor cell zzso differences in vascular zzso features, and thus offers the framework for future investigations interrogating the role of the tumor zzso in supporting vascular zzso
