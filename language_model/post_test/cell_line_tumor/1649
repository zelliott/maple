Although primary and established human zzso cell lines have been evaluated for zzso C virus zzso infection in zzso thus far only zzso cells have been found to be highly zzso for infectious zzso Since our understanding of the zzso zzso would benefit from the identification of additional zzso cell lines, we assembled a panel of zzso and zzso cell lines and assessed their ability to support zzso zzso Here we show infection of the human zzso cell lines zzso and zzso with cell zzso zzso zzso albeit to lower levels than that achieved in zzso zzso To better understand the reduced zzso of zzso and zzso cells for zzso infection, we performed studies to evaluate the ability of each cell line to support specific steps of the viral zzso zzso entry, zzso zzso and zzso 

We found that while the early events in zzso infection zzso entry plus replication zzso are zzso equivalent or only marginally reduced in zzso and zzso cells, later steps of the viral life cycle such as zzso zzso de zzso virus production and/or spread are impaired to different degrees in zzso and zzso cultures compared to zzso cell zzso Interestingly, we also observed that zzso zzso gene zzso zzso expression was significantly and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells following viral zzso 

We conclude that the restrictions observed later during zzso infection in these cell lines could in part be attributed to zzso innate zzso Nevertheless, the identification of two new cell lines capable of supporting authentic zzso infection, even at reduced levels, expands the current repertoire of cell lines zzso for the study of zzso in zzso and should aid in further zzso zzso biology and the cellular zzso that zzso zzso zzso
