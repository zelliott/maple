The aims of this study were to investigate zzso function in normal and Barrett's zzso zzso zzso cells zzso by laser capture zzso and to evaluate the effect of zzso zzso in cancer cells in zzso and in zzso 

zzso cells were zzso from surgically zzso zzso zzso activity was measured by modified zzso repeat amplification protocol and zzso length was determined by real-time zzso zzso To evaluate the effect of zzso zzso zzso cell lines were continuously treated with a specific zzso inhibitor zzso and live cell number was determined zzso zzso was evaluated by zzso labeling and zzso by zzso zzso For in zzso studies, severe combined zzso mice were zzso zzso with zzso cells and following appearance of palpable tumors, injected zzso with saline or zzso 

zzso activity was significantly elevated whereas zzso were shorter in zzso cells relative to normal zzso zzso zzso The treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso led to loss of zzso activity, reduction in zzso zzso and growth arrest through induction of both the zzso and zzso zzso cell death could also be expedited by addition of the zzso agents zzso and zzso Finally, the treatment with zzso led to a significant reduction in tumor volume in a subcutaneous tumor zzso 

We show that zzso activity is significantly elevated whereas zzso are shorter in zzso and suppression of zzso zzso proliferation of zzso cells both in zzso and in zzso
