Sox factors function as either zzso or zzso of zzso zzso depending on the cellular context and associated interacting zzso Our previous study provided evidence that zzso in zzso signaling is an essential event during zzso toward the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we focused on related functional roles of Sox zzso Of eight Sox factors investigated, zzso could enhance zzso transcription, through zzso of zzso at the zzso level, without any direct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed significant decreases in proliferation rate, along with increases in expression of zzso as well as zzso in contrast to increased cell growth observed with zzso Of these factors, only zzso could zzso zzso zzso zzso but it also resulted in not only zzso of zzso zzso of zzso transcription, but also repression of its own promoter activity, indicating the existence of very complex feedback loop for zzso signal zzso Finally, zzso zzso was frequently pronounced in zzso zzso of zzso zzso the expression being positively correlated with status of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso with cell zzso These data therefore suggest that zzso may serve as a positive regulator of zzso signaling through zzso in zzso expression during zzso differentiation of zzso zzso cells, leading to zzso of cell zzso In addition, zzso may also participate in the process, having complex roles in zzso of zzso
