A fundamental component for success in drug discovery is the ability to assemble and screen compounds that zzso a broad swath of biologically relevant zzso zzso Achieving this goal in a zzso setting requires access to a wide range of biologically diverse zzso For this reason, we introduced a zzso program in which citizen scientists furnish soil samples from which new microbial zzso are zzso zzso the strength of this approach, we obtained a unique zzso zzso zzso from a zzso zzso soil zzso zzso which exhibits a putative combination of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was identified as an inhibitor of zzso melanoma cells zzso zzso The zzso also exhibited efficacy in a zzso mouse zzso These results underscore the value of building cooperative relationships between research teams and citizen scientists to enrich drug discovery zzso
