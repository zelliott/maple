The aim of this study was to determine the zzso and zzso effects of zzso E zzso a zzso extracted from zzso zzso on human oral zzso cell zzso Based on preliminary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treated zzso cells demonstrated a zzso effect and inhibited cell proliferation in a time and dose dependent manner with an zzso value of zzso zzso within 24 h of zzso zzso was also found to have minimal zzso effects on the normal cell line, zzso with cell viability levels maintained above zzso upon zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA fragmentation zzso results showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso Western zzso results demonstrated that the induction of zzso by zzso appeared to be zzso through regulation of the zzso zzso zzso as there was an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso was also found to zzso the zzso zzso zzso while zzso the zzso zzso zzso suggesting the involvement of the intrinsic zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso and executioner zzso zzso were also observed following zzso exposure, hence indicating the involvement of zzso c zzso zzso These results demonstrate the zzso and zzso ability of zzso zzso and suggest its potential development as a cancer zzso zzso
