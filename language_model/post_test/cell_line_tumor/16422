Gene fusion is a common event in zzso The fusion zzso and protein products often play zzso roles in zzso and therefore represent ideal diagnostic and therapeutic zzso zzso fusion zzso products in cancer were thought to be produced solely by zzso zzso Here, we show that a zzso zzso zzso is generated in the absence of zzso zzso We showed that it is not a product of zzso zzso but formed by zzso of adjacent zzso The binding of zzso factor zzso to the zzso sequences zzso zzso with the expression of the zzso zzso The zzso fusion, but not zzso zzso plays important roles in regulating cell growth in both zzso and zzso prostate cancer zzso The level of the zzso transcript zzso with disease zzso with the highest levels in prostate cancer zzso Our results suggest that gene zzso can arise from zzso of adjacent genes without corresponding DNA zzso 

With the absence of corresponding DNA zzso zzso fusion zzso transcript in prostate cancer cells is generated by zzso of adjacent zzso zzso instead of zzso zzso controls prostate cancer cell zzso and the zzso level zzso with prostate cancer disease zzso
