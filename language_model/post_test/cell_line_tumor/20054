zzso is the main strategy for the treatment of lung zzso However, sensitivity to chemotherapy, one of the main factors affecting the survival rate of patients with lung cancer, is extremely zzso zzso box zzso zzso is the key regulatory gene for the development and function of zzso regulatory T cells zzso Increased levels of zzso and zzso expression in the peripheral blood and zzso specimens of cancer patients are associated with zzso progression and poor zzso In addition, certain studies have suggested that zzso may be resistant to conventional chemotherapy and thus, enhance zzso immune zzso Previous studies have demonstrated that zzso is also expressed within zzso cells and that it may mimic the function of zzso Currently, the correlation between the zzso cell expression of zzso and sensitivity to chemotherapy is zzso zzso it was zzso that zzso causes resistance to zzso agents in lung cancer cells and that it may consequently promote the progression of lung zzso In the current study, the expression of zzso in mouse Lewis lung cancer zzso cells was detected using zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso which was accomplished by the transient zzso of zzso zzso or empty plasmids into LLC cells, was confirmed by zzso and western zzso zzso The zzso of cell proliferation was measured using zzso zzso The expression of zzso resistance zzso zzso zzso and its protein product, zzso zzso were detected by zzso and flow zzso zzso The results revealed that zzso was expressed by LLC zzso The zzso rate of cell proliferation in zzso LLC cells compared with those zzso with an empty zzso was significantly decreased following zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso values of zzso and zzso in zzso LLC cells were zzso The expression levels of zzso zzso and zzso were significantly zzso in zzso zzso LLC zzso These results suggest that zzso reduces the sensitivity of LLC cells to zzso and zzso thus promoting zzso zzso by zzso the expression of zzso zzso and zzso
