The zzso zzso zzso and its downstream signaling are implicated in lung cancer zzso zzso much effort was spent in developing specific zzso zzso zzso zzso that bind to the zzso zzso blocking zzso zzso Clinical use of zzso is effective in a subset of lung zzso with zzso in the zzso zzso domain, rendering the zzso highly susceptible to zzso However, these benefits are zzso and emergence of additional zzso zzso usually results in zzso resistance and disease zzso Previously, we showed one mechanism linking cigarette smoke to zzso lung zzso Specifically, exposure of lung zzso cells to cigarette zzso zzso stress stimulates zzso zzso zzso with impaired zzso zzso The abnormal stabilization of the activated zzso leads to uncontrolled cell growth and zzso Here, we describe for the first time a novel zzso mechanism of zzso resistance to zzso Exposure of airway zzso cells to cigarette smoke causes zzso zzso of zzso resulting in a zzso that is different from that induced by the zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso cigarette zzso zzso binds zzso and zzso and does not undergo zzso zzso zzso the cigarette zzso zzso is not inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso in fact, the cigarette smoke exposure zzso zzso even in the zzso zzso zzso Our findings show that cigarette smoke exposure stimulates not only zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation, but also zzso a different zzso zzso and signaling that are resistant to zzso Together, these findings offer new insights into cigarette zzso lung cancer development and zzso zzso
