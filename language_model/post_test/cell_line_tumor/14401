Several zzso protein zzso zzso zzso are cell zzso molecules involved in zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso signaling is coupled to cell contact zzso However, little is known about the mechanisms by which cell density regulates zzso zzso We show that the zzso family zzso zzso is zzso by three zzso zzso zzso 10, and zzso Cell density promotes zzso zzso zzso and shedding of zzso This is followed by zzso zzso zzso of the remaining zzso part to release the zzso zzso portion zzso from the zzso thereby allowing its zzso to the zzso When cells were treated with zzso B, a nuclear export zzso zzso accumulated in nuclear zzso zzso is an active protein zzso zzso that binds to and zzso zzso an zzso zzso The expression of zzso suppresses zzso zzso activity, whereas the expression of zzso increases zzso zzso this increase required the zzso activity of zzso Thus, both zzso have acquired opposing roles in the regulation of zzso zzso We also found that zzso another zzso family member, zzso zzso zzso Our results identify zzso zzso as a regulatory switch in zzso signaling and zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso
