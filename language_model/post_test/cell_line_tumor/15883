Conventional genetic approaches have provided a powerful tool in the study of zzso However, these techniques often zzso selective manipulation of zzso and spatial protein functions, which is crucial for the investigation of dynamic cellular zzso To overcome these limitations, a small zzso novel technology termed zzso zzso zzso zzso has been developed, targeting proteins for degradation at the zzso zzso Despite the promising potential of zzso to serve as molecular zzso of complex signaling zzso their design has not been generalized for broad zzso Here, we present the first generalized approach for zzso design by zzso the distance between the two participating partner zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the target zzso As such, we took a chemical approach to create zzso zzso zzso targeting zzso with varying zzso lengths and the loss of the zzso in cultured cells was monitored via western zzso and zzso zzso We found a significant effect of chain length on zzso zzso and, in this case, the optimum distance between the zzso recognition motif and the zzso was a 16 atom chain zzso The information gathered from this experiment may offer a zzso zzso design strategy to further the expansion of the zzso zzso opening new possibilities for the broad application of the zzso strategy in the study of multiple signaling zzso
