To investigate the mechanism of zzso zzso cell death and cell cycle arrest using zzso gene zzso as well as the function of zzso zzso and genetic instability induced by zzso 

Cell cycle regulation, cell death and nuclear abnormalities induced by zzso were examined using an zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso or zzso genes in human zzso cell zzso 

The zzso zzso cell line was resistant to zzso compared with cell lines expressing intact zzso zzso zzso cells exposed to zzso became zzso and then zzso zzso was prevented in zzso cells zzso with the zzso zzso thus decreasing the death rate of these zzso 

These results imply that enforced zzso expression protects cells from zzso instability induced by zzso regardless of its upstream molecular zzso
