Although significant zzso were made in the field of molecular biology of zzso cerebral zzso the zzso of these tumors continues to be zzso One of the therapeutic failure reasons is the incomplete knowledge regarding the origin of these tumors and cells features, which in fact represent an obstacle in developing a cell and molecular therapy guided against zzso cells responsible for the tumor development and for the therapeutic zzso zzso and characterization of zzso cell lines represents an essential step in order to obtain a better in zzso and in zzso experimental model for zzso We describe here a new zzso line, named zzso which was successfully isolated in our laboratories starting with a tumor sample obtained zzso from a 58 zzso female zzso The zzso evaluation showed a grad IV WHO zzso zzso The sample was prepared by manual zzso followed by zzso zzso using different concentration of zzso The cell line has been cultivated for more than 150 zzso The characterization of the zzso line consisted in the evaluation of cells proliferation capacity zzso zzso zzso features, zzso and identification of specific zzso We found that zzso expressed specific markers for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso CD zzso zzso were negative for zzso lineage markers like zzso and zzso In order to evaluate the differentiation grade of zzso cell line, the presence of stem cell markers zzso zzso was zzso zzso cells expressed higher level of zzso and lower level of zzso comparing with standard zzso cell line zzso zzso cell line expressed zzso and zzso but not zzso and zzso and zzso This new line has distinct and unique characteristics when compared with standard zzso cell line zzso zzso and may become a new and useful in zzso model for zzso
