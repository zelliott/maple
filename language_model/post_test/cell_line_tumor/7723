There are contradictory results from studies on the effect of zzso a plant zzso compound with a well-established zzso effect in zzso on the action of zzso in cancer zzso 

The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of zzso on the zzso and zzso action of zzso in the zzso cell line derived from zzso rat acute zzso leukemia zzso 

The zzso cells were treated with different doses of zzso for zzso hours followed by application of zzso The amount of DNA damage was estimated via a comet zzso zzso cell cycle and zzso were examined by using flow zzso zzso 

The combined effect of zzso and zzso on viability was synergistic at low zzso zzso zzso In comparison to treatment with zzso and zzso alone, zzso with these compounds increased the extent of DNA damage, the percentage of cells arrested in the zzso phase and the number of zzso zzso 

The interaction between zzso and zzso points to an enhanced zzso potential to be derived from the combination of these zzso
