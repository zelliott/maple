Strategies to inhibit zzso have been mainly unsuccessful in part due to insufficient zzso zzso Here, we report evidence of critical role for the zzso protein 2 zzso in zzso zzso In mice, zzso has been implicated in inflammatory zzso but it has not been studied in human zzso In patients with lung cancer, elevated levels of zzso expression in tumor cells within the primary tumor were associated with a reduction in the period of zzso survival after surgical zzso zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso zzso in aggressive tumor cells promoted increased zzso zzso Most notably, tumor zzso zzso increased in zzso zzso and invasion in an zzso manner, zzso an aggressive zzso tumor zzso In zzso mouse models, tumor zzso zzso accelerated zzso and shortened survival whereas attenuating zzso expression in tumor zzso zzso and extended zzso Overall, our findings showed that tumor zzso zzso drives zzso and provided an initial proof of concept for blockade of its action as a strategy to antagonize the zzso zzso
