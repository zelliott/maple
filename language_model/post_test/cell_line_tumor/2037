The role of zzso of the zzso protein zzso in the pathological processes of several neurodegenerative diseases is becoming better zzso zzso development of new compounds capable of preventing zzso zzso is an increasingly hot zzso For this reason, dependable in zzso and in zzso models that reflect zzso zzso in human diseases are zzso In this study, we generated and validated an in zzso model appropriate to test potential zzso and preventive compound effects on zzso zzso For this purpose, a zzso zzso zzso cell line was constructed zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso of expression levels and zzso zzso status in zzso cells confirmed relevance to human zzso zzso the effect of different established zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso It was shown with several methods including zzso zzso and mass zzso that the zzso pattern of zzso in zzso cells can be reliably modulated by these compounds, specifically targeting zzso zzso zzso and zzso These four protein zzso are known to be involved in in zzso zzso zzso and are therefore authentic indicators for the suitability of this new cell culture model for zzso
