The aim of the present study was to evaluate the role of zzso receptors zzso in the outcome of a zzso cell zzso cancer vaccine in the zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that unlike the zzso expressed on zzso loaded zzso zzso expressed in the site of zzso zzso may influence the efficacy of the zzso zzso zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso along with the zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the local innate zzso response in zzso zzso When the adoptive transfer of immature zzso loaded with zzso followed this skin zzso the zzso response was increased and tumor growth was significantly zzso Surprisingly, when zzso mature zzso were used, the effect of the skin zzso was the opposite and tumor growth was similar to that observed in control, zzso zzso The extent of the zzso response on transfer of immature or mature zzso was zzso by a different migration in the draining zzso zzso and by a distinct recruitment of zzso zzso that resulted in a zzso of the zzso zzso T zzso zzso The unexpected zzso effect exerted by mature zzso on skin zzso was apparently zzso by the expression of a distinctive pattern of zzso and of the zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso in draining zzso zzso In conclusion, we found that zzso zzso along with zzso zzso zzso at the site of cancer vaccination may either enhance the resulting zzso response or be zzso in dependence of the maturation state of the transferred zzso
