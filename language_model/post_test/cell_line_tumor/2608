zzso zzso and zzso zzso were deposited on zzso zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso metallic targets in zzso zzso The zzso were analyzed for zzso and phase compositions, zzso structure, zzso residual stress, zzso friction performance, zzso resistance and cell zzso For all the films, only simple zzso solid solutions with zzso preferred zzso were found, with zzso sizes in the range zzso The zzso were subjected to zzso stress, with values ranging from zzso to zzso The zzso coating with the highest carbon content zzso zzso exhibited the highest zzso of about 31 zzso the best friction behavior zzso zzso zzso and the highest wear resistance zzso rate zzso when testing in simulated body zzso zzso Cell viability tests proved that the zzso cells were adherent to the coated zzso and a very high percentage of live cells were observed on sample surfaces, after zzso incubation zzso
