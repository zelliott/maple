zzso zzso are a group of molecules with promising zzso potential, although their precise molecular target remains zzso The current work aims to investigate the zzso and associated mechanisms of zzso in breast cancer cells in zzso 

Effect of zzso on cell cycle distribution, zzso and key regulatory proteins were analyzed in three breast cancer cells in zzso Growth zzso new DNA zzso colony formation zzso and Western zzso analysis were performed to assess the zzso zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso was performed to study the interaction between zzso and zzso 

We have demonstrated the ability of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso to exhibit cell cycle arrest at zzso phase by zzso of zzso D1 through zzso zzso Further, to identify the upstream target of zzso potential zzso zzso activity of zzso and three structurally related zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso acid and zzso was zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso limit zzso zzso breast cancer proliferation through sustained zzso of zzso and its downstream zzso zzso and zzso D1 in breast cancer zzso We also show zzso zzso to bind at the zzso binding pocket of zzso zzso domain of zzso leading to the hypothesis that zzso zzso could be a novel class of zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso inhibit zzso zzso through binding with zzso zzso domain thereby suppressing breast cancer zzso 

zzso zzso may serve as a potential platform for development of novel drugs against breast zzso
