It is well known that the zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in immune cells and zzso an zzso immune zzso zzso this conventional zzso this study reveals a much higher level of zzso expression in multiple types of zzso tumor cells when compared with normal zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso tumor cells suppresses zzso in zzso and zzso tumor growth in zzso Different from the role of zzso in immune cells, the zzso activity of zzso in zzso tumor cells is independent of zzso signaling but is mainly dependent on natural killer zzso cell zzso zzso of either the zzso zzso zzso gene 3 or the zzso zzso zzso in the host animals had no effect on tumor growth zzso induced by zzso expression in tumor zzso zzso of zzso in zzso tumor cells enhances zzso cell zzso activity against tumor cells, whereas the absence of functional zzso cells zzso the zzso zzso of zzso tumor zzso The underlying mechanism by which zzso expression in tumor cells enhances zzso zzso activity is dependent on zzso of zzso zzso zzso Our results reveal an zzso function of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso surveillance via a zzso zzso
