zzso zzso is the primary zzso of zzso zzso These functions are expanded by three branch structures, including core 2, core 4, and blood group I, which are zzso by core 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene expression is expected to have a profound effect on zzso functions, which prompted us to study the regulation of this zzso zzso real-time zzso analysis of the expression of this gene in 24 human zzso and airway zzso cells showed that this gene was expressed primarily in zzso zzso zzso Rapid amplification of zzso ends analysis, coupled with sequence alignment with human zzso database, revealed that this gene was comprised of three zzso and two zzso Northern zzso using zzso 1 probe showed the presence of this zzso in all zzso suggesting the presence of zzso elements in the zzso region upstream of and/or near the zzso initiation site zzso Analysis of this DNA region zzso by a zzso transient zzso zzso coupled with serial deletion and zzso scanning zzso revealed two positive regulatory regions, including zzso and zzso Further, the promoter activity was enhanced by zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso Thus, the promoter region is specific to zzso gene and subject to regulation by zzso and zzso These zzso elements may be useful for construction of a zzso zzso zzso for therapy of zzso zzso zzso
