There has been increasing interest in the potential applications of gold zzso complexes as zzso drugs with higher zzso and fewer side effects than existing metal zzso zzso Our previous findings demonstrated that gold zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso in a cancer cell line zzso In this study, we identified zzso expressed proteins related to the drug's zzso action by comparing the protein zzso induced by gold zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Several clusters of altered proteins were identified, including cellular structure and stress-related zzso zzso proteins involved in zzso oxygen species and zzso zzso translation factors, proteins that mediate cell proliferation or zzso and proteins participating in the internal degradation zzso Our results indicated that multiple factors leading to zzso were involved in drug zzso in zzso zzso The balance between zzso and zzso signals determined the final fate of cancer zzso
