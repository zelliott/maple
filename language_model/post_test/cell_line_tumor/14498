The emergence of zzso zzso and the increased discovery of natural compounds have led to the production of expansive libraries of drug candidates and vast numbers of compounds with potentially interesting biological zzso Despite broad interest in high zzso screening zzso across varied fields of biological research, there has not been an increase in accessible zzso zzso Here, we present a simple zzso sandwich system suitable for screening chemical libraries in zzso zzso at the zzso The zzso platform delivers chemical compounds to isolated cell cultures by zzso zzso arrayed posts with zzso zzso In this way, an array of sealed zzso zzso was generated without zzso between zzso zzso After chemical exposure, cell viability was analyzed by zzso detection of cell viability zzso on a per zzso basis using a standard zzso zzso We demonstrate the efficacy of the system by generating four hits from zzso screens towards zzso human breast cancer zzso Three of the hits were identified in a zzso screen of a library of natural compounds in combination with zzso a zzso zzso A fourth hit, zzso was identified by screening the natural compound library in the absence of zzso The method developed here zzso existing zzso systems and enables the screening of a wide array of individual or zzso libraries in a zzso and zzso zzso We anticipate broad application of such a system as it is amenable to zzso drug screening in a simple, robust and portable zzso
