Breast zzso are highly zzso but can be grouped into zzso based on several criteria, including level of expression of certain zzso zzso breast cancer zzso is associated with early zzso and resistance to chemotherapy, while gene profiling indicates it is characterized by the expression of markers of zzso transition zzso - a zzso conversion linked with zzso Although the zzso program controlling the zzso and cellular plasticity of zzso remains zzso one contributor may be zzso of the zzso promoter, resulting in decreased zzso zzso a hallmark of zzso Indeed, reduced zzso often occurs in zzso and may contribute to the early zzso and poor patient survival associated with this zzso Here, we have determined that zzso of zzso zzso on zzso 9 zzso is critical for promoter DNA zzso of zzso in three zzso zzso model cell lines, as well as in zzso cell zzso Further, Snail zzso with zzso a major zzso zzso responsible for zzso and recruited zzso and DNA zzso to the zzso promoter for DNA zzso zzso of zzso restored zzso expression by suppressing zzso and blocking DNA zzso This resulted in zzso of cell migration and invasion in zzso and suppression of tumor growth and lung colonization in in zzso models of zzso zzso Our study not only reveals a critical mechanism underlying the zzso regulation of zzso but also zzso a way for the development of new treatment strategies for zzso
