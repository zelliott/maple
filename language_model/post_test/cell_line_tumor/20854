The objective of this study was to identify genes regulated by zzso hormone zzso and associated with tumor zzso The gene zzso zzso as previously identified by zzso zzso is known to be zzso by zzso treatment, and zzso zzso production occurs in zzso rats after administration of zzso zzso by using serial deletion of the promoter and zzso the zzso response element on the zzso promoter was localized to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was cooperative with zzso because zzso induction increased after zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso hormone zzso zzso cells was significantly increased by zzso treatment, perhaps due to zzso processing of zzso zzso and zzso In addition, zzso zzso either by stable zzso or zzso and/or zzso induction was evident in zzso zzso mice zzso with zzso zzso The zzso mice displayed a higher zzso index and tumor size than zzso zzso zzso the increased liver and lung tumor number or size in the zzso zzso zzso mice as well as zzso mice was attributed specifically to zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Furthermore, this study demonstrated that zzso zzso in some types of zzso zzso is zzso dependent and might play a crucial role in the development of zzso zzso Thus, zzso regulates zzso gene expression via a novel mechanism or in cooperation with zzso to enhance tumor zzso in zzso and in zzso
