The prognosis of zzso zzso remains largely unsatisfactory for the intrinsic characteristics of the pathology and for the delayed zzso zzso imaging based on PET and zzso may assess the dynamics of disease onset and progression allowing the validation of zzso models of zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was the characterization of a zzso rat model of zzso using combined in zzso imaging and zzso 

Four groups of Fischer rats were implanted in a zzso region with increasing concentration of rat zzso zzso cells and weekly monitored with zzso zzso and zzso starting one week after zzso Different targets were evaluated on post zzso brain specimens using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

Imaging results indicated that tumor onset but not progression was related to the number of zzso zzso zzso regions identified with zzso and zzso metabolism regions recognized with zzso were located respectively in the core and in external areas of the zzso with partial overlap and zzso during disease zzso zzso and zzso analysis confirmed zzso results and revealed that our model resumes biological characteristics of human zzso zzso and PET studies showed that zzso regions, defined on the basis of zzso zzso reduction, may include hypoxic clusters of vital tumor tissue identified with zzso This last information is particularly relevant for the identification of the target volume during zzso zzso 

In conclusion, the combined use of PET and zzso allows in zzso monitoring of the biological modification of zzso zzso during tumor zzso
