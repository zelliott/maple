zzso zzso zzso are emerging as a new family of zzso for drug and gene delivery into biological zzso To evaluate potential application of this technology for brain tumor therapy, we studied zzso and toxicity of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Within 24 h of a single zzso injection of labeled zzso (5 zzso nearly zzso of total cells demonstrated zzso zzso Most zzso zzso however, occurred by zzso zzso zzso which accounted for most zzso zzso zzso Within 24 h of injection, nearly zzso of tumor zzso became zzso Despite a transient increase in inflammatory cell zzso into both normal and zzso brains following zzso injection, no significant toxicity was noted in mice, and minor changes in tumor zzso expression were zzso This study suggests that zzso could potentially be used as a novel and zzso vehicle for targeting zzso in brain zzso
