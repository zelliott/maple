The zzso growth factor zzso zzso is zzso activated in many zzso Two different categories of compounds targeting zzso zzso zzso zzso and low molecular weight zzso zzso zzso zzso which target zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso respectively, have shown zzso zzso We decided to explore whether the combined administration of zzso a zzso and zzso a zzso had superior zzso activity than either agent given zzso 

We studied the effects of zzso alone, zzso alone and the combination of zzso and zzso in two colon cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso The effects of these two agents on cell proliferation and induction of zzso were zzso 

zzso activity of zzso alone or zzso alone or the combination was observed for both colon cancer cell zzso In addition, the combined treatment with zzso and zzso resulted in a synergistic and more pronounced growth effect on cell proliferation and induction of zzso than either zzso zzso 

Our findings suggest that combined treatment with distinct zzso zzso agents can augment the zzso response over that zzso with a single zzso zzso New and tempting treatment strategies on the zzso target consisting of a double hit with a zzso and a zzso may improve the therapeutic ratio for zzso cancer in future clinical zzso
