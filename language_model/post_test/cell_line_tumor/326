Both zzso zzso zzso and zzso aromatic zzso zzso are important environmental zzso They coexist widely in the environment at very low zzso Numerous studies indicated that zzso (one of zzso zzso is the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can cause a variety of zzso in zzso such as zzso DNA damage and zzso In the present study, zzso cells were treated with either zzso zzso zzso or zzso at zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso alone, or zzso the cells with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso It was found that zzso zzso activities of zzso cells exposed to either zzso or zzso zzso zzso DNA damage measured by DNA migration and the formation of zzso zzso also increased in cells exposed to zzso but not in cells exposed to zzso Under the zzso zzso zzso condition, zzso zzso activities was enhanced in cells exposed to the medium and high zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso whereas in all zzso groups zzso significantly increased zzso DNA migration zzso zzso zzso for all) and the zzso formation zzso zzso zzso for zzso In addition, there was positive correlation between the zzso induction activity and Olive tail moment zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso or the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The findings suggest that under the experimental conditions zzso may enhance zzso DNA migration and zzso DNA damage in zzso due to inducing zzso zzso zzso
