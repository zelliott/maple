To investigate the expression of zzso protein zzso in zzso of the small zzso and the zzso effect of zzso zzso on small zzso zzso cells zzso 

zzso tissue samples were examined in our study, including 7 cases from human small zzso zzso and 35 cases from normal small zzso served as zzso The expression of zzso was detected by zzso zzso Western zzso analysis was performed to confirm whether zzso zzso could effectively zzso zzso protein after zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso The cells were treated with zzso agent zzso to observe whether zzso zzso affects the zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso analysis was used for assessment of zzso rate of zzso cells cultured with zzso zzso alone, with zzso alone, and with combination of zzso zzso and zzso using zzso zzso cells as zzso 

The positive rate of zzso expression was significantly higher in small zzso zzso than that in normal tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared with the control group, zzso zzso zzso effectively zzso the expression of zzso protein ( zzso The zzso in zzso cells was not increased significantly in zzso compared with that of control group zzso zzso zzso zzso However, compared with the zzso group, the zzso in zzso cells was effectively enhanced after combination treatment with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso ( zzso 

zzso protein plays a significant role in the zzso of human small zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein in small zzso zzso zzso cells leads them susceptible to zzso
