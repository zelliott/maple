The zzso zzso have the ability to interact with the zzso domain of the zzso zzso II, linking this way zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for a human zzso weight zzso zzso is located on zzso 19, between the zzso and the zzso zzso and it has been demonstrated from members of our group that zzso is zzso expressed in most of the human zzso while it is zzso in a subset of zzso zzso In this study, we examine the expression of zzso gene in 111 zzso zzso zzso and in the human zzso zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso This higher expression was positively associated to the size of the tumor ( zzso the grade and the stage of the disease zzso and zzso respectively), and the zzso success ( zzso zzso survival analysis revealed that lower zzso expression increases the probability of both the longer overall and the progression free survival of the zzso zzso Cox zzso analysis revealed that zzso may be used as an independent zzso zzso in zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso is associated with cancer progression and may possibly be characterized as a new marker of zzso prognosis for zzso zzso
