zzso delivery is a highly desirable strategy to improve the diagnostic imaging and therapeutic outcome because of enhanced efficacy and reduced zzso In the current research, zzso drug zzso zzso and contrast agent for magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso were zzso in the core of zzso zzso from zzso block zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with a targeting zzso zzso attached to the zzso ends of zzso zzso The in zzso tumor cell targeting efficacy of these folate zzso and zzso zzso zzso was evaluated upon observing cellular zzso of zzso by human zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso which zzso surface receptors for zzso zzso In the zzso blue zzso experiments, cells incubated with zzso showed much higher zzso iron density than the cells incubated with the zzso zzso According to the flow zzso data, cellular zzso zzso observed for the folate targeting zzso was about zzso fold higher than that for the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso showed that zzso effectively inhibited cell zzso while the zzso zzso did not show the same feat at comparable zzso zzso The potential of zzso as a novel zzso zzso platform was assessed with a zzso T clinical zzso zzso The acquired zzso T zzso signal intensity of cells treated with the folate targeting zzso decreased zzso By contrast, T zzso signal did not show obvious decrease for cells treated with the zzso zzso Our results indicate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso have better targeting zzso to the zzso zzso cells in zzso than their zzso counterparts, and the cell targeting events of zzso can be monitored using a clinical zzso zzso
