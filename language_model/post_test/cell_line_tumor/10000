Fusion of zzso cells zzso with tumor cells is an approach in zzso combining zzso and capacity of zzso presentation to activate T cells for the induction of zzso zzso zzso Although there have been reports of clinical benefit, response rates have been limited and further improvements are zzso 

We used zzso DC and a novel protocol for an effective fusion of those cells with the zzso pancreatic cell line zzso 

We observed 2 events: only moderate in zzso and in zzso zzso of tumor zzso hybrids and a zzso of zzso molecules on fused zzso zzso we zzso tumor zzso hybrids with an zzso expressing zzso to improve DC zzso and generating zzso immune response without the need of zzso T zzso High zzso expression could be obtained by zzso of DC and zzso cells prior zzso Furthermore, vaccination with zzso tumor zzso hybrid led to a significantly increased induction of zzso T cells in zzso and to an improved zzso effect in an zzso in zzso mouse zzso 

zzso tumor zzso hybrids are a promising approach to increase the efficiency of zzso zzso
