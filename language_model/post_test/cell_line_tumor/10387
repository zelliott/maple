zzso zzso tumors zzso are the most common zzso tumors of the gastrointestinal zzso zzso zzso of zzso harbor zzso zzso of the zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are major zzso that zzso zzso one of the zzso signal pathways downstream of zzso zzso is an important tumor zzso whereas the involvement of zzso in cancer has been proposed based essentially on cell line zzso We have used a mouse model of zzso zzso zzso zzso mice, resulting in the substitution of a zzso by zzso at position zzso of zzso In zzso zzso mice, zzso zzso in zzso was found in the zzso zzso zzso The same zzso was found for zzso Western zzso analysis in zzso showed a large increase in zzso expression in zzso zzso mice as compared to wild zzso In contrast, zzso expression was not affected between the two zzso zzso but not zzso zzso appears to be zzso in zzso zzso zzso In the human zzso zzso sensitive cell line, both zzso and zzso were expressed and zzso in part, a nuclear zzso The zzso of zzso in zzso in zzso mice might serve as a feedback mechanism to limit zzso zzso zzso downstream of Kit in a context of zzso zzso
