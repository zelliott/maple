zzso is being incorporated as zzso therapy with zzso chemotherapy on zzso zzso zzso zzso We investigated zzso combined with chemotherapy on zzso progression and mouse survival in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was administered zzso with zzso plus zzso zzso continued after induction zzso or started after zzso The effect on zzso progression was monitored by zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso dissemination into the zzso zzso and zzso formation zzso zzso was evaluated by zzso analysis at the end of treatment zzso and at euthanasia zzso The effects on overall survival zzso were investigated in both zzso zzso 

zzso with zzso delayed zzso progression in mice bearing zzso zzso zzso was significantly extended, with complete responses, by zzso continued after stopping chemotherapy in the zzso zzso zzso alone inhibited zzso formation, with only limited effect on zzso burden, but combined with zzso reduced zzso and zzso zzso started after induction with zzso and maintained was equally effective on zzso progression and survival on zzso zzso 

zzso combined with chemotherapy not only affected zzso zzso but when administered as maintenance regimen significantly prolonged survival, reducing zzso and zzso zzso We believe our findings are consistent with the clinical results and shed light on the potential effects of this kind of treatment on zzso zzso
