zzso cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in American zzso resulting in an estimated zzso deaths annually, typically the result of zzso zzso A consequence of the unsuccessful zzso zzso therapy used initially to treat zzso disease is the emergence of zzso prostate cancer, for which there is currently no prescribed zzso Here, three related human prostate cancer cell lines that serve as a model for this dominant form of prostate cancer zzso were studied to determine the correlation between zzso sodium channel zzso and prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso cell line and two increasingly zzso zzso daughter cell lines, C4 and zzso zzso in zzso invasion zzso indicated that C4 and zzso cells are more invasive than zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso sodium channel expression increases with the invasive potential of the cell line, and this increased invasive potential can be blocked by treatment with the specific zzso sodium channel zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that increased zzso sodium channel expression and function are necessary for the increased invasive potential of these human prostate cancer zzso When the human adult skeletal muscle sodium channel zzso was expressed zzso in each cell line, there was a highly significant increase in the numbers of invading zzso zzso and zzso zzso This increased invasive potential was reduced to control levels by treatment with zzso These data are the first to indicate that the expression of zzso sodium channels alone is sufficient to increase the invasive potential of zzso zzso zzso as well as more aggressive cells zzso C4 and zzso zzso Together, the data suggest that increased zzso sodium channel expression alone is necessary and sufficient to increase the invasive potential of a set of human prostate cancer cell lines that serve as a model for prostate cancer zzso
