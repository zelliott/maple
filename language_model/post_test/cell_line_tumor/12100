We investigated the effect of the charge and the zzso of drug delivery system zzso carriers on their specificity to living zzso melanoma zzso cells with the atomic force zzso To model various zzso zzso carriers, we used zzso particles that were modified with zzso zzso zzso We then measured the zzso and zzso forces between the modified zzso zzso and the living zzso cell in a zzso buffer as a function of their separation zzso The maximum adhesive force on zzso was related to the strength of the specificity of the zzso to the zzso zzso A comparison of the average maximum adhesive force of each functionality group surprisingly showed that zzso charged surfaces and zzso modified surfaces all had similar low zzso Additionally, we saw the unexpected result that there was no zzso dependence on the degree of zzso of the probe surface to a zzso zzso Only the positively charged particle gave a strong adhesive force with the zzso zzso This indicated that zzso carriers with positive charges appeared to have the highest affinity for zzso melanoma cells and that the use of zzso materials unexpectedly did not improve their zzso
