The human double minute zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a key role in zzso turnover and has been validated zzso as a target in multiple myeloma zzso and mantle cell zzso zzso zzso zzso are entering clinical trials, and we therefore sought to understand potential mechanisms of resistance in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells resistant to zzso or zzso were generated by exposing them to increasing drug zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells were resistant to zzso whereas zzso cells displayed zzso to zzso These cells also showed zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso but remained sensitive to the small zzso inhibitor zzso zzso of zzso and induction of tumor cell zzso zzso zzso cells zzso increased zzso levels, but neither zzso nor zzso approaches to activate zzso induced zzso or zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso but zzso were found in the zzso DNA binding and zzso zzso In resistant cells, zzso induced a zzso arrest, zzso of zzso targets zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso Combination regimens with zzso and zzso resulted in enhanced cell death compared with zzso zzso These findings support the possibility that zzso zzso could be a primary mechanism of acquired resistance to zzso zzso in zzso and zzso Furthermore, they suggest that simultaneous restoration of zzso function and zzso zzso is a rational strategy for clinical zzso
