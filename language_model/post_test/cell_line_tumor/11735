Previous studies have suggested conflicting roles for the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso providing evidence that both the zzso zzso and the tumor zzso zzso may be zzso zzso In the present study, we focused on the clinical significance of zzso expression in gastric cancer cases and analyzed the zzso behavior of zzso gastric cancer cells in zzso We analyzed zzso expression in cancer zzso and the corresponding normal zzso to demonstrate the clinical significance of zzso expression in 133 cases of gastric zzso We also investigated the relationship between zzso expression and cell proliferation and the association of zzso with zzso zzso target zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso The expression of zzso zzso was significantly lower in gastric cancer zzso compared to the corresponding normal zzso zzso In zzso analysis for overall survival, we found that zzso expression was an independent zzso factor in gastric zzso zzso of zzso expression in the gastric cancer cell lines zzso and zzso promoted zzso and significant associations between zzso expression and zzso zzso and zzso were also observed in zzso zzso In conclusion, the present study suggests that loss of zzso expression may be a novel indicator for the biological aggressiveness in gastric zzso
