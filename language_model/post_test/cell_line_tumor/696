zzso zzso have been identified as zzso zzso of target gene regulation and control the expression of gene products important in cancer zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso the expression of zzso tumor zzso 1 zzso a widely zzso gene product in human cancer, by targeting the 3' untranslated region zzso of zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso expression was positively regulated by the zzso zzso factor, which is zzso during cancer zzso zzso directly zzso with the zzso zzso and bound to zzso putative promoter that contains a zzso zzso In addition, we found that the level of zzso protein was progressively zzso whereas that of zzso and its zzso zzso were zzso in a breast cancer progression model consisting of zzso cell lines whose zzso ranged from zzso to highly zzso zzso expression in breast cancer cells resulted in increased zzso expression and reduced zzso zzso activity and zzso protein zzso We also provide evidence that the introduction of zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso growth, and zzso of invasive breast cancer zzso We believe our findings show for the first time that zzso regulates the level of zzso and in turn zzso the functions of the zzso zzso in human cancer zzso Based on these findings, we suggest that zzso be further investigated for therapeutic use in zzso the expression of zzso in cancer zzso
