zzso zzso has been widely used for chemotherapy of head and neck cancer, and is known to affect the cell cycle and induce zzso death of cancer zzso However, the molecular actions of zzso on the cell cycle regulatory mechanism have not been fully zzso zzso we analyzed the effects of zzso on the expression of zzso cell cycle regulators in oral cancer cell zzso In zzso zzso treatment of oral cancer cells resulted in an increase in zzso phase zzso zzso expression was zzso by zzso without any notable changes in zzso zzso A remarkable zzso of zzso E and a zzso zzso of zzso D were observed after 24 h zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso changes in cell cycle regulation of oral cancer cells might associate with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was remarkably zzso but it was speculated that its activity might be zzso by an increased binding to zzso
