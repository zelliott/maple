zzso zzso a component of the zzso zzso zzso is involved in promotion of cellular zzso and zzso assembly zzso However, the role of zzso in the zzso of zzso is zzso We evaluated zzso expression in human oral cancer and its possible roles including cellular zzso and zzso We first investigated the zzso zzso and protein expression status in human oral zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso analysis detected frequent zzso of zzso in zzso cells compared to human normal oral zzso To assess the zzso regulation of zzso zzso cells were treated with a zzso zzso zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso restored the zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso cells were examined whether zzso could contribute to cellular zzso and zzso zzso increased zzso and decreased zzso in zzso cells were found compared to zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells was inhibited by zzso zzso functional blocking zzso zzso cells treated with zzso also decreased zzso The expression status of zzso in primary zzso zzso zzso zzso was analyzed and compared to zzso zzso zzso expression in primary zzso was significantly lower zzso zzso zzso than in the normal counterparts and was correlated significantly zzso zzso zzso with regional zzso zzso zzso Our data provided strong evidence that zzso of zzso is a characteristic event in zzso and that zzso was correlated with cellular zzso and zzso zzso zzso might play an important role in regulating tumor invasion and zzso
