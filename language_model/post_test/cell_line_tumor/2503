zzso transfer of zzso zzso zzso is in development for the treatment of zzso zzso In phase II clinical trials, patients with zzso melanoma that received zzso after zzso had a zzso clinical response zzso The current approach to generate zzso is to culture melanoma zzso zzso in the presence of zzso for a zzso to zzso period followed by 2 weeks of rapid expansion zzso Prior to administration, cell therapies are characterized and tested for zzso zzso are characterized by zzso surface marker zzso and purity is assessed by the amount of tumor remaining in zzso Evaluating zzso purity has traditionally been done by zzso which is often considered zzso To generate a quantitative zzso we used zzso flow zzso to evaluate the presence of viable tumor cells by zzso zzso populations with a viability dye and an zzso cocktail that detects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and surface zzso melanoma zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on T zzso zzso were identified by gating on the viable zzso zzso zzso in tumors were initially zzso with individual zzso using both zzso and flow zzso When eight different tumor cell lines were spiked into an activated T cell culture, flow zzso was able to distinguish zzso from tumors in all samples zzso Most importantly, the zzso was able to detect melanoma cells in all zzso zzso zzso from patient zzso After zzso zzso expansion, there was a significant decrease in tumor zzso tumor cells were detected in only 2 of 12 zzso In eight zzso zzso samples that were further expanded in zzso no tumor cells were zzso We have demonstrated that flow zzso is an alternative to zzso for defining the purity of a zzso zzso
