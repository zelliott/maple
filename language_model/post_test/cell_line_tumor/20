zzso is the most common primary brain tumor with poor zzso zzso has been used with zzso to treat zzso We investigated the synergistic mechanism of these two drugs in zzso 

Human zzso zzso cells zzso were cultured and assigned to four groups with different treatments for 3 days: zzso group zzso zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plus zzso group zzso zzso and control zzso zzso zzso was applied to evaluate the cell zzso Cell cycle was analyzed by flow zzso The zzso features of zzso were observed with electron zzso zzso orange and zzso were adopted to label zzso and flow zzso was applied for zzso of zzso The expression of zzso protein was detected by Western zzso 

zzso of tumor cell was obviously suppressed by zzso with zzso treatment than by either drug used alone zzso zzso zzso for each zzso The combination treatment induced cell cycle arrest at zzso zzso Typical zzso zzso character was found after the combined zzso zzso promoted the zzso induced by zzso The zzso zzso associated protein 1 light chain 3 zzso and zzso were more significantly zzso by the combined treatment than zzso used alone zzso P zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The expression level of zzso and zzso zzso deleted on zzso ten zzso which promoted zzso by suppressing zzso signaling pathway, was elevated by zzso zzso group: P zzso zzso combined group: P zzso zzso 

zzso enhances the zzso of zzso by promoting the zzso induced by zzso zzso to the zzso of zzso by zzso the expression of zzso associated zzso and zzso was zzso which leads to a reinforced zzso in the combined treatment of zzso and zzso in zzso
