zzso receptors alpha zzso and beta zzso are zzso factors zzso that mediate zzso signaling and define the zzso zzso of breast cancer zzso The two receptors can be found zzso and play specific, often opposite, roles, with zzso being able to zzso the effects of zzso on gene zzso and cell zzso zzso is frequently lost in zzso where its presence generally zzso with a better prognosis of the zzso The identification of the zzso targets of zzso in zzso BC cells is thus a critical step to zzso the roles of this zzso in zzso signaling and tumor cell zzso 

zzso of full-length zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells resulted in a marked reduction in cell proliferation in response to zzso and marked effects on the cell zzso By zzso we identified zzso zzso and zzso zzso binding sites in zzso cells, zzso sites occupied by either zzso zzso or both zzso zzso A search for zzso binding zzso revealed that the majority of the binding sites identified comprise one or more zzso Response zzso and the remaining show binding zzso for other zzso known to mediate zzso interaction with zzso by zzso including zzso zzso and zzso Of 921 genes zzso regulated by zzso in zzso vs zzso cells, zzso showed one or more zzso site within 10 zzso These putative primary zzso target genes control cell zzso death, zzso zzso and zzso signal zzso and transcription, key cellular processes that might explain the biological and clinical zzso of tumors expressing this zzso zzso zzso binding in close proximity of several zzso genes and in the zzso zzso suggests the possible involvement of this zzso in small zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso indicate that the vast majority of the zzso targets of zzso can bind also zzso suggesting that the overall action of zzso on the zzso of zzso BC cells depends mainly on the relative concentration of both zzso in the zzso
