zzso a zzso zzso rich in the zzso acids zzso and zzso can interact with the zzso charged component of the cell surface, and rapidly penetrate cell zzso zzso we hypothesized that zzso as a membrane penetrating zzso zzso could be exploited as a novel carrier to deliver zzso into the cell zzso in order to zzso target gene zzso zzso a complex formation of zzso with zzso and its cellular zzso were investigated in our zzso Further, we zzso the ratio of the zzso complex, zzso incubation period and the concentration of zzso The results suggest that zzso could form a complex with zzso and mediate zzso of the zzso into zzso zzso The optimal ratio of zzso with zzso was zzso which was found to have a maximum zzso gene zzso effect after zzso zzso Moreover, zzso cell zzso cell cycle, invasion and migration were zzso The results suggested that zzso zzso could not result in zzso cell proliferation zzso and cell cycle arrest, while invasion and migration of zzso cells were strongly zzso zzso the data also showed that in addition to zzso of zzso single zzso may play a role in cell invasion and zzso zzso and zzso zzso displayed synergistic biological effects in zzso cell invasion and migration of zzso cells, which was more prominent compared with the popular zzso delivery zzso
