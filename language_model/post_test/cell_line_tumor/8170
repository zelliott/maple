zzso by zzso causes a dramatic zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso that has been suggested to be essential for viral zzso zzso Several proteins from zzso zzso zzso zzso have been tested as putative zzso factors with negative zzso Here, we show that zzso a viral protein that is absolutely required for the viability and proliferation of zzso primary zzso zzso zzso cells, increases the levels of zzso zzso and zzso the disruption of zzso by a zzso zzso In addition, we demonstrate that this disruption is largely dependent on both the integrity of a zzso interaction motif in zzso and the zzso 160 from zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso expression in zzso cells by zzso interference led to an increase in the zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso repression of zzso a protein that directly contributes to zzso progression of zzso This represents the first example of zzso of these important zzso structures by zzso
