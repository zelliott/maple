To improve activity of a zzso zzso zzso zzso comprised of zzso spliced to truncated diphtheria toxin zzso zzso growth factor zzso was added to the same single chain zzso This new zzso zzso CT, called zzso enhanced the killing potency against the human zzso lines, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A similar enhancement was observed against the lung zzso cell line, zzso zzso zzso zzso activity could not be explained by an increased number of zzso available for binding since a combination of zzso zzso and zzso did not cause the same enhanced zzso zzso activity was dependent on the presence of both zzso on the same single chain zzso and killing was zzso specific since target zzso negative leukemia cells were unaffected by the highly selective zzso and zzso could be blocked with zzso and zzso zzso In a zzso flank tumor model, zzso injection of zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso significantly inhibited the growth of established zzso tumors in nude mice zzso zzso zzso In this model, the human zzso and zzso components of zzso are zzso with mouse zzso and zzso zzso These studies show that a new zzso agent that simultaneously recognizes zzso and zzso is more effective than its zzso counterparts and that zzso has therapeutic advantages for zzso
