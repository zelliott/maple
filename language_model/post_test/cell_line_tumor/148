To study the zzso effects of zzso therapy zzso treated by zzso cancer cell zzso in rat zzso zzso cancer in zzso 

Female zzso rats of 6 - 8 weeks were allocated to four groups zzso zzso 8 zzso zzso group zzso zzso with zzso tumor cell zzso zzso group zzso zzso with zzso tumor cell zzso normal saline group zzso zzso with normal zzso and control zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso cells were injected into all rats by zzso at day 7, while injected with normal saline in control zzso The number of tumor specific zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso linked zzso zzso zzso the zzso T zzso zzso activity of zzso was measured by zzso zzso zzso analysis and tumor growth and the survival time of rats were also zzso 

zzso by zzso tumor cell zzso the number of tumor specific zzso zzso zzso in zzso group, zzso group, normal saline group and control group were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, which were significant differences among of them zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso tumor cell zzso the number of tumor specific zzso zzso zzso in four groups were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, which were not significant differences among of them zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso of zzso group increased significantly than that in other three groups zzso zzso zzso Except rats in control group were all alive until the experiment ended, the mean survival time of other rats were 234 d in zzso group, zzso d in zzso group and zzso d in normal saline group, which in zzso group was significantly higher than those in zzso group and normal saline group zzso zzso zzso 

zzso treated by zzso tumor cell zzso could produce zzso effects in zzso which shown that induce zzso immune response and prolong the life zzso
