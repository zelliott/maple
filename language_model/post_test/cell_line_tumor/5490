Treatment of breast cancer is becoming more individualized with the recognition of tumor zzso that respond differently to available zzso Breast cancer 1 gene zzso tumors are usually of the zzso zzso and associated with poor survival rates, highlighting the need for more effective zzso 

We investigated a mouse model that closely mimics breast cancer arising in zzso carriers to better understand the molecular mechanism of tumor progression and tested whether targeting of the zzso protein zzso would be a putative therapy for zzso zzso 

Gene expression analysis demonstrated that zzso is zzso in zzso mouse zzso zzso By zzso we show that an increase in zzso protein levels is also evident in tumors from zzso zzso zzso is responsible for repression of genes driving differentiation and could thus be involved in the zzso zzso of these zzso zzso we show that zzso cancer cells are selectively dependent on their elevated zzso zzso In addition, a chemical inhibitor of zzso zzso A zzso is about zzso more effective in killing zzso cells compared to zzso zzso tumor zzso 

We demonstrate by specific zzso experiments that zzso zzso is functionally relevant in zzso breast cancer zzso The effectiveness of a small zzso inhibitor indicates that zzso is a zzso zzso The zzso of zzso in all zzso breast zzso warrants further investigation of the potential for targeting the genetic zzso of this particular breast cancer zzso
