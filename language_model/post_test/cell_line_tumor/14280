zzso specific membrane zzso zzso expression is correlated with stage and grade of prostate cancer suggesting that it zzso a growth zzso We studied if zzso folate zzso activity provides cells a growth advantage in a low folate zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso folate to a form that cells can zzso 

zzso of zzso and zzso cells was assessed in media containing low zzso zzso zzso or high zzso folate with or without zzso folate and a zzso specific folate zzso zzso zzso acid zzso 

zzso cells, which express zzso and zzso cells, which do not, displayed decreased proliferation when grown in zzso or zzso compared to zzso zzso This reduction in proliferation was eliminated in zzso cells when zzso folate was added to the zzso In the presence of zzso zzso acid zzso cells displayed increased growth but this was still significantly lower than growth in zzso zzso zzso of zzso attenuated the increased growth seen in zzso cells but had no effect on zzso cell zzso 

The folate zzso activity of zzso may provide a growth advantage in zzso and zzso zzso
