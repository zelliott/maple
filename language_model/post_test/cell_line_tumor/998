zzso IX zzso synthesis by zzso cells is clinically exploited for zzso and zzso therapy following administration of zzso acid zzso The expression and activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was correlated to zzso synthesis in zzso zzso melanoma zzso zzso was zzso by two zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso both of which promote the formation of typical zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso A marked decrease in total zzso activity and zzso synthesis was observed following stimulation by zzso while zzso induced an opposite zzso In contrast, zzso levels remained zzso zzso zzso of the cells undergoing differentiation was largely dependent on the zzso zzso which was modulated by the two zzso zzso and zzso Fluorescence zzso with zzso zzso revealed a major zzso fraction in the nucleus and a minor fraction in the zzso This nuclear zzso pattern was confirmed by expression of zzso fused to green zzso zzso We suggest that efficient zzso therapy of cancer facilitated by zzso administration can be enhanced using combined therapeutic zzso
