The most important clinical zzso for breast cancer management is zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso that express zzso are candidates for zzso therapy and are biologically less aggressive, while zzso zzso are largely treated with conventional chemotherapy and have a poor zzso Despite its significance, the mechanisms regulating zzso expression are poorly zzso We zzso that the inflammatory zzso zzso M zzso can zzso zzso expression in breast zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso protein and zzso expression in zzso in a zzso and zzso manner in two human zzso breast cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso This was dependent on the expression of zzso zzso beta zzso and could be blocked by zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso loss was also necessary for zzso zzso signal zzso and migratory zzso In zzso high expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso was associated with reduced zzso ( zzso and zzso zzso ( zzso protein levels in a cohort of 70 invasive breast zzso High zzso and zzso zzso expression was also associated with low expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes in a previously published breast cancer gene expression zzso zzso zzso In the latter zzso high zzso expression was associated with shorter recurrence-free and overall survival in zzso ( zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may be a novel factor causing suppression of zzso and disease progression in breast zzso
