The zzso signaling plays an integral role in cellular zzso controlling the transition between the zzso and anabolic zzso Originally approved as zzso agents preventing zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling have recently entered the arena of cancer zzso Using zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso we aimed to systematically analyze the molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso effects of zzso zzso Using zzso and zzso survival zzso a preferential sensitivity of zzso zzso cells zzso followed by zzso and zzso zzso to zzso treatment was zzso In contrast, zzso and prostate tumor cells demonstrated relative resistance against zzso zzso In zzso with zzso zzso exerted potent zzso effects by zzso zzso cell tube zzso Further, zzso treatment efficiently prevented tumor growth in zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed to decipher the molecular mechanism underlying zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso expression pattern was zzso of genes after zzso treatment in all three sensitive cell zzso Among the zzso zzso zzso a zzso network was discovered enriched for genes related to zzso processes and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso Of note, key components of zzso upstream zzso as well as zzso downstream signaling zzso zzso were zzso by zzso zzso expression of zzso and 139 common gene targets between zzso acid and zzso suggested in part shared mechanisms underlying their zzso and zzso zzso In zzso key genetic participants governing zzso and zzso effects of zzso zzso were zzso
