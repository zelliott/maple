zzso B virus zzso infection is a major cause of zzso zzso zzso in Southeast Asia and Hong zzso Among the four proteins that are zzso by the zzso zzso zzso X zzso is the most potentially zzso zzso It is known that zzso plays an important role in zzso but the exact functions and molecular mechanisms of zzso in zzso are not well zzso In this study, we constructed expression zzso for small hairpin zzso zzso against zzso and investigated their regulatory effects in zzso zzso cells, which zzso produce zzso Our data show that this tool of zzso interference zzso could successfully reduce the zzso zzso and protein levels by zzso zzso targeting zzso in zzso cells demonstrated significant reduction in cell zzso cell growth, zzso growth in soft zzso and zzso development in nude zzso In addition, depletion of zzso expression increased cell sensitivity to zzso and zzso zzso and reduced the expression levels of zzso and zzso These findings suggest that zzso plays an important role in zzso and zzso mechanisms in zzso
