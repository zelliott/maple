zzso T zzso zzso 4 zzso is a critical negative regulator of immune zzso zzso among known zzso zzso its genetic zzso results in a zzso and fatal zzso zzso This central regulatory role led to the development of zzso designed to block zzso activity in zzso aiming to enhance immune responses against zzso Despite their zzso efficacy and promising clinical activity against late stage zzso melanoma, the critical cellular targets for their activity remains zzso In particular, debate has focused on whether the zzso T cell zzso or regulatory T cell zzso zzso zzso compartment is the primary target of zzso zzso We developed a mouse expressing human instead of mouse zzso allowing us to evaluate the independent contributions of zzso blockade of each T cell compartment during cancer zzso in an in zzso model of mouse zzso The data show that although blockade on zzso cells significantly improves tumor protection, zzso blockade on regulatory cells completely fails to enhance zzso zzso However, zzso blockade of both compartments leads to a synergistic effect and zzso zzso zzso We conclude that the combination of direct enhancement of zzso cell function and zzso zzso of T zzso cell activity through blockade of zzso on both cell types is essential for zzso the full therapeutic effects of zzso zzso during cancer zzso
