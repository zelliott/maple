The precise regulation and maintenance of balance between cell zzso differentiation and death in zzso are critical for tissue zzso zzso protein alpha zzso has been implicated as a key regulator of differentiation and proliferation in various cell zzso Here we investigated the potential dynamic change and role of zzso protein during zzso zzso 

Upon onset of zzso induced by various kinds of zzso such as zzso zzso and others, zzso expression presented a profound zzso in zzso cell lines and primary cells via induction of protein degradation and zzso of transcription, as assessed respectively by zzso zzso test, real-time quantitative zzso and zzso reporter zzso zzso chemical zzso forced expression of dominant negative zzso and zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso which was zzso activated during zzso induction tested, we showed that the active zzso protein contributed to the increased degradation of zzso zzso Three specific zzso zzso antagonized zzso degradation during zzso zzso More importantly, zzso expression of zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso while the chemical zzso of zzso action significantly inhibited the enhanced zzso of zzso protein under zzso zzso Additionally, zzso of zzso expression by small interfering zzso zzso while zzso expression of zzso inhibited zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

These observations indicate that the zzso of zzso upon zzso results in the increased zzso degradation of zzso which partially contributes to zzso zzso
