zzso zzso zzso suppresses breast cancer cell zzso potentially through its regulatory effect on zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso although the mechanism by which this occurs remains zzso Thus in our studies, we aimed to determine the effect of zzso expression on zzso cell proliferation and zzso of zzso signaling in the breast cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso In zzso cells, which express low levels of zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso cells, which express high levels of zzso zzso zzso promoted zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso and restoration of zzso expression in zzso zzso cells rescued the zzso of zzso on zzso zzso zzso further confirming that the zzso of zzso downstream molecules could be specifically inhibited by zzso zzso Since zzso signaling was triggered by zzso zzso via zzso zzso we further detected the zzso status of zzso in the presence or absence of zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells inhibited zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso in zzso cells enhanced zzso zzso zzso Meanwhile, total expression levels of zzso were unaffected during zzso zzso Taken together, our data shows that zzso can suppress zzso proliferation of breast cancer cells by zzso zzso zzso and blocking zzso downstream signaling in breast cancer zzso These results provide further insight into the molecular mechanism by which zzso regulates the development and progression of breast zzso
