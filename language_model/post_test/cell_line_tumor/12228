Patients with pancreatic zzso have a doom prognosis these tumors were previously proved to express high level of zzso The current study was aimed to demonstrate that the treatment with zzso zzso to zzso is effective, in zzso in pancreatic cancer cells, similar to what we had previously shown in the setting of zzso zzso Three human pancreatic cancer cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso were analyzed for their expression levels of zzso by Western zzso zzso The correlation for the protein available on the zzso membrane was assessed by zzso zzso to plates coated with fixed cells using zzso zzso as the first zzso Human cancer cell lines were tested for their response to two different zzso zzso zzso and a control zzso zzso zzso Human pancreatic zzso cell lines that express zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed growth zzso in dose and time dependent zzso These results were repetitive for the two different zzso Growth rate was not affected in zzso cells that do not express zzso or when cells were treated with a control zzso zzso may play an important role in the zzso process of pancreatic zzso It may serve as a useful target in the therapy of pancreatic zzso
