zzso zzso zzso is a potent and selective zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor currently in early clinical zzso We examined the activity of zzso in a panel of zzso cell lung cancer and a panel of cell lines representing many cancer types using in zzso growth zzso zzso induced zzso cell cycle arrest in sensitive cell lines that primarily included cells containing the zzso zzso zzso In these cells, zzso arrest is accompanied by the zzso of the cell cycle zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso zzso In the majority of cell lines tested, including those with zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso induced the zzso of zzso an effect not observed in the most sensitive zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cell lines is due to zzso of negative feedback zzso zzso zzso zzso negative feedback zzso which results in enhanced baseline zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso feedback zzso but does not sensitize cells to zzso zzso suppression of zzso zzso zzso does not zzso resistance to zzso but enhances sensitivity to zzso Thus, our findings show that zzso zzso marks cells with an in zzso requirement for zzso signaling to support zzso These cells are exquisitely sensitive to zzso zzso zzso zzso have high baseline levels of zzso and lack feedback zzso between zzso and zzso These data suggest an approach to identifying cells that may be sensitive to zzso and other zzso zzso
