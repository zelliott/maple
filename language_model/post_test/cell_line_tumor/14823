zzso zzso is one of the zzso that is highly resistant to therapy and among the leading causes of zzso zzso Several factors may influence pancreatic cancer resistance, and expression of zzso cassette transport proteins is one of the major mechanisms of drug zzso Members of this family's zzso also referred to as zzso zzso proteins zzso might be of particular interest because they are able to zzso zzso zzso used in the treatment of pancreatic zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in human zzso and pancreatic zzso has been zzso However, contributions of zzso to zzso of pancreatic cancer are not fully zzso zzso zzso expression in pancreatic zzso cell lines correlated significantly with cellular sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso treatment with zzso increased expression of zzso by zzso and was associated with significant drug resistance zzso values for control and zzso zzso zzso cell lines were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells resulted in significantly reduced zzso of zzso related zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso significantly increased cellular zzso of zzso to zzso cells and enhanced zzso of zzso related to zzso and its zzso Our results suggest that zzso is expressed and functionally active and contributes to variable sensitivities of pancreatic zzso cell lines to zzso Further investigations using models that resemble human zzso tumors are necessary to prove a zzso relation between expression and activity of zzso and tumor resistance to zzso
