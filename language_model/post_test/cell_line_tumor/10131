The efficient zzso reaction of zzso as model structures for zzso compounds with zzso aromatic systems was carried out using the zzso zzso and atmospheric oxygen to produce eight novel zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was used for zzso zzso containing primary or secondary zzso groups with zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that not only primary zzso groups, but also secondary zzso groups, are able to couple with zzso aromatic systems in zzso zzso The resulting model products zzso up to zzso were isolated, structurally characterized and tested for their zzso zzso and zzso zzso Four of the eight products showed low to moderate growth zzso against several zzso and zzso bacterial strains and against the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso and zzso activities were determined by an zzso disc diffusion test and a modified method according to the zzso discussion document zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 9, zzso for the evaluation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso against the human urinary zzso zzso cell line zzso are zzso
