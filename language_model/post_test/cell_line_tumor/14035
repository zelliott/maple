zzso zzso is the most common primitive zzso zzso zzso of the central nervous zzso Although zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso similar, their clinical zzso zzso zzso being more aggressive than zzso The aim of this study was to determine whether zzso and zzso are genetically different zzso 

We investigated 32 zzso primary zzso samples zzso zzso and nine zzso and four zzso cell lines, for the presence of zzso zzso deletions at zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and promoter zzso of both zzso No zzso deletion of either zzso or zzso was demonstrated in any of the zzso primary zzso zzso zzso of zzso was found in one of six zzso and in one of 23 zzso while zzso zzso was observed in three of six zzso and in three of 21 zzso No zzso of zzso or zzso was found in any of the zzso cell lines zzso The three zzso cell lines did not show zzso zzso and only the zzso zzso cell line zzso deleted at zzso presented loss of zzso zzso 

Our results in this limited series of central zzso show that zzso is frequently involved in zzso zzso with a higher frequency, but not statistically zzso for zzso than for zzso
