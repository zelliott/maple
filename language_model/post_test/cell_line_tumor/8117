zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso space is required for zzso dynamics and zzso Currently, spatial regulation of zzso is thought to require the association of zzso regulatory zzso zzso with zzso zzso proteins zzso Here, we show that the regulatory zzso zzso of zzso associates with dynamic zzso zzso in an zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and a zzso fusion protein zzso with zzso in zzso within zzso zzso growth cones and the leading edge zzso of zzso zzso zzso imaging demonstrates that zzso zzso are highly dynamic and that the zzso of zzso to zzso is tight, as the movement of both zzso and zzso are immediately and zzso stopped by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in these structures is resistant to displacement by a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso confirms that a substantial pool of zzso zzso is associated with the zzso zzso and is resistant to extraction by a zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso Finally, zzso of the zzso domain of zzso fails to disrupt its association with zzso zzso These data provide the first demonstration of the physical association of a zzso with such dynamic zzso structures, as well as the first demonstration of the ability of zzso zzso to zzso to discrete zzso structures independently of zzso zzso zzso This association is likely to be important for zzso dynamics and cell migration and may prime the investigation of novel mechanisms for zzso zzso zzso
