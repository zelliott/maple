zzso T cells play important roles in innate immunity against tumors and zzso zzso effect of zzso on growth of cancer cells has been found in recent zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of zzso on human zzso T cell proliferation by zzso zzso and killing activity against pancreatic cancer cells zzso zzso and zzso by zzso release zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso were verified by flow zzso The results suggested that appropriate concentration of zzso favored the expansion of zzso T cells and enhanced zzso T cell zzso killing activity against pancreatic cancer zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso B expression and zzso production may be the important mechanism of zzso on increased zzso activity of zzso T zzso
