zzso belongs to zzso family proteins which are involved in cell zzso zzso zzso and wound zzso Although a number of studies on the roles of zzso in zzso have been reported, no study on the expression and function of zzso in the central nervous system has been zzso In this study, we focused on zzso that was zzso in nervous zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso enhanced zzso outgrowth zzso after serum withdrawal with increased zzso levels of zzso and zzso When cells were cultured with zzso zzso zzso more and longer zzso were formed than in the zzso Thus, we demonstrated for the first time that zzso zzso zzso formation in a mouse zzso cell line, zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso was suppressed after zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso cells were resistant to zzso induced by zzso These results suggested that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso via zzso and consequently zzso zzso formation and zzso resistance to zzso zzso of zzso in zzso mice should be, therefore, a reaction to protect nervous zzso from zzso caused by zzso zzso
