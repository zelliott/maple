zzso evidence has shown multiple roles that zzso zzso zzso may play to promote the progression of several types of zzso The mechanism of such promotion is believed to involve chronic inflammation that creates a zzso which enhances tumor zzso zzso blocking zzso function with an zzso may provide a novel treatment of zzso such as prostate zzso Currently, several zzso zzso are available, but all have been zzso for their zzso activity on zzso cellular membrane invasion process rather than zzso on zzso signaling zzso Thus, there is need to develop zzso zzso focusing on zzso of zzso downstream signaling and zzso of zzso related prostate cancer proliferation and zzso In this report, a zzso analysis was conducted based on zzso studies of several known zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso A unique structural skeleton for zzso zzso was constructed and zzso resulting in a new series of small molecules to be zzso and zzso A combination of zzso calcium flux zzso anti prostate cancer cell zzso zzso zzso and in zzso animal model studies were applied to screen the newly zzso zzso zzso from this study provided a potential lead compound for future zzso zzso development focusing on prostate cancer zzso
