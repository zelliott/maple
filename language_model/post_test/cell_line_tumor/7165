zzso on zzso is a hallmark of zzso zzso As a consequence, these tumors generate more zzso which is zzso from cells by zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that 1) zzso expression in zzso tumors may differ from normal tissue in zzso zzso or zzso and 2) zzso zzso expression would induce zzso zzso resulting in decreased proliferation and/or increased cell zzso 

We zzso expression of zzso zzso in human zzso zzso and zzso cells lines by Western zzso zzso zzso that were abundant or specific to zzso then were targeted in the model zzso zzso zzso cell line via small interfering zzso zzso gene zzso and tested for zzso of zzso zzso zzso pH changes, reduced zzso and/or induction of cell zzso 

zzso 1 and 2 were the primary zzso expressed in human zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso In contrast, zzso 3 was the predominantly expressed zzso in normal zzso Small interfering zzso acid specific for zzso 1 and 2 reduced expression of these zzso in zzso zzso cells to barely zzso levels and reduced zzso zzso by zzso individually and zzso in zzso with a zzso decrease of zzso pH by zzso units (a fourfold increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso of both zzso reduced viability by zzso individually and zzso in zzso as measured by both zzso and flow zzso zzso 

zzso targeting significantly reduced the viability of zzso zzso cells zzso by both zzso and zzso This indicates that the strategy may be a useful therapeutic avenue for treatment of patients with zzso zzso
