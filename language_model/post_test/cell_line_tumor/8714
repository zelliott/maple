zzso zzso is an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso and recently it has been shown as a promising nontoxic zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrated that zzso could induce zzso in zzso cells, which were confirmed by the formation of zzso appearance of zzso patterns of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso associated zzso Moreover, zzso zzso by zzso zzso or zzso zzso treatment can significantly enhance zzso zzso To determine the underlying mechanism of zzso zzso target identification using drug affinity responsive target stability zzso coupled with zzso zzso analysis were zzso to profile zzso expressed proteins between control and zzso zzso zzso As a result, zzso D zzso and zzso protein 1 zzso were identified with significant zzso compared with zzso Further study indicated that zzso treatment significantly promoted abnormal zzso oxygen species zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso could be attenuated by zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrated that the zzso signaling pathway, a major negative regulator of zzso was suppressed by zzso zzso To our knowledge, it was the first study to show that zzso induced protective zzso in zzso cells, and the potential mechanisms were involved in zzso imbalance and zzso signaling zzso zzso
