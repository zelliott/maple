The tumor zzso zzso zzso coli zzso is zzso in familial zzso zzso and in many sporadic zzso zzso zzso zzso coli is known to zzso regulate zzso signaling by inducing the degradation of zzso zzso zzso coli also interacts with the zzso zzso exchange factors zzso and zzso and stimulates their activity, thereby regulating cell zzso and zzso Here we show that in zzso zzso zzso II cells, zzso are zzso with zzso at the sites of zzso zzso at the zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, in zzso tumor cells containing zzso zzso significant amounts of zzso and the truncated zzso zzso are localized mainly in the zzso These results suggest that zzso of the zzso complex at the sites of zzso contact is critical for the regulation of cell zzso and that the zzso zzso zzso of these complexes in zzso tumor cells may contribute to the cell's zzso adhesive and migratory zzso
