Small cell lung cancer zzso easily acquires zzso resistance after successful initial zzso zzso of zzso cassette (ABC) zzso is important for the zzso zzso Among them, zzso and zzso are known to be zzso in zzso zzso zzso We found that human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso expressions are also zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells, compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso could not suppress proliferation of these zzso zzso cells alone but successfully restored zzso to zzso and zzso with a clinically zzso zzso The reversal effect of zzso was thought to be caused by zzso of drug zzso pump functions of ABC zzso although zzso itself has been reported to be a zzso for zzso Moreover, knocking down of zzso by an short interfering zzso weakened the effect of zzso on zzso indicating the involvement of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso we showed that zzso and zzso play key roles in modulating zzso function via zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso of zzso by zzso activates zzso and successively leads to increased zzso zzso Through this process, zzso zzso from zzso and strengthens association with zzso and finally zzso the pump zzso Furthermore, we showed that treatment by zzso in combination with zzso or zzso significantly suppresses the growth of subcutaneous zzso and zzso tumors in mice, zzso zzso these results indicate that combination therapy with zzso and zzso agents could zzso ABC zzso zzso especially in zzso zzso
