The zzso of this study was to determine whether zzso can be used for zzso therapy response assessment in a zzso cancer zzso mouse model using zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso human prostate cancer cell line zzso was implanted zzso into the left zzso of 17 zzso zzso zzso testosterone zzso were implanted in the neck zzso All mice were injected 4-6 weeks after zzso zzso with 37 zzso zzso via the tail zzso Dynamic imaging was performed for 60 minutes with a zzso zzso zzso After the first zzso zzso imaging 8 mice were subsequently injected zzso with zzso twice zzso 1 and 5) at a dose of 3 zzso body zzso 8 mice were treated with PBS as a zzso zzso zzso imaging was performed on day 7, 14 and 21 after zzso Image analysis was performed using zzso zzso ratios zzso zzso zzso zzso 

All zzso zzso could be zzso by zzso zzso Before treatment the mean zzso ratio was zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group and zzso zzso zzso in the control group zzso zzso zzso There was a reduction in the mean zzso zzso after zzso treatment of the zzso of the zzso cell line as early as 1 week after initiation of therapy zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso after one week, zzso zzso zzso after 2 weeks and zzso zzso zzso after 3 zzso There was no decrease in zzso zzso in the control zzso 

Our results show that zzso has the potential for use in the early monitoring of the therapeutic effect of zzso in a zzso prostate cancer zzso animal zzso
