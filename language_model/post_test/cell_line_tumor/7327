zzso proteins comprise a family of zzso zzso that control cellular membrane zzso zzso is a poorly zzso member with no known zzso Human zzso zzso from zzso cells was zzso into zzso expression zzso to generate zzso and zzso zzso defective in either zzso zzso zzso zzso or binding zzso zzso for zzso studies in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies revealed zzso to be predominantly zzso to the early zzso pathway, on zzso containing zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso to enlarged zzso in zzso zzso expressing cells but the zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso had unique zzso zzso zzso zzso structures and the zzso network, zzso Early zzso zzso for zzso was confirmed in a zzso cell line that allowed analysis of the zzso distribution of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso with other zzso revealed extensive zzso with early zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but much less overlap with those associated with late zzso recycling zzso and the early zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso had defects in zzso of zzso and zzso growth factor and failed to effectively deliver the latter zzso to late zzso and zzso for zzso zzso our data provide the first zzso of zzso function in early zzso zzso
