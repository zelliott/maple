A substantial number of studies provide evidence that inflammation may play a significant role in the zzso of prostate cancer via increased activity of inflammatory zzso particularly zzso We have previously shown that peripheral blood zzso cells zzso are capable of carrying out an in zzso zzso zzso with colon cancer cells expressed by an increased production of zzso zzso by zzso The aim of the current study was to examine the model of zzso interaction between zzso and prostate cancer cells from two lines - zzso resistant zzso and zzso zzso For that purpose, cancer cells from both lines were incubated with zzso and zzso zzso by zzso was zzso The results showed a zzso dependent increase in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso induced by cells from both lines, whereas generation of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were found to be increased after incubation with zzso cells zzso The zzso of zzso was slightly lower following incubation of zzso with zzso derived from zzso zzso The results of the study support the possibility that prostate cancer zzso zzso production by zzso and particularly zzso are involved in prostate cancer zzso The zzso between the effect of the two prostate cancer cell lines on zzso zzso by zzso may be due to their different zzso zzso
