Invasion is an important early step of cancer zzso that is not well zzso zzso zzso to limit zzso requires the identification and validation of candidate proteins necessary for invasion and zzso 

We developed a functional zzso screen to identify zzso of tumor cell zzso This screen couples zzso Assisted Light zzso zzso to a zzso zzso library to systematically zzso surface proteins expressed by human zzso cells followed by a zzso assessment of zzso zzso 

Using this screen, we have identified zzso (the zzso zzso as a zzso of tumor cell invasion through its role in zzso zzso of zzso by zzso or by zzso resulted in a significant decrease in zzso migration of zzso zzso cells towards a serum zzso zzso was found to be highly expressed in multiple cancer cell lines and primary tumors including zzso zzso zzso of zzso also decreased migration of zzso zzso zzso zzso is recruited to the leading edge of zzso cells where it zzso with zzso and zzso known zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso also altered cellular zzso resulting in cells that were larger and more zzso than controls when zzso on a zzso zzso 

These results zzso a role for zzso in zzso tumor cell invasion and migration and suggest that zzso may contribute to zzso
