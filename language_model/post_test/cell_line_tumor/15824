zzso zzso zzso zzso is an aggressive disease associated with median survival between 9 and 12 zzso The correct diagnosis of zzso is sometimes challenging and usually requires solid tissue zzso rather than zzso aspiration zzso zzso We zzso that the accuracy of zzso diagnosis might be improved by the addition of molecular tests using a gene expression zzso zzso and that zzso tests could be similarly zzso 

Two zzso and 2 lung cancer cell lines were used to establish the minimal quantity of zzso required to perform the gene ratio zzso On the basis of these results, 276 ex zzso zzso zzso from 63 zzso patients and 250 ex zzso zzso samples from 92 lung cancer patients were analyzed using previously described diagnostic and zzso tests based on gene expression zzso 

We found that the sensitivity of the diagnostic test for zzso was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and the specificity in primary lung zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was zzso among zzso zzso zzso zzso of patients with the risk assignment in a subset of the matched surgical specimens previously analyzed by the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso can be extracted from most zzso zzso to perform gene expression molecular zzso In particular, we show that the gene expression ratio zzso performed well when applied to diagnosis and prognosis in zzso This study provides support for the development of additional zzso molecular tests that may enhance the utility of zzso in the management of other solid zzso
