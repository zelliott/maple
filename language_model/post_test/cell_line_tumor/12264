zzso in DNA zzso are important in cancer, but the acquisition of these zzso is poorly zzso Using an unbiased global screen for zzso island zzso events, we have identified a zzso pattern of DNA zzso acquired in zzso zzso Interestingly, this pattern included zzso located upstream of a number of zzso zzso Upon removal of zzso activity in primary human zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso and recruited to zzso a locus expressed during normal breast development and zzso silenced in breast zzso We demonstrate that at this targeted zzso the zzso of zzso zzso is accompanied by the recruitment of DNA zzso and the zzso of DNA, an zzso which we show to be dependent on zzso zzso These results demonstrate a zzso role of zzso disruption in modulating DNA zzso and identify a dynamic and active process zzso zzso zzso of gene expression is activated as an early event in breast tumor zzso
