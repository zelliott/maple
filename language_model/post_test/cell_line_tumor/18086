The zzso assembly of zzso zzso is a pathological hallmark shared by Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders known collectively as zzso To model how zzso zzso zzso in zzso we previously established zzso zzso cultures from human zzso zzso cells that zzso express human zzso In the present study, these cells were used to determine the role of the zzso system in the degradation and zzso of zzso zzso zzso induction for 5 days led to the zzso of zzso with nominal assembly of zzso zzso within zzso When the zzso agent, zzso zzso was added following the termination of zzso zzso zzso clearance was zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased levels of intact zzso were zzso When present during zzso zzso zzso led to zzso zzso and promoted the formation of zzso zzso containing both truncated and full-length zzso zzso treatment significantly decreased the activities of zzso D, B and zzso and the zzso of zzso B and L zzso the effect of zzso and increased zzso levels in zzso Additionally, exposure of cells to the zzso zzso zzso led to zzso zzso and zzso These results suggest that the zzso system plays a role in the clearance of zzso and that dysfunction of this system results in the formation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
