Although it has been proposed that the common zzso zzso gives rise to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso little is known about molecular switches that determine whether zzso develop into either zzso or zzso We used the zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso marker zzso to zzso zzso sorting procedures to further zzso the zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from peripheral zzso We have identified signal zzso and zzso of zzso 5 zzso as a critical zzso that determined lineage commitment between zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso from zzso cells by a zzso zzso approach in the presence of zzso and stem cell factor resulted in an increase in zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso were zzso Furthermore, an increase in cells expressing zzso markers zzso and zzso was observed in zzso zzso cells, as was an increase in the percentage of zzso zzso zzso zzso of activated zzso zzso severely impaired zzso development and induced a robust zzso zzso zzso and quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction analysis revealed changes in expression of a number of zzso including zzso which was zzso by zzso zzso and zzso by activated zzso
