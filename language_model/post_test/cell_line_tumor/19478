zzso is a large, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a wide tissue zzso With the exception of its unique domain I, each of zzso other four zzso shares sequence similarity to other protein families including low density zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha chain, neural cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso members, and zzso growth factor zzso Previous studies demonstrated that zzso zzso domain I supports early zzso and growth factor zzso Other sites in the core protein interact with other zzso molecules and support cell zzso although the zzso sequences involved remain zzso To identify novel functional motifs within zzso we used a zzso approach to predict regions likely to be on the exterior of the folded zzso zzso zzso sequences of about 18 zzso acids were selected for testing in cell zzso zzso A novel zzso sequence zzso from an zzso zzso repeat in domain IV supported rapid cell zzso spreading and focal zzso zzso zzso zzso when compared to other zzso a randomly scrambled sequence of the domain IV zzso or a negative control zzso zzso human zzso cells, zzso cells and zzso zzso cells, but not bone zzso cells, zzso zzso within 30 zzso formed focal zzso and assembled an zzso zzso on domain IV zzso Cell lines zzso zzso to the domain IV zzso suggesting zzso is zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso independent and zzso sensitive, a finding that may explain some previously poorly understood observations obtained with intact zzso zzso these studies demonstrate the feasibility of using zzso strategies to identify novel functional motifs in zzso proteins such as zzso
