As yet, zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso used in clinical practice target a unique site, zzso the zzso zzso With the aim of discovering other potential therapeutic targets in the zzso we studied its zzso domain, a site that proves to be critical for zzso zzso zzso Previous studies from our laboratory highlighted an zzso action associated with a site included in this domain, zzso the zzso zzso zzso a deletion of this sequence produces a zzso activated zzso zzso More interestingly, a synthetic zzso with the zzso sequence zzso elicits in breast cancer cell lines zzso responses that may be ascribed to a competitive mechanism towards the zzso zzso of zzso In the present study, we show that zzso sustains zzso cell growth in zzso culture medium by inducing molecular events promoting zzso phase zzso We zzso moreover, that this zzso activity is associated with zzso down regulation zzso of zzso degradation and repression of zzso gene zzso similar to that induced by zzso zzso zzso studies suggest that our observations may be, at least in part, relevant to a competitive zzso affecting zzso zzso zzso the design of drugs able to stabilize zzso complexes - where the zzso is in an inactive zzso - may be of therapeutic zzso
