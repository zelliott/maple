Our previous study showed that zzso a human acute leukemia cell line, has zzso loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso activity and that its viability is severely affected by zzso zzso zzso In the present study, the nature of the killing action of zzso on zzso was zzso Signs observed in zzso zzso cells indicated that death was due to zzso as demonstrated zzso increased zzso zzso zzso cells, DNA zzso and zzso body zzso loss of zzso zzso potential, the release of zzso c from zzso into the zzso and the zzso of zzso and the zzso of zzso 8, 9, and 3, and the efficient zzso of the zzso process by zzso zzso This zzso appears not to be associated with zzso zzso because the expressions of these proteins were zzso zzso zzso cells showed a high concentration of zzso in zzso Moreover, the increased concentration of zzso in DNA, and the zzso process were not suppressed by the zzso zzso and thus the process is independent of zzso oxygen zzso Of the 18 cancer cell lines treated with zzso 3 cell lines zzso zzso and zzso were found to be committed to zzso and all of these showed very low zzso activity and a marked increase in the concentration of zzso in zzso These observations indicate that in addition to its zzso action, zzso in DNA zzso cell viability by inducing zzso
