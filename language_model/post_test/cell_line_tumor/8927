The diphtheria toxin zzso domain zzso and the zzso zzso zzso are membrane proteins that adopt their final zzso by switching folds from a zzso to a zzso zzso While the exact molecular mechanisms of this transition are not clearly understood in either case, the similarity in the structures of soluble states of the zzso and zzso led to the suggestion that their membrane zzso pathways will be similar, as zzso Previously, we have applied an array of zzso methods to characterize the zzso zzso and membrane zzso of the diphtheria toxin zzso Here, we use the same set of methods to describe the membrane zzso zzso of zzso which allows us to make a direct comparison between both systems with respect to the zzso stability in solution, zzso membrane association, and zzso zzso zzso zzso measured by circular zzso indicates that, unlike the zzso zzso does not undergo a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso resonance energy transfer zzso demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso membrane association modulated by the presence of zzso zzso suggesting that formation of the zzso form occurs close to the membrane zzso zzso zzso of the main zzso zzso hairpin of zzso zzso was studied by zzso attachment of zzso dye zzso In contrast to the zzso of the corresponding zzso hairpin into the zzso zzso of zzso was found not to depend strongly on the presence of zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicate that while zzso and the zzso share structural similarities, their modes of zzso switching and membrane zzso pathways are distinctly zzso
