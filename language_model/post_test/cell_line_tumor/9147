zzso is a highly unstable zzso factor whose deregulation and increased expression are associated with zzso zzso a small synthetic zzso zzso rapid degradation of zzso protein in zzso multiple myeloma and other tumor cell zzso zzso of zzso by zzso requires the presence of a region of zzso between zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso that has not previously been associated with zzso zzso zzso degradation of zzso depends on zzso but is independent of the zzso regions previously shown to be important for zzso targeting and zzso destruction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is not zzso by any previously identified zzso regulatory zzso does not require new protein zzso and does not depend on the nuclear zzso of zzso zzso reduced zzso levels in zzso melanoma cells and in zzso tumors in nude mice, and this activity correlated with tumor growth zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso reduces the stability of zzso in zzso and in zzso through a unique signaling process that uses zzso zzso not previously associated with zzso zzso
