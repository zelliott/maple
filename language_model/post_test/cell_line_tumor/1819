In zzso experiments and mice models have confirmed the importance of zzso 2 zzso in zzso zzso and the progression of human zzso However, the zzso value of zzso in cancer patients remains zzso This study is aimed to investigate the clinical relevance and zzso significance of zzso expression in patients with zzso zzso zzso 

With samples from 240 zzso zzso patients who underwent surgery, zzso was used to investigate zzso expression on tissue zzso The correlation of zzso expression with survival was estimated by the zzso method and zzso Cox zzso hazard zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression in zzso cell lines was detected by Western zzso 

Among the patients, zzso zzso of zzso exhibited zzso of zzso zzso Patients negative for zzso showed poorer survival zzso and increased recurrence zzso zzso analysis further established zzso as an independent predictor of zzso recurrence in zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was associated with highly zzso zzso like vascular invasion and advanced tumor zzso and was positively correlated with the zzso potential of zzso cell zzso 

In the era of molecular targeted therapy, the expression of zzso in zzso may have relevant clinical significance and turn out to be a key factor in zzso assessment and in treatment zzso
