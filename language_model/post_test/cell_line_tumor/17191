Previously we reported that a small rat zzso zzso promoter zzso to zzso zzso zzso would target zzso regulated zzso expression in transgenic zzso Later we demonstrated that a large zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso promoter would target high levels of gene expression to the prostate in transgenic zzso These results suggested that optimal zzso of the zzso gene depended on the presence of zzso regions upstream of the zzso zzso To identify these zzso the zzso zzso was zzso and the zzso activities of restriction fragments were characterized in cell zzso Two zzso zzso zzso binding sites zzso zzso and zzso in an upstream zzso zzso of the zzso gene were zzso One site functions as a weak steroid response element in both zzso and zzso zzso another site acts as a strong steroid response element, which zzso responds to zzso and is zzso activated in zzso zzso These two new zzso interact in a cooperative manner with the previously described zzso response region zzso zzso by zzso to zzso zzso that contains zzso zzso and two zzso zzso binding sites, zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that the context in which the zzso binding sites are present is pivotal in determining their effect on zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso promoter contains a second zzso zzso zzso element zzso zzso in addition to the first described zzso The zzso promoter creates a model that contains six zzso binding sites that function in a cooperative manner for maximum zzso zzso gene zzso
