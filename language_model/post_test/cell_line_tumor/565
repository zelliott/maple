The zzso zzso zzso produces six different zzso that are important in development of zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso of the head and neck zzso In zzso the expression of zzso zzso is highly complex, with zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in many zzso To date, little is known about the functions of different zzso zzso and zzso the distinctive properties of zzso zzso will help to clarify how they influence zzso zzso By gene expression profiling of zzso cells zzso the zzso zzso we identified different effects of the three zzso with zzso being more effective at gene induction than zzso and zzso whereas zzso was most effective at zzso gene zzso Thus, zzso expressing even low levels of zzso or zzso may have distinct zzso characteristics important for zzso and therapeutic zzso zzso of zzso zzso was shown by each zzso and data were confirmed by independent quantitative zzso and western zzso No direct binding of zzso to the zzso promoter could be seen, neither could any evidence for zzso induction as a consequence of activated zzso zzso responses be zzso As zzso is known to inhibit zzso responses in zzso patients, data indicate an additional mechanism through which zzso acts to promote cell survival and influence therapeutic response of zzso zzso data have been deposited in the zzso Express database zzso zzso zzso
