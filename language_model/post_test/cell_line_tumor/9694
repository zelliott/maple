zzso of zzso metabolism is a hallmark of zzso zzso in the genes zzso zzso zzso zzso a key zzso cycle zzso are associated with zzso predisposition to zzso and zzso through mechanisms which are largely zzso Recently, the zzso zzso zzso have emerged as a novel family of zzso zzso zzso with credible functions in zzso Using pharmacological and zzso zzso we show that increased zzso of zzso zzso is a general consequence of zzso zzso in cultured zzso cells and can be reversed by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the core promoter of zzso which encodes a zzso protein zzso after loss of zzso showed decreased occupancy by zzso in the absence of zzso Finally, we provide the first evidence that the chief zzso I) cell is the major zzso zzso constituent of zzso These results support the notion that loss of zzso function alters zzso processes and might provide a signature zzso mark for zzso
