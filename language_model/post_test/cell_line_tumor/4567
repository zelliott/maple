The present study describes the experimental synthetic procedure and the characterization of a new zzso zzso zzso of zzso bearing zzso zzso as targeting zzso In zzso stability studies of zzso performed in media mimicking biological zzso zzso solutions at pH zzso and zzso and in human zzso evidenced the high stability of the targeting portion zzso linkage and the ability of this zzso to release linked zzso in a prolonged way in zzso Moreover, preliminary in zzso zzso studies, carried out on zzso cells, that are zzso zzso positive cells, showed that the zzso zzso has the same cell growing zzso ability of free zzso
