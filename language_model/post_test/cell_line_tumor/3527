zzso zzso and zzso zzso deleted on zzso 10) has been shown to be zzso in a wide variety of zzso and the role of this gene as a tumor zzso has been well zzso On the other hand, results of recent animal studies as well as clinical evidence indicate that zzso is also involved in tumor zzso zzso Although zzso is known to play a key role in controlling cell growth and zzso how zzso exerts the zzso zzso function remains largely zzso Recently, a zzso analysis identified the zzso gene zzso related gene 1) as one of the potential targets of zzso The zzso gene has been shown to suppress tumor zzso in animal models of prostate and colon cancer, and the expression of this gene is significantly reduced with advancement of prostate and breast zzso in clinical zzso In this study, we explored the possibility that zzso controls tumor zzso by regulating the expression of the zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso of zzso significantly zzso the zzso expression of zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso by small interfering zzso decreases zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso We also found that the control of the zzso gene by zzso seems to be at the zzso level, and that a zzso inhibitor restores the zzso zzso indicating that zzso controls zzso by an zzso zzso zzso with these results, our zzso analysis revealed that zzso expression zzso significantly with zzso in both prostate and breast cancer zzso Furthermore, combination of the two zzso zzso and zzso emerged as a significantly better predictor of prostate and breast cancer patient survival than either marker zzso
