The zzso C virus zzso zzso protein has roles in zzso zzso virus zzso and zzso of host zzso zzso is a zzso and it has been proposed that differential zzso could regulate the various roles of the zzso By zzso two forms of zzso with distinct apparent molecular weights can be observed, referred to as zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, the sites of zzso on these two species have not been unequivocally identified, zzso our understanding of the function and regulation of zzso To address this, we zzso zzso zzso from cells harboring a replicating zzso zzso and analyzed the zzso protein by mass zzso We identified six zzso fragments containing 12 zzso zzso and were able to assign four of these to zzso zzso zzso and 225 and zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso spanning zzso 221 to 240 was highly zzso Using zzso we identified roles for a subset of these zzso in virus zzso zzso We further showed that zzso at zzso regulates zzso and by generating a zzso zzso targeted to zzso we identified that zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso by introducing zzso zzso across zzso 221 to zzso we demonstrated changes in the mobility of the zzso zzso species suggestive of a sequential zzso cascade within this zzso zzso We propose that this regulation could drive a zzso switch between the zzso structures of zzso and could also explain the different functions of the protein in the virus life zzso
