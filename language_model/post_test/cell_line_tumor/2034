zzso zzso zzso T cells play important functions in tumor zzso and in certain cases they can directly recognize zzso class zzso tumor zzso However, the underlying mechanism of zzso zzso presentation to zzso T cells by tumor cells has not yet been well zzso We analyzed two naturally occurring human zzso T cell lines specific for different peptides from zzso tumor zzso zzso Whereas both lines had the same zzso restriction and a similar ability to recognize zzso zzso zzso only one zzso T cell line recognized zzso zzso class zzso melanoma zzso zzso of zzso processing in melanoma cells using specific molecular zzso and small interfering zzso revealed a previously zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso class zzso melanoma zzso The presentation required both zzso and zzso zzso processing mechanisms, as well as zzso heat shock protein zzso zzso Such zzso zzso of zzso zzso class II zzso presentation is expected to play an important role in zzso or zzso zzso by various zzso of zzso T cells at the tumor local zzso Furthermore, targeted zzso of zzso zzso T cells by vaccination or adoptive transfer could be a suitable strategy for enhancing the efficacy of tumor zzso
