zzso zzso is a tightly regulated process involving zzso between zzso cells and the host zzso The underlying mechanisms that regulate such interactions remain largely zzso zzso is a zzso zzso whose presence on transformed cells has been demonstrated to increase proliferation in zzso and zzso in zzso To study the effects of zzso during zzso growth and zzso we engineered an zzso positive human zzso cell line zzso from parental zzso negative cells zzso and implanted both cell types zzso into zzso nude rat zzso The zzso were zzso monitored in zzso using zzso zzso employing two differently sized contrast agents zzso and zzso to assess vascular zzso zzso zzso zzso volumes and zzso Comparisons of zzso and zzso revealed differences in their spatial distribution in the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso exhibited a higher zzso of the larger molecular weight zzso and displayed a stronger zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso compared to the controls zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso and electron zzso revealed that the zzso zzso had a higher zzso density zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso compared to controls zzso zzso zzso with vessels that displayed larger gaps between the zzso zzso Thus, zzso cells can regulate both the function and structure of the zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso suggesting a role for zzso in the zzso between zzso zzso
