The zzso inhibitor zzso is emerging as a potent zzso zzso Still, recent clinical trials have revealed a significant secondary toxicity of zzso zzso there is much interest in zzso the mechanism of action of this compound to rationally improve its therapeutic zzso The zzso effect of zzso is frequently characterized by interfering with downstream events derived from the zzso of zzso zzso Here we identify the first chemical agent able to act upstream of the zzso to prevent cell killing by zzso Specifically, we show that the zzso compound zzso can function as a competitive inhibitor of zzso This effect of zzso was surprising, since it is a classical radical spin trap and was expected to zzso zzso oxygen species produced as a consequence of zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso against zzso was selective, since it was not shared by other zzso such as vitamin zzso zzso zzso and zzso Comparative analyses with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed a specificity of zzso for zzso We exploited this novel feature of zzso to define the zzso of no zzso of zzso zzso in melanoma cells and to block cell death in a three-dimensional model of human zzso zzso from zzso lymphoma, breast zzso and zzso cell lung cancer were also responsive to zzso suggesting a broad impact of this agent as a zzso zzso These results may have important implications for the analysis of zzso in zzso and for the design of drug zzso containing zzso zzso
