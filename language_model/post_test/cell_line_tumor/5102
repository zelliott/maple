zzso the structure and dynamics of zzso and zzso in response to different stimuli is a topic of continuing interest in cancer cells as these structures may be attractive targets for therapeutic zzso Interestingly, a close functional relationship between these zzso zzso and specialized membrane zzso has been recently zzso The aim of this study was therefore to investigate the fine organization of these zzso structures and examine how they structurally may relate to zzso membrane zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso For this reason, we designed a straightforward and alternative method to study zzso zzso and their associated structures by means of zzso zzso zzso and electron zzso zzso zzso on whole mounted breast cancer cells revealed that a zzso is composed of an intricate zzso zzso web organized in various patterns after different zzso Both zzso dots and zzso were zzso and were closely interconnected with the surrounding zzso Long zzso filaments were repeatedly observed extending beyond the leading edge and their density and length varied after different zzso Furthermore, zzso also allowed us to demonstrate the close structural association of zzso with the zzso in general and the zzso structural complexes in particular, suggesting that they are all functionally linked and consequently may regulate the cell's fingertip zzso Finally, electron zzso zzso on the same zzso samples confirmed that these extensions are clearly embedded within the zzso zzso of the zzso
