This study investigated the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso negative breast tumor growth both in zzso and in zzso Study results showed that zzso suppresses zzso zzso incorporation indicating cell growth zzso and this was accompanied by cell cycle arrest at the zzso and S stages and zzso zzso Further analyses showed that zzso exhibited cell cycle arrest and zzso activity by decreasing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A, zzso zzso and zzso expression and increasing zzso and zzso zzso zzso mechanisms of action exerted by zzso included the zzso zzso zzso expression followed by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso including the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso at zzso or zzso significantly reduced tumor burden in nude mice zzso with zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso effectively suppresses zzso zzso breast cancer cell growth, and its zzso activity may be partly derived from zzso effects on zzso cell zzso
