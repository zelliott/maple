The role of zzso zzso and the mechanism by which it influences the development and behavior of prostate cancer is zzso Selective zzso zzso may be effective against prostate cancer via zzso zzso But administration of high doses of zzso zzso over longer period of time may not be devoid of side zzso There is increasing interest in using zzso zzso in combination with other zzso agents to overcome the issue of zzso However, the molecular mechanisms underlying their combined actions are not well zzso zzso the present study was designed to determine the effects of low doses of zzso acid zzso in combination with zzso on the molecular targets at the proteins level in rat prostate cancer zzso zzso gel zzso in combination with mass zzso analysis, was used for protein zzso Western zzso analysis confirmed the proteins zzso zzso tissue sections from the rat prostate tumor were used to detect base level expression of heat shock protein 70 zzso and zzso The rate of cancer cell growth was inhibited more effectively zzso zzso zzso by zzso in combination with zzso at lower doses zzso zzso zzso A total number of twelve proteins were zzso expressed by the combined action of zzso and zzso at low zzso It was interesting to note that these agents activated both zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso by the combined actions of zzso and zzso in the presence of zzso zzso reveals a unique zzso independent mode of action against prostate zzso
