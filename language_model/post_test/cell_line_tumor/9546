zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that zzso several key zzso in the de zzso pathways of zzso and zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has demonstrated zzso activity in a broad array of human zzso zzso breast, zzso cell lung cancer, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso head and neck cancer, and is currently in phase III clinical zzso It has been reported that a dose of 600 zzso of zzso showed toxicity to bone zzso and the gastrointestinal zzso The aim of this investigation was to evaluate zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to determine the most effective regimens and cellular mechanism of action to mitigate zzso zzso in human bone zzso zzso 

In order to determine the zzso interaction between zzso zzso and zzso on zzso cell viability was carried out using the zzso Cell zzso zzso by exposing the zzso and zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso and zzso alone, or zzso zzso 24 h prior to zzso followed 2 h later by zzso or zzso zzso 2 h prior to zzso followed 24 h later by zzso 

The growth rate in zzso in early zzso was 69 zzso zzso and late zzso was 36 zzso zzso of the control whereas in bone zzso early zzso was 78 zzso zzso and late zzso was 52 zzso zzso of the zzso The late zzso exhibits significant protection against zzso zzso in bone zzso The findings were further supported by cell flow zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis zzso 

This study suggests that zzso administration of zzso zzso in combination with zzso protects against zzso toxicity in human bone zzso while maintaining the maximum zzso effect of zzso in breast zzso
