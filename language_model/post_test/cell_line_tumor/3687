We reported previously that zzso zzso or zzso synthesis zzso zzso zzso inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression in zzso while they enhance that in zzso Here, we report that the zzso zzso of zzso expression in zzso zzso cells is due to its reduced zzso activity, while the zzso enhancement of zzso expression in zzso zzso is a result of increased stability of zzso protein without zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso via zzso of zzso activity in zzso cells while it was not affected in zzso In both cell types, zzso activities were required for the spontaneous degradation of zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso activity by zzso after maximum increase of zzso protein levels further enhanced zzso protein induction by zzso suggesting the involvement of zzso in zzso zzso More importantly, the zzso protein levels were zzso by the zzso zzso in zzso treated with zzso alone and along with zzso and zzso zzso protein levels were reduced by zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso of zzso of zzso protein and the following increased stability of zzso protein are one of the mechanisms of zzso enhancement of zzso gene expression in zzso To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that zzso regulates zzso expression at the zzso level in zzso
