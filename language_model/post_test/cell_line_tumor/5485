The sodium zzso zzso zzso directs the zzso and concentration of zzso in zzso zzso This in turn allows zzso imaging and therapy for zzso zzso To extend the use of zzso zzso therapy to other types of cancer, we successfully transferred and expressed the zzso zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso and breast cancer cells both in zzso and in zzso by using zzso zzso zzso 

To improve zzso efficiency, we developed a zzso replicating zzso zzso in which the zzso cassette zzso zzso zzso zzso was also inserted at the zzso zzso The zzso gene is driven by the zzso promoter zzso in the zzso zzso 

In zzso infection of the zzso breast cell line zzso resulted in virus zzso zzso and release of zzso viral zzso zzso the zzso breast cancer cell line zzso was zzso to the viral zzso effect and did not support viral zzso The data indicate that zzso activity is zzso restricted to zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso was readily measurable in zzso cells infected with zzso 24 hours after infection, thus confirming zzso expression before zzso cell zzso 

This construct may allow zzso therapy, combining zzso with zzso therapy to be developed as a novel treatment for breast and other zzso zzso
