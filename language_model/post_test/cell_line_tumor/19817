Breast zzso gene 1 zzso also referred as zzso zzso was originally isolated from a human breast cancer zzso library and the protein is mainly localized to zzso terminals in the nervous zzso zzso is not expressed in normal or benign breast zzso but expressed at an extremely high level in the vast majority of the advanced staged breast zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso in cancer cells led to significant increase in cell zzso zzso and zzso and zzso To zzso the molecular mechanism and regulation for abnormal zzso of zzso a variety of zzso promoter zzso reporters were constructed including 3' end deleted zzso zzso deleted, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to detect the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso sequence in zzso region was involved in the zzso zzso activities of zzso without zzso zzso In comparison to zzso the reporter activities of zzso in zzso zzso cells and zzso in zzso cells were notably zzso zzso at zzso sites in zzso zzso 1 significantly reduced the promoter activity in all cell zzso zzso factors, zzso zzso and zzso zzso element binding zzso zzso could markedly enhance the promoter zzso Thus, our results suggest that the abnormal expression of zzso in breast cancer cells is likely regulated by multiple zzso The zzso zzso region of zzso provides the zzso zzso activity without cell type zzso A critical promoter element involved in abnormal expression of zzso presents in the first zzso The cell type specificity of zzso zzso is probably affected through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the first zzso play an important role in control of zzso zzso
