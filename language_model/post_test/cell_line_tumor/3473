zzso in the human cartilage zzso zzso protein zzso gene have been linked to the development of zzso and multiple zzso zzso We previously cloned the promoter region of the zzso gene and delineated a minimal negative regulatory element zzso that is both necessary and sufficient to repress its promoter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Leslie, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 18, zzso zzso zzso zzso Liu, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 22, zzso In this study, a zzso zzso screen for proteins that associate with the zzso led to the identification of the zzso factor zzso a zzso zzso that contains a zzso zzso zinc zzso domain, as an zzso zzso zzso bound directly to the zzso both in zzso and in living zzso Nine zzso zzso in the zzso zzso are essential for binding to zzso zzso showed zzso zzso of zzso reporter gene activity, and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso gene expression in both rat zzso cells and bone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso also inhibited bone zzso zzso zzso in high density zzso cultures of zzso cells, as evidenced by lack of expression of other zzso zzso such as zzso and collagen types II, IX, X, and zzso and by zzso blue zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso and experiments utilizing the zzso inhibitor zzso A revealed that zzso repression requires zzso zzso zzso is the first zzso factor found to bind directly to the zzso gene promoter, to recruit zzso and to regulate both zzso gene expression and zzso zzso
