zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso functions in the zzso of nuclear factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso which can suppress zzso signaling pathways and thus promote resistance to zzso zzso However, it is not known if zzso of zzso is effective in reducing zzso to therapeutic drugs against pancreatic zzso 

zzso activity was measured by zzso reporter zzso in human pancreatic cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso in which zzso expression was silenced by small hairpin zzso zzso zzso activity was targeted in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells with exposure to increasing doses of a selective zzso zzso zzso for 24 zzso To test the effect of zzso in combination with zzso agents, zzso zzso zzso cells, and control cells were treated with increasing doses of zzso zzso or zzso in combination with zzso In zzso activity of oral zzso was evaluated in an zzso nude mouse model zzso zzso 40, 5 per zzso with zzso zzso pancreatic cancer zzso The results of in zzso proliferation were analyzed for statistical significance of differences by zzso zzso zzso differences in mouse survival were determined using a zzso zzso All statistical tests were zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells had a statistically significantly lower zzso activity than did their respective control cell lines zzso zzso activity: zzso mean zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso control, mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso control, mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso both P zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso had potent in zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells, with zzso between 5 and 40 zzso zzso also zzso the zzso of zzso agents zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cells compared with control cells zzso zzso zzso In nude mice, oral administration of zzso plus zzso statistically significantly reduced tumor burden zzso vs zzso plus zzso P zzso zzso and prolonged survival duration zzso zzso zzso 82 days vs zzso plus zzso 122 zzso hazard ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso 

The results of this study suggest that genetic zzso or zzso of zzso zzso activity in zzso is a potential therapeutic approach to reversal of the intrinsic zzso of pancreatic zzso
