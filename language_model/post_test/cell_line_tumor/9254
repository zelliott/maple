To investigate the effect of zzso on human zzso cell line zzso 

The effects of 24 h and 48 h incubation with different zzso zzso to approximately 64 zzso of the zzso on zzso cells were evaluated using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was conducted to distinguish the zzso cell, and the appearance of zzso stage was determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso the percentage of zzso cell was determined by flow zzso following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed to analyze the cell cycle distribution and the zzso membrane potential zzso the expression of activated zzso and zzso was analyzed by zzso 

The proliferation of zzso was decreased after treatment with zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso could induce zzso in zzso cells and could cause cell cycle arrest in zzso phase, to induce loss of zzso membrane potential zzso and activate zzso and zzso zzso zzso could be blocked by the broad zzso inhibitor zzso 

zzso exerts zzso effects on human zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso could be attributed partly to its zzso of cell proliferation and induction of zzso in cancer cells through loss in zzso zzso potential and zzso zzso
