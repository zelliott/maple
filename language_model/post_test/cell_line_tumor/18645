zzso zzso is a highly coordinated process involving orchestrated expression of a number of zzso Although the essential role of zzso alpha zzso for the normal development of secondary zzso zzso is well established, it is not clear to which extent it depends upon cooperation with T and B zzso for zzso zzso To determine whether zzso is sufficient to mediate recruitment of basic elements needed for zzso zzso we made use of a zzso cell line as an experimental tool and established tumors in nude and zzso zzso Our data showed that high zzso zzso formed and zzso zzso cells accumulated and differentiated in response to zzso in the absence of zzso A zzso cell population that is found in the secondary zzso organ was also recruited into tumors expressing zzso Furthermore, in nude mice, B cells migrated in response to zzso and formed zzso zzso These B cell zzso were structurally well equipped with zzso zzso cell networks and high zzso zzso however, they were not functionally zzso zzso those B cells specific for a surrogate zzso expressed by the tumor were found in the zzso but not in the zzso We show that, even in the absence of functional T and B zzso local expression of zzso in transplanted tumors induced typical zzso characteristics of zzso zzso emphasizing that zzso is a critically important zzso for formation of zzso organ zzso
