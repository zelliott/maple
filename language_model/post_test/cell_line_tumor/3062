zzso have emerged as critical regulators of tumor progression and zzso by modulating different biological events including zzso cell zzso zzso migration, zzso and immune zzso zzso zzso zzso might represent novel therapeutic agents for zzso 

A series of structural zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were screened as potential zzso zzso by examining their capability to block binding of zzso and/or zzso to zzso in zzso zzso To demonstrate any functional role in zzso zzso were characterized by their ability to regulate tumor cell zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso 

zzso zzso inhibited binding of each zzso to zzso zzso containing longer zzso chains were found to be potent zzso of both zzso under zzso zzso zzso the most active compound in zzso zzso cell zzso and tumor cell zzso was found to be zzso zzso which paradoxically exhibited a modest zzso capacity for blocking zzso and zzso binding to zzso 

zzso zzso represents a novel powerful inhibitor of zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso Further investigations are required to zzso selective and potent zzso capable of specifically modulating the activity of different members of the zzso zzso
