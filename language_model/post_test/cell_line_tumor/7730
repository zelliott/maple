zzso therapy to the zzso growth factor zzso zzso seems to be related to its expression level on tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso growth zzso but also may zzso the zzso expression in some cancer cell zzso We aimed to determine whether the zzso combined with an zzso zzso zzso zzso may affect the growth of human tumor zzso cell lines with different zzso expression zzso zzso a lung zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso zzso cell lines express intermediate and high levels of zzso respectively, whereas zzso zzso a breast zzso cell line expresses zzso levels of zzso measured by flow zzso We found that zzso alone inhibited in a zzso fashion the growth of all cell lines, but only zzso the zzso expression in the lung zzso cell zzso zzso the combined treatment did not modify the zzso zzso of the zzso although the zzso activity of zzso in zzso cells in zzso increased when an zzso treatment was zzso In conclusion, this study may provide insights about the rational use of zzso zzso into the zzso management of targeted therapies including the zzso for lung zzso
