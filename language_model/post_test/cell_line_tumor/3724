zzso are the major components of the zzso zzso and zzso of these proteins are associated with several important human zzso Here we report the cloning and sequencing of bovine zzso the first zzso cloned from a large domestic zzso The bovine sequence proves to be generally more similar to that of human zzso than the previously described zzso zzso suggesting that bovine zzso are a useful model for zzso studies of application to zzso However, we noted some unusual features within the 16 zzso zzso type zzso repeats and also note that the number of these repeats zzso well with the size of zzso We also characterized two in zzso zzso zzso sites by direct zzso sequencing, finding that both are located in the zzso acid rich E zzso Finally, we show zzso that the more abundant and stable of these zzso fragments can also be detected in zzso
