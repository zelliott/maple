zzso of zzso zzso at the 3' end is guided by the zzso zzso which is a component of a larger zzso processing zzso To identify other components of this complex, we isolated proteins that zzso associate with a zzso of zzso zzso containing all necessary processing elements and a zzso affinity tag at the zzso zzso Among the isolated zzso we identified three zzso processing factors: the zzso binding protein zzso which interacts with the zzso structure upstream of the zzso site, and both zzso and zzso which are components of the zzso zzso zzso We also identified zzso a zzso 3' zzso that is known to trim the 3' end of zzso zzso zzso primarily binds to the downstream portion of the zzso structure in mature zzso zzso with the upstream portion being occupied by zzso The two proteins bind their respective zzso sites in a cooperative manner, and zzso can recruit zzso to a zzso zzso that itself does not interact with zzso zzso studies used to characterize interactions within the processing complex demonstrated that zzso also interacts in a zzso manner with zzso zzso zzso However, this interaction is not required for the zzso zzso The region between the zzso site and the zzso site interacts with three zzso zzso which were identified as components of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These proteins likely zzso the zzso and function as the molecular ruler in determining the site of zzso
