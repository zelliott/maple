zzso resistance to current drugs prevents zzso treatment of human colon zzso A pressing need for effective, zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is zzso in zzso of human colon zzso and represents a zzso drug zzso zzso human zzso colon cancer cells were zzso zzso with two distinct zzso zzso of zzso Their response to zzso to zzso the active zzso of zzso zzso active in colon zzso and to zzso of the death zzso zzso was compared with zzso control cells in terms of cell cycle arrest and zzso Both zzso forms of zzso zzso cells to zzso induced by zzso and zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso harboring zzso forms of zzso carrying function blocking point zzso in zzso or zzso zzso were similarly sensitive to zzso suggesting that reduction in zzso activity and not a zzso zzso scaffold function was responsible for the observed altered zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso was dependent on zzso of zzso 8 and associated with Bid zzso Each of the stable cell lines in which zzso zzso of zzso were expressed had reduced levels of zzso However, zzso of zzso zzso activity by zzso in zzso control cells did not alter the zzso response over 72 h nor did it reduce zzso zzso The data suggest that longer term suppression of zzso zzso activity may be required to lower zzso levels and sensitize colon cancer cells to zzso zzso
