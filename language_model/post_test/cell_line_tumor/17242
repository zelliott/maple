The zzso family is a group of potent zzso factors that are essential for T cell zzso in zzso However, zzso zzso cells display zzso in response to zzso suggesting that zzso functions as a negative regulator of zzso cell zzso In this study we show that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a direct target gene of zzso and that zzso zzso cells are unable to fully zzso zzso upon zzso Restoration of zzso expression in zzso partly zzso the zzso of zzso zzso cells by attenuating zzso zzso Our data, therefore, depict a zzso negative feedback mechanism of T cell zzso
