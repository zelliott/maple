A series of symmetrical zzso zzso zzso with either zzso or zzso metal zzso and two bulky zzso zzso on the silicon complexes was zzso in high zzso The zzso zzso zzso fluorescence, and zzso oxygen quantum zzso and cellular zzso zzso and zzso zzso properties of this series of zzso were zzso The zzso exist mainly as zzso in zzso media and have higher fluorescent quantum yields in zzso zzso zzso and water) than the zzso The presence of eight short zzso groups at the periphery of a zzso significantly increases its zzso in zzso zzso but a centrally zzso silicon zzso and associated bulky zzso zzso were more efficient in preventing zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso oxygen quantum yields for this series of zzso in zzso are in the range zzso All zzso were readily taken up by human zzso cells, and the extent of their zzso within cells depends on their zzso zzso zzso all zzso localized zzso within the cell zzso The zzso 11 and zzso 12 and 14 were found to be the most zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at a 1 J zzso light zzso of this series of zzso
