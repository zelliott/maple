zzso zzso zzso zzso type 1 zzso is expressed not only in normal human pancreatic zzso cells but also in a variety of pancreatic zzso zzso There are structural similarities between zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso we hypothesized that zzso binds to zzso zzso zzso to activate its downstream zzso We first showed that zzso induced proliferation of zzso zzso cells and pancreatic cancer cell zzso We showed that zzso zzso with zzso in an zzso experiment and that the binding affinity of zzso to zzso was about half of that of zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso As expected, zzso and its downstream zzso signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3, zzso zzso zzso viral zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1/2, were zzso by zzso as well as zzso To determine which zzso is the most important for cell growth, we further analyzed the effect of zzso Growth stimulation by zzso or zzso was completely inhibited by zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor but not by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso To further analyze the clinical importance of zzso in the development of pancreatic cancer, we examined the expression of zzso and zzso in pancreatic zzso zzso and pancreatic zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso were zzso not only in the early stage of cancer, zzso but also in advanced zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso stimulates the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells through the zzso protein zzso zzso
