zzso zzso can be used as imaging agents and for potential zzso of folate zzso zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso However, substantial zzso expression in the zzso results in zzso zzso retention of zzso Recently, we found that the zzso of an zzso significantly improved tumor selectivity of zzso zzso in zzso The aim of this study was to corroborate the effect of zzso with the clinically tested zzso zzso is zzso zzso in a human zzso cancer zzso mouse zzso 

In zzso studies were performed in female zzso nude mice bearing subcutaneous zzso zzso tumors zzso and zzso or zzso (after zzso zzso cell zzso zzso studies were performed 1, 4, and 24 h after administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with or without zzso of zzso zzso 400 zzso 1 h before the zzso Images were acquired with a zzso zzso zzso camera, 4 and 24 h after injection of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso studies the tumor zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso injected dose per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 h after zzso was high and retained over the time of zzso However, considerable retention of zzso was found in zzso zzso zzso 4 h after zzso resulting in unfavorably low zzso ratios ( approximately zzso zzso of zzso resulted in a significant reduction of zzso zzso zzso of control values, P zzso zzso at all time points after injection of zzso whereas the tumor zzso was zzso Thus, the zzso ratio was significantly increased to approximately zzso zzso images confirmed the superior zzso ratio in mice injected with zzso These findings were particularly evident in mice with zzso zzso that could be zzso only when zzso was administered in combination with zzso 

The application of zzso resulted in a significant reduction of zzso zzso zzso in zzso whereas the tumor zzso remained zzso These observations suggest a general zzso of the reducing effect of zzso on the zzso of zzso in zzso Our findings will lead the way toward the development of zzso zzso
