zzso cancer is among the most aggressive solid zzso It is possible that pancreatic cancer contains cancer stem cells responsible for its zzso The purposes of this study were zzso to establish an zzso in which a subset of pancreatic cancer cell line zzso cells with stem cell properties can zzso and zzso to identify the cells obtained from this zzso 

The zzso cells were cultured in zzso modified eagle medium zzso supplemented with zzso growth factor, basic zzso growth factor, insulin, zzso zzso and bovine serum zzso at a density of 1000 zzso for 10 to 14 days to form zzso zzso of spheres were cultured in different conditions to evaluate their ability of zzso and zzso zzso formation zzso and tumor formation zzso were used to identify the ability of propagation in zzso and in zzso The cells and spheres were also stained by using zzso zzso dye to evaluate their capacity of excluding zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction was used to detect expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

A zzso of zzso cells could zzso to form spheres in this zzso zzso of obtained spheres had the hallmark of excluding zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso the zzso single cells of primary spheres could form zzso spheres zzso cultured in zzso zzso these cells generated both the cells with the ability of excluding zzso zzso dye and the cells without that zzso The propagation capacity of zzso spheres was higher than that of cells cultured in zzso medium both in zzso and in zzso In addition, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso in zzso zzso 

A zzso of zzso cells can zzso to form spheres with properties of stem cells in this zzso enough of these cells can be obtained for further zzso Considering the zzso of zzso it was tentatively suggested that zzso zzso and zzso proteins may act as surface markers for sorting pancreatic cancer stem cells with zzso cell zzso cell zzso
