Triple negative breast zzso zzso lacking hormone receptors and zzso amplification are very aggressive zzso Since relevant differences between primary tumors and zzso could arise during tumor progression as evidenced by zzso zzso reported for hormonal receptors or zzso zzso in this analysis we studied changes that occurred in our zzso model zzso throughout the development of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso in nude mice, using an zzso protein array to characterize their expression zzso We also analyzed their growth zzso migration, zzso and zzso structure in zzso and in zzso In zzso zzso cells grew slower but showed higher zzso independent zzso In zzso zzso tumors grew significantly faster and showed a zzso zzso of zzso zzso after zzso zzso although no zzso was observed for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were strongly zzso in zzso while zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were the most zzso proteins in the zzso cell zzso zzso protein expression profile could reflect a higher zzso zzso in these zzso In zzso zzso displayed higher migration but zzso had more elevated zzso invasion zzso In agreement with that zzso zzso had an zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso tumors presented also higher local zzso invasion than zzso but similar zzso vessel zzso zzso and zzso expression were higher both in zzso and in zzso for zzso zzso expressed more zzso than zzso cells, which was mainly localized in the cellular zzso and both cell lines are zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso cells have acquired a pronounced zzso transition zzso zzso expression changes observed between primary zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells suggest potential targets involved in the control of zzso
