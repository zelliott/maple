Though prostate cancer is often indolent, it is nonetheless a leading cause of cancer zzso Defining the underlying molecular genetic zzso may lead to new strategies for prevention or zzso zzso this goal, we performed zzso comparative zzso zzso zzso on 86 primary prostate zzso Among the most frequent zzso not associated with a known cancer zzso we identified focal deletions within zzso in 15 out of 86 zzso zzso By high-resolution zzso array zzso the smallest common deletion targeted just one zzso the zzso remodeler zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso zzso of zzso was significantly reduced in tumors with deletion zzso and compared with normal prostate zzso zzso sequencing analysis also uncovered zzso zzso in 1 out of 7 zzso cell lines zzso and in 1 out of 24 zzso prostate tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in two zzso prostate zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso did not alter cell growth, but promoted cell zzso and in zzso cell zzso Taken together, our findings suggest that zzso deletion may zzso cell zzso in a subset of prostate zzso and indicate a possible novel role of altered zzso zzso in prostate zzso
