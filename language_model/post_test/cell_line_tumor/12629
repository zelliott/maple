zzso zzso is zzso on zzso cells of growing vessels as well as on several tumor types, and so zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have attracted increasing interest for in zzso imaging of zzso zzso expression by zzso zzso zzso zzso Of the zzso derivatives available for imaging applications, systems zzso multiple zzso zzso have recently been shown to exhibit highly favorable properties in relation to zzso To assess the synthetic limits of the zzso approach and thus the maximum zzso size achievable by using different efficient zzso zzso we prepared a variety of zzso that were further investigated in zzso with regard to their zzso to zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso containing increasing numbers of zzso zzso on zzso zzso scaffolds were prepared by different click chemistry zzso zzso A zzso zzso was the largest construct that could be zzso under zzso reaction conditions, thus identifying the current synthetic limitations for zzso zzso The obtained zzso systems were zzso to a new zzso zzso developed for the zzso of zzso demanding structures and successfully labeled with zzso for a potential in zzso zzso The evaluated zzso showed very high zzso with the number of zzso zzso in zzso studies on immobilized zzso zzso and zzso cells, of up to zzso and zzso respectively, relative to the zzso zzso
