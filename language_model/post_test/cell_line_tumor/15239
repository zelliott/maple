zzso group zzso 2 zzso protein acts as an zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso its expression can be induced by a variety of growth factors such as zzso growth zzso zzso and zzso growth zzso zzso as well as by zzso bovine serum zzso thus enhancing zzso 

To examine these effects in zzso zzso we used the zzso prostate cancer cell line for zzso proliferation and zzso expression in response to incubation with growth factors and zzso The zzso locus was investigated by zzso in zzso zzso zzso for loss, amplification or zzso 

zzso is a cell line that moderately zzso zzso None of the growth factors nor zzso caused significantly increased expression of zzso In contrast, a significantly zzso proliferation rate was observed when applying zzso or zzso for 12 zzso 

zzso is expressed independently of external zzso whereas proliferation zzso by growth factors is independent of further elevated zzso zzso
