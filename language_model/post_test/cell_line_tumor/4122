zzso cells urgently require an efficient therapy to improve drug zzso Here we show a critical role for zzso combined with gene therapy, using zzso of a zzso zzso zzso in improving zzso sensitivity of zzso cells with a strong zzso of tumor cell growth in zzso and in zzso The effects may be associated with enhancement of zzso platinum zzso via decreased zzso and improvement of zzso resistance via increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso The combined therapy may efficiently inhibit cell invasion and migration via deceased zzso zzso zzso and zzso to suppress zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso chemotherapy combined with targeting the zzso axis is an attractive strategy to treat zzso zzso
