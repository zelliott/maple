Three zzso protein zzso implement cellular responses to DNA zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respond primarily to DNA zzso breaks zzso zzso and zzso zzso signals the zzso of replication protein A zzso zzso DNA zzso which is caused by replication zzso zzso replication zzso can further zzso and yield zzso zzso In this paper, we show that the juxtaposition of a zzso DNA end and a short zzso gap triggered robust zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in human zzso zzso This DNA damage signal depended on zzso and zzso which zzso onto gapped linear duplex zzso zzso primed zzso zzso through DNA zzso zzso of zzso and zzso The synergistic zzso of zzso and zzso suggests that the two zzso combine to mount a prompt and specific response to zzso zzso
