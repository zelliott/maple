zzso of primary zzso zzso for studying zzso biology are notoriously difficult to zzso One alternative is the use of zzso cell zzso Because the zzso cells are the most widely used cell line in cartilage research, we investigated the molecular zzso of these cells by zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso cells were cultured to zzso zzso and zzso primary human zzso were grown in zzso culture and zzso cultures and several other zzso cell lines were cultured as zzso zzso was isolated and analyzed by zzso array profiling using zzso zzso zzso and quantitative zzso 

Important similarities, but also remarkable differences between the zzso cells and adult human zzso zzso were zzso zzso and several cartilage typical zzso as well as zzso transcripts were strongly expressed in zzso cells, whereas zzso cells expressed hardly any zzso cartilage zzso degrading zzso Of all zzso conditions, zzso analysis showed that zzso cultured at zzso are most closely related to primary zzso 

Our study confirms how careful one needs to be in choosing in zzso model systems for investigating effects of zzso The major issue of zzso cell lines appears to be that they mainly zzso and show less expression of genes of zzso synthesis and zzso A successful approach will have to select suitable zzso cell lines and to validate findings obtained using primary zzso This allows to establish a zzso in zzso model showing the property of interest and subsequently to relate back the obtained results to the zzso zzso
