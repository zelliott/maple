Recent reports have shown that the zzso zzso zzso stress is relevant to the zzso of zzso zzso Following the zzso cascade hypothesis, we therefore attempted to investigate the effects of zzso stress on zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we found that zzso stress altered the zzso of zzso precursor protein zzso from late compartments to early compartments of the zzso pathway, and decreased the level of zzso 40 and zzso 42 release by zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso also caused a shift of zzso and a reduction in zzso zzso It was revealed that the zzso stress response facilitated binding of zzso to zzso thereby causing it to be retained in the early compartments apart from a location suitable for the zzso of zzso These findings suggest that induction of zzso during zzso stress may be one of the regulatory mechanisms of zzso zzso
