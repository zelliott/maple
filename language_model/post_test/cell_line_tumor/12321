In the present study, we characterized the binding site of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso on the surface of T zzso These peptides had been able to inhibit zzso zzso zzso signal by blocking the zzso of immune zzso Both peptides prefer to bind to the closed form of zzso zzso indicating that two peptides act as zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso site mapping using zzso zzso proposes that zzso binds to around zzso zzso of zzso zzso where this site is adjacent to the metal zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso binds to the pocket called zzso where is distant from metal zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping between two peptides show that zzso could inhibit the binding of zzso but not vice versa, suggesting that zzso has some properties that allow this zzso bind to more than one zzso zzso comparison between zzso and zzso reveals that zzso is more flexible than zzso allowing this zzso bind to exposed region, such as zzso site as well as cramped pocket like zzso Our findings are important for understanding the selectivity of zzso and zzso zzso thus, they can be zzso with drugs and transported specifically to the zzso
