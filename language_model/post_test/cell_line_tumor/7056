zzso precursor zzso is a novel growth zzso Our earlier zzso zzso study indicated that zzso was zzso in zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the clinical significance of zzso expression and its potential as a therapeutic target in zzso 

A total of 110 pairs of zzso and adjacent zzso liver zzso and 22 normal liver zzso were zzso The zzso zzso level was examined by quantitative reverse zzso and protein zzso by zzso The zzso function was examined by zzso zzso 

The zzso levels of the zzso were significantly higher than those of the zzso liver zzso and normal zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso was observed in tumor zzso and the zzso protein levels of the zzso were also significantly higher than those of the zzso liver zzso and normal zzso zzso zzso The majority of zzso demonstrated zzso of zzso protein compared with their adjacent liver zzso zzso zzso of zzso Positive correlation of zzso zzso with protein levels was observed in zzso zzso zzso Strong zzso expression was associated with large zzso zzso zzso and early zzso recurrence zzso zzso zzso studies on the zzso cell line zzso demonstrated that reduction of zzso protein levels resulted in decreased cell proliferation rates, tumor invasion ability, zzso growth in soft zzso and zzso in nude mice zzso zzso 

zzso is an important factor for zzso growth, invasion, and zzso zzso has the potential to serve as a tumor marker and therapeutic zzso
