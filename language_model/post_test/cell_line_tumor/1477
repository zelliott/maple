A persistent inflammatory reaction is a hallmark of chronic and acute zzso in the central nervous system zzso and greatly zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso plays a pivotal role in the initiation and progression of inflammatory processes provoking zzso stress, zzso zzso and the production of zzso zzso We established in zzso cells that zzso exposure dramatically increased zzso neutral zzso zzso activity thus generating the zzso zzso zzso zzso essential for subsequent zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Since many of the zzso effects of zzso are attributable to its zzso we examined whether zzso zzso zzso converting zzso to zzso is implicated both in zzso zzso and enhanced zzso production in zzso zzso In the present study, we demonstrated that zzso exposure of human zzso zzso caused a profound increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso activity using either zzso or pharmacology completely negated zzso zzso and zzso zzso yet, more importantly, rescued zzso viability in the presence of zzso These findings provided evidence for a critical function of zzso and thus zzso activity in directly linking zzso metabolism to zzso zzso This vital role of zzso in zzso inflammation could provide a novel therapeutic approach to intervene with the adverse consequences of a progressive zzso zzso
