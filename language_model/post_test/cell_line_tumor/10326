Human zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that can inhibit cancer zzso The molecular mechanism of zzso tumor growth zzso is incompletely zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene therapy on cervical cancer has not been yet zzso In this study, the zzso zzso was used to explore tumor growth suppression effects on cervical cancer in zzso and in zzso The results showed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso delivery resulted in a more differential tumor growth zzso and this growth arrest was caused by cell cycle zzso at zzso zzso In addition, zzso a zzso zzso and zzso a member of zzso zzso family, were increased in the sample of cervical cancer tissue treated by zzso Further, it was also observed that zzso was activated and the expression of zzso zzso was zzso These results indicated that the growth zzso effects of zzso on cervical cancer were caused by elevated expression of zzso and decreased the ratio of zzso to zzso zzso zzso
