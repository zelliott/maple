zzso zzso zzso represent a large family of zzso identified as key regulators of zzso zzso zzso a major zzso event that controls zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso has been associated with profound zzso in cellular zzso We have thus hypothesized that an altered zzso expression may favor cancer zzso To test this possibility, we have sought to screen the expression profiles of several class I and class II zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso human prostate cancer cell lines as well as in matched zzso and zzso prostate zzso by use of real time zzso zzso and zzso All zzso transcripts tested were detected at various levels in all prostate cancer cell lines and tissue samples zzso In prostate zzso the abundance of zzso zzso which was exclusively expressed in the cell nucleus, was similar in normal and zzso zzso cells, but was usually lower in zzso zzso zzso zzso another class I zzso was not detected in zzso cells but was uniquely expressed in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso a class II zzso involved in zzso was not detected in the zzso Altogether, our findings indicate that zzso and zzso cells exhibit distinct class I zzso expression profiles, and the abundance of zzso is not altered in human prostate zzso In addition, our observations are the first to demonstrate the prominently zzso distribution of a class I zzso zzso
