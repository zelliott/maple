zzso in the zzso gene lead to zzso or zzso inherited peripheral zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso is a zzso zzso factor whose activity is dependent on the zzso factors zzso and zzso Unlike other zzso zzso factors, zzso zzso or zzso does not influence the zzso of cells to zzso zzso zzso inherited zzso forms of zzso zzso have reduced zzso activity, whereas zzso inherited forms zzso interfere with zzso zzso Only the expression of zzso increases the production of zzso leads to uneven zzso zzso zzso and enhances the zzso to zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso zzso promotes zzso without increasing the risk of zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso are associated with reduced zzso activity, while dominant zzso impair zzso fusion and cause zzso zzso Thus, different cellular mechanisms that disturb zzso dynamics zzso the similar clinical manifestations caused by zzso zzso depending on the mode of zzso
