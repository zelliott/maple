Our aim was to investigate the influence of zzso zzso zzso in human colon zzso zzso cells on the ability of human zzso vein zzso cell zzso migration, proliferation and its possible zzso zzso zzso expression was detected by reverse zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso basic zzso growth factor zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expressions were detected by western zzso The influence of zzso hairpin zzso on the ability of zzso migration and proliferation were observed by zzso migration and Counting zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and western zzso results showed that the expression of zzso in zzso cells was decreased and expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in those cells were lower than that in the zzso and zzso groups ( zzso zzso zzso showed that migratory zzso rate for zzso was decreased zzso in zzso zzso zzso moreover, zzso zzso showed that the proliferation of zzso cultured with the zzso of zzso cells was also comparatively zzso zzso concluding that zzso zzso could inhibit the ability of zzso migration and proliferation by zzso the activity of zzso in zzso cells that in turn decreases zzso factors such as zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso of zzso and zzso
