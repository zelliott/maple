zzso evidence has revealed that zzso may be beneficial for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases through removal of abnormal protein zzso However, the critical zzso events during zzso remain to be zzso Here, we investigated whether zzso zzso events occur in the zzso zzso zzso cell line upon exposure to zzso zzso zzso ), a well-known zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment induced both zzso and zzso characteristics of zzso such as zzso of zzso zzso and zzso form and decreased zzso zzso Further investigation revealed that these phenomena were largely the consequences of blocked zzso zzso Following zzso zzso treatment, levels of zzso formed and zzso dramatically increased in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso proteins also increased in this zzso Further zzso analyses revealed that the zzso spots positive for both zzso and zzso were more intense following zzso zzso treatment, suggesting drug-induced enrichment of these two proteins in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso mainly zzso with zzso form following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso form of zzso zzso zzso , which zzso zzso processing, dramatically decreased binding between zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso can be efficiently localized to zzso compartments via preferential binding with zzso zzso This zzso may assist in removal of zzso forms of damaged cellular proteins during zzso zzso impairment of zzso zzso
