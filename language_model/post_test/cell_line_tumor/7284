To investigate the zzso effects of plant extracts and zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso which is a popular zzso herbal tea and folk medicine in zzso zzso and other medications zzso 

zzso zzso zzso formation, and cell migration zzso were used for the valuation of zzso of target plant extracts and zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso and various spectral analyses were used to identify active fraction and zzso for zzso 

We show that an zzso zzso zzso fraction of zzso zzso exhibited significant zzso proliferation and zzso formation activities against human zzso vein zzso cells zzso zzso zzso led to isolation of one new and one known zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, from the zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso highly specific and significant activities against zzso proliferation with zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso respectively, however, compound 1 had a more potent effect on preventing tube formation of zzso than compound 2 at a dose of zzso zzso Western zzso analysis showed that both compounds zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

This is the first report to demonstrate that zzso possess significant zzso activities and the ability to regulate the expression of cell cycle zzso for example, zzso zzso or zzso zzso
