Recent studies have shown that zzso a component of cigarette smoke, can stimulate the proliferation of zzso zzso While nicotine is not zzso by itself, it has been shown to induce cell proliferation and zzso Here we find that zzso effects of nicotine in zzso cell lung zzso zzso are analogous to those of growth factors and involve zzso of zzso induction of zzso interaction, and zzso of zzso Analysis of human zzso tumors show enhanced levels of zzso complexes compared with adjacent normal zzso The zzso effects of nicotine were zzso via the zzso zzso and resulted in enhanced recruitment of zzso and zzso on zzso promoters in zzso cell lines and human lung zzso zzso stimulation of zzso cells caused zzso of zzso from these zzso zzso signaling via zzso zzso receptors zzso required the scaffolding protein zzso zzso of zzso or disruption of the zzso interaction blocked zzso proliferation of zzso Additionally, suppression of zzso also blocked zzso of zzso suppressed levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso binding in response to zzso It appears that nicotine zzso cell proliferation by zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso
