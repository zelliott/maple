Human zzso is involved in the maintenance and progression of several diseases such as multiple myeloma zzso zzso arthritis, or zzso Our previous work demonstrated that an zzso zzso zzso (named zzso possessed potential zzso to antagonize the function of zzso and could efficiently induce the growth arrest and zzso of zzso and zzso cells in a zzso zzso In this study, the theoretical interaction of the zzso zzso with its zzso was analyzed further more with molecular zzso and molecular dynamics zzso The theoretical studies showed that zzso possessed very high affinity to zzso and offered a practical means of imposing long-term blockade of zzso activity in zzso According to the theoretical results, the biological evaluation of zzso was researched on two different cells models with more sensitive zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso was studied on the zzso dependent zzso cells zzso cultured with zzso In the other zzso dependent zzso cells zzso they survived themselves by zzso without the zzso zzso and also could be antagonized by zzso The therapeutic value of zzso only limited on the zzso dependent category in zzso zzso zzso leukemia zzso cells were induced for growth arrest and zzso in response to zzso The results supported our previous findings and showed that zzso could be evaluated by protecting the cells from zzso induced zzso In conclusion, zzso could induce zzso zzso and zzso cells to zzso while inhibit zzso zzso in zzso zzso
