zzso is a necessary step in the zzso and zzso trafficking of many plasma membrane proteins and can also influence protein trafficking in the zzso zzso Although a molecular understanding of zzso in these processes is beginning to emerge, very little is known about the role zzso may zzso Fat Facets in mouse zzso is zzso zzso zzso highly expressed in zzso where it interacts with its zzso zzso Here we show, in the polarized zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso localized to multiple points of protein zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso in zzso cells but only in zzso zzso zzso extensively zzso with zzso in zzso zzso but not at sites of zzso contact as well as zzso with zzso and zzso from a higher molecular weight complex ( approximately 500 zzso At zzso zzso neither zzso with, nor zzso zzso or zzso which were predominantly in a larger molecular weight complex ( approximately 2 zzso at the cell zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells resulted in increased zzso levels, which localized to the plasma zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso resulted in the zzso of zzso from the zzso to zzso zzso These data strongly suggest that zzso associates with zzso and zzso during trafficking to the plasma zzso
