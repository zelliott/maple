The possibility that a zzso 50 zzso magnetic field with a magnetic flux density of 1 zzso can damage zzso zzso zzso and induce variations in the invasive properties of these three-dimensional model systems after 2 days of exposure was zzso Specifically, possible damage induced by these fields was examined by determining changes in zzso surface zzso zzso zzso growth zzso diameter and protein content zzso zzso zzso release, and reduced zzso zzso zzso changes in the invasive properties were studied by invasion zzso The results show no induction of cell damage by zzso fields while invasion chamber zzso demonstrate a significant increase in the invasive potential of exposed zzso In order to determine if the zzso or zzso receptors are involved, Western zzso analysis was conducted on these two zzso No significant variations were observed in either zzso in zzso zzso tumor zzso
