Various zzso E zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso 1000 zzso have been extensively studied as a zzso zzso in various drug delivery zzso However, limited information is available about the zzso relationship of zzso E zzso as a zzso zzso for zzso zzso In this study, four zzso E zzso were developed that vary in the molecular weight of zzso zzso vs zzso and the zzso ratio of zzso E zzso vs zzso in the zzso These zzso were systematically characterized with respect to zzso zzso loading efficiency, stability, and their efficiency in delivery of zzso to tumor cells in zzso and in zzso Our data show that zzso have lower zzso values and are more effective in zzso loading with respect to both loading capacity and zzso The zzso with two Vitamin E molecules also worked better than the zzso with one zzso of Vitamin zzso particularly for zzso Furthermore, all of the zzso E zzso can induce significant suppression of zzso zzso More importantly, zzso zzso resulted in significantly improved tumor growth zzso effect in comparison to zzso formulated in zzso or zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso in a zzso mouse model of breast cancer zzso Our study suggests that zzso zzso may hold promise as an improved zzso zzso for in zzso delivery of zzso agents such as zzso
