zzso derived from zzso zzso and used to treat zzso diabetes, zzso zzso and zzso has been recently shown to antagonize the zzso X zzso and decrease the expression of zzso zzso zzso Because zzso of zzso has been closely linked with inflammatory diseases affected by zzso we zzso that it must zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we tested this hypothesis by investigating the effect of this steroid on the zzso of zzso induced by inflammatory agents and zzso zzso suppressed DNA binding of zzso induced by tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, cigarette smoke zzso hydrogen zzso and zzso zzso zzso was not cell zzso because both zzso and leukemia cells were zzso zzso also suppressed zzso zzso zzso expressed in most tumor zzso Through zzso of zzso zzso zzso this steroid blocked zzso zzso and degradation, thus suppressing zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso reporter gene zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was also blocked by zzso but without affecting zzso gene zzso In addition, zzso decreased the expression of gene products involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proliferation zzso D1 and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso this correlated with enhancement of zzso induced by zzso and zzso zzso Overall, our results indicate that zzso suppresses zzso and zzso gene products, which may explain its zzso zzso
