zzso (a natural zzso zzso is a zzso zzso compound found in a variety of zzso It has been demonstrated to exert zzso activity against a variety of human cancer cell lines, including the human zzso cell line, zzso However, its effects on zzso cell zzso are still zzso The present study was undertaken to examine the effect of zzso on cell zzso zzso and zzso membrane potential, and to determine the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso by investigating the expression of zzso family proteins zzso zzso zzso C, zzso and zzso in zzso zzso We found that zzso suppressed the viability of zzso cells in a zzso and zzso dependent zzso Furthermore, we observed that zzso induced the loss of zzso membrane potential, zzso the expression of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso C, and activated zzso and zzso and zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso may induce zzso via the zzso zzso in zzso zzso
