zzso zzso of zzso zzso mediates the release of hormones from zzso cells and zzso The plasma membrane protein zzso protein of 25 zzso zzso is thought to be a key component of the membrane fusion apparatus that mediates zzso in zzso Recently, zzso of zzso have been identified, including zzso which is expressed in many zzso albeit at different zzso At present, little is known concerning functional differences among members of this family of zzso Using an in zzso zzso we show here that zzso and zzso mediate the zzso of zzso zzso with the plasma membrane at high (1 zzso and low zzso zzso zzso levels, respectively, by interacting with different members of the zzso zzso In intact zzso cells, expression of zzso zzso leads to high levels of hormone zzso under zzso zzso Thus, the relative expression levels of zzso and zzso might control the mode zzso zzso zzso of zzso release by forming zzso complexes at different zzso zzso
