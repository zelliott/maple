zzso the molecular events that lead to zzso zzso resistance is necessary to identify effective means to prevent zzso Previously, results from our lab revealed that zzso zzso zzso form positively mediates zzso response in zzso cancer zzso Thus, we had interest to study the role of another zzso form zzso zzso zzso in zzso Here, we provide zzso that zzso form zzso mainly in the nucleus and zzso expressed in the zzso zzso cells, versus zzso zzso zzso cancer cells and zzso regulate cellular zzso zzso was zzso by deleting the zzso signaling zzso from full-length zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso expression of truncated zzso was mainly zzso in the zzso and significantly reduced cellular growth, accumulating cells in zzso phase which finally died through zzso zzso compromised expression of zzso under an zzso promoter was tolerated and did not induce zzso but zzso zzso cancer cells to zzso We then demonstrated that this zzso mechanism was cell cycle independent and relied on zzso binding probably due to controlling the free amount of zzso available for DNA repair in the zzso zzso from zzso zzso in zzso tumor zzso verified the zzso of nuclear zzso zzso in the zzso tumor even though their primary counterparts showed nuclear zzso zzso Thus, the controversial data on zzso function in zzso may be explained by a shift in the pattern of zzso expression and zzso zzso as well when tumor acquires zzso
