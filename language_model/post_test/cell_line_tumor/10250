zzso of an effective vaccine for zzso has been an elusive goal of the scientific community for almost 30 zzso zzso zzso are assumed to be pivotal to the success of a zzso vaccine but previous attempts to make an zzso capable of generating zzso zzso to primary zzso zzso zzso have resulted in responses of very limited breadth and zzso The objective of the study was to determine the breadth and strength of zzso zzso against zzso and zzso primary zzso in a cohort of zzso infected zzso and to characterize envelopes from subjects with particularly broad or strong immune responses for possible use as vaccine candidates in regions predominated by zzso zzso and G zzso zzso zzso from a panel of primary Nigerian zzso were constructed and tested with zzso from the same cohort using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to assess the breadth and potency of zzso zzso The immediate goal of this study was realized by the recognition of three broadly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Based on these findings, envelope zzso sequences from zzso and zzso zzso with a gag sequence zzso zzso and consensus zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been zzso zzso cloned and evaluated in zzso zzso The intramuscular administration of these zzso DNA zzso followed by two booster DNA zzso induced substantial specific zzso response against all zzso and strong cellular responses against the gag and zzso zzso These zzso findings provide a framework for the design of candidate vaccine for use in regions where the zzso epidemic is driven by zzso zzso and zzso
