We show that zzso lifetime is a powerful contrast mechanism that can enhance the zzso imaging of fluorescent proteins zzso in the presence of background tissue zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is characterized from zzso zzso zzso on multiple nude mice and separated from the zzso zzso using a linear fit to a zzso basis zzso We illustrate this approach using an zzso mouse tumor model of breast zzso We also report that four commonly used zzso show distinct zzso indicating their suitability for in zzso lifetime zzso These results suggest the potential for exploiting zzso lifetime for imaging zzso for a variety of zzso zzso imaging zzso
