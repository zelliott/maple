Cancer zzso is beginning to overwhelm the global research and viewed to be the revolutionary treatment regime in the medical zzso This investigation describes the development of a stable zzso zzso carrier zzso system as carrier for zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso developed with zzso of zzso showed a zzso particle with the size of zzso zzso index of zzso zzso efficiency of zzso and with the zzso potential of zzso Besides, the equivalent zzso of zzso and zzso to human zzso and mice zzso zzso breast cancer cell lines were zzso zzso the zzso at the zzso pH resulted into reduced zzso zzso rate but without any significant change in the zzso When coupled with the zzso of zzso potential and zzso zzso rate, the zzso zzso may be used to predict the long-term stability of zzso zzso zzso The results of the study also suggest that zzso is a promising drug delivery system for breast cancer zzso This is the first encouraging report on the in zzso effect of zzso against human and mouse zzso zzso cell zzso
