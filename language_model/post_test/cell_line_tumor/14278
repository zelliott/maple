Raising selectivity to tumor cells is a major challenge for most chemotherapy zzso One of approaches to realizing this goal is zzso zzso zzso therapy zzso This study was done to investigate the zzso effect of a new zzso system for the treatment of prostate zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion protein zzso was zzso zzso effects of this zzso system were zzso 

The synthesis of zzso was successful and the zzso were confirmed no zzso but zzso with zzso zzso fusion protein gave zzso higher zzso than zzso zzso Cell cycle zzso showed that tumor cells were arrested in the S phase after zzso zzso zzso tumors were inhibited significantly in zzso and zzso treated zzso 

Our results suggest that targeted zzso zzso against established prostate cancer by zzso zzso zzso is zzso and has no systemic toxicity in zzso and in zzso
