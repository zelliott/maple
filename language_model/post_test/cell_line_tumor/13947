zzso harboring zzso upstream open reading frames zzso are often found in genes controlling cell growth including zzso zzso or growth zzso zzso can zzso translation or zzso stability and mediate inefficient translation of these potent proteins under normal zzso In zzso cancer cells, where the gene product, for example zzso zzso is zzso zzso processes must exist that serve to override the zzso effects of the zzso The zzso untranslated region zzso of zzso zzso contains a short zzso that zzso translation of the downstream coding zzso We demonstrate that in zzso zzso breast cancer cells, the 3' zzso of the zzso zzso can override zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso Within this 3' zzso a zzso zzso element zzso that binds to a zzso protein was zzso These results define a novel biological mechanism in which zzso control of genes harboring a zzso zzso can be modulated by elements in their 3' zzso
