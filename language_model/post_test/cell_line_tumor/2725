zzso targets the breast cancer zzso protein zzso along with zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso structures at DNA zzso breaks zzso These zzso targeting events are essential for zzso DNA damage zzso checkpoint and repair zzso Here, we identify zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso 40 zzso as a zzso protein that is essential for zzso complex protein zzso stability, and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso activity, a critical component of zzso zzso checkpoint and viability responses to zzso zzso Thus, zzso represents a novel factor that links zzso complex integrity, zzso recognition, and zzso chain zzso activities to the DNA damage zzso These findings provide new molecular insights into how zzso associates with independently assembled core protein complexes to maintain zzso zzso
