Human zzso zzso G zzso is a zzso zzso class I zzso involved in fetus protection from the maternal immune system, transplant zzso and viral and zzso immune zzso zzso zzso expression has been described for a wide variety of zzso including zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate whether zzso radiation zzso could zzso the surface expression of zzso in a human melanoma cell line that expresses zzso zzso zzso For this purpose, cells were exposed to increasing doses of zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels at the plasma membrane were analyzed at different times zzso by flow zzso zzso total expression and the presence of the soluble form of zzso zzso in the culture medium of zzso cells were also zzso zzso was capable of zzso cell surface and total zzso levels, with a zzso increase of zzso in the zzso These results could indicate that zzso decreases zzso surface levels by enhancing the zzso zzso of this zzso
