zzso metal particles are known to induce heat energy under an alternating magnetic field zzso We developed a local zzso device incorporating an zzso needle for the purpose of mild zzso for cancer zzso A needle made from zzso zzso particles was embedded in the zzso or breast zzso zzso were then heated by the energy dissipated from the needle exposed to an zzso We zzso evaluated zzso changes, cellular activity of tumors, and the extent of zzso effect using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso labeling zzso zzso The mean temperature of the tumor tissue during heating was about 60 degrees zzso zzso of the tumor cells became zzso immediately after zzso The injured area spread progressively until 3 days after zzso when the area was surrounded by zzso (meaning is not zzso zzso disappeared after treatment without zzso This is the first time that the complete death of tumor cells has been realized by raising the tumor temperature above 60 degrees C using the heat generated by magnetic metal particles exposed to zzso This device may be useful in the future for local zzso treatment of human zzso
