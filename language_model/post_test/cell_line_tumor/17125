The crucial step in cellular zzso seems to be the zzso of zzso the zzso that zzso zzso repeat ending zzso Since the zzso activity has been detected in almost all types of cancer tissue it has been proposed as new reliable tumor zzso This study was conducted to evaluate the significance of appearance of circulating zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the plasma of cancer zzso Seven healthy volunteers, 25 primary breast cancer patients zzso zzso 29 patients with advanced zzso melanoma zzso zzso and 4 patients with advanced zzso cancer zzso zzso were included in the zzso The total zzso was extracted from plasma samples, reverse transcribed to zzso and specific zzso for zzso and zzso were amplified by zzso zzso In healthy volunteers, the control zzso was positive in all, zzso was positive in 3 cases, and zzso was negative in all 7 tested zzso Among 25 breast cancer patients, zzso was positive in 23, and zzso in 12 zzso Two cases, that were zzso and zzso negative, were at the same time negative also for zzso Of the 29 patients with zzso melanoma, 24 were positive for zzso and 17 for zzso Again, the 5 patients that were negative for zzso and zzso were negative also for the control zzso In all plasma samples from zzso cancer patients, zzso and zzso were zzso In conclusion, the zzso followed by zzso zzso is a highly sensitive method for detection of circulating zzso in the zzso Among the zzso zzso only zzso could serve as an unspecific tumor marker in the plasma of cancer zzso
