zzso half of patients with stage IV zzso are expected to zzso despite current therapy, and when this occurs, there is little likelihood of achieving a zzso Very few clinical trials have been conducted to determine whether cellular immune responses could be harnessed to fight this zzso largely because potential tumor zzso for zzso T zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso expressed on a number of zzso solid tumors, including zzso but many tumor cell lines zzso the expression of CT zzso as well as major zzso zzso zzso zzso recognition by zzso T zzso If expression of cancer zzso on zzso could be enhanced zzso CT zzso zzso could be considered for this zzso We have demonstrated that the expression of zzso zzso and zzso can be zzso on zzso cells following exposure to zzso levels of the zzso agent zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso was induced in zzso zzso cell lines after 5 days of exposure to zzso Culture of zzso cell lines with zzso was also associated with an increased expression of either zzso Class I or II by zzso as reported by other zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were cultured from volunteer donors by stimulating peripheral blood zzso cells with zzso cells zzso with overlapping zzso mixes derived from full-length zzso and these zzso zzso zzso zzso partially zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso These studies show that zzso chemotherapy can be combined with zzso to increase the expression of CT zzso and zzso molecules on zzso cells, and zzso with these agents makes tumor cell lines more susceptible to zzso zzso These data provide a basis to consider the use of zzso chemotherapy in zzso patients, in conjunction with immune therapies that facilitate the expansion of CT zzso zzso
