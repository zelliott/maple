zzso zzso a frequent agent of zzso zzso strongly zzso to human zzso zzso cells in zzso The zzso normally provides a barrier between zzso organisms and the zzso the tight zzso of bacteria to the zzso cells can lead to zzso and subsequent zzso However, zzso was not shown yet for zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and the common zzso protection zzso was used to assess zzso zzso Via site directed zzso an zzso negative zzso zzso strain was generated to point out the importance of zzso zzso 

We identified an important bacterial factor zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso cells, as the zzso zzso zzso zzso filaments and zzso filaments were shown to be involved in zzso However, zzso of zzso cells by zzso was an interfering factor, and therefore zzso zzso were used in subsequent zzso zzso zzso zzso strains were still zzso but were no longer zzso did not disrupt the cell culture zzso and were no longer zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells under the conditions used for the zzso zzso After zzso zzso zzso became zzso the infected zzso cells were zzso by extended zzso induced by zzso In late stages of zzso highly zzso zzso zzso cells were observed in the zzso zzso zzso was also able to replicate in cultured zzso cells, and replication was not dependent on zzso zzso 

The results reported here showed that the zzso toxin zzso triggers zzso invasion and is the main factor inducing zzso of the zzso cells to release the bacteria, and therefore plays a major role in the development of zzso zzso zzso
