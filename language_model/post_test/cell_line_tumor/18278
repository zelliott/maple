The major zzso breast cancer zzso gene zzso is associated with familial breast and zzso zzso zzso plays a role in DNA repair, transcription, cell cycle regulation, maintenance of zzso stability in response to DNA damage, zzso regulation, and zzso To further understand the function of zzso we used a zzso zzso method and identified a novel zzso zzso zzso which is reported to be a potential zzso zzso We confirmed the interaction between zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells, and showed that zzso interacts with a portion of the highly zzso region of zzso in various zzso and M zzso zzso of the binding region of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso increases cell growth, and zzso of zzso zzso expression using small interfering zzso suppresses cell growth and leads to the induction of zzso zzso the zzso zzso level is zzso by zzso zzso DNA damage and depletion of zzso expression by small interfering zzso promotes the reduction of zzso expression and enhances cell zzso in response to DNA zzso Additionally, the recovery of zzso expression in zzso DNA damage zzso zzso zzso The data suggest that zzso promotes cell growth and may regulate the induction of cell zzso in response to DNA damage in cooperation with zzso in an M zzso zzso zzso we speculate that targeting zzso may aid in the treatment of breast zzso
