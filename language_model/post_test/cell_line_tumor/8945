zzso is regulated by zzso cellular cues, including some zzso through zzso structures on zzso zzso bodies called transition fibers and zzso zzso However, the molecular basis for this regulation is not fully zzso The zzso gene product, zzso is essential for both zzso and the formation of the zzso and zzso zzso on zzso which become zzso zzso We examined the effects of zzso deletion zzso on zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso and transition fiber formation required the zzso zzso containing zzso acids zzso zzso whereas zzso foot formation required zzso zzso and zzso These sequences also formed zzso and zzso zzso respectively, indicating that the zzso zzso are zzso analogous to those on zzso zzso We used the differential formation of zzso by zzso deletion zzso to study the incorporation and function of molecules associated with each zzso zzso We found that transition fibers and zzso zzso were required for zzso and zzso zzso stabilized the zzso zzso
