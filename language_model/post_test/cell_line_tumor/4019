zzso lung cancer zzso is the most prevalent zzso cancer zzso zzso As the majority of patients present with zzso zzso disease, it is vital to understand the basis for lung cancer zzso zzso is highly expressed in zzso lung zzso in which it contributes to cancer progression and zzso Here we show that zzso promotes lung cancer progression in mouse and human cells by operating as a competing zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can promote the transformation of lung cancer cells independent of zzso function but dependent upon the presence of zzso zzso this occurs without changes in the levels of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso affects zzso activity by altering zzso zzso These effects are also observed in zzso where zzso zzso activity drives lung cancer growth, invasion and zzso Integrated analysis of zzso target prediction zzso and zzso lung cancer gene expression data reveals the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a putative target of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression is regulated by the zzso zzso through differential recruitment to zzso 2 zzso and zzso zzso driven by zzso is important for zzso to promote lung cancer zzso Finally, analysis of zzso zzso data reveals that zzso and zzso are zzso regulated in zzso material, a vital zzso to zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso promotes lung zzso both as a zzso gene and as a zzso zzso such zzso regulation of zzso networks reflects a novel means by which zzso promote disease zzso
