We have shown previously that most melanoma cell lines are insensitive to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but resistance can be reversed through zzso of zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso We report in this study that zzso was induced by the zzso stress zzso zzso or zzso via a zzso zzso in the melanoma cell line zzso although the zzso zzso was activated in this cell zzso The high sensitivity of zzso to zzso zzso zzso was associated with low expression levels of the zzso zzso with zzso recruitment domain zzso protein that was expressed at relatively high levels in the resistant melanoma cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso ARC into zzso cells inhibited both zzso zzso and zzso induced by zzso or zzso In contrast, zzso of ARC by small interfering zzso zzso zzso the resistant melanoma cell lines to zzso zzso zzso which was zzso by zzso of zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso ARC seemed to predominantly locate to the zzso and zzso and could be zzso with zzso Taken together, zzso stress can potentially activate multiple zzso signaling pathways in melanoma cells in a zzso zzso Whereas the zzso signaling zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ARC seems to be critical in blocking zzso of zzso in melanoma cells subjected to zzso zzso
