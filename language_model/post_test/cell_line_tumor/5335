The zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been implicated as a critical cause in the zzso of Alzheimer's disease zzso It can cause zzso in zzso by evoking a cascade of zzso zzso zzso to zzso In the present study, we for the first time investigated the protective effect of zzso zzso zzso an zzso water soluble compound that acts as a zzso zzso of bacterial zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced cell zzso increased the number of zzso cells, and increased zzso zzso All of these zzso induced by zzso were markedly reversed by zzso zzso zzso recovered cells from zzso cell death, prevented zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso ratio, and suppressed the zzso of zzso These results indicated that zzso could protect zzso cells against zzso induced zzso
