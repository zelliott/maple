zzso zzso only protein zzso is a newly identified zzso gene whose loss of expression has been reported for several types of zzso Although we found most human zzso zzso zzso zzso defective in zzso zzso genetic zzso in the zzso gene were zzso As is the case with several tumor zzso zzso the promoter region of zzso is densely zzso in zzso tissue samples obtained by laser capture zzso zzso zzso and protein levels were reduced in the majority of samples, and this correlated with zzso of the zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso resulted in a partial block in cell zzso in zzso zzso and zzso gene expression in zzso and zzso cells in response to zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the serum response element zzso of zzso gene promoter showed that the effect of zzso expression is associated with zzso of zzso zzso zzso through the serum response factor zzso zzso zzso of zzso in immortalized human zzso cells resulted in accelerated zzso Our study indicates that zzso zzso of zzso results from zzso of the zzso which leads to zzso zzso
