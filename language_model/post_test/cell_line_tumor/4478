zzso is a novel hormone that has been proposed to mediate the beneficial effects of exercise on zzso including body weight regulation and insulin zzso No previous studies have evaluated whether zzso may regulate cell proliferation and zzso potential of zzso cancer cell zzso 

Cell proliferation and zzso potential zzso cell zzso and colony formation were studied in zzso using human and mouse zzso cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso colon zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso 

We observed that, in contrast to zzso cell proliferation is not regulated by zzso in a zzso manner in human and mouse zzso cancer cell zzso Specifically, zzso (5 to 10 zzso and high zzso zzso to 100 zzso zzso of zzso had no effect on cell proliferation when compared to control in human and mouse zzso zzso zzso and zzso cancer cell zzso Also, we observed that, in contrast to zzso neither zzso nor high zzso zzso of zzso regulate cell zzso and/or colony formation in human and mouse zzso zzso zzso and zzso cancer cell zzso 

Our data suggest that zzso in zzso and high zzso zzso has no in zzso effect on cell proliferation and zzso potential of zzso cancer cell zzso Future work is needed to determine the regulation of zzso levels and any zzso effects it may have on zzso zzso in zzso in animals and zzso
