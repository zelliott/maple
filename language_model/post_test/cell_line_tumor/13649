The zzso factor zzso is induced during the unfolded protein response and is related to the induction of zzso zzso zzso However, how zzso is organized between the zzso and zzso roles of zzso stress remains largely zzso In this study, we identified the zzso regulating protein suppressed by zzso We found that treatment of zzso cells with zzso drugs including zzso A, zzso zzso A, and zzso led to a strong reduction in zzso protein levels together with a zzso increase in the zzso zzso Interestingly, Wit A zzso zzso expression via both suppressing zzso zzso and increasing zzso protein zzso We also found that forced expression of zzso zzso led to a decrease of zzso protein expression but did not alter zzso zzso zzso Additionally, we observed that zzso zzso zzso recovered the zzso expression decreased by zzso agents in zzso zzso Finally, we showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation, leading to zzso of zzso Finally, zzso zzso reduced cell death induced by treatment with zzso A, zzso and zzso Taken together, our results provide novel evidence that zzso is a zzso control target and that zzso zzso of zzso is due to zzso of the zzso zzso
