zzso zzso zzso play an essential role during zzso Here, we explore the function of an alternatively spliced zzso of zzso zzso heavy chain zzso zzso called zzso zzso in the zzso human lung tumor cell line during zzso zzso zzso contains an insert of 8 zzso acids in the head region of zzso zzso First, we show that there is a marked increase in both the zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein in tumor cell lines compared with zzso cell lines derived from the same zzso zzso of the amount of zzso II zzso in the zzso cells shows that the amounts of zzso zzso and zzso protein are about equal and substantially greater than zzso zzso Using specific zzso to decrease zzso zzso in cultured zzso cells resulted in a zzso decrease in the number of cells at 120 zzso whereas decreasing zzso zzso with zzso does not affect cell zzso This decreased proliferation can be rescued by reintroducing zzso zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso into zzso cells, although zzso zzso zzso does rescue to a limited zzso Time zzso video zzso revealed that loss of zzso zzso leads to a delay in zzso and zzso it from 2 to 8-10 zzso These findings are consistent with the zzso of zzso zzso to the zzso bridge that zzso the two dividing cells during the late zzso of zzso The results suggest a specific function for zzso zzso in zzso in the zzso tumor cell zzso
