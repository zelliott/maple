zzso zzso relaxation zzso is a major factor of functional zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso could be the key zzso responsible for zzso We previously reported that the zzso gastric zzso ability can be evaluated by measuring the zzso area of the zzso stomach by abdominal zzso zzso zzso sodium zzso a zzso zzso agent, has been shown to improve symptoms in zzso zzso We examined the effects of zzso on zzso in humans and on NO synthesis in zzso 

zzso was measured by US in 14 subjects, 8 of whom had a pressure sensor inserted into their stomach, after treatment with zzso zzso or no zzso NO was measured in zzso zzso cells using a fluorescent zzso zzso zzso and zzso NO zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expressions were examined in zzso zzso cells by Western zzso 

Compared to zzso zzso induced significantly greater zzso of the zzso stomach after the subjects drank zzso zzso water zzso zzso zzso After zzso zzso the zzso pressure did not change significantly, but it tended to be lower zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso increased NO production and zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso with zzso NO zzso zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso reduced NO production by zzso 

zzso may promote zzso in humans through zzso zzso therefore, it may be useful for patients with zzso
