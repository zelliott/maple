zzso is an essential zzso molecular zzso that zzso a large set of client zzso many of which are involved in various cellular signaling zzso The current list of zzso zzso comprises about 200 proteins and this number is growing zzso In this paper, we report on the application of three complementary zzso approaches directed towards identification of novel proteins that interact with zzso These methods are zzso pull down with zzso zzso and zzso of zzso on zzso In all, this study led to the identification of 42 zzso including 18 proteins that had not been previously characterized as zzso zzso These novel zzso partners not only represent abundant protein species, but several proteins were identified at low levels, among which signaling zzso zzso and putative zzso factor zzso zzso protein zzso Identification of zzso zzso import zzso protein zzso suggests the involvement of zzso in the early steps of zzso of zzso zzso Taken together, our data expand the knowledge of the zzso zzso and provide a further step in our understanding of the zzso zzso zzso
