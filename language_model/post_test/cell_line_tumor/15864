zzso zzso occur in as high as zzso of patients with pancreatic zzso zzso activates zzso zzso zzso a key source of zzso zzso has an important function in pancreatic cancer cell zzso and scavenging or decreasing the levels of zzso zzso pancreatic cancer cell growth both in zzso and in zzso DNA zzso analysis and zzso has demonstrated that zzso is also zzso in pancreatic zzso The aim of this study was to determine whether zzso zzso would alter pancreatic tumor cell zzso Human pancreatic cancer cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso that is zzso were infected with a zzso zzso construct zzso In cells with zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso activity, decreased zzso levels and inhibited in zzso zzso However, in the zzso cell line, zzso did not change zzso activity, zzso levels or in zzso cell zzso Additionally, zzso decreased zzso levels and inhibited in zzso growth in the zzso zzso cell line, but had no effect in the immortalized zzso cell zzso In human pancreatic tumor zzso zzso injections of zzso inhibited tumor zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso zzso generation leads to pancreatic cancer cell zzso In pancreatic cancer, zzso of zzso may be a potential therapeutic zzso
