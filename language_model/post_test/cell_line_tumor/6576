zzso of the type I zzso for zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso is restricted to zzso zzso cells, such as zzso zzso and a subset of zzso zzso Previous work has indicated a role for zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso We zzso that tagging of zzso cells with an zzso zzso single chain zzso zzso may facilitate targeting to this zzso on zzso cells, thereby initiating zzso zzso A zzso zzso the zzso for an zzso zzso zzso zzso linked to the zzso domain of zzso growth factor was zzso zzso zzso cells expressed high surface levels of functional zzso which greatly enhanced zzso for zzso and zzso by zzso and zzso The expression of zzso evoked the ability of zzso cells to directly activate zzso as evidenced by zzso of zzso protein zzso and zzso of the inflammatory zzso zzso zzso zzso necrosis zzso and zzso Moreover, growth of zzso cells in mice expressing zzso was profoundly delayed (or zzso in transgenic mice expressing human zzso zzso These results demonstrated that zzso cells can be readily modified to activate cell zzso mechanisms, a strategy that may be useful for in zzso targeting in zzso
