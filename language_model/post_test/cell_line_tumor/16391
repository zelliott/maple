To identify the presence of side population zzso cells in human zzso cancer cell line zzso and to investigate whether SP cells have the characteristics of cancer stem zzso 

SP and zzso zzso cells from zzso were isolated by zzso cell sorting after being stained by zzso dye zzso zzso zzso dilution transplantation zzso real-time zzso and drug sensitivity zzso were performed to compare the zzso ability, differentiation ability in zzso the zzso expression of zzso marker zzso zzso and zzso and zzso cassette (ABC) zzso zzso zzso and zzso and response to multiple drugs zzso zzso zzso and zzso between SP and zzso zzso 

A few of SP cells zzso zzso zzso which were sensitive to zzso were identified in zzso zzso The injection of as few as zzso SP cells initiated tumors in two of five zzso zzso zzso was 52 - 61 zzso However, the zzso cells did not generate any tumors in mice until zzso zzso cells were injected zzso of five zzso zzso zzso was 64 - 98 zzso zzso of SP cells was enhanced by at least zzso than that of zzso zzso The SP cells zzso both SP zzso zzso zzso and zzso populations in zzso with a fraction size that was comparable to the original zzso The zzso expression of zzso genes zzso zzso and ABC zzso zzso zzso genes were elevated in SP cells compared to zzso cells, the fold changes were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The relative activity of SP and zzso cells were zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso when they exposed to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

SP cells from zzso have enhanced zzso zzso and zzso capacity compared to zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso genes and ABC zzso are markedly elevated in SP cells, which showed resistance to multiple zzso drugs and have characteristics of cancer zzso zzso zzso SP zzso could be used as a marker to isolate the cancer zzso cells in zzso zzso
