Three different second-generation zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso and zzso promoter, respectively, and all carrying the zzso zzso zzso were compared for expression in human zzso precursor ALL zzso At a comparable percentage of zzso and zzso DNA copy number, zzso clearly showed better efficiency of zzso Human bone zzso zzso cells were favored compared to the zzso cell line, as support for cell viability during zzso zzso were infected and analyzed after variable culture times ranging from 4 to 12 days, to reduce the possibility of zzso In zzso samples, we detected more than zzso zzso cells after exposure to zzso viral zzso We then tested a similar zzso carrying the human zzso zzso and, in similar infection conditions, obtained more than zzso zzso in zzso zzso The levels of zzso obtained were sufficient to induce the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso immature zzso zzso
