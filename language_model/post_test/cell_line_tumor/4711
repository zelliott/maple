zzso are zzso brain tumors that are very difficult to zzso even with aggressive therapy consisting of surgery, chemotherapy, and zzso zzso frequently have loss of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso leading to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We examined whether zzso zzso leads to zzso and whether this can be reversed by zzso a zzso inhibitor that decreases zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso and enhanced zzso in zzso and zzso zzso cells, both of which are zzso zzso In the zzso line zzso induction of zzso zzso with zzso decreased zzso expression and increased zzso to a similar extent as zzso Combining these two approaches had no greater effect on zzso than either zzso This zzso analysis suggests that the zzso acts along the zzso zzso to zzso zzso However, zzso neither decreased zzso zzso in immortalized human zzso nor zzso zzso zzso was also assessed in zzso using a tumor regrowth delay zzso in nude mice implanted with zzso zzso The mean time to reach 1,000 zzso in the radiation + zzso group was 71 days, as compared with 41, 34, or 45 days for control, zzso alone, or radiation alone groups, zzso A significant synergistic effect on tumor regrowth was detected between radiation and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also increased the sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso These results support the clinical investigation of zzso in combination with radiation and zzso in future clinical trials for patients with zzso
