A classic feature of zzso cells is the zzso exposure of zzso zzso as an zzso zzso signal for zzso We show that the zzso protein zzso mediates zzso exposure in response to zzso zzso Mouse zzso cells or human cancer cells in which zzso expression was zzso by zzso failed to expose zzso during zzso and were zzso engulfed by zzso zzso was activated directly by zzso and required a zzso zzso site for its zzso zzso the only zzso zzso zzso zzso also promoted zzso zzso exposure and zzso zzso Thus, zzso proteins have zzso zzso roles in promoting the zzso of dying cells by altering the zzso distribution in the plasma zzso
