To explore the clinical implication of zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso expression in breast cancer, we evaluated its protein level in six kinds of human breast tissue samples, including adjacent normal zzso zzso breast zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso invasive zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso was more frequently and much more intensely expressed in adjacent normal zzso zzso and zzso zzso than in zzso zzso zzso IDC, and zzso Furthermore, the zzso expression in primary tumors and the corresponding zzso was evaluated in parallel samples from 60 patients with zzso zzso showed that the zzso expression status in primary tumors and zzso was zzso in 53 patients zzso suggesting that zzso expression was retained in zzso Moreover, our results suggested that zzso expression zzso correlated with the tumor grade zzso and clinical stage zzso in zzso zzso Finally, the effect of zzso zzso on the breast cancer cell growth was zzso and results revealed that zzso of zzso could restore the zzso effect of zzso B on the growth of zzso breast cancer cell line, zzso These findings provide the evidence that the reduction or lack of zzso expression may account for the loss of its zzso sensitivity of breast cancer cells, thereby leading to breast tumor zzso
