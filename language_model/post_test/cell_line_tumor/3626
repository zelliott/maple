Our previous studies have clearly shown that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are directly involved in human zzso zzso and zzso and suggest that the zzso zzso which have dual zzso activities on zzso activity and transcription, represent the best candidates for achieving tumor zzso Many zzso drugs have strong cellular zzso and side effects, indicating that strong zzso drugs that have no or minimal zzso and side effects need to be zzso The specific aim of the present study was to develop powerful zzso drugs with specific tumor zzso and zzso potential having the dual zzso activities of specific zzso and -9 zzso activities and gene zzso at the molecular zzso zzso acid zzso a strong and selective zzso activity and zzso zzso was isolated from the plant zzso zzso and its zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso was zzso CA and zzso selectively inhibited zzso and -9 but not zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with CA zzso zzso and zzso (5 zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression by zzso the function of zzso but not zzso We confirmed that CA and zzso suppressed the growth of zzso tumor zzso in nude mice in zzso The subcutaneous and oral administrations of CA and zzso significantly reduced the liver zzso These results confirm the therapeutic potential of the compounds and suggest that the zzso and zzso effects of CA and zzso are zzso through the selective suppression of zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso by the dual zzso of zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso
