zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso is associated with cellular immune tolerance during the process of cancer zzso zzso of tolerance requires a specific environment in which zzso cells and regulatory T cells zzso play an essential zzso It was recently shown that maturation of zzso cells in the presence of zzso 2, zzso zzso results in zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso activity regulated zzso expression within the tumor zzso Thus, we hypothesized that the tumor immune tolerance would be inhibited by zzso inhibitor and this zzso would be zzso by zzso zzso zzso The zzso in Lewis lung cancer cells zzso and serum of mice were measured for the evaluation of zzso zzso local and systemic zzso The production of zzso in zzso cells and serum of zzso zzso mice were decreased by zzso zzso However, there were no significant differences in serum zzso levels among normal control and zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was reduced in the zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the expressions of zzso zzso and zzso were reduced in the mice treated with a zzso zzso and this was found to correlate with a reduction in the size of tumor mass and zzso These results suggest that the zzso effects of zzso zzso seemed to be correlated with the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso might provide a therapeutic strategy for zzso tumor immune zzso
