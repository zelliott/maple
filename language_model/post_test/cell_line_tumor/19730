zzso signaling pathways are key regulators of cellular functions in tumor zzso zzso zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and -5 may be involved in tumor formation and zzso We have investigated the role of zzso in zzso melanoma zzso using various zzso and protein zzso In melanoma zzso zzso transcripts were zzso approximately zzso In 13 of 21 zzso human melanoma zzso zzso was zzso in comparison to normal human zzso and benign zzso The zzso target gene zzso was frequently zzso The investigation of the underlying mechanism revealed specific zzso zzso by zzso human zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso of zzso occurred in zzso through the zzso zzso zzso transforming gene zzso of zzso zzso virus and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression by small interfering zzso strongly reduced the expression of zzso and led to decreased cell viability and increased zzso in the melanoma cell lines zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso caused enhanced cell death and zzso arrest in zzso zzso Our study identifies zzso zzso in melanoma and shows regulation through zzso zzso may thus act as a survival factor for growth of human melanoma and may represent a potential target for molecular zzso
