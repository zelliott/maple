zzso zzso zzso is elevated in more than zzso of head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso However, a majority of patients with zzso do not respond to zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso may be due to zzso actions of zzso and/or zzso of zzso Strategies to reduce zzso and zzso protein levels in concert may be an optimal approach to enhance the efficacy of current zzso zzso In this study, zzso of zzso with zzso box zzso decreased zzso and zzso promoter activity, zzso and zzso zzso was elevated in primary zzso tumors and associated with increased zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso decreased zzso and zzso levels and enhanced the zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso and zzso levels and zzso the zzso efficacy of zzso zzso zzso zzso retarded the in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso the combination of zzso zzso and zzso was significantly superior in zzso and resulted in a zzso response rate with a zzso reduction in tumor zzso zzso zzso levels with an zzso inhibitor and zzso zzso activity with a zzso simultaneously is a highly active therapeutic approach to manage zzso Our work provides evidence to support the further development of zzso zzso as an zzso to enhance the response rate of patients with zzso to current zzso zzso
