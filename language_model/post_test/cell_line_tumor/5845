Cellular zzso is a zzso process instigated by proliferation in the absence of zzso zzso by cellular stresses such as zzso zzso or by zzso of the tumor zzso zzso such as zzso or zzso This process is characterized by an irreversible cell cycle exit, a unique zzso and expression of zzso zzso Despite the potential biological importance of cellular zzso little is known of the mechanisms leading to the zzso zzso zzso has been known to be a putative regulatory component of the zzso zzso complex, which is required for the formation of zzso networks of zzso filaments at the cell zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso can induce zzso zzso when it is zzso in human tumor cell line, zzso which is deficient in zzso and zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso that zzso can induce zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso causes a change in zzso zzso accumulating zzso filaments in zzso zzso these results imply that a change in zzso filament can trigger an intrinsic zzso program in the absence of zzso and zzso tumor zzso zzso
