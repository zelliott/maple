We have shown previously that zzso zzso zzso express zzso growth factor receptors zzso alpha and zzso We report the expression of a novel zzso zzso transcript in zzso of zzso rat zzso zzso zzso sequence spans from zzso 6 to zzso 23 of the zzso zzso and is predicted to zzso a protein lacking part of the zzso zzso zzso transcripts are expressed zzso in developing zzso The embryonic zzso zzso cells, in which differentiation is driven by zzso acid zzso express zzso but not zzso zzso Green fluorescent zzso zzso localized mainly in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and green fluorescent zzso zzso displayed zzso zzso activities and contain zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso induced zzso gene zzso zzso with changes in zzso and increased zzso expression of collagen IV and zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is involved in cell zzso Similarly, treatment of zzso d 3 rat zzso with zzso induced a zzso increase in zzso expression together with an increase in zzso and zzso markers of more differentiated germ cells and a zzso decrease in zzso a marker of zzso stem zzso However, an excess of zzso inhibited zzso collagen IV and zzso B1 expression and altered both zzso and zzso zzso changes in zzso cells, while increasing cell zzso These results suggest that the expression of zzso is tightly regulated during differentiation and that it may play an active role in germ cell zzso
