The zzso activity of three major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso isolated from corn bran, and their related zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso acid, were evaluated by three zzso in zzso zzso systems, including zzso zzso radical and zzso and zzso zzso generated by zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, five zzso compounds were evaluated for zzso zzso activity using mushroom zzso and zzso melanoma zzso Most of the zzso compounds significantly scavenged zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso showed potent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso radical scavenging activities, while zzso exhibited the strongest zzso radical scavenging activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also exerted moderate zzso zzso and zzso radical scavenging zzso Meanwhile, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed potent zzso zzso activity toward zzso as the zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso synthesis in zzso melanoma zzso These current results indicate that these three zzso zzso from corn zzso may be useful potential sources of natural antioxidants and zzso zzso
