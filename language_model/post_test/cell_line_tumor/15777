zzso zzso a tumor zzso zzso has been reported to inhibit growth of human cancer cells, to induce differentiation and to cause zzso all conditions that result in growth zzso In order to clarify the functional effects of zzso we have investigated its expression in diverse conditions and different cell zzso Our results show that zzso levels definitely increase in zzso cells and also in zzso cells, even in the absence of zzso Increased expression during differentiation sometimes occurs as a late event, suggesting that zzso could be required either early or late during the differentiation zzso
