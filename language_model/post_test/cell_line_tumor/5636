zzso invasion of tumor cells is a characteristic feature of human pancreatic zzso zzso the molecular mechanisms that enable cancer cells to invade and grow along nerves is important for the development of novel therapeutic strategies in this zzso We have previously identified zzso changes in highly nerve invasive pancreatic cancer zzso Here we further analyzed one of the identified zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso expression was significantly increased in high versus less nerve invasive pancreatic cancer cells, and changes of zzso expression resulted in altered zzso distribution in these zzso zzso was predominately expressed in normal pancreatic zzso cells but absent in zzso zzso In pancreatic cancer, there was strong zzso and occasionally nuclear expression of zzso in the cancer cells zzso Increased zzso zzso levels in bulk pancreatic cancer zzso tended to be associated with reduced zzso survival of pancreatic cancer zzso In conclusion, zzso is highly expressed in pancreatic cancer cells, and seems to be involved in zzso zzso zzso targeting this zzso protein might be a promising approach in the therapy of pancreatic zzso
