We previously identified zzso gene 2 zzso as a commonly zzso gene in various human cancer zzso especially in zzso liver, and lung zzso et zzso zzso zzso was determined to be a nuclear protein that exhibited high zzso activities when zzso in zzso mouse zzso zzso To identify other cellular functions of zzso we performed zzso zzso screening and identified zzso a component of zzso zzso complex in the zzso as an interacting partner of zzso Moreover, zzso the principle zzso zzso was also found in complex with zzso zzso zzso revealed the zzso of zzso with human zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression drastically affected cell viability by inducing zzso cell zzso We propose that zzso is a new component of the human zzso complex that is required for proper zzso segregation during zzso
