The zzso tumor associated zzso is highly expressed on a range of zzso Its broad distribution on primary tumors and zzso renders it an attractive target for zzso After synthesis zzso is zzso yielding a large soluble zzso alpha zzso containing the tandem repeats array zzso domain specifically bound, via zzso interaction, to a smaller beta zzso containing the zzso and zzso zzso Thus far, zzso efficacy has been reported for zzso zzso directed against the soluble alpha zzso zzso the cell bound beta zzso may bypass limitations posed by circulating zzso zzso zzso signal zzso zzso domain zzso binds multiple zzso class II and Class I zzso which upon zzso generated robust zzso immunity against zzso zzso This is a first demonstration of zzso zzso zzso specific, cell surfaces presence for zzso SP zzso zzso and zzso zzso generated against zzso SP domain specifically bind a large variety of zzso human solid and zzso tumor cell zzso zzso bone zzso derived plasma cells obtained from multiple myeloma zzso but not zzso negative tumors cells, and normal zzso primary blood and zzso zzso zzso zzso SP appears mainly as an independent entity but also zzso with the full zzso zzso zzso specific binding in zzso plasma cells can assist in selecting patients to be treated with zzso SP therapeutic zzso zzso A therapeutic potential of the zzso SP zzso was suggested by their ability to support of zzso zzso of zzso tumor cells but not zzso negative tumor cells and normal zzso primary zzso zzso These findings suggest a novel cell surface presence of zzso SP domain, a potential therapeutic benefit for zzso SP zzso in zzso tumors and a selection tool for zzso patients to be treated with the zzso SP zzso zzso
