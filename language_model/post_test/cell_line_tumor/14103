The zzso factor zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso has relevant functions in cell zzso Interestingly, the zzso can either promote or inhibit proliferation depending on the cell zzso Although recent data reveal potential pathways for zzso signaling in cell zzso the mechanisms that regulate its activity in tumor cells remain zzso Here, we have analyzed promoter zzso as a potential mechanism controlling zzso expression in human tumor zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso was sporadic in a panel of 19 tumor cell lines except for the chronic zzso leukemia zzso zzso and the acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso When compared with normal zzso zzso had very low zzso zzso expression that could be attributed to promoter zzso since treatment with the DNA zzso agent zzso zzso significantly increased zzso zzso and zzso These results in zzso cell lines were further confirmed in primary zzso where zzso of the patients zzso had zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso impaired binding of the zzso factor zzso to the zzso promoter, thus providing a mechanism for zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso represents a novel zzso mechanism zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso such as zzso
