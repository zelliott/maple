We investigated the novel role of zzso zzso and its zzso zzso acid in regulating zzso zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso zzso cell line is strongly induced by zzso treatment and zzso with the expression of zzso Treatment with 300 zzso zzso acid zzso zzso 3 zzso peak plasma concentration zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso zzso and zzso production ( zzso in zzso (1 zzso zzso zzso bone zzso zzso zzso but failed to do so in zzso zzso Treatment with zzso acid reduced nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso levels by zzso ( zzso in zzso zzso 6 h after zzso stimulation but not in zzso zzso zzso acid significantly inhibited zzso zzso zzso ( zzso but had no effect on the zzso of zzso zzso A significant increase in zzso zzso zzso by both zzso ( zzso and zzso zzso ( zzso in response to zzso was observed, which was significantly suppressed by zzso acid in zzso zzso ( zzso but not in zzso zzso Our results suggest that the zzso zzso axis is a novel negative regulator of zzso zzso
