zzso zzso 1 zzso also known as zzso contains a DNA repair domain and a zzso regulation zzso zzso is zzso in several human zzso and disruption of zzso function has zzso effects on cancer cell zzso However, the selective contribution of the zzso and the DNA repair zzso to maintenance of cellular zzso in cancer has not been zzso In the present study, we used zzso a zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso domain function, to interrogate the functional relevance of sustained zzso function in pancreatic zzso We show that zzso significantly reduces the growth of human pancreatic cancer cells in zzso This phenomenon was further confirmed by a small interfering zzso experiment to zzso zzso expression in pancreatic cancer zzso Further, the zzso effects of zzso are zzso by zzso and this is accompanied by striking zzso in the zzso ability of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso exposure promotes zzso zzso oxygen species formation in pancreatic cancer cells, and the resulting zzso stress is associated with higher levels of zzso and hence zzso zzso an essential protein zzso zzso that promotes cancer cell proliferation in its active zzso Finally, zzso treatment zzso pancreatic cancer cell migration as assessed by in zzso zzso zzso zzso shows zzso properties at multiple functional levels in pancreatic cancer, such as zzso of cancer cell growth and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso function through zzso means has the potential to become a promising therapeutic strategy in this zzso
