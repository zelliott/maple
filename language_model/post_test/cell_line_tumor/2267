zzso acid is one of the zzso compounds widely used against free radical zzso The present study was undertaken to examine whether zzso acid and hydrogen zzso zzso alone or in zzso could influence cell zzso The zzso zzso cell line, zzso was used to perform a dose response curve for zzso zzso It was observed that zzso acid alone at zzso zzso zzso zzso did not cause any cell zzso However, at pharmacological zzso zzso zzso zzso acid caused zzso cell zzso The lethal concentration at which 50% cells were killed zzso was determined to be approximately zzso zzso zzso acid at 24 zzso zzso up to 300 zzso alone did not cause significant cell zzso In the combined treatment, when the cells were treated with zzso acid at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso at 400 zzso higher rates of cell death were observed compared to the cell death rates caused by either compound zzso zzso experiments revealed that cell death was partly zzso through the loss of total zzso levels in the zzso These data suggest that the combination of zzso acid and zzso is zzso for cancer cell zzso Further studies are required to ascertain the zzso significance of these zzso
