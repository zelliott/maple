zzso zzso zzso and zzso are associated with tumor progression and zzso potential in human pancreatic zzso We discovered that zzso interacts with specific sequences within the coding sequence of zzso and zzso zzso and evaluated the regulatory nature of this zzso zzso cancer cell lines zzso and zzso zzso with zzso showed a zzso and zzso fold down regulation of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso fold down regulation of zzso zzso compared to zzso cells, zzso A significant reduction of zzso expression was also zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso regulates zzso and zzso zzso in pancreatic cancer cells by directly targeting the zzso coding sequence of each, resulting in reduced levels of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso These data suggest that, in addition to regulating proteins that zzso zzso zzso influences expression of cell surface zzso in pancreatic zzso
