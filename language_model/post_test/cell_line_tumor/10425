zzso is involved in the development and progression of breast zzso Here we investigated the effect of zzso growth factor zzso on breast cancer cell proliferation caused by zzso using human breast cancer zzso zzso zzso cells express zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso cell proliferation in a zzso manner, whereas zzso zzso had a weak effect on zzso cell zzso compared with the effect of free zzso It is notable that zzso cell proliferation was enhanced in the presence of zzso and that the combined effects were reversed in the presence of an zzso zzso inhibitor or an zzso zzso It was also revealed that zzso increased the expression levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso while zzso reduced the expression levels of zzso zzso and steroid zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso receptors was zzso by zzso which was reversed by an zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso signaling was also zzso in the presence of zzso On the other hand, zzso suppressed zzso actions that are linked to zzso zzso by zzso the cell cycle regulator zzso zzso was revealed to inhibit zzso zzso actions including zzso promoter activity and zzso zzso by suppressing expression of zzso zzso receptors and by increasing expression of zzso zzso zzso the results indicate that zzso acts to facilitate cell proliferation by zzso zzso zzso actions as well as by suppressing zzso zzso signaling in zzso breast cancer zzso
