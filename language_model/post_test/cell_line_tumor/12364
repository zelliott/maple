The molecular and cellular mechanisms by which zzso zzso album zzso extracts exert zzso and zzso zzso effects are largely zzso In this study the hypothesis that zzso preparations induce tumor zzso by cell cycle zzso and/or interference with zzso signaling pathways in cancer cells was zzso Also a possible effect on zzso which is a prerequisite for tumor growth in zzso is studied in zzso cell zzso Furthermore, it was examined which zzso signaling zzso is zzso activated by zzso by studying specific zzso proteins in cultured zzso To characterize these properties, 9 human cancer cell lines of different origin, one zzso derived cell line and 2 zzso cell cultures were incubated with different zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Cell cycle kinetic parameters were measured by zzso zzso pulse labeling and zzso zzso zzso responses were detected by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was performed by zzso cells for amongst others active zzso 3 and zzso C zzso zzso as well as active zzso 8 zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity to zzso treatment varies strongly between different cell lines and also zzso those derived from small cell lung cancer, and zzso of the lung and breast, as well as zzso cell cultures, zzso caused early cell cycle zzso followed by zzso in a dose dependent zzso zzso the low zzso are cell lines derived from zzso zzso In general zzso zzso exerted a stronger response than zzso zzso zzso was induced by zzso the zzso but not the death zzso dependent pathway, at least in case of zzso zzso zzso zzso also seemed to induce zzso via the death zzso route, which may explain the higher sensitivity of cancer and zzso cells to this zzso
