zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso partially zzso zzso zzso zzso repair and has a zzso effect as well as enhanced sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso is the target protein for zzso by zzso We investigated the mechanisms of zzso of radiation and zzso by zzso zzso using zzso cells treated with zzso for zzso We investigated the focus formation of various kinds of proteins involved in zzso and examined the zzso of zzso by zzso using Western zzso zzso zzso depletion by zzso significantly restrained the formation of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso whereas it increased the number of zzso of zzso The numbers of zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells after radiation were significantly smaller than in the control zzso These results suggest that zzso depletion is attributable to decreased zzso DNA generated by the zzso zzso zzso of DNA zzso break zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso was partially suppressed in zzso cells, suggesting that zzso depletion may partially inhibit DNA repair with zzso by suppressing zzso of zzso zzso depletion showed a zzso effect as well as enhanced sensitivity to zzso The zzso effect of zzso depletion plus zzso was the additive effect of zzso depletion and zzso zzso depletion did not have a zzso effect, suggesting that zzso depletion may not be so zzso Considering these results, the combination of zzso and drugs that inhibit zzso may prove useful for zzso as a method of zzso
