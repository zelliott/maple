A clinical role for zzso reverse zzso zzso using zzso zzso in blood samples from patients with prostate cancer remains zzso zzso variation and detection of zzso zzso zzso illegitimate zzso may explain inconsistent results between zzso Defining levels of zzso zzso zzso expression in blood samples from healthy volunteers and patients with prostate cancer would allow zzso to be established to distinguish the two zzso 

zzso real-time zzso for zzso zzso zzso was established and levels of zzso zzso zzso measured in bloods samples from healthy volunteers zzso and patients with localized zzso and zzso zzso prostate zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso zzso were significantly higher in blood samples from patients with zzso prostate cancer than in blood samples from patients with localized prostate cancer zzso zzso or in blood samples from healthy volunteers zzso zzso levels between patients with localized prostate cancer and healthy volunteers were no zzso zzso sensitivity to detect patients with zzso prostate cancer was zzso with specificity of zzso In patients with newly diagnosed zzso prostate cancer, monitoring response to hormonal therapy was possible with this zzso No correlation between levels of zzso zzso zzso and serum zzso zzso protein levels was found, suggesting that zzso zzso zzso and serum zzso zzso protein levels reflect different features of prostate cancer, zzso circulating tumor cells and total tumor bulk, zzso 

zzso zzso discriminates patients with zzso prostate cancer from healthy volunteers and patients with localized prostate cancer but cannot discriminate patients with localized prostate cancer from healthy zzso A role for quantitative zzso has been identified in the assessment and monitoring of patients with zzso prostate zzso
