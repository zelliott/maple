zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso is an zzso binding zzso containing an zzso domain and thus potentially playing a role in integration of cell signaling and zzso zzso The specific function of zzso is unknown and its implication in cancer is poorly zzso zzso of zzso has been reported in human zzso muscle and brain zzso and is associated with a zzso role in immortalized zzso The aim of this paper was to investigate the functional role of zzso through zzso survival analysis of patients with primary invasive breast cancer and zzso experimental evaluation of the effect of zzso on breast cancer cell zzso zzso protein expression was zzso by zzso zzso in tissue zzso with tumors from zzso patients with primary invasive breast cancer, and correlations to zzso zzso recurrence-free and overall survival zzso and zzso and established tumor markers such as zzso and zzso status were zzso In addition, the function of zzso was investigated using zzso zzso and zzso of the gene in six breast cancer cell zzso Of the tumors zzso zzso showed nuclear zzso zzso which was significantly associated with an improved zzso and strongly associated with positive zzso status and negative hormone zzso zzso Furthermore, experimental data showed that zzso of zzso decreased cellular growth while zzso increased it, as shown both by zzso incorporation and zzso zzso In zzso we demonstrate that zzso protein expression zzso with an improved zzso in primary breast zzso This is supported by functional data, indicating that zzso regulation is of importance both for breast cancer biology and clinical outcome but future studies are needed to determine a potential role in patient zzso
