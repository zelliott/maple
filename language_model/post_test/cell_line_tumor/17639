Nuclear DNA zzso II zzso zzso alternatively named zzso zzso A zzso is an zzso binding protein that is particularly enriched in the zzso of mouse zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso of zzso II of zzso zzso cells depended on an ongoing zzso zzso zzso II migrated out of the zzso after administration of zzso zzso zzso D, while zzso and the upstream binding factor zzso remained zzso In S zzso mouse cells, zzso II was frequently found at the zzso zzso where it was accompanied by newly zzso zzso zzso Human zzso II was mainly distributed through the whole zzso and not enriched in the zzso However, in the human breast zzso cell line zzso zzso II was also found at the zzso zzso together with the tumor zzso protein zzso Both zzso II and zzso were apparently attached to the zzso zzso network that surrounded the zzso zzso this zzso structure was sensitive to zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso led to a striking zzso of zzso II in the zzso of zzso zzso This effect was abolished by zzso which extensively released zzso zzso II when added together with zzso Taken together, these results support the idea that an zzso zzso network may anchor zzso II at the zzso periphery for zzso zzso processing, zzso zzso and/or zzso
