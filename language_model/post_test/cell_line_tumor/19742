Two zzso zzso based on zzso zzso linked zzso zzso were zzso by applying different reaction temperatures, 20 degrees C zzso and 60 degrees C zzso Their structural properties were analyzed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso exclusion zzso coupled with zzso laser light scattering zzso zzso temperature strongly influenced molecular weight and zzso ratio and thus resulted in zzso with different biological activities and degradation zzso zzso was an zzso zzso of zzso zzso which zzso rapidly at pH 7 and pH 9 zzso zzso had a molecular weight of zzso zzso was mainly based on zzso and zzso more slowly than zzso Both zzso zzso gene transfer as efficiently as linear zzso of 22 zzso in two cell lines while being less toxic at their optimal zzso zzso zzso zzso needed higher zzso ratios for gene zzso however, it was significantly less toxic than zzso
