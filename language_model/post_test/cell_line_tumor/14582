The novel zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso showed zzso activity towards several cancer cell lines in zzso To investigate the zzso mechanisms, the zzso effects of zzso in human breast cancer cells were zzso and the mechanism of this action was further zzso Cell zzso was detected by zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was zzso using a zzso zzso detection zzso Western zzso analysis was used to evaluate the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso c zzso The results showed that zzso inhibited the growth of zzso cells in a zzso and zzso zzso Typical characteristics of zzso were observed, including zzso changes, zzso cells and DNA zzso zzso Further analysis showed that zzso treatment disrupted the zzso membrane potential followed by an increase in the zzso c zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the activities of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner, however, no obvious zzso of zzso was zzso zzso and zzso inhibitor prevented zzso zzso and the activities of zzso -9 were significantly zzso by zzso Our studies suggest that zzso zzso zzso via a zzso zzso
