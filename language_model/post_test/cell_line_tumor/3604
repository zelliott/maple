Although the roles of zzso in B cells have been zzso zzso little is known on the function of zzso in lung cancer cell zzso This study was to investigate biological effects of soluble zzso zzso zzso on lung cancer cell line zzso zzso zzso and its possible zzso 

zzso cells were zzso with zzso cell proliferation was detected by zzso zzso and zzso incorporation zzso zzso technique and flow zzso zzso were used to evaluate changes in cell zzso and cell zzso Cell zzso and expression changes of zzso and zzso were observed by zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and Western zzso 

Compared with control cells, proliferation of zzso cells zzso with zzso was inhibited zzso zzso Positive rates of cell surface zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells zzso with zzso for 72 h were zzso zzso and zzso respectively, while those in control cells were zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso However, positive rate of zzso in zzso cells zzso with zzso was lower than that in control cells zzso zzso zzso zzso phase of zzso cells treated with zzso for 72 h was zzso more than that of control cells zzso while S phase of zzso zzso cells zzso was less than that of control cells zzso No significant zzso of zzso cells was observed after zzso with zzso for 72 zzso but zzso expression was zzso 

zzso may inhibit cell zzso cause changes in zzso and cell cycle of zzso cells, and alter expression of zzso zzso such as zzso
