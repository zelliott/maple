zzso zzso cell zzso zzso which is the most common zzso of the oral zzso is often associated with local and regional zzso Increased expression of zzso zzso zzso is correlated with invasive behavior of zzso Because transforming growth factor zzso zzso is zzso in zzso tumors, we examined the relationship between zzso signaling and zzso in human zzso zzso zzso of human specimens showed that tumors with enhanced zzso signaling also showed increased zzso zzso Because the zzso factor Snail has been determined to be a key zzso of zzso zzso we evaluated the role of Snail in zzso zzso zzso Initially, we examined the extent to which zzso regulated Snail expression in oral zzso and in zzso cell zzso zzso enhanced Snail expression in a majority of the cell lines zzso with the largest induction of Snail detected in zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of Snail in zzso cells enhanced zzso and tissue inhibitor of zzso protein zzso Despite the increase in the tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso there was a net increase in the zzso zzso activity as shown by enhanced zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso In addition, Snail increased zzso levels and zzso zzso blocked both zzso and zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso Thus, these data show that Snail functions as a molecular zzso of zzso zzso expression by increasing zzso and thereby contributing to oral cancer zzso
