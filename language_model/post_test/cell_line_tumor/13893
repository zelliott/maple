zzso beta zzso the major component of the senile plaques of Alzheimer's disease, is implicated in zzso cell zzso We have found that zzso a zzso form of zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso expression of zzso We have further demonstrated that the addition into culture media of zzso zzso to zzso or a large amount of the zzso soluble zzso precursor protein zzso the zzso domain of zzso precursor protein zzso generated by alpha zzso suppresses death in primary cortical zzso zzso induced by zzso in zzso Combined with the finding in our recent study indicating that zzso is a zzso cell zzso zzso for zzso it is suggested that zzso is an zzso zzso for zzso death in zzso
