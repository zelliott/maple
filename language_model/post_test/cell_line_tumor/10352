zzso zzso is a major mechanism to regulate gene zzso This zzso modification is modified in cancer zzso In various tumor types the levels of zzso at several zzso zzso are associated to clinical zzso By using zzso we show that zzso levels of zzso at positions zzso of zzso zzso zzso are significantly higher in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso than in normal zzso zzso Similar data have been obtained when zzso levels of zzso 18 of zzso zzso zzso were zzso In this case, however, no difference was observed between zzso and zzso When zzso levels of zzso 12 of zzso zzso zzso were zzso only zzso showed significantly higher levels in comparison with zzso These data indicate that modification zzso zzso is an early event along zzso tumor progression and that zzso zzso is switched off in the transition between differentiated and zzso zzso zzso By using rat zzso cell lines that are zzso zzso with zzso zzso we show that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso increase levels of zzso and zzso In the zzso rat zzso cell line zzso zzso increases levels of zzso However, this hormone decreases levels of zzso and zzso In conclusion, our data indicate that zzso transformation and hormonal stimulation can modify levels of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
