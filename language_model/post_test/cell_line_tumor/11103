The invasive and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso are positively correlated with the expression level of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso stimulates zzso zzso cells to acquire invasive zzso in association with the enhanced expression of zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the molecular mechanism underlying the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso The treatment of zzso cells with zzso induced the expression of zzso zzso and zzso these cells to adhere to zzso and to migrate through zzso zzso The promoter activity was measured by zzso zzso with a series of deletion zzso of the zzso region of the mouse zzso zzso zzso and the results showed that the zzso region zzso to the major zzso start zzso contained elements responsive to zzso zzso The introduction of zzso into the putative consensus binding sequence for the zzso of zzso factors located at zzso greatly decreased the promoter activity responding to zzso zzso The nuclear proteins extracted from zzso zzso cells yielded a larger amount of zzso protein complexes than did those extracted from zzso cells, as determined by an zzso mobility shift zzso using an zzso containing the zzso as a zzso These results suggest that zzso stimulates zzso cells to express a higher level of zzso zzso by zzso zzso via zzso zzso factors and to exhibit a more invasive zzso
