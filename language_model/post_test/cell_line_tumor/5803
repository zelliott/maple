The protein association of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso is essential for the zzso zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso interaction and complex formation at the zzso promoter of zzso was zzso The basic region and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zinc finger zzso motifs of zzso and the DNA binding domain of zzso were identified as regions responsible for the interactions between zzso The zzso interaction was confirmed by zzso resonance energy transfer zzso zzso of live zzso The combination of zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso exists as a zzso zzso and zzso induced a zzso in zzso zzso zzso favorable for its association with zzso and zzso zzso zzso and small interfering zzso zzso of members of the complex in breast cancer cells demonstrated the zzso recruitment of components of the complex onto the zzso promoter of the zzso zzso zzso is the preferred zzso for the recruitment of zzso to the complex that zzso the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated in zzso breast cancer zzso This study indicates that the enhanced complex formation of zzso zzso with zzso and zzso by zzso has an essential role in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
