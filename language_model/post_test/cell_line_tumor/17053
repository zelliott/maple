Increased zzso is among the zzso characteristics of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso gene encodes a key factor for zzso transport into zzso zzso However, the expression and functional significance of zzso in zzso have not been fully zzso zzso we investigated the association of zzso expression with clinical outcomes in patients with zzso using zzso zzso for zzso in zzso zzso We also assessed the efficacy of zzso zzso as an zzso treatment in zzso cell lines with altered expression of zzso 

We obtained total zzso from zzso tissue by zzso in 47 patients with zzso zzso expression levels were evaluated by quantitative real-time zzso chain zzso We analyzed the association of zzso expression levels with clinical zzso We also examined changes in zzso expression and zzso responses in zzso using 4 zzso cell lines treated with a zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso expression was associated with poor zzso Moreover, elevated zzso expression independently predicted overall zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso expression tended to be localized to the centers of zzso cell zzso Our in zzso studies showed that zzso acid significantly suppressed the proliferation of zzso cells with high zzso gene expression compared with those with low zzso 

zzso zzso are a potential therapeutic option for treating aggressive tumors expressing zzso
