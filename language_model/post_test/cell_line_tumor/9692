Previous studies have suggested zzso expression of membrane zzso in tumor zzso This aim of the study was to determine the expression level of soluble zzso zzso in circulation and to subsequently evaluate the clinical significance of circulating zzso in patients with zzso cell lung cancer zzso The level of circulating zzso was determined with zzso and its correlation with the clinical data was zzso zzso operating characteristic zzso curve analysis was performed to compare the sensitivity and specificity in the diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso levels in patients with zzso were significantly higher than those in patients with other pulmonary diseases zzso zzso or those in healthy volunteers ( zzso Using a zzso of zzso the sensitivity and specificity of zzso in zzso between patients with zzso and patients with zzso and between patients with zzso and healthy volunteers was, zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, higher levels of zzso were associated with higher tumor stage, tumor size, zzso zzso and distant zzso but not with sex, age or zzso zzso An area under the curve zzso for all stages of zzso resulting from zzso zzso which was significantly better than any other tumor markers tested including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest circulating zzso is a valuable zzso for zzso and an elevated level of circulating zzso suggests a poor clinical character for zzso
