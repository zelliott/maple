zzso zzso is a common feature of most types of human zzso Although several studies have shown that zzso of zzso might participate in the progression of tumors, the mechanism by which zzso zzso causes the invasion and zzso of tumors remains zzso In this study, we zzso a zzso containing the full-length zzso of zzso into a zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso Vacant zzso zzso cells served as a control zzso We then compared the biological and zzso changes in these zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein was detected in zzso cells by Western zzso analysis and zzso zzso The zzso length in zzso cells was longer than that in zzso and zzso zzso zzso We also found using vacuum zzso aspiration that zzso zzso did not only promote the proliferation of zzso zzso cells but also increased the cellular zzso capacity to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed an increased invasion ability in zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso zzso promotes the invasion of zzso zzso zzso zzso maintenance enables these cells to achieve a fully zzso zzso including invasion and zzso
