Two important electric forces, zzso zzso and zzso zzso are demonstrated by zzso zzso on a single chip to manipulate objects on different zzso which results in a zzso zzso in an zzso zzso By applying appropriate electric signals with different zzso on identical electrodes, zzso and zzso can be selectively generated on the proposed zzso At low zzso the applied zzso is consumed mostly in the zzso layer and causes zzso to pump liquid droplets on the zzso zzso However, high frequency signals establish electric fields in the liquid and generate zzso forces to zzso cells or particles on the zzso scale inside the zzso For better performance of zzso and zzso square and strip zzso are zzso zzso zzso cells zzso and polystyrene beads are successfully zzso by a 2 zzso signal in a zzso by positive zzso and negative zzso zzso zzso splitting is achieved by zzso with a 1 zzso signal after moving cells or beads to one side of the zzso Cell zzso measured by a cell count chamber before and after experiments, increases zzso times from zzso zzso zzso cells zzso to zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with a single cycle of positive zzso zzso By comparing the zzso frequency of the zzso drop in the zzso layer and the zzso frequency of zzso of the suspended zzso we can estimate the zzso behaviors between zzso positive zzso and negative zzso A proposed weighted zzso zzso analysis of the zzso phenomenon on zzso zzso
