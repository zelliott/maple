Early detection of response to zzso zzso in zzso cancer may allow zzso of treatment strategies and avoidance of unnecessary zzso Although zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso permits detection of changes in tumor proliferation before any change in tumor size is zzso zzso may fail to distinguish between residual tumor and inflammation and between complete response and partial response with substantial residual tumor zzso PET with the zzso analogue zzso zzso is more accurate than zzso in visualizing early changes in tumor zzso In a recent study in experimental models of zzso cancer, zzso was more accurate than zzso in detecting early changes in proliferation following zzso and radiation therapy in human zzso cells and mouse zzso zzso including having a much stronger correlation with zzso zzso Clinical studies are needed to determine if zzso can distinguish among degrees of response to zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso The ability to zzso tumor cell proliferation may also contribute to the ability to improve precision delivery of radiation zzso
