zzso zzso of locomotion zzso occurs when a cell stops zzso in a particular direction upon contact with another zzso Many cancer cells show zzso zzso of locomotion when zzso one another but display zzso migration following collision with zzso zzso Here we review current understanding of zzso zzso of zzso from zzso historical studies of cells in tissue culture to more recent analyses of zzso zzso of locomotion in zzso We discuss the cellular machinery required for zzso and the molecular signals that regulate zzso We focus on our recent finding that in prostate cancer cells, zzso zzso of locomotion is regulated by a balance between zzso and zzso zzso zzso We show that, as recently described for chick heart zzso zzso dynamics are required for zzso zzso of locomotion in prostate cancer cells and we propose that stabilization of zzso could account for defective zzso zzso of locomotion between cancer cells and zzso zzso
