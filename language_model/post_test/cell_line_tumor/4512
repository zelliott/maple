The objective of this study is to zzso zzso cancer zzso cells to zzso zzso using an inhibitor of zzso zzso The efficacy of zzso in combination with zzso was determined in zzso ex zzso and in zzso 

Human zzso cell lines zzso and their zzso zzso zzso were treated with zzso zzso and the combined treatment zzso and cell zzso zzso and protein expression levels, zzso distribution, and DNA damage were then zzso Furthermore, the efficacy of zzso combined with zzso was further examined in established primary cell cultures and zzso zzso 

The combination of zzso with zzso induced zzso cell cycle arrest and zzso increased DNA damage, and decreased zzso levels, especially in zzso zzso zzso Additionally, zzso in combination with zzso zzso primary cell cultures to zzso Studies in zzso showed how this combination significantly decreased the tumor size of zzso zzso 

Our results demonstrate that in zzso cells the expression of zzso did not affect their sensitivity to zzso suggesting that zzso was not the only target of zzso The combination of zzso with zzso could be a good option for therapy of zzso zzso independently of zzso zzso
