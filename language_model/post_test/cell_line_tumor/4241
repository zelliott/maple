Second harmonic generation zzso imaging using near infrared laser light is the key to improving penetration zzso leading to biological zzso Unfortunately, currently zzso imaging techniques have limited capability due to the poor zzso ratio, resulting from the low zzso efficiency of available zzso zzso tumor imaging over zzso zzso is also a challenge that needs to be zzso Driven by this need, in this study, the development of zzso zzso imaging of live cancer cell lines selectively by enhancement of the zzso optical response of gold zzso zzso is zzso Experimental results show that zzso scattering intensity can be increased by few orders of magnitude by just developing zzso zzso zzso modeling indicates that the field enhancement values for the zzso zzso can explain, in part, the enhanced zzso optical zzso Our experimental data also show that A9 zzso zzso zzso gold zzso zzso can be used for targeted zzso imaging of the zzso prostate cancer cell zzso Experimental results with the zzso normal skin cell lines show that zzso zzso zzso demonstrate zzso imaging that is highly selective and will be able to distinguish targeted cancer cell lines from other zzso cell zzso After zzso this reported zzso imaging zzso could have considerable application for zzso
