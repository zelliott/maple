To explore the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso B zzso signal zzso on the process of zzso hormone zzso zzso cell proliferation and invasion in human zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cancer cell lines zzso and zzso were cultured to exponential phase, then assigned to control group, zzso group, zzso group and zzso + zzso group, zzso zzso were treated with different concentration of zzso and zzso zzso The effects of zzso on cell proliferation were observed by zzso zzso zzso zzso changes were observed by phase contrast zzso The ability of cell invasion was investigated by zzso invasion zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein were detected by western zzso 

zzso zzso could promote the proliferation of zzso and zzso zzso When the cells were treated with 40 zzso zzso for 48 hours zzso and 24 hours zzso compared with those in control groups, they reached the highest proliferation rate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso cells in four zzso control group, zzso cells were short zzso and zzso cells were long zzso the zzso of them were both zzso or oval, the zzso were zzso In zzso group, the cells changed to slightly longer or zzso they were full in shape, meanwhile, the cell intensity were higher than control zzso In zzso group, some cells changed from zzso to round, and began to zzso The cell intensity zzso The zzso of zzso + zzso group was similar with control group, but the cell intensity was lower than that in zzso zzso zzso The number of zzso cell that passed through the membrane in control group, zzso group, zzso group and zzso + zzso group was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (18 zzso 5) and zzso zzso zzso zzso The number of zzso cell was (19 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (12 zzso 3) and zzso zzso zzso zzso The results showed that the number of cells in zzso group was significantly higher than that in control group zzso zzso zzso while the number of cell in zzso + zzso group was significantly fewer than that in zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no significant difference in the expression of zzso and zzso between zzso group and control group zzso zzso zzso but zzso increased the expression of zzso and the ratio of zzso zzso in the nucleus versus zzso in zzso and zzso cells, there were significant differences compared with control group zzso zzso zzso zzso reversed the effects of zzso on increasing the expression of zzso and the ratio of zzso zzso in the nucleus versus zzso there were significant differences among zzso group, zzso + zzso group and zzso group zzso zzso zzso 

The effects of zzso on proliferation and invasion of zzso cancer cell lines zzso and zzso may be realized by regulating the activity of zzso in zzso signal zzso
