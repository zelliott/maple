There has been considerable interest in targeting cell cycle checkpoints particularly in emerging and alternative zzso zzso Here, we show that checkpoint zzso by zzso a potent and selective zzso zzso inhibitor enhances zzso treatment efficacy in immature zzso zzso cell line and in zzso patient samples, particularly those with a complex zzso which display major zzso instability and zzso Furthermore, these data suggest that zzso zzso level might be useful markers to select zzso patients susceptible to receive checkpoint inhibitor in combination with conventional zzso Moreover, this study demonstrates for the first time that zzso inhibitor targets the zzso primitive zzso zzso which are responsible for the majority of zzso patients zzso Finally, zzso zzso does not seem to affect zzso potential of normal zzso zzso
