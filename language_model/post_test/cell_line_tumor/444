We developed a zzso system, which zzso between zzso zzso zzso and imaging bright field and zzso zzso image volumes with zzso For applications requiring zzso detection of zzso labeled cells anywhere in a zzso we are developing software for reduction of zzso zzso In mouse experiments, we zzso zzso cancer and stem cells, and zzso fluorescent zzso To remove zzso fluorescence, we used a simplified model of zzso interaction zzso the zzso was zzso zzso and zzso from the current zzso We estimated zzso and blurring parameters by minimizing an objective function on zzso zzso zzso zzso parameters zzso heart zzso zzso zzso zzso liver zzso zzso zzso zzso brain zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to be within the range of estimates in the zzso zzso processing removed zzso zzso equally well across multiple zzso zzso zzso liver, zzso and analysis of 200 zzso images gave 97 zzso zzso reduction of zzso zzso zzso processing greatly improved zzso enabled high quality zzso volume zzso and improved automated zzso of single cells by up to zzso The method has been used to identify zzso cancer sites, determine zzso of stem cells to injury sites, and show zzso distribution correlated with blood flow zzso
