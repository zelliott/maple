We studied the effects of DNA zzso break zzso repair deficiencies on zzso aberration frequency using low doses zzso zzso of gamma rays and zzso iron zzso zzso zzso 151 zzso zzso aberrations were measured using the zzso zzso painting zzso The cell lines included zzso deficient in zzso zzso of the gene that is zzso in zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of the gene zzso in the zzso breakage zzso and zzso cells zzso in or lacking zzso protein zzso zzso zzso The yields of both simple and complex zzso aberrations were increased in zzso zzso cells compared to normal zzso the increase was more than twofold higher for gamma rays compared to iron zzso For zzso zzso the zzso and zzso lines were found to have significantly larger zzso components compared to normal zzso for both simple and complex zzso while the linear zzso term was significantly higher only for the zzso zzso For simple and complex aberrations induced by iron zzso zzso models preferred purely linear and zzso dose responses, respectively, for each cell line zzso zzso were reduced relative to normal cells for all of the zzso zzso lines, with the zzso cells found to have zzso near zzso The large increase in the zzso zzso terms in the zzso zzso cell lines points to the importance of the functions of zzso and zzso in zzso modifications to facilitate correct zzso repair and to minimize aberration zzso The differences found between AT and zzso cells at lower doses suggest important questions about the zzso of observations of radiation sensitivity at high doses to zzso zzso
