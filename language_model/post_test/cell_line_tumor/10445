zzso imaging systems are capable of detecting and zzso subtle differences in light zzso In this study we coupled spectral imaging with zzso and white light zzso to develop new methods for zzso zzso and zzso For zzso we employed zzso imaging to examine spectral changes in the zzso of zzso a zzso protein commonly used to track zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso exhibited a spectral profile that was distinctly different from diffuse zzso zzso We then exploited this shift in spectral quality to zzso the amount of zzso signal in single zzso zzso zzso an zzso agent that increases zzso number, significantly increased the zzso zzso spectral signature, providing zzso for this zzso For studying zzso we employed the zzso and zzso Imaging zzso System zzso zzso imaging system to identify a spectral signature for active zzso zzso in ex zzso tumor zzso This system was then used to rapidly zzso zzso induced by zzso an zzso zzso zzso in zzso sections from a zzso mouse zzso We further found that the zzso could accurately distinguish zzso tumor regions in zzso and zzso zzso which allowed us to zzso death zzso zzso in the absence of an zzso zzso These spectral imaging systems provide zzso quantitative and fast means for studying zzso and zzso and complement the existing methods in their respective zzso
