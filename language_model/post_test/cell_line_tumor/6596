To compare the therapeutic and toxic profile of zzso given zzso with zzso in human zzso cancer zzso into zzso nude zzso 

Eighty female zzso mice were zzso assigned into eight groups zzso zzso resulted from zzso injection of cultured human zzso cancer cells zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso treatment with either zzso or zzso zzso zzso was on day zzso Animals scheduled for zzso zzso received zzso application of zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso zzso zzso 2 or zzso zzso zzso zzso Animals scheduled for zzso zzso received intravenous administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 or zzso zzso zzso zzso Two weeks after drug application animals were zzso zzso growth zzso were assessed and compared with zzso mice and zzso zzso administered zzso Acute toxicity was determined by loss of body zzso Cell cycle division and zzso after drug administration was determined by flow zzso zzso 

In a panel of ten zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly more effective than intravenous zzso The toxicity profile suggested a better zzso in terms of weight loss after zzso administration than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per day (1 day) schedule was an optimal treatment for zzso cancer and well tolerated by mice with no signs of acute zzso zzso and zzso induce cells zzso arrest and apparent zzso No significant difference among mice treated with zzso zzso or zzso or zzso was observed in term of zzso and cell cycle zzso 

The results may have implications for the future design of clinical studies on zzso application of zzso It suggests that zzso and cell cycle zzso play an limited role in the mechanism of zzso zzso
