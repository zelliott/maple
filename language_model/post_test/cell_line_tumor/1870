zzso are implicated in cancer initiation and progression by their ability to affect the expression of genes and proteins that regulate cell proliferation and zzso Recent studies found that the stem zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso are among the target genes regulated by zzso zzso suggesting that zzso possibly plays a role in the maintenance of cancer stem zzso zzso it is important to address the involvement of zzso in the key roles of cancer stem cells in cancer zzso progression and zzso We compared zzso expression in the cancer zzso cells zzso derived from zzso in the zzso cell line zzso and in the normal liver zzso zzso cell line zzso As demonstrated by a zzso zzso real-time zzso zzso cells express lower zzso levels compared to the other cell zzso To address the role of zzso in cancer stem cells, zzso was restored in zzso zzso This resulted in zzso zzso arrest in cell zzso and significantly inhibited zzso cell expansion in zzso and zzso tumor growth in zzso Moreover, zzso restoration diminished zzso growth of zzso cells in zzso and zzso cells tumor formation in nude mice in zzso Additionally, the increase in zzso levels paralleled the decrease in zzso zzso The effect of zzso on tumor suppression in zzso cells was partly reversed by zzso of zzso both in zzso and in zzso zzso our data indicate that zzso plays an important role in cancer stem cell zzso potentially via zzso of the downstream target, zzso
