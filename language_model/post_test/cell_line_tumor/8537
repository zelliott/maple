zzso zzso is associated with therapy resistance and zzso Previously we demonstrated that zzso of zzso and the unfolded protein response zzso promote zzso zzso Here we explored the importance of zzso in zzso zzso zzso induction and its zzso value for recurrence after zzso 

zzso regulation of zzso zzso and protein was assessed in zzso and in primary human head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso zzso Its importance in zzso zzso zzso zzso and tolerance to chronic and acute zzso was evaluated in zzso zzso zzso The zzso value of zzso zzso expression was assessed in 82 zzso zzso 

zzso enrichment was observed in hypoxic tumor zzso High enrichment was associated with a high hypoxic zzso In line with these findings, high zzso expression in zzso patients appeared associated with poor local zzso Exposure of cells to zzso induced zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso dependent zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso increased zzso mass and zzso exposure and zzso cells to acute and chronic zzso 

We demonstrate that zzso is a zzso regulated gene and is associated with zzso tolerance and a worse clinical zzso
