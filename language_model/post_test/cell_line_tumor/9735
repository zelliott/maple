The results of many studies have reported that peptides from the zzso family are involved in the regulation of cell growth, zzso cell migration, zzso zzso zzso and zzso which suggests that they might play an important role in zzso The role of the zzso system in supporting prostate cancer induction and progression has so far received little zzso 

The present study was to examine the influence of zzso II, zzso III, and zzso IV on a human zzso prostate cancer line zzso Using an zzso method, we tested the effects of zzso on zzso zzso activity, and measured cell viability using an zzso zzso 

The results showed that only zzso IV significantly reduced zzso zzso activity and cell viability in zzso zzso The process seemed to be zzso partly by zzso and probably by another type of zzso with high affinity for zzso IV and low affinity for zzso and zzso 

These findings suggest that components of the zzso system, specifically zzso peptides and receptors zzso zzso can modify prostate cancer cell zzso
