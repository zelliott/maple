zzso zzso cleave peptides on the zzso side of internal zzso zzso and their zzso has potential in the treatment of human brain zzso Using our zzso program zzso we have designed a series of constrained zzso zzso built from a series of zzso zzso to study the optimal shape required for these small zzso These structures bear zzso functional groups that we predicted to zzso bind to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and biological zzso using human zzso zzso cells and zzso cells and human zzso revealed that these compounds act as selective zzso of zzso zzso activity compared to zzso activity, are able to penetrate the cells and inhibit zzso activities in intact living zzso This integrated zzso and experimental study shed light on the binding mode of zzso in the zzso active site and will guide the design of future zzso zzso
