zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling is now increasingly reported in a variety of human zzso zzso cell lung cancer zzso is among such human zzso with zzso zzso zzso yet the exact zzso of zzso deregulation in zzso biology, in particular in zzso remains zzso Here, we demonstrated a specific role of zzso in the control of the zzso capacity of zzso cells derived from human lung zzso a major zzso of zzso Despite its potent zzso activity on zzso cell growth in zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso failed to inhibit the growth of zzso zzso zzso in zzso when zzso zzso Nevertheless, the same zzso treatment caused a marked reduction in the zzso population within the zzso tumors, suggesting that zzso may be specifically required in zzso for the maintenance of the zzso population of tumor cells rather than for proliferation and survival of the entire cell zzso Furthermore, zzso cells either zzso with zzso or zzso zzso with zzso against the zzso genes in zzso showed substantially reduced ability to initiate tumor formation upon zzso into nude mice, zzso that the cell intrinsic zzso activity of zzso cells is essential for the maintenance of their zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that zzso is involved in the control of the zzso capacity of zzso zzso Our findings also give rise to an intriguing possibility that therapies targeting zzso could contribute to prevention of zzso and/or zzso of zzso through elimination of zzso zzso
