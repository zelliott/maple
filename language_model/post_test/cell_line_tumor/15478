The translation of zzso zzso peptides into clinical routine is often hampered by an enhanced zzso into the zzso zzso It has recently been reported that the zzso zzso tag is able to improve the zzso of zzso zzso zzso the aim of this study was to prove the positive influence of zzso on the zzso of 2 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso is zzso and zzso is zzso acid zzso 

Both compounds were compared with their respective zzso zzso in zzso in zzso zzso and organ zzso 

The introduction of zzso to zzso significantly changed the zzso zzso In both cases, the zzso in several zzso was reduced whereas tumor zzso was not zzso Most importantly, zzso lowered the kidney and liver zzso of the zzso membrane zzso inhibitor each by a factor of zzso and, in the case of zzso the liver zzso by a factor of zzso 

The zzso data suggest that zzso is able to improve the zzso properties of zzso zzso leading to reduced zzso in zzso such as the liver, an important site of zzso zzso
