We are developing a novel treatment for high-grade zzso using near zzso zzso zzso that are zzso activated upon exposure to a near infrared laser, thereby zzso damaging zzso zzso The goal of this work was to determine the efficacy of zzso zzso therapy in zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso were induced in male zzso mice by subcutaneous zzso of zzso zzso zzso human zzso cells and zzso and survival studies were zzso To evaluate zzso zzso zzso were delivered zzso to zzso mice and after 6, 24, or 48 h the zzso liver, zzso brain, muscle, and blood were assessed for gold content by zzso coupled zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the tumor increased for the first 24 h and stabilized zzso Treatment efficacy was evaluated by delivering saline or zzso zzso and zzso irradiating tumors with a near infrared laser 24 h zzso Success of treatment was assessed by monitoring tumor size, tumor zzso and survival time of the mice following laser zzso There was a significant improvement in survival for the zzso treatment group versus the control zzso zzso zzso and 57% of the mice in the zzso treatment group remained tumor free at the end of the zzso study zzso By comparison, none of the mice in the control group survived beyond 24 days and mean survival was only zzso zzso The results of these studies suggest that zzso zzso therapy represents a promising novel treatment strategy for zzso zzso
