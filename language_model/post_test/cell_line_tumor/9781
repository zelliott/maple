zzso a traditional zzso and zzso agent, has been reported to exert zzso activity on several human tumor cell zzso This study investigates the zzso function and the functional mechanism of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso presented here demonstrated that zzso had zzso effects on cell viability of human zzso cell line zzso cells through inducing cell zzso In the molecular level, zzso did not successfully initiate zzso signaling pathway, but zzso the nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso Our studies suggest that zzso functions as an effective zzso zzso in a zzso but zzso zzso thus providing a promising agent for tumor types with zzso zzso
