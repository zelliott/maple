zzso C virus zzso is one of the major causes of chronic liver disease with the potential for development of zzso zzso zzso The core protein of zzso has been shown to zzso expression of various cellular genes and to influence a number of cellular zzso We investigated the effect of zzso expressed zzso core protein on cell cycle progression in zzso cell line, which is derived from a differentiated human zzso and shows zzso features similar to human zzso The results indicated that stable expression of the core protein in zzso zzso cells induced a zzso of the cell cycle with reduced cell doubling zzso and increased S phase zzso zzso of zzso protein above the zzso expression level was demonstrated with a significant increase of zzso stability, as revealed by its prolonged zzso zzso in zzso expressing zzso core zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso levels were zzso These results suggest that zzso core protein may promote cell cycle progression in zzso cells possibly through increasing stability of zzso zzso These results are in support of important role played by zzso core protein in zzso zzso in persistently infected hosts and in zzso
