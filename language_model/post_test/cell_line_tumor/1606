The zzso target of zzso zzso plays a role in controlling zzso cellular zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso are currently being evaluated in cancer zzso However, a significant number of tumors are zzso zzso In this study, we report that the ability of zzso to zzso zzso a zzso of the zzso protein zzso complex, identifies tumors that are sensitive to zzso zzso interference zzso zzso of zzso in human tumor cells increased their sensitivity to zzso in zzso and inhibited the growth of tumor zzso in zzso Our findings suggest that zzso levels are a key zzso of zzso responses to zzso zzso highlighting a potentially important zzso marker to predict sensitivity to zzso as well as zzso zzso strategies for therapeutic zzso
