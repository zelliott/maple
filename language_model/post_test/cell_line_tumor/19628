To determine the effects of zzso on the growth, migration and invasion of zzso cancer cells and the mechanisms underlying such zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso protein zzso was zzso into zzso zzso cancer cells by zzso zzso zzso the zzso and the cells that expressed zzso zzso were screened out by zzso The changes in zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso protein levels were measured by Western zzso growth zzso were estimated by the zzso zzso zzso then zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell invasion zzso were used to measure zzso zzso and invasion in zzso and control zzso 

The zzso protein level in zzso zzso cells was significantly higher than that in control cells, while the zzso protein level was significantly zzso zzso zzso cells had less proliferation than control zzso zzso with zzso cells, the invasion and zzso zzso ability of zzso zzso cells decreased zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso ability was significantly zzso 

zzso might act as a zzso zzso participating in negative feedback control of zzso zzso which zzso zzso cancer cells from growth, migration and zzso
