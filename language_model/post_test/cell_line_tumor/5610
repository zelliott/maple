zzso zzso has been reported to play an important role in the development of a variety of human zzso zzso expression is revealed to be reduced or absent in the zzso tumor cells of small cell lung zzso zzso This study was performed to investigate the influences of the stable expression of zzso on the zzso and proliferation of zzso in zzso The zzso zzso gene was successfully zzso into the zzso cells and was zzso expressed in the zzso zzso The effects of zzso on the zzso zzso and zzso potential for zzso cell were evaluated by crystal violet zzso zzso analysis, zzso zzso and scratch wound zzso zzso Western zzso and gelatin zzso were used to examine the expression changes of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression of zzso was observed in the zzso cells, which enlarged the cell shape with zzso The proliferation of zzso was zzso while its migration and invasion abilities were promoted in zzso The zzso of zzso reduced the expression of zzso while it increased the protein expression and zzso activity of zzso Taken together, the cellular proliferation of the zzso could be inhibited by the zzso of zzso zzso might increase the cell zzso potential through the interaction with zzso and zzso zzso These in zzso findings confirm the involvement of zzso in the proliferation and zzso of zzso
