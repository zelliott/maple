zzso cell growth and tissue invasion define the characteristic features of zzso Several growth factors regulate these processes by inducing specific signaling zzso We show that zzso a novel factor, is expressed in human zzso and its expression is markedly increased in zzso zzso This finding indicated possible involvement of zzso in zzso cancer zzso We observed that zzso stimulates the proliferation of human zzso zzso cells, zzso and zzso Furthermore, through the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso pathway, zzso regulates the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and thus zzso cellular zzso zzso of zzso as well as zzso zzso reduces the zzso and invasive behavior of zzso cancer zzso Moreover, zzso tumors with zzso zzso expression also showed zzso of zzso zzso that prompted us to investigate possible interaction among zzso zzso and zzso zzso We identified that zzso zzso zzso factor interacts with and regulates zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso promoter possesses the binding elements of zzso as well as zzso factor zzso in close zzso where zzso and zzso binds to and zzso activates the zzso A detail study showed that both zzso and zzso factor elements and the interaction with their binding partners are necessary for target gene zzso Taken together, our findings indicate that zzso in conjunction with zzso zzso contributes to the cancer zzso of zzso cells and suggests that zzso of its expression in zzso cells might be a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of invasive zzso zzso
