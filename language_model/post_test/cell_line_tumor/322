zzso are short regulatory zzso that zzso zzso gene expression at the zzso level, and are deeply involved in the zzso of several types of zzso To investigate whether specific zzso and their target genes participate in the molecular zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to assess the differential expression profiles of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso compared with normal zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by specific zzso zzso inhibited the proliferation potential of zzso cells, whereas zzso of zzso elevated growth activity of the cells, as detected by the colony formation zzso The cell number reduction caused by zzso zzso was due to the loss of control of the zzso phase transition, instead of a noticeable increase in zzso zzso a new target gene of zzso zzso was found to be zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to act as a zzso cycle regulator and tumor zzso These findings indicate that zzso expression of zzso may contribute to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso by maintaining a low level of zzso The identification of the zzso zzso and its target zzso zzso in zzso zzso is potentially valuable for cancer diagnosis and zzso
