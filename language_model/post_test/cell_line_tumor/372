zzso plasma cholesterol levels are considered responsible for excess cardiovascular morbidity and zzso zzso in plasma is tightly controlled by cholesterol within zzso Here, we developed and applied an zzso functional zzso strategy that allows systematic identification of regulators of cellular cholesterol zzso zzso genes were identified by zzso zzso profiling of zzso cells and systematic literature zzso The role of these genes in cholesterol regulation was then tested by targeted zzso zzso experiments zzso cellular cholesterol levels and the efficiency of zzso zzso zzso zzso With this strategy, 20 genes were identified as functional regulators of cellular cholesterol zzso Of these, we describe zzso as zzso target gene that under zzso conditions zzso to zzso compartments and binds to LDL cholesterol zzso protein zzso C1 zzso Taken together, zzso and other factors described here are promising to yield further insights into how cells control cholesterol zzso
