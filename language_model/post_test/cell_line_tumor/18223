zzso zzso a zzso zzso gene expressed in the zzso zzso functions as a zzso zzso either by direct DNA binding to paired zzso zzso sites or through recruitment by the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso Here, we report that zzso is zzso modified by small zzso modifier proteins zzso Members of the zzso family of proteins enhance zzso zzso and this modification occurs on at least six zzso zzso zzso expression of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso breast cancer cells results in zzso changes giving rise to cells with increased cell zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso can effectively repress zzso induction of the zzso promoter, indicating that zzso is not required for zzso repression of promoters where recruitment occurs through zzso In contrast, zzso zzso exhibits a decreased ability to repress the induction of promoters to which it is directly recruited through zzso binding sites, including its own promoter and that of the zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our data suggests that regulation of zzso repressive activity by zzso modification is promoter specific and may serve to zzso regulate genes that function to control cell zzso during early development and zzso
