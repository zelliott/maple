zzso zzso proteins 1, 2, and 3 zzso 2, and 3) are recently identified viral restriction factors that inhibit infection zzso by the influenza A virus zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we show that zzso proteins restricted infection zzso by the entry zzso zzso of zzso and Ebola zzso zzso zzso zzso with these zzso zzso specifically restricted zzso and zzso entry zzso zzso proteins also inhibited replication of infectious zzso and zzso We observed distinct patterns of zzso restriction: compared with zzso the entry processes of zzso and zzso were less restricted by zzso but more restricted by zzso Moreover, zzso zzso and 6 did not restrict zzso but efficiently inhibited zzso zzso We further demonstrate that replication of infectious SARS coronavirus zzso and entry zzso by the zzso spike zzso protein are restricted by zzso zzso The profile of zzso restriction of zzso was more similar to that of zzso than to zzso zzso treatment of zzso zzso zzso which zzso their dependence on zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso However, zzso proteins did not reduce cellular zzso activity or limit access of zzso to zzso zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso restriction is localized to a late stage in the zzso zzso They further show that zzso proteins zzso restrict the entry of a broad range of enveloped zzso and zzso cellular zzso independently of viral zzso zzso
