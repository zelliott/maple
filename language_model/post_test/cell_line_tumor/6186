The hallmark of type 1 diabetes is zzso destruction of the zzso zzso of the pancreatic zzso zzso diabetes has been difficult to study or treat because it is not usually diagnosed until substantial zzso loss has already zzso Imaging agents that permit zzso zzso of changes in zzso mass remain a zzso zzso We report on the development and testing of a zzso fluorescent zzso imaging zzso Based on the zzso acid sequence of zzso we created a zzso via introduction of an zzso zzso acid at the zzso position, which could subsequently be zzso to zzso via zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso confirmed that the resulting fluorescent probe zzso had a high binding affinity zzso zzso Its in zzso properties were evaluated using high-resolution zzso imaging, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso According to zzso zzso the probe rapidly bound to zzso and, as demonstrated by zzso zzso it was zzso zzso of the whole zzso showed a close correspondence between zzso and insulin zzso and there was an excellent correlation between imaging signals and zzso mass in mice treated with zzso a zzso zzso Individual zzso could also be zzso by zzso zzso In short, zzso showed strong and selective binding to zzso zzso receptors and permitted accurate measurement of zzso mass in both diabetic and zzso zzso This zzso imaging probe, as well as future zzso versions of it, should prove to be important tools for monitoring diabetes, zzso and treatment in both experimental and clinical zzso
