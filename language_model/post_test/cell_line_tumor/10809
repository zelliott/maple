zzso play an important roles in cell growth, zzso proliferation and zzso They can function either as tumor zzso or zzso We found that the zzso of zzso inhibited cell proliferation in zzso zzso and zzso cells, and inhibited zzso in a nude mouse zzso Both zzso and the zzso protein were activated by the zzso of zzso thus suggesting that zzso zzso cell zzso through the zzso zzso Further studies showed that zzso 1 zzso is a direct target of zzso zzso of zzso decreased zzso zzso and protein levels and zzso zzso reporter zzso zzso of zzso using zzso resulted in a similar cell zzso as that observed for zzso of zzso Additionally, zzso treatment inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell zzso in lung cancer zzso Analysis of zzso expression in clinical samples showed that zzso is significantly zzso in lung cancer zzso compared to adjacent zzso lung zzso In conclusion, our results demonstrate that zzso is a tumor zzso that can target the zzso gene to inhibit cell proliferation and induce cell zzso in lung cancer zzso Furthermore, zzso was expressed at low levels in lung cancer samples, indicating that it might be a promising therapeutic target for lung cancer zzso
