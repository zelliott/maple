Silicon zzso zzso hold prominent interest in various aspects of biomedical zzso For this purpose, surface zzso of the zzso is essential to stabilize them, target them to specific disease area, and allow them to selectively bind to the cells or the zzso present on the surface of the zzso However, no such zzso has been explored with zzso zzso zzso play a critical role in cell zzso Here, we report the first synthesis of silicon zzso zzso with zzso In this study, stable and brightly zzso zzso zzso capped zzso have been zzso from zzso terminated zzso and zzso zzso The surface zzso is confirmed by zzso transform infrared zzso zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso and energy zzso X-ray zzso zzso zzso The mean diameter of the crystal core is zzso zzso as measured by transmission electron zzso zzso while the zzso diameter obtained by dynamic light scattering zzso is 16 zzso The quantum yield zzso of zzso zzso is found to be zzso and the zzso exhibit an exceptional stability over two zzso The zzso zzso may prove to be valuable tools for further investigating zzso zzso and material science zzso zzso are carried out using zzso A zzso as a target protein in order to prove the zzso When Man zzso zzso are treated with zzso zzso zzso are formed, as shown in zzso images as well as monitored by zzso zzso zzso Man zzso zzso can target zzso zzso zzso imaging of zzso in zzso human breast cancer cells shows the zzso is distributed throughout the zzso of these zzso
