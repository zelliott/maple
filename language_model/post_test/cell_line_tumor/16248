zzso of circulating tumor cells has emerged as a promising minimally invasive diagnostic and zzso tool for patients with zzso zzso We report a novel three zzso zzso device that can enrich viable circulating tumor cells from zzso This device consists of two layers of zzso membrane with pores and gap precisely defined with zzso The positions of the pores are shifted between the top and bottom zzso The bottom membrane supports captured cells and minimize the stress concentration on cell membrane and sustain cell viability during zzso zzso cell capture on device was investigated with scanning electron zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso using model systems of cultured tumor cells spiked in blood or zzso The paper presents and zzso this new zzso zzso concept for circulation tumor cell enrichment zzso The device provides a highly valuable tool for assessing and characterizing viable enriched circulating tumor cells in both research and clinical zzso
