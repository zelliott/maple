zzso is a zzso zzso with an unique zzso region 3 zzso zzso referred to as zzso in its zzso zzso This region was identified in zzso zzso zzso from human zzso zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso a fusion protein composed of the complete zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso chains linked to the zzso zzso of human zzso exhibited successful binding to multiple human zzso cell zzso In zzso zzso zzso cell killing via zzso cellular zzso zzso in a zzso zzso In zzso zzso significantly inhibited tumor growth and enhanced survival in human zzso zzso zzso zzso Our findings suggest that the zzso fusion protein possesses both the zzso properties of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso functions of the zzso
