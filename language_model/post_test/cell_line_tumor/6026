zzso has been shown to play a role in the early differentiation of stem cells in some human zzso Whether cancer stem cells occur in zzso cervical cancer is not zzso 

We tested the hypothesis that cervical zzso contain zzso of cells that express zzso following sources of cervical zzso zzso were examined for the presence of stem cell marker zzso by zzso zzso zzso isolation of cancer cells was based on zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso The zzso and protein levels of zzso were investigated by zzso and Western zzso zzso We also detected the expression of zzso identified as a stem cell marker for several zzso 

zzso samples of invasive zzso zzso and zzso samples of zzso exhibited zzso to stem cell marker zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso of zzso was found in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso analysis, zzso and Western zzso also confirmed the presence of small zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, we found cervical zzso had low zzso zzso 

zzso zzso contains a small zzso of cells that may relate to a cancer stem zzso zzso zzso
