The aim of the study is to dissect the zzso mechanisms of zzso zzso 1) in zzso cells and therefore to provide new insight into zzso zzso 

Nine zzso were isolated from zzso zzso by zzso and their zzso was evaluated by an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso incorporation zzso and zzso zzso were employed to investigate zzso and zzso effects induced by the compound zzso In addition, Western zzso zzso and zzso techniques were used to zzso the molecular mechanisms of the zzso 

The study to zzso the zzso mechanisms of compound 1, the most potent zzso showed that cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as two main zzso related families, zzso and zzso 2 were involved in S phase arrest and zzso in zzso cell line zzso Furthermore, following the drug treatment, the protein expression of zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso activated genes zzso zzso and zzso were increased zzso zzso and Aurora A, the two zzso negative regulators were zzso the zzso protein stability was zzso whereas the zzso zzso expression level slightly decreased and zzso zzso expression apparently zzso In addition, the zzso of zzso gene by zzso partially suppressed zzso zzso 3, S phase arrest and zzso triggered by compound zzso 

These results suggest that compound 1 zzso S phase arrest and zzso via up regulation of zzso and stabilization of zzso in zzso cell zzso zzso compound 1 might be a promising lead structure for zzso zzso
