zzso zzso technologies were used to study DNA zzso accompanied by zzso changes in zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso Island zzso with zzso to study zzso Island DNA zzso in FL, we discovered widespread zzso of zzso genes and previously identified targets of zzso repressive complex 2 zzso in cell lines and primary tumors, but not in benign zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was independently validated in the zzso cell line and zzso zzso zzso and zzso in primary zzso Combined zzso zzso Analysis zzso also established DNA zzso for the previously identified zzso targets zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in FL but not in zzso Gene expression analyses revealed 411 genes that were zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso of which were zzso by the zzso agent zzso zzso plus or minus the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso A zzso Forty genes were also zzso in primary zzso Our results suggest that extensive zzso in promoters of zzso target genes is a characteristic of FL and that loss of expression of certain zzso target genes could be functionally relevant for zzso
