zzso are able to inhibit the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso B and L and have been suggested as potential zzso zzso We have incorporated chicken zzso a model protein inhibitor of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso to improve its zzso and delivery into tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in diameter, were prepared by the double emulsion zzso diffusion method using low energy zzso to preserve the biological activity of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at zzso higher than 80 zzso were zzso towards zzso zzso cells, but not free zzso at zzso up to 5 zzso To zzso the zzso of zzso into living zzso zzso cells, zzso loaded with Alexa zzso zzso zzso were added to the culture zzso They rapidly zzso into the cells, whereas the zzso of zzso zzso was very zzso zzso released from the zzso effectively inhibited zzso B activity, as detected by degradation of specific zzso zzso violet zzso In contrast, the same amount of free zzso showed no zzso of zzso zzso zzso Our results show that zzso zzso are a useful carrier system for rapid delivery of protein zzso into tumor cells, enabling effective zzso of zzso zzso The approach can be applied to other protein drugs active against zzso zzso
