zzso zzso zzso is among the most aggressive tumor types and is essentially an incurable zzso characterized by resistance to zzso zzso and zzso zzso is maintained by a zzso cell organization that includes zzso zzso and differentiated zzso zzso and maintenance of the tumor is attributed to a small population of zzso zzso cells, defined as zzso zzso cells zzso This cellular hierarchy offers a potential treatment to induce differentiation of zzso away from tumor initiation to a more benign zzso or to a cell type more amenable to standard zzso Bone zzso proteins zzso members of the zzso zzso have numerous biological activities including control of growth and zzso In zzso a zzso zzso zzso decreased primary human zzso zzso zzso zzso formation, and stem cell marker expression while enhancing zzso and zzso differentiation marker zzso In subcutaneous and zzso zzso zzso which closely reproduce the human disease, zzso decreased tumor growth and stem cell marker zzso while enhancing zzso and zzso differentiation compared with control zzso In addition, zzso reduced brain invasion, zzso and associated mortality in the zzso zzso zzso differentiation of zzso and zzso zzso with zzso provides a potentially powerful and novel approach to the treatment of zzso
