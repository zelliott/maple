zzso zzso are strongly implicated in zzso but their specific roles in the major zzso have yet to be fully zzso 

The expression levels of zzso in zzso zzso and paired normal zzso were examined using real-time zzso zzso Potential functions of zzso were evaluated in zzso zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

In this study, we determined that zzso is zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso Lower zzso expression zzso with more advanced zzso and lower overall survival of patients with zzso The zzso expression of zzso in human zzso cells decreased cell growth and zzso whereas the zzso of zzso promoted cell zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso zzso the activity of a reporter gene fused to the zzso region of zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso the expression of the reporter zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso whereas the zzso of zzso blocked zzso zzso effects in zzso zzso 

Taken together, these results demonstrated that zzso decreases proliferation by directly targeting zzso defining zzso as a new putative zzso zzso zzso in zzso
