zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso 4 a zzso and 5 a leads to 4 b zzso and 5 zzso zzso zzso and biology of the zzso pairs are zzso zzso 4 a) is a zzso zzso zzso Its silicon zzso zzso (4 zzso twofold zzso zzso was prepared in a zzso synthesis by starting from zzso In addition, the related zzso zzso 5 a and 5 zzso with an zzso zzso instead of a zzso zzso zzso were zzso The zzso pairs 4 zzso b and 5 zzso b were studied for their interaction with zzso receptors and were demonstrated to be highly potent zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, twofold zzso exchange in the zzso zzso of 5 a resulted in a zzso increase in biological activity of the corresponding zzso zzso 5 zzso possibly resulting from an increased zzso affinity or a divergent zzso effect on zzso zzso The crystal structures of the zzso complexes formed by 5 a and 5 zzso respectively, with the zzso domain of zzso and a zzso of the zzso zzso revealed additional interactions of the zzso analogue 5 b with the zzso and zzso zzso supporting the first option of increased binding zzso This is the first demonstration of an increase in binding affinity of a zzso to a nuclear zzso by zzso replacement, thereby adding this zzso switch strategy to the repertoire of nuclear zzso zzso zzso
