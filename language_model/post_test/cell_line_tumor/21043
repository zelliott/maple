We succeeded in zzso a major zzso fraction from a green zzso zzso This fraction consists mainly of three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In a previous study, we found that the zzso fraction inhibited DNA zzso activity, cancer cell growth and tumor growth with subcutaneous zzso We aimed to clarify oral administration of the zzso zzso suppressing colon zzso zzso tumor growth in zzso A tumor graft study showed that oral administration of 20 zzso zzso fraction for 2 weeks induced a zzso decrease in the solid tumor volume zzso zzso zzso without any zzso such as loss of body weight or major organ failure, in zzso The zzso fraction induced the suppression of zzso tumor growth with zzso of zzso and the expression of cell proliferation marker proteins such as zzso zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso and zzso E in the tumor zzso These results suggest that the orally administered zzso fraction from spinach could suppress colon tumor growth in mice by zzso the activities of zzso and cancer cellular proliferation in tumor zzso
