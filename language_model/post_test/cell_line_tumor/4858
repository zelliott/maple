zzso cancer is now one of the most common causes of cancer death zzso zzso zzso are present in up to zzso of pancreatic cancer zzso The expression of zzso zzso activates the zzso zzso B pathway, resulting in the zzso of the nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity plays a key role in pancreatic zzso zzso has been shown to inhibit zzso in response to zzso zzso In the present study, the effects of zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso family, were investigated on two established pancreatic cell lines, zzso and zzso A zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso was found in the cells treated with zzso as determined by Western zzso zzso Moreover, a zzso of zzso zzso and a protein expression by zzso were observed in both cell lines as determined by reverse zzso and Western zzso zzso By zzso zzso a remarkable difference in zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was found in both cell zzso The zzso values of zzso for the zzso or zzso cells were zzso or zzso zzso respectively, lower than those of the other zzso Growth zzso zzso induction and cell cycle arrest were observed in the zzso zzso zzso decreased the invasive potential of pancreatic cancer cells by reducing zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso was found to suppress the growth of zzso zzso in nude zzso Treatment with an zzso injection of zzso at the dose of zzso and zzso zzso zzso a week for two weeks) inhibited the growth of zzso by 66 and zzso zzso By contrast, an zzso injection of zzso at the dose of 80 zzso inhibited the growth of zzso by zzso Our findings suggest that zzso is active in the zzso of zzso and could play a positive role in relevant targeted chemotherapy for pancreatic zzso
