zzso chemotherapy is the standard treatment for pancreatic zzso However, the issue of resistance remains zzso The aim of this study was to identify zzso zzso that govern the resistance to zzso in pancreatic zzso 

zzso zzso analysis using zzso clones of zzso zzso zzso zzso and their parental cells zzso zzso was zzso Changes in the zzso effects of zzso were studied after zzso analysis of the candidate zzso Further assessment of the putative target gene was performed in zzso and in 66 pancreatic cancer clinical zzso 

zzso expression was significantly higher in zzso and zzso than in their parental zzso zzso induced resistance to zzso in zzso Further experiments showed that zzso resistance to zzso was zzso through zzso a core zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, clinical examination revealed that only zzso patients benefited from zzso therapy with regard to survival after recurrence zzso 

The results indicate that zzso regulates the resistance of pancreatic cancer cells to zzso through zzso suggesting that zzso could be suitable for prediction of the clinical response and potential therapeutic target in pancreatic cancer patients on zzso zzso
