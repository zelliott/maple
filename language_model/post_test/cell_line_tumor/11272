zzso of zzso zzso by zzso cells is now well established and plays diverse zzso zzso In zzso the zzso zzso high affinity zzso zzso zzso is absolutely required for zzso zzso In contrast, some zzso cells zzso zzso in the absence of zzso indicating a fundamental difference in zzso synthesis compared to zzso The aim of this study was to identify zzso zzso other than zzso that play a role in zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis was studied in lung and colon cancer cell lines focusing on the zzso zzso zzso a five gene family zzso like protein zzso Supporting a role for zzso in zzso transport in lung cancer cells, zzso transport was zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in all cells zzso zzso 2, and 5 were expressed at highest levels and zzso of zzso 2, and 5 decreased zzso transport in zzso lung cancer zzso zzso of zzso 2, 3, and 5 had no effect on zzso synthesis in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso by both lung and colon cancer zzso zzso increasing expression of zzso increased zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso mediates zzso synthesis in zzso cell lines and presents a mechanism to target zzso zzso synthesis without affecting zzso zzso zzso
