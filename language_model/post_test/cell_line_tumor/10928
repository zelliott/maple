zzso zzso zzso resistance presents a major obstacle in the successful therapeutic treatment of solid tumors such as zzso zzso Among the more promising techniques used to overcome zzso resistance in zzso cancer, is the zzso suppression of zzso by zzso zzso zzso To design more potent zzso zzso we explored the concept that zzso zzso zzso may offer advantages in stability and potency over zzso in zzso to zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso against the human zzso gene were compared to the duplex of the active zzso and sense sequence of the same zzso Concentration zzso effects on zzso zzso expression and functionality were zzso compared in the zzso zzso zzso cancer cell line zzso and its parental cell line zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso for stability, cellular zzso and nuclear zzso zzso Duplex formation significantly enhanced zzso zzso of zzso surface expression and zzso Cellular zzso and distribution to the nucleus was improved when zzso as zzso zzso 

Novel findings from this study suggest that zzso zzso zzso more effectively inhibit target protein expression and consequently enhance zzso through improvements in cellular zzso and distribution to the zzso
