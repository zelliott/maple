Creating new molecules that simultaneously enhance tumor cell killing and permit diagnostic tracking is vital to overcoming the limitations rendering current therapeutic regimens for terminal zzso zzso zzso we investigated the efficacy of an innovative new zzso targeted zzso zzso zzso using models of the lethal brain tumor zzso zzso zzso Designed using zzso computer zzso zzso incorporates the therapeutic activity of the promising zzso zzso zzso an enhanced zzso domain, and diagnostic domain for zzso zzso In zzso zzso revealed the diagnostic domain of zzso produced robust zzso zzso while the therapeutic domain showed marked zzso efficacy and significant zzso of zzso and zzso zzso In zzso the unique zzso nature of zzso allowed simultaneous real-time monitoring of both zzso delivery and zzso zzso zzso engineered stem cells as novel delivery vehicles for zzso therapy zzso we demonstrate that zzso significantly improved zzso and attenuated progression of established peripheral and zzso human zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso efficacy was zzso in zzso and in zzso by concurrent zzso of zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso these studies define a promising new approach to treating highly aggressive zzso including zzso using the zzso therapeutic zzso zzso
