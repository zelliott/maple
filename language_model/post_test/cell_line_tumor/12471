zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso are centrally positioned regulators of zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso or a novel small zzso zzso we show zzso is required for path generation by leading tumor cells and zzso zzso cells during collective tumor cell zzso zzso zzso lowers zzso zzso zzso levels, serum response factor zzso activity and collagen contraction, and reduces invasion in three-dimensional invasion zzso Although zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein degradation and zzso formation associated with significantly faster recovery times in zzso zzso indicative of reduced zzso zzso When zzso is knocked down in zzso cells, they lose the ability to lead strands of collectively invading zzso Similarly, when zzso activity is blocked in zzso zzso they are unable to lead the collective invasion of zzso zzso cells in an zzso skin zzso These results show that zzso is required for zzso zzso activities for path generation by leading cells in collective zzso
