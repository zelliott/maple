zzso cancer zzso is a major cause of zzso mortality in the zzso Recently, a number of studies have demonstrated that cancer stem cells zzso present in zzso cancer zzso are responsible for resistance to conventional zzso zzso effective recognition of zzso is of great zzso In the present study, to explore the potential zzso of zzso by the expression of specific cell surface markers such as zzso and zzso we screened six zzso cell lines using western zzso zzso and flow zzso zzso one of the six cell lines zzso was sorted into four zzso by zzso activated cell sorting zzso The capability of colony formation, proliferation rate, zzso drug resistance, as well as their migratory and invasion potential were zzso The results revealed that the combination of zzso and zzso zzso with the features of zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells showed more robust colony formation, higher zzso less spontaneous zzso a higher resistance to drug-induced cell death, and were enriched after drug zzso Among zzso zzso cells, the zzso zzso was more migratory and zzso which means that zzso zzso with most of features proposed for zzso Overall, the data presented zzso showed that zzso have a wide range of expression for zzso and zzso it is unlikely the zzso can be characterized by any single marker or the same set of markers for all colon cancer zzso For zzso cells, the zzso are likely represented by the zzso surface zzso This finding of zzso markers represented by one positive and one negative is in line with zzso in other tumors, such as zzso for acute zzso zzso zzso for breast and pancreatic zzso The absence of surface zzso on zzso will make it even more difficult to track and target this group of minority zzso
