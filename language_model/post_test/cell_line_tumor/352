zzso small cell lung cancer zzso is a leading cause of cancer zzso We have shown previously that zzso zzso mice develop spontaneously lung zzso or zzso zzso zzso of the study was to investigate zzso zzso expression in human primary lung zzso and in their counterparts, zzso normal zzso zzso cells zzso zzso the direct zzso activity of zzso on lung zzso cells in zzso and zzso and the mechanisms involved, and zzso zzso activity on zzso 

Stage I lung zzso showed significantly zzso zzso zzso higher frequency of zzso expressing samples than stage zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso zzso cells isolated from primary zzso zzso zzso 6) inhibited zzso in zzso through zzso of different zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as assessed by zzso membrane zzso zzso and zzso zzso In order to perform in zzso studies, the zzso zzso cell line was zzso with the zzso containing zzso zzso Similar to that observed in primary tumors, zzso treatment of zzso cells inhibited zzso in zzso zzso formed by zzso cells in zzso mice, zzso zzso or zzso were significantly smaller following zzso vs PBS treatment due to zzso of zzso and of zzso and zzso zzso zzso tumors were studied by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells were isolated and cultured from lung specimens of non zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso and released zzso tumor promoting zzso zzso zzso and zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso zzso production of these zzso 

This study demonstrates that zzso zzso directly the growth of human lung zzso and targets the adjacent zzso These novel zzso activities of zzso add to the well known zzso properties of the zzso and may provide a rational basis for the development of a clinical zzso
