zzso is a putative zzso zzso proposed to inhibit zzso and zzso based on zzso zzso However, we previously demonstrated that it failed to inhibit zzso or induce zzso in chronic zzso leukemia zzso cells, which are dependent on zzso for zzso In contrast, we show here that zzso rapidly increases zzso oxygen species, zzso zzso zzso stress, and zzso the zzso protein zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have demonstrated zzso efficacy in cell lines, while zzso and zzso have demonstrated efficacy in early clinical zzso Resistance to these zzso arises from the zzso of zzso factors, such as zzso zzso and zzso This resistance can be induced by zzso zzso cells on a zzso cell line that mimics the zzso found in zzso Since zzso can inhibit zzso zzso and zzso we hypothesized that zzso may overcome resistance to zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso in a human zzso leukemia cell line zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso ex zzso and overcame resistance to zzso induced by zzso zzso cells with zzso
