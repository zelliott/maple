The stability of zzso bearing zzso elements in their zzso and thus the level of expression of their protein products, is regulated by interactions with zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso generally leads to zzso stabilization and increased protein production, whereas binding by zzso zzso generally lead to rapid degradation of the zzso and reduced protein zzso The exact nature of the interplay between these and other zzso proteins remains zzso although recent studies have shown close interactions between them and even suggested competition between the two for binding to their zzso recognition zzso Other recent reports have suggested that the sequences recognized by the two proteins are zzso We therefore performed a detailed in zzso analysis of the binding zzso for zzso and zzso present in zzso zzso zzso to define their exact target zzso and show that the same sequence is contacted by both zzso Furthermore, we zzso a proposed zzso target within the zzso of zzso zzso and show that the contacted bases lie outside of the zzso motif and are a better match to a classical ARE than the zzso zzso The defining features of these zzso binding sites are their zzso and single zzso
