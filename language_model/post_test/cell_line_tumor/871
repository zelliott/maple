zzso is a potent melanoma detachment factor that interferes with cellular adherence by binding to zzso and zzso blocking their interaction with zzso and zzso zzso The direct correlation between serum zzso levels of patients with progressing zzso and tumor load supports a role for zzso as a melanoma progression zzso The goal of this study was to determine the effect of ultraviolet radiation zzso zzso zzso zzso or loss of zzso function on zzso expression and release from melanoma zzso We previously showed that zzso of a zzso zzso active zzso into the melanoma cell line, zzso zzso a zzso change from zzso to vertical growth, exhibiting increased proliferation and zzso Here, we report that zzso release was elevated in a zzso cell zzso In addition, loss of functional zzso using a dominant negative zzso substantially lowered the level of zzso release compared to zzso zzso zzso release of zzso into the zzso compartment in both the control and zzso cell zzso In addition, zzso zzso was increased following zzso in all cell lines zzso By inducing either zzso or zzso we were able to confirm that zzso protein is not released from cells due to cell death zzso We have identified a zzso effect of zzso on zzso expression and have shown that release of zzso protein is dependent upon functional zzso We propose that zzso production and release of zzso may promote the detachment of zzso and vertical growth phase zzso from basement membrane or zzso zzso serving as a unique progression mechanism for zzso
