The zzso of tissue factor zzso observed in numerous cancer cells and clinical samples of human zzso makes zzso an ideal target for cancer zzso The purpose of this study is to develop a zzso energized fusion protein zzso which is composed of a human Factor zzso light chain zzso as the targeting domain zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the zzso zzso The potential efficacy of zzso for cancer therapy was tested in zzso by zzso zzso zzso and colony formation zzso and in zzso with a zzso nude mouse zzso model of human liver cancer line zzso The zzso concentration zzso value of zzso varied from zzso to zzso zzso for the various human tumor zzso zzso showed a tumor growth zzso rate of zzso at the dose of zzso zzso in in zzso animal zzso The mechanism through which zzso zzso tumor growth also was determined by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso labeling zzso zzso zzso causes tumor cell death through inducing zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso protocol is zzso and tolerated in the mouse model of human liver cancer zzso and has clinical zzso for treating cancer zzso
