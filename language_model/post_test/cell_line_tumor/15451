zzso zzso channels play diverse roles in zzso such as sensory zzso vascular smooth muscle, and zzso where increased expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is often zzso Here, we report regulation of zzso zzso channels by carbon monoxide zzso a zzso zzso CO zzso as zzso caused a zzso poorly zzso zzso of all zzso channel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells, and native zzso channels in zzso cells and primary rat sensory zzso No recognized zzso signaling zzso could account for the CO zzso of zzso Instead, CO sensitivity was zzso by an zzso zzso site, which was also highly sensitive to zzso zzso zzso depletion zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso currents and their CO sensitivity by zzso but increased sensitivity to zzso zzso By contrast, zzso and zzso channels, and their sensitivity to zzso were unaffected in identical zzso Our data propose a novel signaling zzso in which zzso acts as a zzso zzso regulator of zzso channels, while zzso CO zzso this regulation, causing channel zzso CO zzso of zzso channels has widespread implications for diverse zzso and zzso mechanisms, such as zzso zzso and zzso
