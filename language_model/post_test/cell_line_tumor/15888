The aim of this study is to use zzso zzso imaging together with an zzso cell model to compare zzso behavior of control and genetically modified breast cancer cell populations within the intact primary tumor of a zzso 

zzso cells were generated with zzso conditional zzso expression using zzso zzso fluorescent protein zzso zzso expression together with tumor cell zzso is monitored in zzso and in zzso 

zzso and tight control of zzso zzso expression was observed both in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso on intact zzso tumors allowed a clear discrimination between zzso and zzso cell zzso which enables direct comparison of the zzso behavior of two different cell populations in the same zzso in zzso 

This system is robust and versatile for conditional gene expression and can be used to study the role of individual candidate zzso genes in zzso and in zzso This technology will allow investigations of cellular events in cancer zzso and in particular zzso within a primary zzso
