Heat shock protein 90 zzso family of proteins are ubiquitous molecular zzso that are involved in zzso zzso maturation and assembly of many proteins that include essential zzso of signal zzso and cell cycle zzso They are abundant in zzso cells and localized to the zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso under normal conditions, making up zzso of all cellular zzso zzso proteins have increased expression in a number of zzso A large number of zzso client proteins have been shown to be necessary for the development, proliferation and survival of specific types of zzso zzso zzso can affect multiple zzso pathways and involved zzso therefore make it an attractive target for drug zzso This article serves as an overview of the zzso data and clinical trial data on zzso inhibitor zzso in different zzso zzso has shown significant zzso activity against a spectrum of zzso in the zzso studies and information from various zzso of clinical trials is zzso The potential indication of zzso for the treatment of zzso multiple myeloma now awaits for the results of two phase III zzso More work needs to be done before the broader zzso use of zzso zzso in the area of defining zzso client zzso understanding the mechanism of zzso actions, identifying reliable surrogate markers for zzso zzso in zzso and zzso drug delivery and zzso
