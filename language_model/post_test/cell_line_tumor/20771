zzso the zzso growth factor zzso zzso represents a role model for a successful biological targeting approach to improving outcomes after zzso This review summarizes data from several local zzso control experiments in which zzso zzso were combined with radiation in zzso human zzso cell zzso zzso into nude zzso zzso is an oral zzso inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso It was administered in different experimental zzso concurrent with zzso zzso following completion of zzso and in the period between surgery and zzso zzso Despite beneficial effects on zzso growth, in none of these experimental settings did zzso improve local zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso against the zzso zzso domain of zzso improved local zzso control when given zzso with zzso zzso from a series of local zzso control experiments designed to zzso the underlying mechanisms of zzso suggest that multiple zzso mechanisms might contribute to the observed zzso decreased number of zzso zzso cells, increased cellular radiation sensitivity, decreased zzso and improved zzso of zzso zzso cells during the combined zzso In zzso the data suggest that different classes of zzso zzso may have a different potential to improve local zzso control after zzso zzso
