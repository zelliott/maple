Wilson's disease zzso is a genetic disorder resulting in zzso zzso and is caused by zzso in the zzso zzso the copper zzso In zzso studies show a correlation between zzso zzso and malfunction of the zzso zzso zzso In this study, we describe multiple effects of zzso zzso on zzso zzso which, in turn, affect zzso zzso zzso toxicity was examined in two zzso zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso with zzso cells containing an integrated zzso B virus zzso Exposure of zzso and zzso cells to zzso inhibited the zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso synthesis zzso and, in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso IX zzso and the zzso pool were reduced as a result of these zzso zzso synthesis was found to be lower in cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso compared to those expressing the zzso zzso zzso activity was inhibited under zzso treatment in zzso zzso however, zzso induced marked zzso acceleration in zzso zzso Under these conditions, zzso proteins were gradually zzso whereas treatment with zzso zzso acid zzso a zzso zzso reversed this zzso In conclusion, our data suggest that copper zzso the zzso synthesis zzso in zzso cells and further reduces it in the presence of zzso zzso
