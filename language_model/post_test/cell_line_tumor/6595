zzso interference zzso has been proposed as a potential treatment for cancer, but the lack of cellular targets limits its use in cancer gene zzso No current technology has achieved direct zzso gene zzso using zzso In the present study we attempt to develop a zzso zzso system using the human zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso we analyzed its zzso effect on zzso zzso 

The zzso containing a small hairpin zzso zzso to target zzso reporters zzso zzso and enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso and zzso gene zzso were zzso zzso expression was determined by dual zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell sorting zzso were used to measure zzso zzso zzso of zzso was evaluated by zzso and Western zzso Cell proliferation and viability were measured by using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to analyze the cell cycle distribution zzso 

We showed that with the zzso promoter directly driving zzso transcription, expression of the zzso reporters zzso and zzso in tumor cells, but not normal cells, was specifically inhibited in zzso The zzso zzso zzso also depressed the expression of zzso zzso of zzso did not affect cell zzso but increased the zzso of zzso cells to zzso 

The present study describes an efficient zzso system for gene zzso that is specific to tumor cells using the zzso zzso zzso of zzso by using this system zzso zzso cells to zzso This system may be useful for zzso zzso
