In zzso disease zzso zzso zzso which contains expanded zzso stretches, forms nuclear zzso in zzso The interactions of several zzso factors with zzso zzso as well as altered expression of many genes in HD models, imply the involvement of zzso zzso in the HD pathological zzso The precise mechanism remains obscure, zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso interact with the components of the zzso zzso factor in zzso and in HD model mouse zzso An zzso mobility shift zzso using HD model mouse brain zzso showed reduction in zzso binding to the promoter region of zzso one of the zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed reduced zzso expression in these zzso We further clarified the importance of zzso for zzso zzso in cultured zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso sequesters zzso leading to the reduction of zzso gene expression in HD model mice zzso Because zzso roles of zzso on the HD pathological process have been shown in several HD models, zzso could be an important target of zzso zzso
