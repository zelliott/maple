zzso is a zzso of serum zzso protein that has been modified to create a probe for zzso zzso zzso array screening demonstrated that the zzso domain of zzso selectively binds common groups of zzso zzso including zzso structures and T zzso suggesting that engineered zzso proteins such as zzso represent novel tools for the characterization of zzso bearing zzso zzso zzso of cell extracts and zzso from zzso breast cancer cells with zzso zzso was used to demonstrate that it binds to a selected set of high molecular weight zzso that could be zzso from zzso cells on an affinity column constructed with zzso zzso and zzso analysis of these zzso by mass zzso showed that they are forms of zzso that bear zzso displaying heavily zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso The pool of zzso was found to include the target zzso for zzso zzso which are commonly used to detect zzso zzso on tumors, and for the zzso scavenger zzso zzso zzso which may be involved in tumor zzso through interactions with this zzso A survey of additional breast cancer cell lines reveals that there is wide variation in the types of zzso that lead to binding of zzso Higher levels of binding are associated either with the presence of zzso zzso structures carried on a variety of different cell surface zzso or with the presence of high levels of the zzso zzso bearing T zzso
