zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso complex contains a single zzso of either zzso or zzso as the zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that the zzso complex forms a larger complex with zzso zzso factor zzso and its zzso zzso and zzso in human zzso cell lung zzso cell zzso We also demonstrate that the strong zzso suppression of such zzso genes as zzso and zzso by zzso in these zzso cells requires the functional zzso complex; these zzso genes were elevated in cell lines deficient in both zzso and zzso whereas zzso zzso expressing zzso targeting integral components of zzso complex zzso or zzso induced expression of these zzso genes in zzso cell zzso In cell lines deficient in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso suppressed expression of these zzso genes in an zzso manner and induced efficient and specific zzso of zzso zzso around the zzso binding site present in the zzso gene by a large complex containing the recruited functional zzso zzso Patients with zzso lung zzso have been reported to carry poor zzso zzso of zzso genes including these zzso genes could contribute to enhance zzso and also would provide selective markers for zzso zzso
