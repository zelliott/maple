zzso zzso are useful in the treatment of zzso Recently, we found a new zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso A produced by zzso zzso Here we report that zzso zzso zzso in human prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso showed strong zzso to zzso cells zzso zzso It increased the number of cells in the zzso phase and increased the accumulated amounts of the zzso and zzso zzso which are negative regulators of cell cycle zzso Furthermore, it induced zzso along with zzso zzso and DNA fragmentation in zzso cells, and zzso zzso appeared to be associated with zzso zzso Additionally, zzso inhibited not only the degradation of zzso and the nuclear zzso of nuclear zzso zzso but also the DNA binding activity of zzso These results indicate that zzso shows a strong growth zzso and zzso in zzso zzso
