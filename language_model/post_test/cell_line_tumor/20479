The zzso zzso TRAIL is believed to have promise as a cancer gene therapy, yet many types of cancer, including zzso have exhibited resistance to zzso zzso Here, we show that therapeutic combination of the zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso human zzso stem cells zzso provide targeted and prolonged delivery of TRAIL both in zzso and in zzso mouse models of zzso Treatment of either zzso or zzso human zzso cells with zzso and zzso resulted in significantly enhanced zzso compared with each agent zzso zzso effectively increased the sensitivity to zzso zzso via zzso of the death zzso 5 and zzso of the zzso protein zzso in human zzso cell lines and in primary zzso zzso This regulation was accompanied by a substantial increase in zzso zzso after combined zzso Furthermore, in zzso survival experiments and imaging analysis in zzso zzso mice showed that zzso TRAIL gene delivery combined with zzso into the tumors had greater therapeutic efficacy than zzso zzso Together, our findings indicate that zzso combined with zzso TRAIL gene delivery may represent a novel strategy for improving the treatment of zzso zzso
