zzso in liver cancer 1 zzso is a tumor zzso protein that is frequently zzso in various tumor zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso zzso protein zzso domain that appears to be required for its tumor zzso zzso Little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate zzso By mass zzso we have mapped a novel zzso site within the zzso GAP domain on zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso our results identify protein zzso D zzso to zzso this site in zzso in intact zzso Although zzso on zzso zzso did not directly impact on in zzso GAP activity, a zzso zzso exchange zzso inhibited colony formation more zzso than the wild type zzso Our results thus show that zzso zzso of zzso on zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso cellular zzso
