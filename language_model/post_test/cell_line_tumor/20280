zzso cellular transfer has been employed for cancer zzso including patients with gastric zzso However, little is known about the distribution of zzso cells after their injection via different zzso In this study, we used human gastric cancer cells zzso zzso with enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso to establish a subcutaneous gastric cancer model in nude zzso zzso killer zzso cells and zzso T zzso zzso were generated from human peripheral blood and labeled with red fluorescent zzso A portion of zzso cells was armed with zzso zzso zzso When zzso cells were injected into nude mice with established subcutaneous gastric cancer via zzso zzso intravenous zzso and zzso zzso infusion respectively, the distribution of cells was observed using a live zzso imaging zzso We found that only a very small number of zzso cells could travel to the tumor site after zzso or zzso infusion, and they inhibited subcutaneous tumor growth in zzso only immediately following zzso In contrast, zzso injection resulted in a significantly higher zzso of zzso cells at the tumor site for 48 hours and zzso the greatest tumor zzso compared with the other two injection zzso In addition, we compared the zzso activity of zzso zzso and zzso cells in zzso and in zzso after zzso zzso Among the three types of immune cells, zzso demonstrated the strongest zzso activity both in zzso and in zzso zzso single chain zzso could effectively link T zzso and tumor cells expressing zzso and resulted in significantly higher zzso of zzso cells at the tumor site compared with the parental zzso zzso This study indicates that zzso injection of immune zzso cells by minimally invasive surgical procedures represents an effective delivery method of adoptive cellular zzso zzso immune cells, such as zzso are a better choice of zzso cells than zzso in cellular zzso Furthermore, zzso immune cells armed with the zzso single chain zzso could more effectively travel to and accumulate at the site of tumors expressing zzso such as gastric zzso
