zzso plus prednisone is a zzso treatment for zzso prostate cancer zzso but without survival zzso zzso has shown activity against zzso but only in the zzso zzso Our previous in zzso zzso screening study established that their free combination act zzso to inhibit proliferation of zzso zzso We aim to develop a zzso zzso zzso zzso with improved in zzso therapeutic zzso 

zzso and zzso were simultaneously zzso into zzso zzso by means of a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was characterized in terms of mean size diameter, loading parameters and drug retention in human zzso In zzso zzso activity of developed zzso zzso was evaluated in a nude mice bearing subcutaneous zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso efficiency zzso and enhanced drug retention for both zzso Additionally, this zzso zzso administered at a low zzso dose zzso showed a tumor zzso activity zzso and zzso tumor volume zzso slightly superior to that of zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso volume zzso zzso therapeutic activity of zzso was significantly improved by zzso with zzso since a four times lower dose was needed to achieve an equivalent growth zzso zzso 

The loading parameters and drug retention properties of our zzso zzso combined with its in zzso zzso activity, make this zzso an excellent strategy to improve the therapeutic index of zzso and a promising candidate for clinical development in prostate cancer zzso
