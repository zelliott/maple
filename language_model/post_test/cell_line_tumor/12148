zzso zzso are a class of small zzso zzso regulatory molecules that block translation or induce degradation of target zzso These have been identified in a wide range of organisms, including zzso In particular, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso virus zzso zzso that could potentially regulate either viral or host zzso To determine if zzso disease virus zzso an zzso zzso of zzso encodes zzso we isolated small zzso from zzso chicken zzso zzso zzso and used the zzso Life Sciences sequencing technology to obtain the sequences of zzso candidate host and viral small zzso Eight zzso were found, five of which flank the zzso zzso and three that map to the zzso transcript zzso region of the zzso The zzso gene is unique to zzso zzso of zzso and is zzso active during zzso and zzso and the zzso region of the zzso zzso is zzso to the zzso gene zzso Secondary structure analysis predicted that the regions zzso the zzso could form hairpin zzso Northern zzso analysis confirmed expression of all zzso in zzso zzso zzso tumors, and zzso zzso cell zzso We propose that the zzso zzso function to enable zzso zzso and contribute to zzso transformation of chicken T zzso
