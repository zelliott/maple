zzso is an zzso member of zzso zzso family, which is a crucial regulator of zzso zzso cell cycle zzso and cell zzso Previous studies have reported that zzso was zzso expressed in several human zzso but the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso remained poor zzso 

This study investigated the expression of zzso and its clinical significance on the outcome of patients with zzso 

The expression of zzso was examined in zzso patients and then the zzso impact of the zzso expression status was evaluated by zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso was zzso in zzso cell lines and zzso compared with normal zzso line zzso and zzso liver zzso The expression of zzso was significantly zzso associated with serum zzso zzso and tumor grade zzso Furthermore, the patients with low expression of zzso had a shorter survival zzso than those with high zzso zzso and zzso analysis showed that zzso expression was a significant and independent zzso predictor for zzso patients zzso 

zzso zzso in patients with zzso could serve as an independent zzso predictor for patients with zzso
