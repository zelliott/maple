The failure of tumor zzso used for zzso therapy is due in part to the zzso of tumor cells to the zzso zzso It is therefore desirable to develop approaches to weaken the zzso of zzso tumor cells to zzso We have previously developed zzso coated zzso that resist the zzso of normal zzso cells and zzso The zzso mechanisms in zzso tumor cells are significantly altered from normal zzso therefore, it is unclear if zzso can similarly resist tumor cell zzso In this study, we show that the zzso of tumor zzso cells cultured on zzso is rounded compared to flat surfaces and associated with decreased cellular zzso and zzso zzso II zzso zzso cell viability and proliferation was unchanged on zzso zzso cell numbers were significantly decreased while single tumor cell zzso was increased on zzso compared to flat zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso can be used to weaken zzso tumor cell zzso and therefore potentially improve tumor zzso zzso
