Rapid advances in the understanding of cancer biology have transformed drug development thus leading to the approval of targeted therapies and to the development of molecular tests to select patients that will respond to zzso zzso status has emerged as a negative predictor of clinical benefit from zzso zzso in zzso cancer, and zzso zzso use was limited to zzso wild type zzso In order to ensure wide access to tumor molecular zzso the French National Cancer Institute zzso has set up a national network of 28 regional molecular zzso zzso zzso a nationwide external quality assessment for zzso testing zzso was granted to analyze zzso and zzso 

96 zzso zzso and 24 DNA samples from zzso embedded tumor zzso were sent to 40 French zzso A total of zzso zzso results were collected and analyzed and a zzso study was performed on sites for 5 common methods by an independent team of health zzso 

This work provided a baseline picture of the accuracy and reliability of zzso analysis in routine testing conditions at a nationwide zzso zzso Kappa values were zzso for zzso results despite differences detection methods and the use of in-house zzso zzso was excellent with only one false positive in zzso zzso data, and sensitivity was higher for targeted techniques as compared to zzso sequencing based methods that were dependent upon local zzso zzso zzso costs per patient ranged from zzso to zzso 

The zzso has zzso a network of public laboratories dedicated to molecular zzso zzso Our results showed almost perfect agreements in zzso testing at a nationwide level despite different testing methods ensuring a cost-effective equal access to personalized zzso cancer zzso
