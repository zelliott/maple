The zzso signaling zzso plays key roles in both zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a novel member of the expanding LDL zzso family, functions as an indispensable zzso for the zzso signaling zzso Although the role of zzso in embryonic development is now well established, its role in zzso is zzso We report that zzso is readily expressed at the transcript level in several human cancer cell lines and human zzso zzso Furthermore, using a zzso gene transfer system, we find that stable expression of zzso in human zzso zzso cells alters zzso zzso distribution such that the zzso zzso level is significantly zzso This is accompanied by a significant increase in zzso signaling and cell zzso Finally, we demonstrate that zzso expression promotes zzso in zzso These results thus indicate that zzso may function as a potential zzso protein by modulating zzso zzso
