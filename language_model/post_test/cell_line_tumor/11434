There is a high demand for the development of an imaging agent for zzso zzso zzso detection in Alzheimer's zzso In the present study, a series of zzso acids was zzso and evaluated for zzso imaging of zzso in brain zzso of zzso zzso Five out of seven zzso have shown excellent binding affinity to zzso over zzso plaques in the zzso red R displacement zzso However, the selectivity in this in zzso zzso is not confirmed by the zzso zzso which indicates significant differences in the binding sites in the zzso zzso 6 showed binding affinity zzso to zzso zzso which is the highest among this zzso zzso 2, 3, 4 and 5 display zzso values of lower than zzso to zzso zzso to zzso zzso red zzso zzso of the zzso of these five zzso with human liver zzso cells revealed that these compounds zzso negligible zzso The in zzso studies with zzso zzso confirmed negligible zzso at 24 and zzso post zzso
