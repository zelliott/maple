Cell migration is an zzso and critical step for cancer zzso The most common approach to monitor this process is zzso zzso However, this traditional method has some unavoidable zzso We observed that simply scratching the zzso of cultured cells might cause local cell damage around the injury zzso The cells along the scratched border seemed to be irritated and exhibited abnormal distribution of zzso zzso with protruding zzso zzso and zzso during wound healing, which might potentially affect the assessment of cell migration zzso zzso we applied a zzso device that mechanically constrained cells seeded in a designed pattern inside zzso and monitored cell movement in a way of mimicking the natural zzso of zzso zzso We illustrated the capacity of this simple method to probe cellular migration behaviors and to screen some biological active agents that reflected in their influence on cellular zzso
