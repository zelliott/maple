zzso zzso large cell zzso is a category of zzso zzso zzso which can be further subdivided into two distinct entities zzso and zzso based on the presence or absence of zzso gene zzso Among several pathways triggered by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is strictly required for zzso transformation and zzso Here we performed zzso zzso profiling and identified 48 zzso zzso modulated by the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso To evaluate the functional role of zzso expressed zzso we forced their expression in zzso zzso large cell zzso cells, and monitored their influence after zzso zzso We found that the expression of the zzso cluster partially zzso zzso zzso by sustaining proliferation and survival of zzso zzso zzso in a zzso mouse model indicated that forced expression of zzso interferes with zzso zzso in zzso High expression levels of the zzso cluster resulted in zzso of zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that their targeting might mediate resistance to zzso zzso in zzso large cell zzso zzso We speculate that the zzso cluster is involved in zzso of zzso zzso and that its zzso might represent an alternative avenue to interfere with zzso signaling in zzso large cell zzso
