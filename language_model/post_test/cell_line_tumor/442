A major concern in human embryonic stem cell zzso cell replacement therapy is the risk of zzso from zzso zzso residing in the population of zzso zzso zzso of these zzso zzso from the differentiated derivatives using cell sorting methods may be a plausible approach in overcoming this zzso We therefore explored magnetic activated cell sorting zzso and zzso activated cell sorting zzso to separate zzso zzso zzso from a zzso population of zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso deliberately mixed respectively at different ratios zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to mimic a standard in zzso differentiation zzso instead of using a zzso cell population, so that we could be sure of the actual number of cells zzso zzso and zzso cells were zzso in separate experiments for the stem cell markers zzso and zzso using primary zzso zzso magnetic zzso that recognize the zzso zzso zzso zzso was added to the zzso cell mixture and passed through the zzso zzso The cells that passed through the column zzso zzso and those retained zzso zzso were subsequently zzso using zzso The maximum efficacy of zzso retention using zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso all the zzso zzso zzso with the two zzso markers could be removed by selective zzso Both zzso and zzso cells in the zzso fraction following zzso separation were viable in culture whereas by zzso separation only the zzso cells were zzso zzso efficiently helps to eliminate the zzso zzso based on their zzso zzso zzso
