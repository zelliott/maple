According to the expression of gastric zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso the authors have previously proposed a new zzso zzso of gastric zzso zzso the gastric zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to examine the role of zzso the zzso zzso factor, on the regulation of zzso zzso expression in zzso and in zzso It was confirmed on zzso that zzso gastric zzso with zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso with increased levels of zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso expression was detected in 28 zzso of 94 zzso at the invasive zzso Interestingly, zzso expression had a significant association with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which was almost identical to the established gastric and zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso of a zzso human zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso cells specifically elevated the expression of zzso and zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein levels zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas no induction of the other zzso was zzso These findings suggest that zzso plays an important role in the regulation of zzso zzso expression not only in gastric zzso with IM but also zzso
