zzso zzso zzso type 7 zzso plays an important role in zzso and zzso responses in various zzso including breast zzso In the present study, the authors demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and directly influences the migration and invasion of breast cancer zzso 

The expression of zzso its zzso zzso and zzso was detected in breast cancer cell lines and in breast cancer patient zzso zzso zzso and an inhibitor of zzso were zzso into zzso and zzso breast cancer cells, respectively, and cell zzso cell migration, and invasion zzso were zzso To confirm the fact that zzso of zzso is a direct target of zzso a zzso zzso for the reporter gene expressing the zzso binding sites of zzso zzso was zzso An in zzso invasion animal model system using transparent zzso zzso was also established to determine the zzso effect on breast cancer cell zzso 

First, a higher expression of both zzso and zzso in zzso zzso than in their normal counterparts from breast cancer patients was zzso In addition, a reverse correlation in the expression of zzso and zzso in breast cancer cell lines and breast cancer patient zzso was zzso zzso zzso decreased breast cancer cell zzso migration, and invasion, as well as zzso protein expression in zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor reversed the zzso effects on the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was confirmed as a direct target of zzso by using the zzso zzso for the reporter gene expressing zzso zzso zzso binding zzso zzso when analyzing in zzso invasion, zzso 231 cells after synthetic zzso zzso were unable to invade the vessels in zzso zzso 

The results from the present study suggest that targeting of zzso signaling is a valid approach for breast cancer therapy and that zzso directly binds to the zzso of zzso and blocks its protein zzso thereby suppressing migration and invasion of human breast cancer zzso Furthermore, the present study underscores the therapeutic potential of zzso as an zzso and zzso manager in breast cancer zzso
