The phenomenon of zzso zzso DNA from the zzso zzso cell zzso is under zzso It is found that foreign DNA incorporated into cell zzso as a result of zzso by zzso may be lost with the frequency from zzso up to zzso zzso per cell division during zzso This effect is not dependent of the nature of cell line and zzso zzso It is actual for different cell zzso zzso human zzso AG zzso zzso embryonic line zzso and for different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso into zzso and the following zzso of this DNA is registered by selection markers zzso and zzso B resistance and zzso zzso The presence of foreign DNA in the zzso was controlled by zzso It is found that true foreign DNA deletion from the zzso takes place rather than gene expression zzso For closely linked zzso genes deletion of both genes at once as well as zzso any one gene separately is zzso Thus, the phenomenon of selective deletion of zzso DNA from zzso has been demonstrated for different zzso zzso
