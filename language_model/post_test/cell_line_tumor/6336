zzso cancer is the leading cause of death from zzso zzso in the United zzso zzso B zzso zzso and zzso are zzso agents that interfere with zzso and arrest the cell cycle in the zzso zzso zzso is being evaluated in phase III clinical trials, and its zzso are currently being used in the treatment of zzso zzso breast zzso Little is known about the effect of these drugs on the immune response to zzso Cancer cells evade immune recognition by zzso zzso Class I zzso allowing escape from immune surveillance and zzso Our data illustrates the effect of zzso agents on zzso Class I and zzso expression as well as the zzso of zzso expression in zzso cancer zzso 

zzso cancer cells were treated with different zzso of zzso Cell surface expression and zzso zzso of zzso Class I molecules and zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression was also evaluated upon zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso greatly increased expression of zzso Class I and zzso molecules in zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso does not zzso zzso expression in drug-resistant zzso cancer zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso is also markedly increased upon zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso agents enhance zzso of zzso cancer cells by increasing zzso Class I and zzso zzso zzso zzso recognition of tumor cells may be zzso
