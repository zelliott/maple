zzso members of the zzso family proteins are zzso in prostate cancer and are promising molecular targets for modulating zzso of prostate zzso zzso a natural zzso zzso is a zzso inhibitor of zzso currently in phase II clinical trials as an zzso therapy for human prostate zzso Our objective is to examine the zzso potential of zzso in prostate cancer and its molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso inhibited cell growth and induced zzso through zzso zzso in human prostate cancer zzso cells and zzso enhanced the zzso activity of zzso both in zzso and in zzso in zzso zzso model in nude zzso zzso blocked the interactions of zzso with zzso or Bad in cancer cells by zzso resonance energy transfer zzso and overcame the zzso protection of zzso model cells on zzso zzso Western zzso and real-time zzso studies showed that a zzso increase of the zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso contributed to the cell death induced by zzso and to the synergistic effects of zzso and zzso The small interfering zzso zzso studies showed that zzso and zzso are required in the zzso cell zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso exerts its zzso activity through zzso of the zzso protein zzso accompanied by an increase of zzso zzso and zzso zzso significantly enhances the zzso activity of chemotherapy in zzso and in zzso representing a promising new regime for the treatment of human zzso prostate cancer with zzso zzso
