zzso and drug resistance are the major causes of mortality in patients with zzso cell lung cancer zzso Several zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso are involved in the progression of zzso The zzso zzso is involved in cell zzso zzso zzso and signal zzso and may play a significant role in the zzso of cancer zzso zzso no specific zzso of zzso have been zzso A series of zzso zzso with progressive zzso established from a patient with zzso has been identified that positively zzso with zzso expression and resistance to zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso results in elevated cell zzso and drug zzso Nuclear zzso zzso signaling activity is associated with zzso expression and may play an important role in the enhancement of zzso and zzso resistance, as shown by using the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In the current study, zzso exerted a synergistic zzso effect with zzso and suppressed cancer cell zzso in parallel in zzso zzso and various zzso cancer cell zzso zzso of zzso and other zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso was abolished by zzso within 15 zzso suggesting that the zzso of zzso and the zzso activity of zzso are involved in the zzso effects of zzso Our study suggests that zzso is involved in zzso zzso and drug resistance and may therefore provide a molecular basis for zzso therapy using zzso to enhance the efficacy of chemotherapy in zzso
