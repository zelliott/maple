zzso zzso of zzso gene expression was achieved in zzso zzso zzso by exploiting the exclusive presence of the zzso virus zzso zzso in the cancer zzso In the current study, we have zzso an zzso zzso targeting strategy to construct a novel zzso replicating zzso zzso After treatment with zzso we observed extensive cell death in the zzso zzso cell line zzso In contrast, no zzso was observed in a panel of other human zzso cell lines, including zzso from the zzso In zzso zzso replication was confirmed by the zzso increase in the expression of zzso zzso fiber protein and zzso DNA after zzso cells were infected with zzso zzso formation was inhibited for more than 100 days after ex zzso infection of zzso cells with zzso Combination of local tumor radiation and zzso caused complete disappearance of established tumors for at least 2 weeks in two distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso Safety of this treatment was determined through the systemic delivery of zzso in zzso zzso minimal temporary zzso of liver function was zzso We have successfully established a zzso replicating zzso for zzso zzso which is both safe and zzso indicating a strategy that may be zzso zzso
