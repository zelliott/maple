zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso of zzso signaling is a common phenomenon in various human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of zzso signaling and acts through direct binding to zzso in the zzso zzso In this study, we tried to illuminate the impact of zzso gene expression in melanoma with zzso zzso by in zzso and in zzso zzso We restored the expression of zzso by zzso gene transfer with a zzso zzso We demonstrated zzso of melanoma cell growth after zzso restoration in colony formation and proliferation zzso in zzso In addition, the zzso effect was related to zzso of zzso zzso which was demonstrated at both the zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, by using a zzso mouse model, we confirmed the effect of zzso expression in suppressing tumor growth by zzso of zzso signaling in zzso Our results suggest the potential for further application of zzso gene therapy in melanoma with zzso zzso
