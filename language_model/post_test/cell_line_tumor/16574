zzso is a fast growing emerging field, the benefits of which are widely zzso Our current knowledge of the health effects of metal zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and titanium dioxide zzso is limited but suggests that metal zzso may exert more adverse pulmonary effects as compared with zzso zzso To investigate metal zzso zzso effects and the potential underlying mechanisms, human lung zzso zzso cells were exposed to zzso and zzso Our results showed that exposure of zzso cells to zzso caused zzso oxygen species zzso generation that was abolished by zzso of cells with zzso zzso or zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso However, exposure of zzso cells to zzso did not cause zzso zzso zzso caused DNA damage in zzso cells, which was reflected by an increase in zzso zzso and DNA content of the comet tail by the zzso zzso Exposure of zzso cells to zzso also caused a zzso and a zzso increased expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These effects were significantly attenuated when zzso cells were zzso with zzso or zzso zzso did not show these zzso These results suggest that zzso stress may be involved in zzso DNA zzso To further investigate the pathways involved in the zzso DNA damage, we measured the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso of zzso was increased when zzso cells were exposed to zzso and this effect was attenuated when cells were zzso with zzso or zzso zzso of zzso cells with an zzso specific zzso zzso significantly abolished zzso DNA zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso cells with zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso significantly abolished zzso increased expression of zzso zzso Taken together, zzso stress and zzso zzso are involved in zzso DNA zzso These findings have important implications for understanding the potential health effects of metal zzso zzso
