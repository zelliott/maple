zzso D3 zzso zzso has been shown to zzso zzso expression via zzso and zzso binding sites in the zzso zzso However, whether vitamin D3 zzso zzso involves in this process is zzso In this study, we demonstrated that expression of zzso in zzso cells, which exhibited low level of zzso zzso increased vitamin zzso zzso promoter zzso On the contrary, suppression of zzso expression by small interference zzso reduced the stimulation of zzso promoter activity by vitamin D3 in zzso zzso DNA affinity zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso bound to the zzso promoter in zzso and in zzso In addition, we also demonstrated that zzso zzso with zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso our results suggest that zzso is involved in the induction of zzso by vitamin D3 and may interact with zzso to zzso the expression of target genes that lack zzso response element zzso in their zzso
