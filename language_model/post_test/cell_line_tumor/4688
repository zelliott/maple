Although zzso is a general zzso process, cancer cells are unusually sensitive to zzso zzso zzso there is an interest in the identification of novel zzso zzso Here, we report the novel discovery of the zzso gene as a regulator of zzso entry and cell zzso The zzso gene was cloned from zzso zzso zzso It encodes a zzso protein with an unknown function and no zzso to known zzso Previously, we observed an increased expression of zzso in multiple zzso that correlated with the expression of zzso zzso checkpoint genes and with increased zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso is important for the transition from the zzso to the M zzso of the cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso in cancer cells in zzso delayed entrance into zzso decreased zzso of the zzso zzso B complex, and induced zzso in a zzso zzso zzso is also essential for the growth of tumor zzso in zzso Thus, zzso is required for zzso entry and cancer cell zzso Because increased expression of zzso has been noted in multiple types of zzso and zzso with zzso spread, it may be a suitable target for novel zzso zzso
