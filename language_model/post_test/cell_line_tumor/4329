zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in normal human zzso zzso cells was not recognized until zzso Although expression of zzso was not zzso in zzso human zzso zzso cells zzso cultured in conventional two-dimensional zzso culture conditions, zzso protein expression was observed in normal human breast zzso suggesting that the zzso condition zzso a repressive status of zzso gene expression in zzso With the use of zzso zzso zzso zzso we were able to detect expression of zzso when zzso formed polarized zzso structures in a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso expression was again seen when the zzso zzso were zzso as a zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso is essential in zzso zzso We have further shown the involvement of DNA zzso in regulating zzso expression in zzso under these cell culture zzso zzso zzso expression was strongly induced in the zzso zzso after treatment with a DNA zzso zzso In addition, zzso analyses showed a decrease in the degree of zzso zzso in the zzso promoter in the zzso versus zzso zzso More importantly, zzso of clinical zzso zzso samples showed significantly decreased zzso zzso and protein expression levels compared with normal zzso zzso and there is an inverse correlation between the expression levels of zzso and the clinical stages of breast zzso Combined zzso restriction analysis analysis of some of the tumors also revealed an association of DNA zzso with the loss of zzso expression in zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso inhibited breast cancer zzso in both the experimental lung zzso model and the zzso mouse zzso This study suggests that zzso zzso of zzso may contribute to zzso zzso and that restoring the zzso zzso scavenging activity could be an effective strategy for breast cancer zzso
