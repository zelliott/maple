zzso has been shown to be an ideal target for cancer gene therapy because of its strong zzso zzso zzso zzso can function as a tumor zzso in some zzso through negative regulation of gene zzso However, the relationship between zzso and zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso has not been zzso The abundance of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso were measured using quantitative real-time zzso chain zzso Their expression levels were analyzed and correlated with tumor zzso zzso zzso clinical zzso and survival zzso zzso mimic was zzso using zzso to increase its level in zzso cancer cell line, zzso The effects of zzso on zzso protein expression were tested using western zzso zzso Cell cycle analyses were performed using flow zzso The results showed that zzso of zzso mimic significantly suppressed cell proliferation with decreased zzso protein zzso but did not affect zzso expression zzso The results from zzso tissue samples showed that zzso was zzso while zzso expression was zzso The zzso levels were zzso correlated with zzso differentiation and were positively correlated with survival zzso zzso significantly suppressed cell proliferation by arresting cells at zzso phase in zzso zzso These results indicated that zzso may affect the occurrence of zzso by targeting zzso
