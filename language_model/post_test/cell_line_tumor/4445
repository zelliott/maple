zzso cancer zzso is a leading male zzso zzso zzso During zzso zzso normal zzso cells undergo genetic and zzso changes known as zzso transition zzso Several regulatory genes and specific marker proteins are involved in PC zzso Recently, zzso have been associated with zzso grade and zzso score in zzso Considering that zzso is mainly a gene zzso increased in PC and that zzso promoters have putative binding sites for this zzso we propose that zzso might regulate zzso expression during PC zzso The aim of this study was to analyze zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso and other zzso markers in a tissue zzso zzso of PC samples and PC cell zzso The zzso included PC samples of different zzso grade and benign zzso zzso zzso samples, as zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines were used as models of PC representing different zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed on zzso and zzso zzso and western zzso analysis were conducted on cell zzso zzso show that zzso exhibits increased expression in high zzso specimens compared to low zzso grade and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells show higher zzso expression levels compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso similarly to zzso (a known marker of zzso shows a decreased expression in high zzso grades samples and zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso 2 shows no changes associated to zzso zzso It is concluded that increased zzso levels in advanced PC are associated with low expression of zzso The mechanism by which zzso regulates the expression of zzso remains to be zzso
