Lung cancer is more deadly than zzso breast, and prostate zzso combined, and treatment improvements have failed to improve prognosis zzso Here, we identify a critical zzso of lung cancer zzso zzso a zzso protein with zzso properties that are linked to the zzso zzso zzso zzso transition zzso in lung zzso zzso We show that expression of mouse zzso in lung zzso cells of transgenic mice zzso zzso and spontaneous tumor development and that zzso of zzso by zzso expression of zzso gave rise to lung zzso in the transgenic mice through bypassing zzso zzso zzso is expressed abundantly in stages 1 and 2 of human lung zzso and, zzso is an attractive molecular target for the development of new therapies that prevent progression to zzso lung zzso
