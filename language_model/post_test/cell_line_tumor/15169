Two novel zzso complexes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso and characterized by X-ray zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso The interactions of the complexes with salmon zzso DNA were investigated by zzso analysis, zzso zzso and circular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso spectral zzso zzso zzso zzso spectral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso reveal that 1 and 2 interact with DNA through zzso In zzso studies, the zzso zzso and zzso zzso changes of the reactions between the zzso zzso complexes with DNA demonstrate zzso zzso In addition, CD study indicates the zzso zzso complexes cause a more zzso to a more zzso zzso change upon binding zzso All the experimental results show that the interaction mode of the two complexes was greatly affected by the coordination environments of zzso zzso zzso Their in zzso zzso towards five selected tumor cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso has been evaluated by zzso method, and 2 exhibits higher growth zzso of the selected cell lines at concentration of 50 zzso this result is identical with their DNA binding ability zzso
