zzso and related compounds have potent zzso activity through zzso of zzso zzso zzso It has recently been reported that zzso is highly expressed in zzso center B cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting an important role for zzso in zzso B zzso zzso we determined the importance of zzso in normal and transformed zzso center B cells by evaluating the effects of zzso zzso on the form and function of zzso centers and zzso zzso NHL zzso 

To examine the activity of zzso on zzso center zzso zzso sections from zzso monkeys treated with oral zzso were zzso zzso activity of zzso was assessed on zzso zzso NHL lines in zzso A zzso zzso zzso was used to determine cellular zzso zzso following zzso zzso Finally, zzso of zzso and proliferation by zzso was examined in the human zzso NHL line in culture and in implanted zzso 

zzso zzso caused a reduction in zzso center size and number in zzso zzso from treated zzso zzso zzso inhibited growth zzso zzso zzso zzso of several NHL lines in a manner that correlated with zzso zzso Moreover, orally administered zzso significantly inhibited zzso tumor growth, which correlated with zzso of tumor zzso zzso at 100 zzso in zzso 

These results show the potent zzso activity of zzso on NHL lines in zzso and oral zzso activity in zzso and suggest the therapeutic potential of zzso as a novel agent for treatment of NHL should be evaluated in the clinical zzso
