DNA zzso of promoter sequences have been developed in order to identify the profile of genes bound and activated by DNA regulatory proteins such as the zzso factors zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso The zzso contain zzso unique human promoter sequences from zzso to zzso zzso from the zzso start zzso zzso DNA damage rapidly leads to specific zzso of the zzso zzso zzso leading to increased zzso of zzso and zzso complexes at hundreds of sites within 3 zzso Using three statistical criteria, approximately zzso most commonly zzso zzso complexes were identified and representative cases were verified by zzso measurement of zzso zzso zzso was correlated at the zzso and protein zzso The largest functional cohort was 24 genes of known DNA repair function, most of which exhibited increased protein expression indicated coordinate gene zzso In addition, cell lines of prostate cancer exhibit stable zzso or copy number changes that reflect the zzso of the corresponding primary zzso 504 zzso promoters showed differential zzso between immortalized control prostate zzso and cancer cell zzso Among candidate zzso genes in zzso lines, eight had previously been observed in prostate cancer, and 13 were previously determined zzso targets in other zzso The vast majority of genes that appear to be both zzso zzso and zzso regulated between prostate zzso and cancer cell lines are novel zzso targets, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso representing a rich new source of candidate genes to study the role of DNA zzso in prostate zzso Earlier studies using zzso promoter zzso examine approximately zzso of the zzso regulatory sequences while the current gene regulatory events surveyed here occur on a large scale and may rapidly effect the coordinated expression of a large number of zzso
