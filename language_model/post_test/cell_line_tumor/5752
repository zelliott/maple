The zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso plays an essential role in the development of mantle cell zzso zzso an aggressive tumor that remains incurable with current treatment zzso zzso has been zzso as an effective therapeutic target, but the evaluation of this target has been hampered by our incomplete understanding of its zzso functions and by the lack of valid zzso zzso zzso To address these issues, we generated a zzso mouse model in which zzso expression can be regulated zzso These mice developed zzso zzso capable of zzso features of human zzso We found that zzso zzso was not sufficient to induce zzso zzso in zzso however, using a combination of in zzso and in zzso zzso we identified a novel zzso zzso function in zzso zzso Specifically, we found that zzso besides increasing cell proliferation through deregulation of the cell cycle at the zzso transition, zzso the zzso protein zzso in the zzso thereby favoring zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso cells to zzso through zzso zzso Thus, genetic or zzso targeting of zzso combined with a zzso zzso zzso zzso killed the zzso zzso zzso human zzso cell lines, and primary zzso zzso Our study identifies a role of zzso in zzso zzso in zzso cells, and highlights the potential benefit of simultaneously targeting zzso and survival pathways in patients with zzso This effective combination therapy also might be exploited in other zzso zzso
