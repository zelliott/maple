To investigate the effect of zzso on zzso in gastric zzso 

We generated stable cell lines zzso zzso in zzso zzso Cell proliferation was assessed by the zzso zzso The effects of zzso zzso on tumor growth and zzso were zzso Because of the key role of zzso target of zzso zzso signaling in gastric cancer zzso we also tested whether zzso zzso affected the zzso zzso 

zzso expression of zzso significantly diminished cell proliferation in zzso cells ( zzso zzso zzso significantly retarded zzso zzso growth by zzso in zzso and caused a marked reduction in tumor zzso assessed by zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis of the zzso showed that zzso zzso substantially reduced the zzso of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso indicative of art zzso of the zzso zzso Accompanying with the zzso zzso the zzso factors, zzso factor 1 alpha and vascular zzso growth factor, were significantly zzso 

These data highlighted an important role for zzso in controlling gastric cancer growth and zzso therefore offering a possible therapeutic strategy against this zzso
