zzso of native transgenic T cell receptors in recipient human T cells is often insufficient to achieve highly zzso T cell zzso Here we show that zzso modification of an zzso T cell zzso zzso together with omission of zzso instability motifs and zzso zzso sites, leads to a dramatic increase in the expression levels of the transgenic zzso in human zzso T zzso The zzso zzso have been tested in three different zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso T cells carrying the zzso zzso are functionally active against target cells loaded with relevant zzso model tumor cells expressing the specific zzso as well as cervical zzso zzso The significant improvements we report here in the functional expression of specific human zzso will hopefully zzso clinical application of zzso zzso zzso
