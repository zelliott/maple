zzso is highly expressed in zzso cell zzso The authors investigated whether zzso actually zzso the migration and invasion of human zzso zzso zzso cell lines, and whether its expression with respect to invasion and prognosis is attributable to certain zzso zzso 

In the human zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso the zzso differential display was evaluated using zzso zzso The results were validated by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction and Northern zzso analysis to detect possible genetic changes as the determining factors for the zzso of the zzso zzso The migration and invasion abilities were investigated in human zzso cell lines and zzso zzso using an in zzso brain slice invasion model and a simple scratch zzso The zzso and zzso (such as the development of zzso and zzso changes were examined under light and zzso zzso zzso expression was assessed on zzso tests and Western zzso zzso 

zzso zzso expression in the human zzso cell lines was statistically correlated with migratory abilities and zzso The zzso cells became more round than the zzso cells and lacked zzso On zzso zzso zzso expression was increased in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso demonstrated higher expression levels than zzso zzso in the Western zzso zzso appears to zzso migration and invasion in human zzso cell lines and may play a role in tumor progression and zzso in human zzso
