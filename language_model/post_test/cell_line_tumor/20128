We previously established a three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso model using zzso cells which are human zzso cancer zzso zzso cells with a disruption in zzso zzso and revealed the crucial roles of zzso zzso both in zzso of zzso and in disruption of cell zzso however, the molecular mechanism of zzso these 3-D specific biological changes remains to be zzso 

Among the genes that were zzso by zzso zzso in this model, we focused on the zzso zzso zzso of which expression levels were found to be higher in clinical tumor samples from zzso patients in comparison to those from healthy control in the public zzso of gene expression zzso zzso was specifically zzso among other zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells resulted in zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso zzso activity using zzso reverted the disorganization of zzso cells into the normal zzso state of the zzso cell polarity by inducing the zzso assembly of zzso (a tight junction zzso and zzso (an zzso junction zzso and by increasing the activity of zzso (an zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced the zzso zzso which is known to be associated with the disruption of zzso cavity formation and zzso zzso Similar results were also obtained using zzso In addition, increased expression of zzso zzso was found to be correlated with relapsed zzso in a public zzso of gene expression zzso 

These results collectively suggested that zzso is zzso by zzso zzso and also that the zzso of zzso zzso activity can induce both zzso cell polarity and zzso zzso in zzso thus highlighting the utility of our 3-D culture zzso model for the zzso development of zzso in 3-D zzso Indeed, using this model, we found that zzso is a promising candidate for a therapeutic target as well as zzso molecular marker in zzso Further zzso of the signaling network of zzso in zzso would provide a better understanding of zzso in zzso
