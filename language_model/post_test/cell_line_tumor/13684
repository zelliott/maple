zzso aberrations of key regulators of the zzso zzso have hardly been identified in zzso We detected high zzso zzso and protein levels in the majority of zzso zzso by zzso expression profiling and zzso Micro zzso zzso This zzso zzso expression is strongly elevated compared to normal zzso and other zzso Most zzso cell lines lack this high zzso zzso Only two zzso cell lines zzso and zzso show zzso expression levels representative for zzso zzso To validate zzso as a therapeutic target in zzso we employed zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso resulted in massive zzso while cell lines with low zzso expression were zzso zzso results were obtained by treatment of the zzso cell lines with the small zzso zzso inhibitor zzso which is currently being clinically zzso Combination zzso of zzso with most classical zzso showed strong synergistic zzso zzso zzso of a zzso cell line with high zzso expression in zzso zzso mice showed a strong response to zzso These findings establish zzso as a promising drug target in zzso and warrant further evaluation of zzso and other zzso zzso zzso
