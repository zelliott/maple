Although zzso acid zzso has been reported to show zzso effects on various zzso zzso few studies have reported the molecular mechanisms of resistance to zzso 

A drug-resistant cell line was developed by repeatedly treating human zzso cell line zzso with zzso zzso status of drug zzso molecules including zzso cassette (ABC) and zzso protein 27 zzso was confirmed in order to zzso molecular mechanisms of the drug zzso 

zzso treatment with zzso induced drug resistance with zzso of zzso in the resistant cell zzso Although ABC expression was zzso zzso of zzso in the resistant cell line was zzso The resistance was overcome by zzso zzso 

Resistance to zzso in zzso cells may be induced by a molecular mechanism different from conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression may play a role in the development of zzso resistance in zzso zzso
