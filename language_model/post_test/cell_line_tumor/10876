zzso is an zzso growth hormone zzso zzso causing release of zzso from zzso zzso through the zzso zzso zzso of zzso is linked directly to zzso free zzso concentration zzso which is determined by zzso influx and release from zzso zzso storage zzso zzso influx is via zzso zzso channels, which are activated by cell zzso zzso potential is mainly determined by zzso zzso zzso The present study investigates the in zzso of zzso on membrane zzso zzso channels in the zzso rat zzso cell zzso zzso patch clamp recording was used to record zzso currents under zzso zzso In the presence of zzso (1 zzso zzso channel zzso and zzso (1 zzso zzso channel zzso in the bath solution, two types of zzso zzso currents were characterized on the basis of their zzso zzso and pharmacological zzso We observed that transient zzso current zzso represented a significant proportion of total zzso currents in some cells, whereas delayed zzso zzso current zzso existed in all zzso The application of zzso (10 zzso zzso and significantly decreased the zzso of both zzso and zzso currents to zzso and zzso of control, zzso Application of zzso (1 zzso SK channel zzso or zzso (1 zzso BK channel zzso did not alter the zzso current or the response to zzso The zzso reduction in zzso currents was not affected by zzso and zzso zzso zzso a specific zzso zzso totally abolished the zzso current response to zzso These results suggest that zzso reduction of zzso zzso currents in zzso cells is zzso through a zzso zzso A decrease in zzso zzso currents may increase the frequency, zzso and zzso of action zzso and contribute to zzso zzso from zzso
