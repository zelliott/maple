The goal of this study was to develop zzso zzso resonant zzso zzso zzso zzso as dual contrast and therapeutic agents for cancer management via zzso zzso followed by higher intensity zzso We demonstrate that zzso exposed to a zzso zzso laser exhibit zzso induced zzso that can be zzso to zzso zzso cells in zzso When zzso with zzso zzso these zzso specifically bind zzso breast zzso cells that zzso the zzso zzso enabling the cells to be zzso via zzso zzso with an incident laser power of 1 zzso Higher zzso power zzso zzso could be employed to induce zzso damage to the zzso cells, producing extensive membrane zzso within seconds leading to cell zzso zzso are ideal zzso agents for cancer management because they offer the ability to pinpoint precise treatment sites and perform subsequent zzso zzso in a single zzso
