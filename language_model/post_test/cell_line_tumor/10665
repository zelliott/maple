An unresolved obstacle in transplantation of zzso of zzso is the early graft loss caused by zzso reactions on the surface of zzso after zzso zzso We investigated a versatile method for zzso the surface of zzso with zzso carrying the zzso zzso using an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso zzso was gradually released from the zzso on the zzso and zzso activity was detected in culture zzso zzso zzso retained the ability to control insulin release in response to zzso concentration zzso Although we mainly examined surface modification of zzso this technique may be useful for zzso various types of small molecules on cells and zzso and thus may have many applications in cell therapy and zzso zzso
