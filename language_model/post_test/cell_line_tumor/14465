zzso melanoma zzso is the most common primary zzso cancer of adults and is characterized by several well-established zzso zzso More recently, a specific zzso of zzso zzso binding protein zzso alpha zzso zzso has also been identified in a proportion of zzso Although some of these zzso have been suggested to be early changes, the genetic zzso responsible for the development of zzso have yet to be clearly zzso zzso are characterized by increased genetic instability, and analysis of established cancer cell lines and blood from cancer patients has universally been associated with an increased level of sister zzso exchange zzso We have observed that the spontaneous frequency of zzso in primary cultures of zzso and zzso cell lines is decreased below normal baseline levels, a phenomenon unique to zzso when compared with multiple other zzso This finding was specific to the tumor and not found in zzso from the zzso Although we cannot exclude the possibility that low zzso zzso is peculiar to the zzso zzso zzso as it was consistently observed in all zzso zzso regardless of other genetic zzso we propose that this phenomenon contributes to the molecular zzso of zzso
