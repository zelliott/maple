The zzso activity, upon UVA zzso of two zzso derivatives of zzso and zzso a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso has been investigated in a panel of human tumor cell zzso The two compounds present a remarkable zzso after UVA zzso zzso zzso reaching an zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso cell lines and zzso zzso in the solid zzso cell zzso Their effect on the cell cycle was measured by flow zzso in zzso zzso The compounds induce cell cycle zzso and trigger a massive zzso as revealed by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso at the outer zzso zzso zzso the drugs zzso upon UVA zzso significant variations of the zzso potential zzso measured by flow zzso using the zzso zzso In addition we characterized the zzso production of zzso oxygen species zzso using the probe zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso using the interacting probe zzso zzso orange zzso Both compounds stimulate the production of zzso and remarkably induce zzso of zzso We have investigated the zzso properties of these two compounds by means of zzso zzso and zzso The two compounds exhibit a low affinity toward the zzso The mode of binding was also investigated by means of flow linear zzso zzso which has revealed that the two compounds do not efficiently zzso into zzso Finally, the zzso properties of the test compounds were studied on zzso zzso DNA as a zzso Only compound 1 is able to induce a significant production of single strand breaks only after zzso with the base zzso repair zzso zzso zzso zzso these data suggest that DNA is not a preferential target of these molecules and other zzso structures may be responsible for their high zzso zzso
