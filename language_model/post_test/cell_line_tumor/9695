Growth zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso a promising cancer zzso constituent of garlic, against cultured human cancer cells zzso with checkpoint zzso 1 zzso zzso arrest, but the fate of the cells arrested in zzso remains zzso Using zzso and zzso human cancer cells as a model, we now demonstrate that the zzso zzso arrest resulting from zzso exposure leads to zzso The zzso exposure resulted in zzso phase and zzso arrest in both zzso and zzso cell zzso The zzso arrest was accompanied by zzso of zzso zzso 1 zzso cell division cycle zzso zzso and zzso leading to zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso arrest correlated with zzso of zzso zzso as evidenced by zzso of its zzso zzso and zzso The zzso treatment increased zzso zzso of zzso zzso and transient zzso with zzso zzso zzso significant protection against zzso zzso arrest in both cell zzso The zzso protein zzso also afforded partial yet statistically significant protection against zzso DNA fragmentation and zzso zzso resulting from zzso exposure in both zzso and zzso zzso Even though zzso treatment resulted in stabilization and zzso zzso of zzso the zzso of zzso protein failed to rescue zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the results of the present study indicate that zzso dependence of zzso zzso arrest in human cancer cells is not influenced by the zzso status and cells arrested in zzso upon zzso exposure are driven to zzso DNA zzso
