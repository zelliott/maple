We report here in zzso gene transfer between cancer cells is associated with acquisition of high zzso zzso The zzso cell line with high zzso potential and the zzso cell line with low zzso potential, both derived from the zzso human zzso cell line, were either zzso or transplanted alone in the zzso in nude zzso Upon mixed transplantation of the two differently labeled zzso resulting zzso colonies are single colored either red or green, thereby demonstrating their zzso and enabling facile color-coded zzso When zzso and zzso were zzso in the zzso the number of lung zzso of zzso increased zzso compared to zzso transplanted alone zzso zzso zzso In contrast, no enhancement of zzso zzso occurred when zzso and zzso were transplanted separately in the right and left zzso zzso This result suggests that the presence of zzso increased the zzso potential of zzso within the mixed zzso We observed transfer of the zzso gene from zzso to zzso after they were zzso suggesting the zzso played a role in increasing the zzso potential of zzso in the presence of zzso These data suggest the possible role of in zzso gene transfer in enhancing the zzso potential of cancer zzso The data also further demonstrated the power of color-coded imaging to zzso zzso interactions in zzso
