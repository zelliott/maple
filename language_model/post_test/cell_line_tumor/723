zzso zzso are extremely difficult to treat and rarely result in a zzso The application of zzso viruses is a potential strategy for controlling zzso cancer because zzso zzso injection of an zzso virus, such as zzso virus, results in tumor cell zzso and subsequent release of tumor zzso into the zzso Furthermore, the viruses can serve as a vehicle for delivering genes of interest to cancer zzso 

In the current study, we zzso that in zzso mice primed with DNA zzso an zzso foreign zzso zzso zzso followed by a boost with zzso administration of zzso virus zzso the same foreign zzso zzso can generate enhanced zzso effects through the combination of viral zzso and zzso zzso 

We observed that zzso mice primed with zzso DNA and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso generated significant therapeutic zzso effects as well as induced significant levels of zzso zzso T cells in two different tumor zzso Furthermore, treatment with zzso not only kills the tumor and zzso cells directly but also renders the tumor cells and surrounding zzso cells susceptible to zzso zzso zzso killing, resulting in enhanced zzso therapeutic zzso 

Thus, the current study may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the control of zzso zzso
