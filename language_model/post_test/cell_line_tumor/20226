We developed a new zzso natural zzso zzso which tightly binds to zzso quantum zzso zzso surfaces and renders them zzso zzso zzso with this flexible and zzso zzso offers high zzso stability, adds only zzso zzso to the radius of the particles (as compared to their original zzso zzso preserves very high quantum yield zzso in water, and zzso facile zzso with various functional zzso We demonstrate specific targeting (with minimal zzso zzso of such zzso zzso to zzso mouse prion protein expressed in live zzso zzso We also demonstrated homogeneous in zzso zzso with no significant toxicity in live zzso
