The zzso factor zzso is a key regulator of insulin gene expression and maturation of zzso zzso zzso Despite its importance, the regulatory mechanism of zzso gene expression is still zzso To identify the zzso regulators of zzso we examined various zzso factors, which are potentially involved in zzso cell zzso An zzso zzso study clearly demonstrated that zzso suppresses the promoter activity of zzso through the zzso zzso on the zzso zzso region (named area zzso However, zzso analysis showed that zzso but not zzso could directly bind to area zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso inhibited the binding of zzso onto area A upon zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso in the zzso site of area A significantly decreased the promoter activity of zzso These findings suggest that zzso suppresses zzso gene expression through the zzso zzso In the mouse zzso zzso expression was first detected at the latest stage of zzso cell differentiation and was scarcely observed in zzso cells during zzso zzso In addition, zzso expression was significantly increased in the zzso of diabetic zzso mice, whereas zzso expression was markedly zzso The improved zzso levels of zzso mice with insulin injections significantly reduced zzso expression and rescued the reduction of zzso zzso These in zzso experiments also suggest that zzso is a negative regulator of zzso gene zzso This study implicates the novel role of zzso in the control of normal zzso cell differentiation and its involvement in zzso cell dysfunction under diabetic conditions by suppressing zzso gene zzso
