To investigate the zzso effect of zzso fusion zzso dominant negative zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso or truncated zzso of zzso was fused to C terminal of zzso core protein zzso and zzso into zzso zzso zzso yielding zzso expression plasmids of zzso zzso After zzso into zzso cells, the expression of zzso zzso was identified by zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso zzso on zzso replication was zzso as the zzso zzso concentration determined by zzso and zzso content by fluorescent zzso zzso metabolism of zzso cells was evaluated by zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and its truncated zzso were expressed in zzso cells, and had no toxic effect on host zzso zzso zzso could inhibit zzso replication and the zzso ability of zzso protein had a stronger zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso with full length of zzso had the strongest zzso effect on zzso zzso reducing the zzso concentration by zzso and the zzso content by zzso zzso zzso suggested that there were no significant differences in cell zzso activity between the zzso 

zzso zzso zzso can inhibit zzso replication zzso
