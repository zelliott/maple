In cancer biology, cell lines are often used instead of primary tumors because of their widespread availability and close reflection of the in zzso zzso Cancer is a genetic disease, commonly caused by small- and large-scale DNA zzso zzso it is essential to know the zzso profiles of tumor cell lines to enable their correct and efficient use as experimental zzso Here, we present a comprehensive study of the zzso profiles of 20 colon cancer cell lines combining conventional zzso zzso comparative zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Major differences between the zzso instability zzso and zzso instability zzso cell lines are zzso the zzso cell lines exhibited complex zzso involving many zzso zzso zzso copy number zzso whereas the zzso cell lines showed considerably fewer aberrations zzso zzso The 3 techniques complement each other to provide a detailed picture of the zzso and structural zzso changes that characterize cancer zzso zzso 7 of the cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are here completely zzso for the first time and, among these, 5 have not previously been zzso zzso By zzso cluster analysis, we show that the cell lines are representative models for primary zzso at the zzso zzso We also present the zzso profiles of an experimental model for tumor zzso including 3 cell lines zzso zzso and zzso established from a primary zzso its corresponding zzso and zzso zzso from the same zzso To address the question of zzso we compared the zzso of 3 common cell lines grown in 2 zzso Finally, we compared all our results with previously published zzso data and zzso of zzso cell zzso In conclusion, the large variation in genetic complexity of the cell lines highlights the importance of a comprehensive reference of zzso profiles for investigators engaged in functional studies using these research zzso
