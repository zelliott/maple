There still remain concerns over the potential for zzso zzso after zzso zzso We designed this trial to investigate the effects of the inflammatory zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso on the interaction between gastric cancer cells and zzso cells, and to evaluate differences in both the zzso and systemic zzso zzso and zzso zzso after zzso and conventional surgical approaches, thus offering another possible advantage of zzso procedures for treatment of gastric zzso 

A zzso human in zzso zzso was developed to study zzso of zzso and zzso human gastric cancer cells to zzso of primary cultured human zzso zzso cells zzso zzso cell zzso to a zzso zzso was assessed after zzso of the zzso with zzso and zzso using flow zzso zzso of zzso molecules zzso zzso and zzso and their counterparts zzso and zzso was investigated by real-time zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were measured zzso in zzso drain fluid and in serum by zzso zzso 

zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso and zzso resulted in enhanced tumor cell zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells showed significant enhancement of expression of zzso zzso and zzso after stimulation with zzso and zzso Meanwhile their counterparts zzso zzso and zzso were identified in gastric cancer zzso The level of zzso in zzso drain fluid and in serum zzso in the zzso zzso group was lower than in the conventional open zzso group, whereas there were no significant differences between the zzso zzso zzso zzso and conventional open zzso zzso groups with respect to zzso 

The presented results prove that zzso and zzso are significant stimulating factors in gastric cancer cell zzso in zzso and may therefore partly account for local tumor recurrence and zzso zzso in zzso zzso to less impact on the zzso abdominal regional and systemic immune responses, zzso surgery not only shows clinically relevant advantages but also causes less effect of inflammatory factors on local recurrence and zzso zzso of gastric cancer than conventional zzso Thus, we offer another possible advantage of zzso procedures for treatment of gastric zzso
