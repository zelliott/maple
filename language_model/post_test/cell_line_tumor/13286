zzso to aggressiveness and zzso pancreatic zzso zzso zzso is zzso by a poor zzso To address this zzso dilemma we aimed to establish animal models, which can be used for identifying new specific tumor zzso as well as serving as tools for potential therapeutic zzso From a panel of zzso pancreatic cancer cell lines, two human zzso and zzso and a rat zzso cell line were selected for their properties to grow in the liver of male zzso rats and mimic liver zzso of zzso For better monitoring of zzso tumor growth zzso all three pancreatic cancer cell lines were zzso zzso with zzso and zzso marker zzso In addition, the zzso expression profile of 13 human zzso cell lines was analyzed by zzso array zzso Only 33 genes and 5 signaling pathways were identified as significantly associated with the ability of the cell lines to grow initially and/or consistently in rat zzso Only a minority of these genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth factor 1) has been zzso studied and shown to be closely related to cancer zzso The function of the remaining 30 genes ranges from moderate to poorly investigated, and their function in cancer progression is still zzso The ensuing three pancreatic cancer liver zzso models vary in their aggressiveness and zzso zzso They will be used for zzso evaluation of new therapeutic approaches aiming at the genes zzso
