The zzso and zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso belongs to a class of zzso tumor zzso together with zzso zzso and zzso zzso It is considered one of the most important tumor zzso in the post zzso zzso Previously to identify the molecules involved in the signaling network regulated by zzso using zzso tools, we reported global zzso profiles at different time points using the zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso Kim, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2003, 15, zzso However, the system had a critical limitation that zzso cell has zzso zzso zzso and, thus to be zzso the induced zzso could not give the answer about the real zzso roles of this tumor zzso Here, to find out zzso protein network we have established various zzso zzso an activity zzso zzso and a zzso zzso deficient zzso cell clones in zzso zzso human zzso cells lacking zzso zzso as a result of genetic zzso In this biological context, we compared their zzso and expression patterns, and zzso images of each zzso cell clone by zzso followed by identification with zzso zzso We obtained some pieces of evidence that zzso change by zzso expression is zzso by its protein zzso activity and their growth rate by the zzso zzso zzso The zzso approaches showed that 30 proteins possibly correlated with zzso protein zzso activity (13 zzso and 17 zzso and 20 with the zzso zzso activity zzso zzso and 6 zzso were zzso Taken together, we conclude that the comparative analysis of zzso from various zzso cells has yielded zzso data to zzso the protein network directly and/or indirectly caused by individual zzso activities of zzso in zzso
