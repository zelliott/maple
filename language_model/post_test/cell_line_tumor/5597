The early diagnosis of prostate cancer and its zzso still remains a great zzso Recently, zzso receptors have been found in healthy and zzso prostate zzso If zzso to a zzso zzso zzso zzso would represent candidates for markers of not only zzso cells but also prostate zzso Such a zzso would be of great value for the detection of prostate cancer zzso 

We coupled zzso a zzso zzso to zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso fragrance zzso By using zzso laser scanning zzso and flow zzso we examined the zzso of this zzso into various different human cell zzso One healthy prostate cell line, two different prostate zzso cell lines, and five other zzso cell lines were zzso zzso nude mice bearing human zzso prostate zzso zzso were injected with the zzso zzso zzso of mouse organ frozen sections was evaluated by zzso laser scanning zzso 

When comparing the seven human cell lines, the zzso was zzso taken up by the zzso of healthy and zzso prostate zzso The mice showed high zzso zzso into the zzso but much lower zzso into the mouse zzso After 3 zzso of zzso zzso could be observed in the zzso zzso zzso touch prints confirmed in zzso zzso zzso 

This zzso may be of potential value in the diagnosis of prostate cancer and its zzso
