Because zzso stress elicits various signaling pathways that may be implicated in cell survival or cell death, their zzso may have relevance in the development of zzso zzso Thus, in the present study, we investigated cell response to the zzso growth factor zzso zzso inhibitor zzso of zzso zzso cell lines, including cells selected for resistance to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited a marked decrease in sensitivity to zzso and resistance to zzso zzso was capable of zzso the zzso of zzso in all the studied cell zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso zzso which act downstream of zzso were zzso active in the three cell lines, but zzso levels were increased in the two resistant zzso This feature was associated with reduced sensitivity to the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso of resistant cells with zzso resulted in restoration of sensitivity to zzso zzso was more effective in zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells than in zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso in the resistant zzso indicating the zzso zzso of distinct zzso protein zzso The zzso of zzso was associated with a peculiar zzso of zzso which, in resistant zzso was mainly zzso In conclusion, our results indicate that the development of resistance to platinum drugs is associated with multiple zzso including deregulation of survival pathways activated by zzso resulting in a reduced cellular response to zzso
