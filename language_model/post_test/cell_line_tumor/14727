zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in the zzso of Alzheimer's disease zzso It can cause cell death in Alzheimer's disease by evoking a cascade of zzso damage to zzso zzso compounds may help to zzso and develop a treatment for Alzheimer's zzso In the present study, we investigated the protective effect of zzso zzso a zzso zzso which is particularly effective at reducing zzso injury, on zzso zzso cell zzso Exposure of cells to 20 zzso zzso for 48 h caused viability loss and zzso increase, and zzso with zzso for 24 h significantly reduced the viability loss and zzso zzso In addition, zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso generation and zzso radical generation to a striking zzso Based on these results, it is concluded that zzso effectively protects zzso cells against zzso damage by suppressing the generation of zzso oxygen species especially, zzso zzso
