A cross talk between the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso has been demonstrated to influence the therapeutic response of breast cancer patients but the full mechanism remains poorly zzso Here we show that the zzso domain of zzso interacts with the CD domain of zzso to allow for the assembly of intermediate complex zzso proteins zzso and zzso We demonstrated that a loss of zzso in zzso breast cells decreases the expression of the zzso protein through the zzso zzso Our work reveals a novel regulatory mechanism of zzso zzso turnover and activity and an unanticipated relationship with the zzso tumor zzso
