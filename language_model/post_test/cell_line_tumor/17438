Alternative treatment options are needed for advanced zzso patients because their prognosis remains poor after intensive zzso zzso cells express zzso growth factor zzso stem cell factor zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso and their respective zzso zzso zzso and zzso We therefore evaluated the effects of zzso zzso zzso a selective inhibitor of the zzso zzso activities of zzso and zzso on the growth of zzso cells in zzso and in zzso 

We tested seven human zzso cell lines for their sensitivity to zzso Cell viability was assessed by zzso blue dye zzso zzso was evaluated by nuclear zzso flow zzso and western zzso zzso zzso included zzso western zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression was assessed by northern zzso We used a zzso model in zzso mice (10 mice per zzso to evaluate the effects of zzso oral therapy zzso or 100 zzso every 12 hours for 14 zzso on zzso tumor zzso All statistical tests were zzso 

All seven zzso cell lines treated with zzso displayed zzso decreases in cell zzso which coincided with an induction of zzso and with zzso zzso of zzso and zzso The zzso zzso that caused 50% zzso of growth and 50% zzso of zzso zzso of these receptors were zzso zzso M and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso of zzso its zzso was reduced in zzso cells treated with zzso at 10 zzso or zzso Mice treated with zzso at 50 zzso or 100 zzso had statistically significantly smaller tumors than control mice treated with vehicle zzso tumor volume in mice treated with zzso at 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso in control mice zzso zzso zzso difference zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso 657 to zzso zzso zzso mean tumor volume in mice treated with zzso at 100 zzso zzso 463 zzso difference zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso 

zzso inhibited the growth of zzso cells in zzso and in zzso This zzso was associated with suppression of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso
