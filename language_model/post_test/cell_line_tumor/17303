zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso or zzso type were prepared by treatment of zzso with sodium zzso or zzso or sodium zzso The novel zzso zzso were evaluated for their capacity to catalyze the reduction of hydrogen zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso carrying zzso and zzso groups, respectively, were the most efficient zzso zzso zzso Reduction of zzso zzso zzso often proceeded zzso times faster than reduction of the more zzso zzso which cannot bind into the zzso interior of the zzso Thus, it seems that the zzso zzso acts as a binding site for the zzso zzso The zzso derivatives were also evaluated for their capacity to inhibit zzso zzso and cancer cell growth in zzso zzso values for zzso of zzso or zzso zzso were in the zzso range for the best zzso zzso zzso and zzso Two of the compounds zzso and 5) were found to inhibit the growth of zzso cells in culture with zzso values in the low zzso zzso
