The zzso downstream regulated gene 1 zzso has been identified as a zzso gene in prostate cancer zzso zzso targeting zzso cells deficient in zzso could potentially decrease zzso of zzso A cell based screening strategy was employed to identify small molecules that selectively target zzso deficient zzso zzso zzso zzso cells rendered deficient in zzso expression by a zzso zzso zzso strategy were used in the primary zzso zzso filtered from the primary screen were further validated through proliferation and zzso survival zzso in parental and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso compounds revealed zzso and zzso zzso zzso as compounds that exhibited synthetic zzso against zzso deficient zzso zzso A three-dimensional zzso invasion zzso was zzso to test the ability of zzso to inhibit invasion of zzso zzso zzso was found to remarkably decrease invasion of zzso cells in collagen zzso Our results suggest that zzso and zzso could be further explored for their potential clinical benefit in patients with zzso deficient zzso
