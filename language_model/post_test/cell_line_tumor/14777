The majority of zzso receptors zzso function at the cell surface, where they are activated by their zzso present in the zzso zzso Interestingly, type I zzso zzso zzso zzso one of the most abundant zzso in the central nervous system, is predominantly zzso The important zzso roles of zzso R have sparked interest in the zzso of the molecular mechanisms underlying the trafficking of this zzso and the role of zzso zzso zzso Thus far, results from different groups have been, at least in part, contradictory and the basis of zzso R zzso zzso remains zzso In this commentary, by comparing the studies examining zzso R trafficking and zzso we identify technical or experimental ground responsible for the conflicting zzso Finally, we propose a possible mechanism of zzso R trafficking that may reconcile the different zzso
