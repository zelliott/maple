A facile method was used to prepare zzso zzso zzso The effect of the initial pH of the zzso solution on the formation zzso chemical structure, and zzso of zzso zzso was zzso Additionally, zzso zzso was chosen as a model zzso drug with which to evaluate the efficiency of drug loading and release behavior of zzso zzso The results indicated that the size and yield of zzso zzso consisting of zzso and zzso species, were closely related to the pH value of the precursor zzso At a reaction time of 6 zzso the uniform particle sizes of zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and 75 zzso in solutions with initial pH values of zzso 8, zzso and 9, respectively, and with corresponding yields of 3, 7, 20, and 34 zzso The amounts of zzso loaded in 1 zzso of zzso zzso zzso at pH values of zzso 8, zzso and 9 for 6 h were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso After the first day, 19, 20, 25, and 36 % of the zzso was released from zzso zzso zzso at pH values of zzso 8, zzso and 9, respectively, depending on the particle zzso The zzso zzso had excellent zzso there was no apparent zzso and they did not cause acute toxicity in zzso and zzso zzso The loading of zzso into zzso zzso significantly reduced the viability of zzso and zzso cells, comparable to free zzso It can be concluded that the zzso zzso prepared by our facile method are potential carriers of zzso drugs for cancer zzso
