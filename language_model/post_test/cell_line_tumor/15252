Cancer stem cell model zzso existence of a small proportion of tumor cells capable of sustaining tumor formation, zzso and zzso In breast cancer, these cells were found to be associated with zzso and zzso zzso Our study was performed to evaluate the suitability of current approaches for breast cancer stem cell analyses to evaluate zzso of breast cancer cells through their extensive genetic and zzso zzso 

Breast cancer cell lines zzso and zzso were cultured in adherent conditions and as zzso zzso zzso sorting for zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and adherent cell cultures were subjected to DNA profiling by array zzso and zzso profiling by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso status of selected genes was further evaluated by zzso zzso impact of zzso was evaluated by zzso analysis for selected zzso 

zzso zzso did not reveal any zzso zzso In contrast, putative breast cancer stem cells showed altered zzso levels of several genes compared to parental tumor zzso 

Our results zzso the hypothesis that zzso mechanisms seem to play a major role in the regulation of zzso However, it is also clear that more efficient methods for zzso enrichment are zzso This work underscores requirement of additional approaches to reveal zzso within breast zzso
