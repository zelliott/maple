zzso is a nuclear protein that is suggested to be involved in zzso to zzso transition during tissue zzso Recently we have identified zzso as a gene whose expression is deregulation in zzso invasive pancreatic cancer zzso In this study we assessed the expression of zzso in normal and diseased pancreatic zzso and pancreatic cancer cell zzso zzso real time zzso chain reaction was used to analyze the expression of zzso zzso in nine cultured pancreatic cancer cell lines and pancreatic bulk zzso of the normal zzso zzso chronic zzso zzso and pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso real time zzso chain reaction analysis revealed a significant zzso of zzso zzso expression in pancreatic zzso zzso compared to normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso copies zzso and low expression of this gene indicated a tendency for better survival of pancreatic cancer patients (16 zzso 13 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was present in all tested pancreatic cancer cell lines with comparably low to moderate expression levels of zzso - zzso zzso copies zzso zzso expression of zzso in pancreatic cancer might be related to zzso zzso and zzso zzso might be an important factor during the development and zzso transformation of zzso Further studies are required to better assess the role of human zzso in pancreatic cancer zzso
