zzso cancer zzso cells are described by membrane expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and their capacity to grow as spheres in a zzso medium containing zzso growth zzso The capacity of a panel of four pancreatic cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso to form spheres was zzso All cell lines with the exception of zzso developed zzso zzso the zzso cells showed an increased in zzso invasion zzso Both gene and protein expressions of markers of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and components of active zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso clearly demonstrated increased expression of the zzso markers when compared with their adherent zzso With the aim of identifying a minimum set of markers able to separate cells that have the capacity to form spheres from those incapable of forming zzso a zzso zzso component zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso Although zzso of the zzso zzso genes was unable to separate zzso from zzso cell lines, the addition of the zzso marker zzso allowed a clear zzso Moreover, zzso of the spheres and the adherent cells in zzso confirmed the superior aggressiveness zzso and zzso of the spheres over the adherent zzso In conclusion, the present study suggests that the zzso cell population is not only composed of cells displaying classical stem membrane markers but also needs zzso cells to successfully form zzso Our results also emphasize the potential therapeutic importance of pathways such as zzso and zzso for pancreatic cancer zzso
