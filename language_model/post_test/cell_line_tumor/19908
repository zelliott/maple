Development of chemotherapy resistance and evasion from zzso in zzso a primary zzso bone zzso is often correlated with zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso Here, we investigated the ability of a zzso fraction of green tea zzso that has been shown to have zzso effects on various zzso cell lines to inhibit growth and induce zzso in human zzso zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso resulted in reduced cell proliferation and induction of zzso which correlated with decreased nuclear DNA binding of zzso and lowering of zzso and zzso levels in the zzso and zzso zzso treatment of cells reduced zzso zzso but had no effect on its protein zzso Furthermore, zzso treatment resulted in the zzso of zzso and zzso the upstream zzso that zzso zzso The increase in zzso in zzso cells was accompanied with decrease in the protein expression of zzso and zzso increase in the levels of zzso zzso treatment of zzso cells also resulted in significant zzso of zzso as was evident by increased levels of zzso zzso and zzso in these zzso Treatment of zzso cells with a specific zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and general zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso rescued zzso cells from zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso is a candidate therapeutic for zzso that mediates its zzso and zzso effects via zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso
