zzso zzso a zzso zzso that is present in zzso zzso and bean zzso is known to have zzso zzso The present study examined whether zzso alters prostate cancer cell cycle zzso zzso human and zzso zzso rat prostate cancer cells were cultured with various zzso of zzso In both zzso and zzso cells treated with zzso the percentage of cells in the zzso phase increased, and the incorporation of zzso zzso zzso decreased the protein levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 4, whereas zzso A and zzso expressions were zzso in cells treated with zzso The expression of the zzso inhibitor zzso was increased in cells treated with 20 zzso zzso In addition, treatment of cells with 20 zzso zzso for 24 hours led to zzso cell cycle zzso Cell division control zzso 2 protein levels remained zzso The protein levels of zzso zzso and zzso B1 were increased, and the zzso level was decreased by zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso promotes cell cycle arrest in zzso and zzso cells, thereby providing insights into the mechanisms underlying its zzso zzso
