zzso and zzso zzso zzso and their in zzso zzso may result in DNA damage and cause adverse health zzso It is very difficult to specifically detect trace DNA damage in the presence of a large excess of unmodified zzso Here we report a zzso imprinted zzso zzso zzso namely zzso which can be used as a zzso zzso for specific recognition of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding affinity zzso zzso of zzso was achieved by using two zzso functional zzso The property of binding zzso was greatly improved in virtue of the zzso zzso which was zzso by initiators for continuous zzso zzso transfer radical zzso zzso The zzso DNA can be specifically captured by synthetic zzso By taking advantage of this zzso behavior, we further developed a zzso zzso particle counting zzso zzso method for zzso detection of zzso zzso using a laser scanning zzso microscope zzso The number of zzso fluorescent dots is zzso to the content of zzso zzso in the DNA zzso The proposed plastic zzso zzso method can detect traces of zzso zzso as low as 18 zzso in human lung zzso zzso zzso This zzso detection of DNA zzso offers a promising alternative to zzso zzso zzso for zzso and DNA modification zzso
