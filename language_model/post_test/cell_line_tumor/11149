zzso has been associated with both, tumor survival and zzso This zzso is also involved in promoting cell migration during wound healing and zzso zzso is a zzso cervical zzso cell line, which has been used to study different mechanisms of cervical cancer zzso An in zzso zzso of scratch wound healing onto zzso of zzso cells was used to assess the effect of zzso on cell migration into a wound zzso It was found that zzso cells have the ability to zzso but not zzso in response to scratch wounding in a zzso medium supplemented with zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso cells express zzso zzso when incubated in medium with and without zzso zzso closure and migration rate of zzso cells were significantly increased in the presence of zzso media supplemented with zzso (10 zzso as compared to zzso media, and media supplemented with either zzso zzso or both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The results showed a zzso effect of zzso on the migration of zzso cervical zzso cells, suggesting a novel and important role for zzso in cervical cancer zzso
