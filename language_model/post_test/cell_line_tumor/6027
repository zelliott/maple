zzso is a zzso for the zzso zzso zzso Its zzso is readily zzso in most zzso and zzso zzso the zzso in contrast, is often found at relatively low levels, suggesting that translation of the corresponding zzso may be zzso Because the zzso untranslated region zzso of this zzso is relatively long and burdened with multiple zzso it has been speculated that it contributes to this zzso In this report, the influence of this region was assessed using in zzso and ex zzso zzso The results showed that, in a zzso system, full-length zzso zzso was a poor template for zzso Its zzso dramatically improved when its zzso was truncated or when it was replaced with the zzso of zzso E zzso These observations were confirmed in zzso mouse zzso zzso cells and human embryonic kidney zzso zzso Acute exposure of zzso cells to high zzso increased zzso zzso zzso without affecting the levels of its zzso suggesting that translation repression of this zzso can be relieved by zzso zzso
