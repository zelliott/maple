The zzso zzso zzso zzso is central to a number of pathological processes through the induction of specific genes such as vascular zzso growth factor zzso Even though zzso is highly regulated by cellular oxygen levels, other elements of the inflammatory and tumor zzso were shown to influence its activity under normal oxygen zzso Among others, recent studies indicated that transforming growth factor zzso beta increases the expression of the regulatory zzso zzso and zzso zzso DNA binding zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso acts on zzso zzso and activity by increasing zzso protein zzso In particular, we demonstrate that zzso markedly and specifically decreases both zzso and protein levels of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso through the zzso signaling zzso As a consequence, the degradation of zzso was inhibited as determined by impaired degradation of a reporter protein containing the zzso zzso degradation domain encompassing the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of the zzso converting zzso zzso resulted in increased zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso and zzso levels, suggesting that zzso production of zzso zzso efficiently regulates zzso zzso This was reinforced by results from zzso zzso or zzso cells that show impairment in zzso production in response to zzso This study reveals a novel mechanism by which a growth factor controls zzso stability, and thereby drives the expression of specific zzso through the regulation of zzso zzso
