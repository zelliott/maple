zzso zzso zzso zzso is a critical zzso that is required for a range of cellular zzso A key zzso in the zzso salvage zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso and here, we describe zzso an zzso inhibitor that zzso zzso and zzso cell death in zzso and in zzso While cells zzso for zzso acid zzso zzso zzso can be protected from zzso zzso as they convert zzso acid zzso to zzso independent of the salvage pathway, this protection only occurs if zzso is added before zzso zzso We also demonstrate that tumor cells are unable to generate zzso by de zzso synthesis as they lack expression of key zzso in this pathway, thus providing a zzso rationale for the reliance of tumor cells on the zzso salvage zzso zzso tumors that are sensitive to zzso zzso is one potential way to enhance the therapeutic effectiveness of an zzso zzso and here, we show that zzso but not zzso zzso and protein levels zzso correlate with sensitivity to zzso across a panel of 53 zzso cell lung zzso cell zzso Finally, we demonstrate that zzso reduced tumor growth in a zzso model, which is thought to more closely represent zzso primary patient zzso Thus, we show that dependence of tumor cells on the zzso salvage zzso renders them sensitive to zzso in zzso and in zzso and our data support further evaluation of the use of zzso zzso and protein levels as zzso of overall zzso
