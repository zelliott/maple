The active vitamin D zzso zzso D3 zzso has wide but not fully understood zzso zzso A previous zzso analysis of zzso action on human colon cancer cells revealed zzso D zzso which encodes an inhibitor of several zzso zzso of the zzso family, as a candidate target zzso Here we report that zzso induced vitamin D zzso zzso binding to, and zzso of, the zzso promoter and increased zzso zzso and protein levels in human colon cancer zzso In cells lacking zzso zzso D, zzso zzso D expression inhibited both proliferation in zzso and zzso tumor growth in zzso Furthermore, zzso D inhibited migration and zzso growth, antagonized the zzso signaling pathway, and zzso zzso zzso zzso D zzso expression of the zzso transition zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and, conversely, induced zzso and other zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso attenuated zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso In human zzso tumors, expression of zzso D correlated with expression of zzso and zzso and loss of zzso D correlated with poor tumor zzso Based on these data, we propose that zzso has tumor zzso activity that may contribute to the zzso action of zzso in colon zzso
