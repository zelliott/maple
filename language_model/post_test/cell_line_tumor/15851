The zzso content of urine from zzso III nude mice zzso zzso zzso was zzso before and after zzso with human zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso An zzso and zzso control population zzso zzso zzso was also studied to identify zzso zzso zzso samples were collected daily for 6 weeks, beginning 1 week before cell zzso zzso zzso were obtained via targeted profiling with zzso Suite zzso based on nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso acquired on an Oxford 800 zzso cold probe zzso zzso The zzso rank sum test was used to evaluate the significance of the change in zzso concentration between the two time zzso Both the zzso zzso and the ratios of pairs of zzso were zzso The complicated zzso between zzso were assessed through partial zzso zzso analysis zzso zzso operating characteristic zzso zzso were generated for all variables and the area under the curve zzso zzso The data indicate that the number of statistically significant changes in zzso zzso was more pronounced in the zzso population than in the control zzso This was also true of the ratios of pairs of zzso zzso analysis suggests that the ratios were better able to differentiate between the zzso and zzso samples compared to the zzso zzso zzso models produced good separation between the populations and had the best zzso results (all models exceeded zzso These results demonstrate that zzso may be used as a screening tool for zzso cells grown in zzso models in zzso
