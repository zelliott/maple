zzso of advanced pancreatic cancer has mainly been zzso for the past 15 years, with only limited zzso Recently, combination therapy that also targets checkpoint zzso 1 zzso has become an attractive zzso The central role of zzso in many zzso response zzso however, may result in zzso zzso in normal cells, causing side zzso We were searching for other target molecules of similar function that may be more specific and thus better suited for combination zzso To this end a negative selection zzso screen was performed in cell lines with small hairpin zzso molecules targeting over 10,000 zzso Genes that were found to be zzso lethal with zzso and whose proteins act upstream of zzso were zzso in more zzso In particular, the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the pancreatic cancer cell lines zzso and zzso and in the primary cell line zzso that closely resembles primary zzso zzso Further analysis showed that the synergistic effect of zzso zzso and zzso leads to forced zzso entry of cells arrested in S phase by zzso treatment, resulting in zzso DNA distribution during zzso followed by DNA fragmentation and finally cell death by zzso zzso Our data suggest zzso as a novel target protein for zzso combination therapy supplementing or zzso zzso of zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso by itself does not lead to abnormal DNA zzso suggesting a more specific zzso
