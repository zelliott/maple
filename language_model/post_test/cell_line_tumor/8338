A panel of zzso whose zzso increased zzso of pancreatic zzso cells in zzso was recently zzso The aim of this work was to observe in a mouse zzso model whether zzso of these zzso would alter pancreatic tumor zzso Rate of zzso zzso activity and cell viability were assessed in two pancreatic cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso after zzso selected zzso by zzso of specific zzso For in zzso experiments, zzso cells were injected into the zzso of nude mice, where they formed zzso zzso of zzso was obtained by repeated zzso zzso injections of modified zzso zzso zzso specific for the selected zzso zzso volumes were assessed after 21 zzso Among selected zzso zzso zzso and zzso were those whose zzso increased zzso the most in zzso zzso zzso of two of them increased zzso up to five zzso Moreover, zzso these zzso had little effect on 10 zzso cell lines, suggesting pancreatic zzso In zzso zzso induced significant but incomplete zzso of zzso expression zzso Nevertheless, such zzso resulted in a twofold increase in zzso activity in tumors and a strong reduction in tumor volume (about zzso In zzso zzso by zzso of three survival zzso apparently specific for pancreatic cancer cells, zzso zzso and zzso decreases significantly the growth of zzso zzso zzso This strategy is therefore of potential clinical zzso
