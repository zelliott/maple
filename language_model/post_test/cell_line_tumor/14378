zzso zzso zzso zzso is an aggressive cancer that is zzso to current treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso viruses zzso used for gene therapy are genetically zzso zzso viruses that selectively target tumor cells while sparing normal host zzso The localized nature, the potential accessibility and the relative lack of distant zzso make zzso a particularly suitable disease for zzso viral zzso 

The zzso selective zzso zzso spread and zzso ability of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were tested against zzso pathological types of zzso cell lines including those that are resistant to radiation therapy, zzso or zzso The therapeutic efficacy and the effect on survival of zzso were confirmed in a zzso zzso zzso 

All three zzso zzso were highly effective against all the zzso cell lines zzso Even at very low zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of viral infection, ratio of viral particles per cancer zzso zzso were highly effective against zzso cells that are resistant to radiation, zzso and zzso zzso an zzso zzso that expresses green fluorescent protein zzso was able to delineate the extent of the disease in a zzso model of zzso due to selective infection and expression of zzso in tumor zzso Furthermore, zzso was able to reduce the tumor burden and prolong survival even when treatment was at an advanced stage of the zzso 

These findings support the continued investigation of zzso zzso as potential therapy for patients with zzso zzso
