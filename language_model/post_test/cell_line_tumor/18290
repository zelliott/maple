zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso factor, not only regulates the expression of many zzso but also plays an important role in cell zzso To investigate the molecular mechanism regulating expression of the zzso gene in humans, its zzso region was cloned and zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso promoter is zzso zzso analysis and a DNA decoy zzso indicated that the zzso and zzso elements were involved in negative regulation of the zzso promoter, whereas the zzso element was mainly responsible for its strong zzso zzso mobility shift zzso suggested that the zzso zzso and zzso elements were specifically bound by the nuclear extract from zzso cells in zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that cooperation of the zzso and zzso elements led to negative regulation of the zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso and zzso elements needed to be an appropriate distance apart in the zzso promoter in order to zzso Taken together, our results zzso the mechanism underlying the regulation of zzso gene transcription, and also define a novel regulatory sequence that may be used to decrease expression of the zzso gene in cancer gene zzso
