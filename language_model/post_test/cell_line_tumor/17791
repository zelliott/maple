The human zzso zzso zzso is zzso on its zzso at three major sites zzso zzso and zzso within zzso function 1 zzso Although zzso has been shown to assemble at zzso responsive elements zzso in the presence of hormone, the timing and specificity of zzso zzso recruitment to zzso target genes has not been zzso Using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso we examined zzso zzso recruitment to several zzso genes including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in rat zzso cells, and the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene in human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were efficiently recruited to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso displayed no significant recruitment to any zzso of the genes zzso consistent with its lack of nuclear zzso Interestingly, the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso recruitment differed among zzso Our findings indicate that zzso zzso selectively occupy zzso target zzso and suggests gene specific requirements for zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso
