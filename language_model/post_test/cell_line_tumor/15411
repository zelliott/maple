zzso is a key zzso gene that plays a critical role in the regulation of cell death and survival of various cell zzso We report here that zzso zzso a class of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules able to affect stability and translation of zzso may represent a novel mechanism for regulating zzso expression and therefore zzso We demonstrated that zzso is a potential target for zzso and this zzso could zzso regulate zzso zzso resulting in a zzso of the zzso status in zzso zzso zzso Treatment of these tumor cells with the zzso mimic zzso and with the zzso increased, the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso confirmed that a specific zzso binding sequence in the zzso of zzso contributed to the zzso of the expression of the gene by zzso Interestingly, our results showed that zzso administration activated zzso through zzso formation, as resulted by zzso and zzso protein expression increase, and by the analysis of zzso positive zzso zzso in living zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso by zzso resulted in a decrease of the threshold resistance at zzso doses in zzso cells, while zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells resulted in a zzso to low zzso radiation zzso Our study of the role of zzso in regulating zzso expression and zzso reveals a novel function for this zzso sequence in a critical cellular event with significant impacts in cancer development, progression and zzso
