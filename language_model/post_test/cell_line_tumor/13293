Experimental and zzso studies have revealed that chronic inflammation contributes to cancer progression and even zzso to cellular zzso zzso infiltrates in zzso zzso cancer include zzso zzso and zzso zzso group zzso protein zzso is a late inflammatory zzso that signals danger to the immune system through the zzso for advanced zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of the above receptors results in the zzso of growth, zzso and zzso factors that contribute to chronic zzso In this study, we suggest that apart from the zzso of signal zzso pathways by the zzso of zzso the indirect zzso of cell cycle regulators zzso as zzso and zzso zzso zzso may also cause an increase in cell growth and zzso zzso zzso have increasingly been implicated in regulating the zzso progression of zzso zzso and zzso have been found to be zzso in human zzso zzso zzso They are involved in cell proliferation through the zzso of the cell cycle regulator, zzso in human zzso zzso In this study, we show that zzso increases the expression of zzso and zzso in primary cultures of excised zzso zzso and in an established zzso cancer cell line zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso caused by zzso is associated with an increase in zzso scores, namely cell growth and zzso
