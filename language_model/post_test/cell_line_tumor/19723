zzso of virus replication by means of zzso interference has been reported for several important human zzso including human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso interference against these pathogens has been accomplished by introduction of zzso synthetic small interfering zzso zzso or DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Their use as therapeutic zzso against zzso is zzso because of the emergence of viral escape zzso In order to solve this durability problem, we tested DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for their ability to inhibit zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells may result in the synthesis of many zzso targeting different viral zzso thus providing more potent zzso and reducing the chance of viral zzso The zzso zzso were compared with in zzso zzso zzso zzso and a DNA construct zzso an effective zzso zzso for their ability to inhibit zzso production in zzso Our results show that DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso are capable of zzso zzso production in a zzso manner, without inducing the class I zzso zzso
