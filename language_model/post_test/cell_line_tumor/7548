zzso stress is implicated in the zzso of various neurodegenerative diseases including Parkinson's disease zzso zzso zzso is a small zzso compound isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and has been reported to have beneficial zzso including zzso zzso and zzso activities, with a relatively low toxicity to normal zzso zzso therefore, investigated the zzso activity of zzso against the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of human zzso zzso cells with zzso but not with another zzso zzso compound, zzso acid, zzso improved the survival of zzso zzso Although zzso did not reduce zzso zzso oxygen species in the zzso system, it promoted the zzso of zzso to the nucleus, activated the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso synthesis in the zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso but not zzso IX, a zzso zzso zzso or zzso an 

zzso zzso 1 zzso abolished the protective effect of zzso against zzso Furthermore, zzso activated zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso zzso diminished zzso zzso synthesis and protection against zzso These results suggest that zzso activates the zzso zzso through zzso and improves survival of zzso cells against zzso zzso
