Increased zzso stress has been linked to zzso zzso In this paper, we investigate whether zzso DNA damage and DNA repair differ in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso formation was zzso by zzso in 46 zzso 52 zzso and 18 normal zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of DNA repair genes zzso zzso Y zzso zzso and zzso III zzso was zzso by real-time zzso in 19 zzso 25 zzso and 19 zzso zzso and repair of zzso DNA damage were studied in rat zzso cells after zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of DNA damage checkpoints zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso family, member X zzso zzso and proliferation index zzso were zzso in 28 zzso and 24 zzso zzso Increased nuclear and zzso zzso formation was detected in zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso formation was found to reflect zzso zzso zzso zzso of DNA repair zzso was detected in zzso compared with zzso In zzso experiments mirrored the findings in zzso with zzso zzso DNA checkpoint zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells, an effect that, however, was zzso after 24 zzso Further analysis of zzso zzso showed decreased zzso DNA damage, sustained checkpoint zzso and decreased proliferation in zzso vs zzso zzso Our data suggest a zzso scenario of accumulating zzso zzso damage in zzso vs zzso zzso damage and repair in zzso Furthermore, this study provides the first evidence for differences in zzso stress zzso in zzso zzso with possible implications for therapeutic response and zzso zzso
