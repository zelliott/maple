zzso zzso composed of zzso and zzso zzso has diverse functions in regulating immune systems, enhancing zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated whether forced expression of the zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso cancer cells zzso produced zzso effects in zzso zzso growth of zzso cells expressing zzso zzso in mice was retarded compared with parental and zzso zzso tumors and survival of the mice zzso with zzso cells was zzso Expressions of the zzso T cells and zzso T cells were zzso not only in zzso tumor specimens but also in zzso cells of mice zzso with zzso as compared with those of mice zzso with parental or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso T zzso zzso activity of zzso cells from mice zzso with zzso was also significantly higher than the other two zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso cells of mice bearing zzso tumors were increased while zzso zzso zzso was negative zzso Moreover, we have identified that the quantity of DC in zzso cells of mice bearing zzso tumors was increased as compared with those mice bearing parental or zzso zzso zzso
