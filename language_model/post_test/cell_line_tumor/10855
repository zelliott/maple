zzso zzso zzso zzso is a well-known clinical surrogate zzso A high activity of zzso is associated with a poor prognosis in different tumor zzso Here we demonstrate by a gene zzso approach that zzso is critical for in zzso but not in zzso growth of zzso colon zzso zzso We provide evidence that the suppression of the zzso gene leads to an increased level of zzso zzso factor zzso zzso but in consequence not to an increase of zzso regulated proteins such as zzso zzso IX zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso zzso zzso in cell cultures and tumor zzso This effect is independent of zzso activity in zzso We conclude that zzso has an influence on the activity of zzso and thus on the adaptation of cells to a hypoxic tumor zzso in zzso colon zzso We suggest the use of zzso as a potential therapeutic target for zzso zzso
