The present paper describes the chemical synthesis and in zzso characterization of a novel, zzso fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso The three-step synthesis was carried out starting from zzso After zzso with calcium oxide, the zzso group was zzso with zzso and the resulting compound was reacted with zzso zzso yielding the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso as well as of its precursors with zzso was determined in cell culture zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity of the zzso were comparable to that of the parent zzso Even after attachment of the bulky zzso zzso considerable zzso activity was zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso of the zzso was almost confined to the zzso of steroid hormone zzso cells, whereas the zzso of steroid hormone zzso cells remained zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report on a fluorescent zzso for zzso suitable for studies in living zzso It is proposed that the present fluorescent zzso zzso might serve as a lead compound for the development of contrast agents for zzso imaging, zzso by zzso optical zzso
