zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso several members of the zzso growth factor zzso family of zzso and the type I zzso zzso zzso and enhanced zzso protein levels correlate with shorter zzso survival of patients with zzso In this study, we investigated the effects of zzso on cell proliferation and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso before and after zzso of zzso signaling in 4 pancreatic cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso Signaling was blocked by infecting the cells with an zzso zzso zzso for a truncated zzso zzso zzso enhanced the growth of all 4 cell lines and activated zzso in 3 of these cell zzso zzso with the zzso virus resulted in abundant expression of the truncated zzso at the zzso and protein level, markedly attenuated zzso proliferation in all 4 tested cell lines, and decreased zzso zzso zzso in the 3 cell lines in which zzso activated this zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso in multiple pancreatic cancer cells can be efficiently blocked with an zzso zzso zzso a truncated zzso raising the possibility that zzso may ultimately have a therapeutic role in zzso
