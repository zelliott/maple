zzso cancer is one of the most zzso tumors with high mortality and poor prognosis even with the aggressive conventional zzso zzso based on the understanding of zzso mechanism is ongoing to improve the outcomes of cancer zzso We sought here to evaluate the therapeutic potential of a zzso zzso zzso in pancreatic zzso We found that zzso was differently expressed in a series of pancreatic zzso zzso cancer cell lines, and zzso expression of zzso zzso in these cells resulted in massive zzso zzso was more potent than zzso in suppressing growth of cancer zzso zzso and Western zzso revealed that zzso zzso was expressed 6 h after zzso zzso Furthermore, we assessed the efficacy of zzso combining zzso drugs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in these pancreatic cancer cell zzso Data revealed that zzso significantly zzso pancreatic zzso cell lines to zzso which may be resulted from abundant zzso zzso In nude mice with zzso zzso zzso treatment significantly inhibited the tumor zzso These results suggest that zzso is a potent molecular tool in suppressing tumor growth zzso pancreatic zzso cells to chemical zzso zzso plays roles in zzso regulating cancer cell growth and may be a promising tool for cancer zzso with or without combination with zzso zzso
