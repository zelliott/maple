Women with zzso breast zzso have poor zzso and many are resistant to the zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso of zzso tumors also express zzso an zzso terminally truncated zzso that has zzso zzso Because zzso cannot bind to zzso but should be responsive to the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso we compared the sensitivity of tumors expressing zzso and tumors expressing the full-length zzso zzso to these zzso 

zzso and zzso breast cancer cells were zzso zzso with either full-length zzso or zzso We studied the effects of zzso and zzso on zzso zzso cell zzso and the growth of zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso was developed to study the association between zzso expression and sensitivity to zzso in patients with advanced breast zzso All statistical tests were zzso 

Treatment of zzso cells with zzso inhibited zzso zzso reduced downstream zzso of zzso and zzso protein zzso inhibited cell growth zzso zzso zzso versus control, mean growth zzso zzso zzso versus zzso difference zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus control, mean growth zzso zzso zzso versus zzso difference zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and inhibited growth of zzso zzso tumors zzso versus control, mean zzso zzso versus 435 zzso difference zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso P zzso zzso By contrast, treatment with zzso had no effect on any of these zzso Of 46 patients with zzso breast cancer who were treated with zzso only one of nine patients zzso expressing zzso responded to zzso (with a partial zzso whereas 19 of the 37 patients zzso with tumors expressing full-length zzso achieved either a complete (five zzso or a partial zzso zzso response zzso zzso zzso 

Breast tumors that express zzso are resistant to zzso and may require alternative or additional zzso zzso
