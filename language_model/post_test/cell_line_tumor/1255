zzso zzso involving the zzso gene zzso as a result of marked zzso instability, is the hallmark of human multiple myeloma zzso zzso Since zzso plays a key role in the zzso zzso zzso system, we investigated whether zzso zzso contributes to this genetic instability by examining its status in 16 zzso cell zzso Our study demonstrated a lack of zzso zzso at the zzso zzso and gene level in 15 out of the 16 cell zzso Only the zzso cell line carried a zzso zzso of zzso in one zzso of the zzso Six zzso samples derived from myeloma patients also did not show any zzso zzso zzso in terms of zzso zzso zzso zzso is unlikely to be involved in zzso in disagreement with a previous study reporting frequent presence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso with reduced DNA binding activity in zzso zzso
