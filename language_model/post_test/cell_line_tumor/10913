The members of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso family are over expressed in a variety of zzso and are frequently linked to aggressive disease and a poor zzso Although clinically effective zzso zzso zzso have been developed to target zzso and zzso the remaining two family members, zzso and zzso have not been the subject of significant zzso In this paper, we have taken the initial steps required to generate zzso with potential clinically utility that target the members of the zzso zzso The genes for the zzso zzso zzso of all four members of the zzso family were cloned and used to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso quantities of each zzso were produced and zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso were then employed as targets for the selection of zzso from zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso display zzso Six unique zzso clones were isolated that bound specifically to zzso 13 unique clones were isolated with specificity for zzso and 52 unique zzso clones were zzso These zzso provide a valuable and potentially clinically relevant panel of agents to target the members of the zzso zzso
