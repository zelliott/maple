zzso cell zzso zzso is one of the most zzso zzso zzso with a variable course of zzso Although zzso is the hallmark of zzso resulting in zzso D1 zzso zzso in zzso of patients, this is difficult to validate by zzso We zzso that zzso could be a robust molecular zzso for zzso 

We have developed very sensitive and specific zzso zzso employing a zzso specific zzso primer to circumvent contamination from zzso caused by the zzso nature of zzso 

We found a significant difference between the expression levels of zzso in patients with zzso at diagnosis zzso zzso zzso and in healthy donors zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso expression of very low levels close to the zzso sensitivity was detected in only 2 of 18 healthy donors, while low levels of zzso expression was observed in all blood and 12 of 13 zzso samples within the defined detection limit of zzso zzso zzso In zzso experiments of the zzso zzso cell line into zzso cells from normal zzso the sensitivity of the zzso zzso was found to be 2 zzso zzso , while the sensitivity of the zzso zzso was estimated to 2 zzso zzso because of the normal background zzso In zzso sampling from patients with zzso the minimal residual disease zzso values based on the zzso expression mirrored the clinical disease zzso 

This zzso zzso zzso could be a useful tool for zzso monitoring in patients with zzso
