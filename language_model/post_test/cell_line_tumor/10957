zzso the zzso zzso in tomatoes and zzso foods, is reported to protect against various zzso especially prostate zzso We investigated the effect of lycopene on DNA damage and cell growth zzso in the zzso human zzso cell zzso zzso was analyzed by zzso and cell proliferation was determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso A final lycopene concentration of zzso zzso was added to cells zzso in zzso zzso After a 24-hr zzso cell viability was measured as zzso at zzso zzso after the zzso zzso The effects of lycopene on cell cycle progression were investigated with flow zzso zzso induced zzso arrest and S phase zzso zzso DNA damage was determined by the zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso inhibited cell growth in a zzso zzso Cell growth was inhibited zzso at zzso zzso lycopene and zzso at 50 zzso lycopene after a 24-hr zzso In the zzso zzso zzso cells showed less DNA damage than did zzso zzso The zzso of zzso cell growth in this study demonstrates the zzso properties of zzso
