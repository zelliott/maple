To understand the molecular response of tumor cells to therapeutic zzso radiation zzso we previously reported that human breast cancer cells derived following chronic exposure to zzso zzso radiation zzso showed a transient zzso zzso cells also demonstrated increased activity of zzso increased expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased expression of a cell cycle regulatory protein zzso zzso The present studies were designed to determine the relationship of zzso zzso and zzso B1 expression in cellular zzso responses to zzso zzso 

The first zzso of the zzso B1 gene with a putative zzso element was cloned into the zzso zzso reporter zzso zzso and control zzso zzso activities were determined in zzso and zzso cells treated with a single dose of radiation, over expression of the dominant negative zzso zzso zzso or over expression of the zzso zzso 

zzso cells derived from zzso zzso demonstrated increased zzso of the zzso and zzso controlled reporter activities, relative to the parental cell zzso zzso of dominant negative zzso zzso that zzso zzso nuclear zzso inhibited zzso and zzso activity, indicating the zzso dependence of zzso zzso zzso In addition, over expression of the human zzso gene zzso inhibited zzso and zzso activity, indicating that zzso or some species derived from zzso may have participated in the zzso of reporter activity in response to chronic exposure to zzso zzso zzso These results provide evidence suggesting that a signaling zzso involving zzso and zzso B1 may contribute to zzso zzso induced by chronic exposure to zzso zzso and support the conclusion that zzso appears to be a negative regulator of this zzso
