Despite extensive zzso evaluation in several experimental models, no studies have determined the effect of zzso and its zzso zzso on zzso zzso a model which mimics the zzso of solid zzso The principal aim of the present study was to investigate the in zzso zzso of zzso and its zzso zzso on zzso breast cancer cells growing as zzso or zzso zzso and to evaluate the influence of the length of exposure on the zzso effect of both zzso zzso was evaluated on zzso and zzso cultures exposed to zzso and zzso zzso zzso for 24 h or treated for 6, 12, 24 and 48 h to 100 zzso of both zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso respectively, on zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso effects of 100 zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso was characterized by a marked zzso which was less evident on zzso growing as zzso In conclusion, the present experimental data zzso for the first time, that zzso and zzso have significant zzso activity against zzso zzso comparable to the zzso effects on zzso zzso In contrast, zzso displayed substantial resistance after short exposure times that was not present in the two zzso zzso
