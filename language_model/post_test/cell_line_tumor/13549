Nuclear Factor zzso B zzso is a key zzso of normal immune response but contributes to aggressive cancer cell zzso when zzso zzso Here we present evidence that the zzso of Growth 4 zzso tumor zzso zzso regulates zzso in breast zzso We surveyed primary breast tumor samples for zzso protein expression using tissue zzso and a newly generated zzso We found that zzso of tumors expressed zzso to low levels of the zzso protein zzso zzso with low zzso expression were frequently large in size, high grade, and zzso zzso positive, suggesting that zzso of zzso may contribute to breast cancer zzso In the same tumor set, we found that low zzso expression correlated with high levels of nuclear zzso zzso zzso an activated form of zzso zzso Fifty seven percent of zzso tumors were zzso zzso indicating a high zzso tendency of these zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso inhibited zzso zzso in zzso and zzso breast cancer zzso In addition, zzso suppressed zzso cell invasion and zzso gene expression in zzso cells, indicating that zzso inhibited zzso activity in breast cancer zzso zzso of the zzso function in the regulation of zzso gene zzso we found that zzso expression levels zzso correlated with the expression of zzso genes in primary breast tumors by analyzing public gene expression zzso Moreover, low zzso expression or high expression of the gene signature composed of a subset of zzso zzso genes was associated with reduced zzso survival in breast cancer zzso Taken together, we conclude that zzso zzso regulates zzso in breast zzso zzso zzso of zzso leads to zzso of zzso contributing to tumor progression and reduced zzso patient survival in breast zzso
