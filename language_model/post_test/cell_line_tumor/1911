zzso is the principal molecular goal of zzso for effective zzso zzso We studied the effect of 50% zzso extracts of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso and zzso induction for human zzso zzso cells, and explored the mode of action using zzso zzso The number of viable zzso cells in zzso was decreased in a zzso manner by all tested compounds, although potency differed between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the extract of zzso zzso exhibited relatively lower zzso values zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and higher selectivity zzso zzso than the extract of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso selective zzso on the zzso zzso All three compounds significantly induced zzso through the late stage - seen by the indicative DNA zzso - with the most effective being zzso then the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that all three compounds raised the intensity of the zzso sheet - higher than that of the zzso zzso cells - corresponding to a shift in the zzso band associated with an zzso in the secondary structure of the protein band, confirming induction of zzso via zzso zzso The differences in intensity of the zzso bands associated with zzso proteins and zzso acids were responsible for discrimination of the zzso mode of action of each of the three zzso The zzso data suggest that the two plant extracts possessed zzso activity with a different mode of action than zzso
