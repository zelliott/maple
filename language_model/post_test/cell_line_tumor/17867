The presence of zzso channels has been described in a number of healthy and zzso transformed cells, showing mainly zzso distribution with relatively insignificant zzso of the cell surface zzso In this work, zzso and molecular biology methods were zzso to establish the zzso zzso whose zzso expression accounts for this strong zzso zzso using cultured melanoma and zzso zzso Before the zzso experiments, the presence of zzso zzso was also confirmed in melanoma zzso zzso of the results of the zzso and zzso zzso indicated that the zzso channel zzso were strongly expressed by zzso in both investigated cell zzso Moreover, prominent zzso expression of zzso could also be demonstrated in zzso sections excised from the human zzso These results indicate that zzso channels are present in the zzso in both zzso transformed and healthy cells, suggesting that they might have roles in ensuring zzso zzso
