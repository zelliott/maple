zzso of zzso occurs commonly in zzso We report that zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso by a zzso zzso zzso led to decreased tumor mass and decreased levels of zzso protein without affecting levels of zzso zzso zzso with these zzso zzso zzso in zzso human zzso cell lines resulted in decreased levels of zzso protein without affecting levels of zzso zzso and caused decreased proliferation and increased zzso To clarify the importance of zzso as a target of zzso zzso zzso we zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sites into human zzso cells with no zzso expression of zzso In contrast to zzso zzso the zzso zzso proteins were stabilized and were resistant to the zzso effects of zzso zzso Our results show the importance of zzso as a therapeutic target in established tumors in zzso offer a zzso rationale to test zzso zzso in zzso zzso and represent a therapeutic approach zzso to a broad range of zzso in which zzso factors are stabilized through a zzso zzso
