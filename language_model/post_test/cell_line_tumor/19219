zzso in zzso hosts may behave as particulate zzso able to activate the innate immune system and generate zzso zzso zzso cells zzso play a key role in the initiation of the immune response, mainly by zzso T zzso zzso For this reason, they are increasingly applied as an zzso for effective zzso therapies in animal models as well as in a few clinical zzso The presented study focused on the application of mouse zzso which were activated with T4 zzso zzso zzso zzso and further loaded with tumor zzso zzso in inducing an zzso zzso The zzso of bone zzso zzso with T4 zzso and zzso resulted in zzso of their differentiation marker expression accompanied by an enhanced ability to prime T cells for zzso zzso These activated zzso zzso were used in experimental zzso of zzso mice bearing advanced zzso colon zzso zzso As a result of their triple application, a significant tumor growth zzso up to 19 days, was observed compared with the controls - treated with zzso activated only with T4 zzso zzso or zzso solution zzso where the tumor growth delay did not exceed 7 zzso The percentage of tumor growth zzso estimated 10 days after the third cell injection ranged from zzso (for animals treated with zzso zzso to zzso (for animals treated with zzso zzso over the zzso zzso control zzso The obtained data indicate that in zzso interactions between T4 zzso and zzso followed by zzso zzso caused zzso of the zzso effect when zzso were used as a vaccine for zzso mice zzso zzso zzso of zzso with the zzso may be considered as a beneficial element of a novel strategy in zzso zzso
