We report here the synthesis and evaluation for zzso and zzso DNA binding properties of several zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso and 7- zzso The ability of these compounds to interact with and zzso an zzso zzso DNA against increases in temperature was evaluated by a zzso zzso melting zzso The resulting zzso values were found to correlate with their potency for zzso zzso as measured in an in zzso zzso zzso zzso The interactions of a number of compounds with a zzso DNA molecular structure were simulated by molecular zzso zzso It is concluded that this class of compound represents a new chemical type suitable for further development as zzso zzso
