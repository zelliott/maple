The growth of human breast tumor cells is regulated through signaling involving cell surface growth factor receptors and nuclear receptors of the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso acid receptors zzso members of the zzso hormone zzso gene family, are zzso zzso factors, which have in zzso and in zzso growth zzso activity against breast cancer zzso zzso inhibit the proliferation of many human breast cancer cell lines, particularly those whose growth is zzso by zzso zzso or growth zzso Additionally, zzso and synthetic zzso such as zzso have been shown to induce zzso in zzso breast cells but not normal breast zzso To better define the genes involved in zzso growth zzso of breast cancer cells, we used zzso zzso analysis to create a database of genes that are potentially regulated by zzso in breast cancer zzso We found that zzso zzso cell death zzso a tumor zzso gene presently being evaluated as a target for zzso was induced about zzso by the zzso zzso zzso in zzso breast cancer zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso X receptors zzso stimulate the expression of zzso in a wide variety of zzso breast cancer cell zzso zzso did not induce zzso expression in breast cancer cell lines, which were not growth inhibited by zzso We also observed that zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso also induced zzso expression in zzso cells, suggesting that zzso may play a central role in growth zzso in breast cancer zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells resulted in zzso death, suggesting a role for zzso in zzso zzso in breast cancer zzso zzso protein expression has previously been reported in small zzso zzso of normal zzso To date, there has been no report of induction of zzso expression by zzso zzso or zzso zzso in breast cancer cells and its potential role in zzso in these zzso
