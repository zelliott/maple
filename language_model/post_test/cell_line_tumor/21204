zzso of specific zzso zzso are attractive lead compounds for development of targeted zzso for many tumors, including zzso We asked whether zzso of specific zzso zzso would decrease the zzso colony formation, and/or zzso by human zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso inhibitor reduced zzso of all five cell lines by 50% to zzso In contrast, an zzso inhibitor zzso reduced zzso by zzso in zzso cells and a met inhibitor zzso reduced zzso by zzso in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and met reduced colony formation by more than zzso in all tested cell lines zzso zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor reduced zzso by zzso in zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor increased zzso of zzso and zzso cells without affecting colony formation or zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso did not affect zzso zzso or colony zzso These results support the hypothesis that specific zzso zzso regulate zzso and/or zzso in zzso
