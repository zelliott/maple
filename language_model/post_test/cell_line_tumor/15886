As an in zzso model for type II human lung cancer, zzso cells resist zzso via zzso of proteins as demonstrated by many zzso However, to date, no large-scale zzso investigation has been conducted on zzso Here, we performed a zzso analysis of the zzso of zzso by using mass zzso zzso zzso This investigation led to the identification of 337 zzso sites on 181 zzso Among them, 67 zzso and 230 zzso sites identified appeared to be novel with no previous characterization in lung zzso Based on their known functions as reported in the literature, these zzso were functionally organized into highly interconnected zzso Western zzso and zzso analyses were performed to validate the expression of a bottleneck zzso zzso in cancer cell lines and zzso This zzso provides a valuable resource for further studies on zzso and lung zzso
