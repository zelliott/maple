zzso is an zzso preserved degradation process of zzso cellular constituents and plays important zzso roles in human health and zzso It has been proposed that zzso plays an important role both in tumor progression and in promotion of cancer cell death, although the molecular mechanisms responsible for this dual action of zzso in cancer have not been zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the most aggressive human zzso with zzso five-year survival zzso Its poor prognosis has been attributed to the lack of specific symptoms and early detection tools, and its relatively zzso to traditional zzso agents and zzso Experimental evidence pointed at zzso as a pancreatic cancer cell mechanism to survive under adverse environmental conditions, or as a defective programmed cell death mechanism that favors pancreatic cancer cell resistance to zzso Here, we consider several zzso zzso that have been related to increase or decrease the zzso process in pancreatic tumor zzso We specially review zzso as a cell death mechanism in response to zzso zzso
