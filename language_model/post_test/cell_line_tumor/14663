This paper describes a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso platform for quantitative zzso profiling in breast cancer zzso zzso profiling via zzso was examined for four breast cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso device enabled 20 zzso zzso on a biological zzso at the same time and a zzso decrease in time consumption, and could be used to zzso compare the expression level of each zzso The zzso zzso from the zzso system showed an accurate zzso of protein and comparable quality to that of the conventional zzso zzso Although zzso and zzso cell lines were classified by zzso zzso and zzso and were derived from the same patient, weak zzso expression was seen only in zzso The zzso cell line showed a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and showed only zzso 5 zzso a representative zzso cell zzso To demonstrate the zzso of the system to clinical samples for zzso zzso we were also able to apply this platform to human breast cancer zzso This result indicates that the zzso zzso platform is useful for accurate zzso diagnoses using numerous specific zzso zzso zzso the zzso of cancer zzso
