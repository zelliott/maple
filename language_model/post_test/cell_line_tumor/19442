Some of zzso proteins and the zzso family of zzso factors are involved in zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso and zzso genes were expressed in zzso zzso zzso cells and their levels decreased during zzso differentiation into zzso zzso zzso bound to the zzso domain of zzso through a region encompassing the zzso part of the zzso and the most zzso region and enhanced the zzso activity of zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso cells resulted in the suppression of zzso gene zzso In zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso which also zzso the differentiation of zzso cells, no synergistic effect on the suppression of zzso gene expression was zzso However, in the presence of zzso the expression levels of the zzso gene in the cells zzso zzso and zzso were, unexpectedly, higher than those in the cells zzso zzso zzso The levels of zzso protein were markedly decreased despite that the levels of zzso were preserved in the cells zzso zzso and zzso It was, thus, suggested that although zzso zzso regulates the differentiation of zzso cells into zzso cells, it zzso zzso possibly by zzso of zzso protein in the presence of a differentiation zzso
