zzso are specialized zzso structures at zzso ends that undergo dynamic changes after each cell zzso zzso the mechanisms of zzso dynamics is critically dependent on the ability to accurately measure zzso length in a cell population of zzso zzso such as Southern zzso which measures average zzso zzso and quantitative zzso in zzso zzso zzso which can estimate zzso length in individual zzso are limited in their capacity to determine the distribution of cells with differing zzso lengths in a given cell zzso 

We employed zzso to determine whether mouse and human cell lines exhibit zzso of cells with differing zzso zzso 

Our analysis showed that at least one of four analyzed mouse cell lines had two zzso of cells with differing zzso zzso zzso in zzso length between zzso of cells were zzso and we term this phenomenon zzso zzso zzso zzso in Cell zzso We also observed zzso in 1 of 19 analyzed human zzso lengthening of zzso cell lines and in 1 of 2 analyzed human alternative lengthening of zzso cell zzso The existence of cell zzso with differing zzso lengths was confirmed by zzso 

Our results underscore the importance of zzso in zzso length zzso
