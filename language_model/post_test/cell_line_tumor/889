In the present study, we investigated the relation between zzso expression and the sensitivity of zzso germ cell tumor zzso cells to zzso zzso Despite similar zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso cell lines Tera and zzso expressed low zzso protein and zzso levels in comparison to zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso of the zzso complex with zzso increased zzso protein levels in zzso cells but much more in zzso cells, whereas zzso had no additional effect on zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso activity in zzso cells with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso had no effect on zzso levels and also not upon zzso zzso A similar induction of zzso zzso in contrast to zzso substantially increased both zzso zzso and protein expression in Tera zzso zzso Tera cells expressing low zzso protein levels were zzso while zzso zzso which was mainly localized in the zzso rendered zzso Tera cells resistant to zzso zzso zzso of zzso Tera cells to zzso zzso was restored by short interfering zzso suppression of zzso zzso These results strongly indicate that the low zzso protein levels are caused by reduced zzso gene zzso and sensitize zzso zzso cells to the zzso death zzso
