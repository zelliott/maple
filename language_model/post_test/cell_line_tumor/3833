zzso zzso lifetime zzso zzso provides a direct measurement of the free volume void sizes in zzso and biological zzso This free volume is critical in explaining and understanding physical and mechanical properties of zzso Moreover, zzso has been recently proposed as a potential tool in detecting cancer at early zzso probing the differences in the zzso scale free volume voids between zzso skin samples of the same zzso Despite several investigations on free volume in complex zzso zzso no zzso zzso studies of living cancer cell cultures have been zzso We demonstrate that zzso can be applied to the study in human living zzso cell zzso The technique is also capable to detect atomic scale changes in the size of the free volume voids due to the biological responses to zzso zzso may be developed to characterize the effect of different culture conditions in the free volume voids of cells grown in zzso
