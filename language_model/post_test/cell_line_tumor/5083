zzso include three major zzso Although the role of zzso in melanoma is well established, little is known about zzso We studied effects of zzso zzso in zzso and assessed expression of zzso in a large cohort of zzso and zzso 

Using specific zzso we knocked down zzso zzso and determined the effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in seven melanoma cell zzso We determined the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and studied the effects of zzso on cell zzso Using an automated method to measure in zzso protein zzso we zzso zzso expression in 263 zzso and 523 zzso 

zzso was knocked down in three cell lines with zzso zzso resulting in decreased viability in two of the three zzso and zzso This resulted in decreased zzso expression and zzso zzso without affecting zzso and zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso protein zzso signaling without zzso and zzso zzso zzso was highly expressed in zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso and no zzso had high zzso zzso zzso expression was higher in zzso than primary specimens zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso results in decreased viability of zzso zzso and zzso zzso melanoma cells, likely zzso by zzso zzso rather than zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and parallel pathways might be an effective therapeutic approach for zzso zzso expression is zzso in a subset of zzso but not in zzso suggesting that it might be a valuable diagnostic marker and therapeutic zzso
