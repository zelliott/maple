Cross talk between unrelated cell surface zzso such as zzso receptors zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is a crucial signaling mechanism to expand the cellular communication zzso We investigated the ability of the zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso to zzso the zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso in zzso zzso We observed that stimulation with zzso an zzso zzso isolated by screening synthetic zzso libraries, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso generation, and zzso zzso zzso As a result of zzso zzso zzso zzso provide zzso sites for recruitment and triggering of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is prevented by the zzso zzso zzso by zzso toxin zzso and by the zzso inhibitor zzso The critical role of zzso zzso generation in this zzso mechanism is zzso by the finding that zzso or a zzso against zzso prevents zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso promotes zzso cell growth, which is prevented by zzso and by zzso These results highlight the role of zzso as a potential target of new drugs and suggest that targeting both zzso and zzso may yield superior therapeutic effects compared with targeting either zzso zzso
