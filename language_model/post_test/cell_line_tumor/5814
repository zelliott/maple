Lung cancer is the most common cause of zzso mortality zzso Here, we report elevated expression of zzso zzso 2 zzso in primary human lung tumors and in zzso cell lung cancer cells that express low levels of zzso zzso factor zzso protein alpha zzso In approximately zzso of cases, elevated zzso expression resulted from gene zzso zzso zzso was found to inhibit cell proliferation and in zzso tumor zzso In addition, zzso zzso led to zzso changes similar to zzso zzso and correlated with increased expression and activity of zzso zzso regulation of zzso was found to occur through the association of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso Together, these data identify zzso as a potential driver of lung zzso through a mechanism that involves zzso of zzso
