zzso regulation of DNA damage response is crucial for cellular survival after DNA damage, and its zzso often results in zzso instability in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso forms nuclear zzso at sites of DNA damage and zzso DNA damage response and zzso zzso zzso are short, zzso zzso zzso which zzso regulate gene expression by zzso translation of and/or degrading zzso How zzso zzso DNA damage response is largely zzso In this study, we developed a zzso screening zzso using zzso radiation zzso zzso zzso formation in a human zzso cell line, zzso as the zzso By screening a library of human zzso zzso we identified several zzso that inhibited zzso zzso zzso Among them, zzso directly targeted the zzso zzso zzso region, reduced zzso zzso zzso and induced zzso instability after DNA zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso zzso and enhanced cellular sensitivity to multiple zzso agents zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells attenuated zzso zzso to zzso and zzso Our study suggests that zzso is an important regulator of zzso stability and a potential therapeutic agent to improve the efficacy of zzso and chemotherapy with zzso zzso
