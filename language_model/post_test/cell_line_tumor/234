zzso expression of zzso zzso has been detected in cancer, suggesting that these small zzso zzso can act as zzso or tumor zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by real-time quantitative zzso in a panel of zzso cultures and melanoma cell lines and explored the possible role of zzso in melanoma cell proliferation and zzso The analyzed zzso were selected on the basis of previous studies strongly supporting their involvement in cancer development and/or zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in the majority of melanoma cell lines with respect to zzso zzso expression of zzso significantly inhibited proliferation in 12 of 13 melanoma cell lines with reduced levels of this zzso and induced zzso in 4 out of 4 cell lines zzso In conclusion, our data further support the finding of altered zzso expression in melanoma cells and establish for the first time that zzso is a negative regulator of melanoma cell proliferation and zzso
