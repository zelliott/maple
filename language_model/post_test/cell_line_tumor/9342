Type I zzso growth factor zzso zzso which is frequently zzso in a variety of human zzso including lung cancer, mediates cancer cell proliferation and tumor zzso In this study, we used a human zzso zzso zzso approach to induce hairpin zzso zzso zzso to silence zzso gene expression in the human lung cancer cell line zzso and then evaluate its effects on zzso zzso gene zzso and the growth of tumor cells in zzso and in nude zzso zzso expression levels were found to markedly decrease in cells zzso with a zzso expressing hairpin zzso for zzso (by more than zzso zzso of zzso zzso accompanied reduction of zzso as well as zzso and zzso levels, zzso of zzso zzso and growth zzso of zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso injections of zzso DNA expressing zzso for zzso significantly zzso zzso tumors in nude zzso Our results support the therapeutic potential of zzso as a method for gene therapy in treating lung zzso
