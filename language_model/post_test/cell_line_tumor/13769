zzso zzso cancer zzso is the fifth most common cause of cancer death among zzso Despite its zzso effective zzso responses are zzso due, in part, to the presence of zzso box protein zzso zzso T regulatory zzso cells in the tumor zzso However, the mechanisms that regulate the zzso and the zzso function of these zzso zzso cells are poorly zzso Here, we found that the majority of zzso zzso cells accumulating in the tumor zzso of zzso belong to the subset of zzso zzso cells expressing zzso zzso zzso The expansion and the zzso function of these cells were strictly dependent on zzso zzso provided by tumor zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were found to zzso in close vicinity of tumor zzso and their number directly correlated with the numbers of zzso in the zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells were found to be strong zzso for disease progression in patients with zzso cancer, with zzso zzso cell subset being a stronger predictor than total zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest an essential role for zzso and zzso in zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso cells, leading to tumor progression in zzso zzso
