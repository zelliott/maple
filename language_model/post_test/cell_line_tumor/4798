zzso an zzso zzso isolated from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso lung or liver colonization of melanoma cells in a mouse zzso In this study, zzso migration and in zzso wound closure zzso were used to determine the effect of zzso on the migration of melanoma zzso zzso significantly impaired the migration of five human melanoma cell zzso Furthermore, it specifically inhibited cell migration on zzso in a zzso manner, but not that on collagen IV or zzso In contrast, zzso was found to have no effect on cell proliferation or zzso These results indicate that the interaction between zzso and melanoma cells may involve zzso zzso that mediate cell zzso zzso to zzso of seven zzso within the zzso loop of zzso and four zzso outside the zzso loop of zzso resulted in significantly less potency in both zzso zzso and wound closure zzso For six of the zzso however, decreased activity was found only in the latter zzso We conclude that a different mechanism and/or zzso is involved in these two cell zzso
