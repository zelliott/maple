The purpose of this study was to investigate the in zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alone and in combination with zzso on the growth and survival of different zzso zzso cancer zzso cell zzso zzso expression was assessed on zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso using zzso labeling and flow zzso The effect of zzso zzso alone or in combination with zzso on the cell lines was studied by zzso colony and zzso zzso Our results indicate that all primary and zzso zzso cell lines tested were positive to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso cell proliferation in a zzso and zzso manner; zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso combined with zzso greatly improved efficiency of cell killing in zzso cells and induced zzso the additive effect of zzso zzso was further confirmed in colony forming zzso and cell death following single or combined treatments was associated with the release of zzso c and increased zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso used either alone, or combined with zzso is an attractive strategy for targeting human zzso
