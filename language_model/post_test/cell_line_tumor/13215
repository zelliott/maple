In pathological conditions, the amount of zzso determines whether a cell can survive or engage a cell death zzso This is exemplified in zzso zzso in which zzso expression is increased, while zzso zzso early onset Parkinson's disease zzso of zzso generally lead to decreased stability and expression of the zzso We have shown previously that zzso is zzso by zzso during induction of zzso We demonstrate here that the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is specifically expressed in the nucleus and promotes zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso In addition, zzso of zzso zzso in different cell lines leads to a loss of zzso potential and zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression with zzso or zzso zzso mimics the effect of zzso zzso on cell growth and zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso zzso increases zzso oxygen species zzso production, and zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso Finally, specific exclusion of zzso zzso from the nucleus abrogates its zzso zzso Taken together, our findings identify an original zzso by which generation of a nuclear zzso of zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso amplification of zzso
