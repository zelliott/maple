Recent studies have revealed that zzso zzso is involved in a variety of biological processes including zzso Here, we report that zzso was significantly zzso in zzso B virus zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines as well as in clinical zzso compared with their corresponding zzso zzso necrosis factor zzso protein 3 zzso a key regulator in inflammation and zzso was found to be zzso correlated with zzso levels and was identified as a target of zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells effectively suppressed zzso expression and zzso DNA replication as well as inhibited cell proliferation and induced zzso We conclude that zzso may play an important role as a tumor zzso zzso in the development and progression of zzso zzso by targeting zzso Thus zzso and zzso represent key diagnostic markers and potential therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of zzso zzso
