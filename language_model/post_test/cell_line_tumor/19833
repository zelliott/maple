Human zzso zzso protein 4) is a novel zzso zzso protein of 120 zzso molecular weight, which is classified as belonging to the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso associates with in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and transient expression of zzso zzso revealed a complete zzso of zzso with the zzso zzso array of zzso zzso We present evidence that the zzso portion of zzso zzso acids zzso is essential for the association with zzso zzso experiments revealed that zzso is zzso on zzso zzso during zzso In addition, zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso is associated with the zzso zzso suggesting that the function of zzso is regulated by zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells led to a significant decrease in the number of zzso In no case zzso figures could be observed in zzso negative zzso zzso Additionally, we observed a significant reduction of the proliferation rate and the zzso of radioactive zzso as a result of zzso zzso Most importantly, zzso negative cells showed a completely modified zzso network, indicating that zzso is necessary for correct zzso zzso
