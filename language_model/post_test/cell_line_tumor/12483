To compare the levels of circulating zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso between zzso mice and healthy controls, in human zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso The secondary objective was to correlate zzso and zzso levels with zzso variables such as zzso volume, weight and zzso indicators of disease zzso 

Two human zzso zzso models were zzso zzso cells were zzso either zzso or beneath the zzso zzso zzso zzso dimensions were recorded and blood samples were taken throughout the experiment, as well as at the end of the experiment, upon which zzso were excised and prepared for zzso zzso All blood samples were zzso by flow zzso 

zzso and zzso levels were significantly elevated in zzso mice compared with healthy zzso In particular, there was a divergence in zzso levels between zzso mice and controls during early zzso in disease, whereas zzso levels were only elevated towards the zzso Additionally, zzso levels correlated with zzso variables such as zzso volume, when zzso volume was zzso zzso and with zzso zzso in certain zzso zzso levels did not correlate significantly with most zzso variables zzso 

In human zzso zzso models, zzso levels showed promise as an zzso zzso in evaluating disease zzso zzso from zzso zzso levels with zzso variables such as zzso volume, weight and zzso suggested that zzso levels were a better zzso indicator during early zzso of zzso zzso zzso levels were elevated in zzso mice compared with zzso however, zzso numbers were small and require further validation in future zzso
