zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and thus promotes energetic switch from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso in zzso cells (a phenomenon known as the zzso zzso for their energy need, which zzso the cancer progression by resisting induction of zzso and promoting tumor zzso Thus, in the present investigation, we explored the molecular mechanisms of the zzso action of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso on cells of a zzso T cell lymphoma, designated as Dalton's zzso zzso In zzso treatment of tumor cells with zzso inhibited their survival accompanied by a zzso of the zzso composition of zzso medium with respect to zzso zzso and zzso zzso treatment also altered expression of zzso and pH zzso zzso and zzso and production of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, we also observed an zzso in the expression of other zzso and cell survival regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The study discusses the role of novel molecular mechanisms underlying zzso zzso of tumor cell zzso This study shows for the first time that zzso zzso of tumor cell survival involves altered pH zzso and zzso zzso Thus, these findings will provide a new insight for therapeutic applications of zzso as a novel zzso agent against T cell zzso
