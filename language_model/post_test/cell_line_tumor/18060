zzso zzso growth factor zzso produced by tumor cells plays a central role in stimulating zzso required for solid tumor zzso zzso zzso inhibit tumor cell line growth in animal models and a humanized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is approved as a treatment for zzso zzso We hypothesized that administration of an zzso zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso zzso equivalent of zzso would suppress human tumor growth in zzso The Ad zzso zzso encodes the light chain and heavy chain zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso that specifically recognizes human zzso with the same zzso site as zzso zzso efficacy in zzso was evaluated with zzso zzso and zzso 145 prostate zzso cells in human tumor cell zzso in zzso zzso For both tumor models, zzso directed the expression of high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso the numbers of zzso zzso and blood vessels in the tumor were significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso tumor growth was suppressed zzso zzso zzso and there was increased survival zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso that is the equivalent of zzso effectively suppresses the growth of human tumors, suggesting gene therapy as an alternative to zzso zzso zzso zzso
