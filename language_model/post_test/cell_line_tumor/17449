As a rule, T cell large zzso zzso zzso leukemia runs a chronic clinical course without need for zzso Some cases, however, progress to an aggressive disease after the zzso clinical zzso The transformation mechanism into a high-grade zzso has not been well zzso We have established 2 leukemia cell lines, zzso and zzso derived from the same clone of zzso zzso leukemia in chronic and aggressive zzso zzso The paired availability of such cell lines is valuable in zzso and genetic investigation of zzso zzso We used a zzso containing zzso zzso to zzso zzso of gene expression between the 2 cell zzso We found a number of genes that were zzso zzso 13 genes with increased expression and 3 genes with reduced expression in zzso cells as compared to zzso zzso Increased expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and reduced expression of the zzso and zzso genes were confirmed by real-time quantitative reverse zzso whose results paralleled the zzso zzso These zzso genes zzso zzso cell surface zzso including molecules related to T cell zzso zzso factors, and a zzso zzso The two zzso genes zzso zzso that play an important role for induction of cell zzso These findings suggest that there is differential gene expression in different clinical zzso of zzso leukemia and these zzso expressed genes would be potential targets for further studies to identify the genes involved in the transformation process of zzso zzso
