The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of activated zzso zzso cell division control protein 42 zzso zzso in zzso cancer cell zzso migration, and zzso 

The zzso active form of zzso zzso or control zzso was zzso in the zzso cancer cell line zzso The zzso of active zzso was monitored by zzso zzso and the effects of active zzso on cell migration and invasion were examined using an attachment zzso a wound healing zzso and a zzso migration zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso revealed that zzso active zzso predominately localized to the plasma zzso Compared to zzso cells zzso with the control zzso zzso of zzso active zzso in zzso cells promoted zzso formation and cell stretch and dramatically enhanced cell zzso to the coated zzso The wound healing zzso revealed a significant increase of migration capability in zzso cells expressing active zzso compared to the control zzso Additionally, the zzso invasion zzso demonstrated that active zzso significantly promoted zzso cell migration through the zzso 

Our results suggest that active zzso zzso zzso can greatly enhance zzso cancer cell zzso to spread, zzso and zzso which may contribute to zzso cancer zzso
