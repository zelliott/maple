We reported that zzso zzso of human gallbladder cancer zzso produced a greater amount of zzso zzso zzso factors, however, only zzso suppressed zzso and tumor growth at the distant site zzso The aim of this study was to confirm the zzso of our previous findings that the site of the primary tumor would influence the zzso in the distant site in a different zzso of human gallbladder cancer zzso The growth rates, zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the plasma level of zzso zzso and zzso in the distant site zzso were estimated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso microscopic observation and zzso window gel zzso for zzso All experiments were performed in severe combined zzso zzso zzso zzso tumors grew faster and were less zzso than zzso zzso zzso vessel zzso vessel density and zzso count in the distant site were significantly decreased in zzso zzso mice compared to those in either zzso or no zzso zzso The plasma level of zzso was significantly elevated in mice bearing zzso tumor as compared with zzso and no zzso zzso zzso at the distant site was inhibited by the zzso zzso of zzso by the greatest amount of zzso zzso The results of the present study together with our previous study imply that the primary tumor zzso is conducive to the zzso at a distant site by the production of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso
