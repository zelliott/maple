zzso based therapy has gained renewed interest in the search for treatment strategies for zzso zzso cell zzso We determined whether radio frequency zzso combined with zzso would induce a tumor specific immune response and serve as an in zzso vaccine against zzso cell zzso 

Mice with zzso zzso tumors were treated with radio frequency zzso combined with zzso radio frequency zzso only, zzso only or no treatment as the zzso zzso was done to determine which cells were present in the tumor after zzso In zzso tumor specific zzso zzso were performed with zzso T and natural killer cells derived from the zzso of treated zzso To study whether treatment could prevent zzso or affect the growth of established zzso we induced lung zzso zzso before or after treatment and subsequently zzso zzso 

The number of natural killer, zzso and zzso T cells was significantly increased in the tumor tissue of radio frequency zzso treated mice zzso zzso Natural killer and zzso T cells showed strong zzso activity in zzso after combination zzso Lung zzso formation was significantly prevented in mice that received combination therapy zzso zzso Lung zzso were significantly smaller after combination treatment zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

Radio frequency zzso of the primary tumor combined with zzso zzso a systemic zzso immune response to zzso cell zzso which is much stronger than that of zzso zzso This effect appears to be zzso by natural killer and zzso T zzso It may have an important role in the development of new zzso strategies for zzso cell zzso
