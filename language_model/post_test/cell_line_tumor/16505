zzso oxygen species zzso are strongly implicated in melanoma development, and treatment with antioxidants has shown efficacy in suppressing zzso transition and zzso Here, we investigated the significance of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a key regulator of zzso zzso for zzso zzso A large set of melanoma cell lines zzso was zzso and higher zzso levels were associated with lower presence of zzso zzso and interestingly also lower rates of cell zzso Moreover, treatment with the zzso zzso efficiently reduced the growth speed of several investigated zzso zzso In addition zzso expression was significantly linked to a prominent set of cellular zzso accounting for the observed lower zzso levels of zzso stress and higher zzso zzso Key attributes defining the zzso zzso of melanoma cells including survival, zzso and switch from zzso to zzso expression were more prominent in cells with lower zzso zzso Our findings were further zzso by observations in zzso in which melanoma cells with lower zzso expression depicted a dramatically stronger tumor zzso Furthermore, zzso significance of zzso expression was investigated in patients zzso with advanced zzso zzso High tumor zzso for zzso was a significant zzso for better zzso overall zzso zzso we show for the first time that zzso may serve a dual role, as a surrogate marker for cellular zzso state as well as zzso potential of melanoma zzso These promising results regarding its zzso significance as well as its potential as a pharmacological target require further in-depth zzso
