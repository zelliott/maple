In this work we analyzed the zzso profiles of chicken zzso cells zzso in response to zzso a pharmacological zzso of the liver X zzso zzso Through an in zzso search for zzso zzso response zzso consensus sequences in the promoter of genes whose expression was shown to be sensitive to zzso we identified a zzso in the promoter of the zzso zzso zzso zzso This motif is highly zzso between zzso We further investigated the regulation of this gene and showed that the expression of zzso was induced both in chicken and human zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso allowed us to locate a functional zzso in the chicken zzso zzso zzso these data evidence for the first time that the chicken zzso gene is a direct target of zzso and therefore suggest a new role for zzso in zzso zzso
