zzso zzso in combination with its synergistic zzso zzso acid maintains a pivotal position in cancer zzso However, clinical limitations such as zzso and zzso zzso persist with the administration of these drugs in zzso and are associated with reduced efficacy and/or quality of life for zzso We have reported earlier on the novel, zzso pH neutral, zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso zzso incorporating zzso zzso maintains potency while overcoming the accepted zzso of zzso and zzso zzso We carried out zzso zzso and zzso and efficacy evaluations of zzso compared with zzso acid using several administration routes and schedules in two zzso zzso These were compared with the zzso sequential administration of zzso zzso zzso showed zzso to zzso acid as assessed by the tissue distribution and zzso studies of zzso but was generally better tolerated as determined by weight loss, zzso and other clinical zzso Compared with zzso acid, zzso was also associated with reduced zzso using a rabbit ear vein zzso Furthermore, using human zzso tumor models in mice, zzso resulted in equivalent or improved efficacy profiles compared with zzso zzso In conclusion, these novel, zzso zzso represent a superior zzso form of zzso that allows zzso of zzso zzso This should translate into improved patient zzso with potential for enhanced zzso
