Recently, many studies have focused on the potential diagnostic value of the promoter zzso of the zzso gene in prostate zzso 

A total of 144 patients, undergoing zzso zzso zzso for a clinically suspected prostate cancer, was zzso Two different tissue samples were collected from the same area of the prostate and then divided for both zzso DNA extraction and pathological zzso In order to perform molecular analysis, zzso tissue samples were zzso with the zzso restriction zzso zzso and then amplified by conventional zzso chain reaction zzso 

zzso cancer was diagnosed in zzso patients, and promoter zzso of zzso gene was detected in zzso of prostate cancer zzso and in zzso of negative specimens zzso A significant association between zzso promoter zzso both with a zzso score zzso zzso exact zzso and the presence of zzso grade 4 and/or grade 5 zzso exact zzso was zzso 

zzso zzso of the zzso gene is a highly zzso not a very zzso of prostate zzso Our data showed a significant association between the zzso status of the zzso gene and zzso score and grade, suggesting a potential zzso value of this zzso DNA zzso
