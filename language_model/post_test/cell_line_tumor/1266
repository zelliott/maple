The G zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in bone zzso zzso and survival of chronic zzso leukemia zzso zzso The function of the zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso remains zzso Here we demonstrate that in zzso and normal B zzso zzso zzso is consistently zzso in contrast to low zzso zzso Similar to the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso and zzso These effects are blocked by specific zzso zzso Their zzso by zzso toxin suggests zzso protein zzso Furthermore, zzso mediates zzso zzso which implicates contribution of zzso to zzso Indeed, zzso zzso induce zzso and reduce viability independent of zzso protein zzso Considering the production of zzso in the bone zzso our data suggest that zzso zzso zzso effects, supports zzso and survival of zzso cells in the bone zzso and thus represents a potential treatment zzso
