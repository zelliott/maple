Cancer stem cells zzso are considered to be of particular concern in cancer as they possess inherent properties of zzso and zzso along with expressing certain genes related to a zzso zzso These features zzso the promotion of zzso recurrence and zzso in cancer zzso Thus, the optimal zzso treatment should target the zzso population, either by killing these cells and/or by inducing their transition to a more differentiated zzso zzso zzso were carried out on the zzso human zzso growth factor zzso zzso breast cancer cell line zzso to unravel the zzso effects of the zzso analogue zzso zzso and of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, effects on the properties of zzso and zzso markers were also zzso Treatment with zzso reduced the zzso zzso of zzso cells by approximately zzso inhibited and/or reduced zzso capability of the zzso population, decreased cell zzso and induced expression of zzso to zzso zzso proteins that are involved in promoting an zzso zzso By contrast, zzso slightly increased the zzso zzso increased cell zzso and the level of zzso zzso zzso treatment reduced the zzso capability of the zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso reduced the expression of the human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso which is correlated to zzso and resistance to zzso in zzso zzso Our findings indicate that treatment with zzso targeted the zzso population by interfering with several stem zzso properties, such as zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso
