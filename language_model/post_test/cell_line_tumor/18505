Lung cancer is highly lethal and resistant to most zzso zzso Treatment resistance is zzso in part, by enhanced expression of cell survival proteins that help facilitate tumor zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein zzso by various zzso triggers in many zzso and zzso treatment resistance when zzso The objectives in this study were to evaluate zzso expression levels in human lung cancer zzso and to test effects of zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso and short interfering zzso zzso zzso on zzso in human lung cancer zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was evaluated in a tissue zzso of 149 spotted human lung zzso The effects of zzso zzso or zzso treatment on zzso expression and zzso to zzso was examined in zzso cells in zzso while the ability of zzso zzso to zzso in zzso was evaluated in zzso mice bearing zzso zzso 

More than zzso of human zzso cell lung zzso are zzso for zzso zzso zzso or zzso decreased zzso zzso expression in zzso cells zzso in a zzso zzso manner, and significantly enhanced zzso to zzso in zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso was observed after combined treatment with zzso plus zzso but not with either agent zzso In zzso administration of zzso zzso compared to mismatch control zzso zzso enhanced the effects of zzso or zzso to significantly delay zzso tumor zzso 

These findings identify zzso as a valid therapeutic target in strategies employing novel zzso therapy for advanced lung zzso
