zzso zzso has been shown to open zzso barrier zzso selectively and to increase zzso of the zzso zzso but the mechanism is zzso This study was performed to determine whether BK opens the zzso by affecting the tight junction zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso In rat brain zzso model and zzso model in zzso we find that the protein expression levels of zzso zzso and zzso are attenuated by BK zzso zzso and zzso zzso show that the attenuated expression of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso is most obvious in the smaller tumor zzso zzso zzso after BK infusion, and there is no change in the larger tumor zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso in brain zzso zzso cells are observed at the same zzso Meanwhile, Evans blue zzso shows that the zzso of zzso increases after BK zzso zzso electron zzso indicates that zzso is opened and that zzso zzso density is zzso zzso electrical resistance zzso and zzso zzso flux zzso also reveal that zzso is opened by BK zzso In addition, zzso and Western zzso zzso reveal a significant decrease in expression levels of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso A zzso of tumor zzso This study demonstrates that the increase of zzso zzso zzso is associated with the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso of zzso and that zzso signal zzso system might be involved in the modulating zzso
