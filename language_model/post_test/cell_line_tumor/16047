In our research on the role of zzso in the zzso of the zzso disease systemic lupus zzso zzso we aim to evaluate the effects of early and late zzso cells and zzso on zzso presenting zzso This requires the in zzso generation of sufficiently large and homogeneous populations of early and late zzso zzso Here, we present a quick method encountered by zzso that results in highly zzso synchronized homogeneous zzso cell zzso In brief, zzso zzso cells are incubated on ice for zzso and subsequently zzso at zzso After zzso at zzso more than zzso of the cells become early zzso zzso V zzso zzso zzso After zzso of zzso at zzso zzso of the cells were late zzso zzso zzso zzso V zzso zzso zzso zzso already formed zzso zzso at their cell surface after approximately zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were other characteristics of this zzso process of zzso zzso zzso could be inhibited by a zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso zzso showed a high affinity for zzso zzso generated by zzso Overall, zzso induced zzso is achieved without the addition of toxic compounds or zzso and quickly leads to synchronized homogeneous zzso cell zzso which can be applied for various research questions addressing zzso
