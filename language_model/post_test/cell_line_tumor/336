It is not clear why the development of protective zzso cells is poor in type 1 diabetes zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene promoting zzso cell zzso therefore, abnormalities in zzso may contribute to reduced zzso production by zzso cells from zzso diabetic zzso zzso In this study we demonstrate that despite normal zzso zzso binds poorly to the zzso promoter zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrates that zzso can be modified at zzso 33 by zzso zzso zzso modifier zzso zzso is facilitated by direct interaction with the zzso zzso zzso and increases following T cell zzso In zzso cells, zzso decreases zzso zzso of zzso zzso reporter activity, reduces zzso binding to the zzso in zzso zzso zzso and enhances zzso zzso into zzso leukemia nuclear zzso zzso of zzso is increased in zzso zzso cells as compared with zzso cells from zzso zzso mice, suggesting that increased zzso zzso contributes to immune zzso in zzso by reducing zzso access to and zzso of the zzso zzso
