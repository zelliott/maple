The zzso transition zzso is a pivotal event in the invasive and zzso zzso of cancer zzso zzso zzso the proliferation of a variety of tumor cells including zzso zzso zzso and breast zzso however, the possible role of zzso in the zzso is zzso We investigated the effect of zzso on the zzso zzso growth zzso 1 zzso induced zzso zzso changes and zzso of Snail zzso The zzso of zzso expression and zzso of Snail in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines show that zzso the zzso in zzso zzso however, zzso markedly inhibited zzso zzso changes, Snail zzso and zzso zzso zzso and invasion zzso revealed that zzso completely inhibited zzso cellular migration in both cell zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso Snail zzso thereby zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Thus, our findings provide new evidence that zzso suppresses lung cancer invasion and migration by zzso zzso zzso
