zzso are highly dependent on zzso metabolism for their energy supply, and zzso c zzso zzso is a key zzso zzso in the zzso A unique feature of zzso is that it is one of only four proteins in zzso cells that are zzso zzso Of its thirteen zzso three are zzso in the zzso zzso and ten are zzso on nine different zzso The mechanism of regulating this zzso zzso zzso poses a distinct zzso In recent years, we found that nuclear respiratory factors 1 and 2 zzso and zzso mediate such zzso zzso The latest candidate is the specificity factor zzso family of zzso In zzso cells, we found that zzso regulates all 13 zzso zzso However, we discovered recently that in primary zzso it is zzso and not zzso that regulates some of the key zzso zzso zzso zzso The question naturally arises as to the role of zzso in regulating zzso in primary zzso The present study zzso multiple approaches, including zzso zzso promoter zzso analysis, zzso and zzso of zzso as well as functional zzso to document that zzso indeed functionally regulate all 13 zzso of zzso as well as zzso zzso factors A and zzso The present study discovered that among the specificity family of zzso factors, it is the less known zzso zzso that regulates the expression of all 13 zzso of zzso zzso c zzso zzso zzso in primary zzso zzso also regulates the three zzso zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso and a zzso assembly protein zzso in primary zzso
