Giving human zzso zzso cells 14 zzso zzso for 24 h significantly induced not only zzso zzso but also cortisol zzso zzso the cells with zzso zzso 126 zzso further increased zzso zzso and cortisol productions in a zzso manner, but all examined zzso of zzso had little effect on the yields of precursor steroids zzso and zzso zzso examinations revealed that zzso and zzso zzso responsible for the respective final steps of the cortisol and zzso zzso zzso exhibited increased responsiveness to zzso under high zzso While zzso M zzso was needed to induce a significant increase in the zzso zzso abundance of either zzso zzso could enhance zzso zzso expression of zzso at zzso M and zzso at zzso zzso Actually, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of both zzso zzso raised the zzso rates of zzso and zzso probably through a zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso appeared to regulate these two genes at the zzso zzso Positive zzso zzso was also detected in zzso zzso activity estimated by zzso zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso increased zzso zzso activity or zzso ratio zzso Moreover, zzso improved the time effect of zzso on gene expression and zzso activity of zzso but not the zzso time response of zzso These data demonstrated that zzso zzso enhanced the potency of zzso to induce zzso and zzso zzso
