zzso is a sodium channel, thought to be a descendant of the zzso sodium channel zzso Nevertheless, zzso is not activated by zzso but rather by zzso of zzso sodium over 150 zzso In the brain, it is localized to the zzso zzso important regions for salt and water zzso in zzso where it operates as a zzso sensor of body zzso zzso channel is expressed in zzso zzso and heart, and it is also found in zzso and zzso root zzso and in zzso zzso cells, where its zzso role remains zzso Here we identified the promoter and zzso start sites of zzso sodium channel in zzso root zzso zzso from zzso We report a characterization of the zzso zzso promoter and the sequence requirements for promoter activity in zzso 2A zzso cells and in zzso root zzso zzso where zzso promoter activity seems to require zzso and zzso DNA zzso Finally, we provide evidence that a repression mechanism that zzso zzso expression may be present in certain zzso These findings provide the basis with which to understand zzso regulation of zzso sodium channel gene zzso zzso
