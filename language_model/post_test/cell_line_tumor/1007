A zzso zzso zzso generates an open reading frame in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and an alternate spliced functional transcript of zzso containing partial inclusion of zzso 6 was identified in human brain but not in liver or kidney from the same zzso zzso and protein of the brain zzso zzso were detected in 6 of 12 human autopsy zzso zzso revealed the presence of the zzso zzso zzso only in those human subjects who expressed the brain zzso zzso zzso DNA analysis in normal volunteers revealed the presence of functional zzso in 4 of 8 zzso In liver, the major organ involved in drug zzso a minor zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso is the major zzso In contrast, when expressed in zzso cells, brain zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso with greater efficiency compared with the corresponding activity in cells expressing zzso zzso binds to zzso receptors in certain regions of the central nervous system, such as zzso gray, and produces pain zzso The brain zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso of the zzso gray area in human brain, indicating that metabolism of zzso to zzso could occur at the site of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso generated by alternate zzso which mediate selective metabolism of zzso within zzso particularly the brain, to generate active drugs may play an important role in drug action and provide newer insights into the zzso of zzso
