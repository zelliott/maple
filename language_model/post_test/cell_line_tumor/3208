Regulatory T cells can be obtained from primary mixed zzso cultures of zzso zzso cells responding to zzso zzso At day 3 of culture, T cells are generated which can either help or suppress the generation of zzso T cells in a second primary zzso zzso The regulatory activity observed depends on the conditions employed in the zzso system allowing independent zzso of different functional cell types which coexist in the zzso Both the helper activity and the zzso activity are zzso by differentiated zzso T cells whose function is zzso The zzso zzso of these regulatory cells was zzso At day 3 of the zzso culture, the zzso of the helper cells is zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso cells are zzso zzso zzso zzso At day 5 of M zzso culture, zzso activity and helper activity are also zzso However, at this point, a zzso cell which is zzso zzso zzso represents the major zzso zzso It is not clear whether this change in zzso cell zzso as a function of time in culture represents one differentiation zzso or cells derived from two different precursor zzso The zzso zzso of helper or zzso T cells did not change as a function of time in zzso In day 5 zzso cells, the zzso cells were typed as zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso cells present in zzso of the same treated cell population expressed the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these observations show that the zzso zzso cells and helper cells which regulate the generation of zzso and the zzso cells themselves represent physically distinct zzso of T zzso
