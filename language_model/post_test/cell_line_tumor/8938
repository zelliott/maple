The zzso zzso zzso Nuclear zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso protein family and a vital zzso regulator regarding development and zzso adaptation zzso zzso is discussed to be linked with cancer, and other zzso zzso is known to be zzso into the cell nucleus, where zzso of the protein takes zzso zzso is a zzso partner of the zzso zzso activated zzso zzso zzso zzso the Single zzso proteins zzso the cardiovascular zzso factor 1 and the zzso zzso Factor proteins zzso zzso is obligatory for zzso zzso and zzso binding to zzso Whereas degradation of the zzso zzso is suppressed by zzso zzso is generally regarded as zzso expressed in excess within the cell, and zzso is commonly thought to be zzso However, we provide evidence that the regulation of zzso is far more zzso The aim of our study was to zzso the regulation of zzso zzso 

We examined cell lines of different origin like zzso and zzso zzso breast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Kelly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We used zzso analysis, zzso zzso and transient zzso 

Our results show that zzso protein levels are influenced by zzso and zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a cell line specific zzso We demonstrate that this effect might be triggered by zzso which plays an important role in the process of stabilizing zzso in zzso
