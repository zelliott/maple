The zzso tumor zzso encodes a zzso zzso which coordinates cell growth, zzso zzso and zzso In zzso cell lung zzso zzso is zzso zzso in zzso to zzso of cases, often zzso with zzso zzso zzso Here, we used an zzso approach to define novel therapeutic targets in zzso zzso lung zzso zzso zzso interference screens in lung cancer cell lines from genetically engineered mouse models driven by activated zzso with or without zzso zzso deletion led to the identification of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso as zzso lethal with zzso zzso in mouse and human lung cancer zzso Global zzso profiling showed that zzso cells had a striking decrease in multiple zzso zzso as compared with the zzso zzso Thus, zzso lung zzso have deficits in zzso metabolism that zzso hypersensitivity to zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is a potential therapeutic target in this aggressive subset of zzso
