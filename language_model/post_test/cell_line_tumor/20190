To establish a zzso mouse model of liver tumor zzso expressing zzso B virus zzso zzso 

zzso cell line zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso (named zzso zzso and persistently expressing zzso surface zzso and core zzso zzso were zzso The cells were injected into the zzso zzso space of zzso zzso zzso The mice were divided into 3 groups, receiving 100, 1000 or zzso cells in a total volume of 5 zzso per zzso respectively, five mice in each zzso Two weeks after the tumor cell zzso serum samples from the mice were collected weekly and the serum concentration of zzso and zzso was zzso by zzso The tumor growth in the mouse liver was monitored by a high-resolution ultrasound zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in the tumor zzso was determined by zzso 

Liver tumors were formed in all the mice receiving 1000 and zzso zzso cells per zzso and in zzso of the mice receiving 100 zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in their zzso from 2 weeks after tumor cell zzso The mice receiving 100 cells per mouse began to die 4 weeks, those receiving 1000 cells per mouse began to die 3 - 4 weeks and those receiving zzso cells began to die 2 - 3 weeks after the cell zzso All the tumor cells expressed zzso and zzso 

The zzso cells zzso and persistently express zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso A mouse model of transplanted liver tumor zzso expressing zzso zzso has been successfully established by zzso of those cells into the zzso zzso zzso
