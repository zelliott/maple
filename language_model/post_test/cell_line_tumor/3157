We investigated whether zzso could amplify the zzso effects of zzso in an zzso rat zzso zzso zzso zzso is a specific inhibitor of zzso series zzso and acts as an zzso zzso human zzso cells express zzso and zzso zzso We used in zzso zzso of zzso and growth of tumor and zzso cells to evaluate zzso and the potential for zzso to enhance radiation zzso Treatment was then evaluated in an zzso model to evaluate zzso with therapeutic radiation in zzso In zzso zzso blocked cell zzso but did not influence the effects of radiation on zzso zzso zzso strongly amplified radiation effects on zzso cell zzso In zzso zzso prolonged the survival of zzso zzso rats from 50 to over 110 zzso zzso with zzso and radiation dramatically amplified the effects of radiation, producing survival over 200 days and triggering an enhanced zzso response and suppression of tumor growth by zzso at zzso Signaling pathways activated in the tumor included zzso a documented zzso of cellular response to zzso Because zzso has a short plasma zzso zzso approximately 20 zzso zzso scheduling typically uses daily zzso We found that a single dose of zzso (4 zzso given between 4 and 12 zzso prior to radiation was sufficient to produce the same zzso Our results demonstrate that blockade of zzso zzso mediates an unanticipated rapid zzso of radiation, and suggests possible clinical translation for zzso zzso
