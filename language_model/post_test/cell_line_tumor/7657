Recent progression in the understanding of stem cell biology has greatly facilitated the identification and characterization of cancer stem cells zzso Moreover, evidence has accumulated indicating that conventional cancer treatments are potentially ineffective against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have multiple zzso effects zzso to zzso in the patterns of zzso of zzso and are a promising new group of zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the effects of two zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso A zzso on two zzso cancer zzso cell lines from zzso cell zzso of the head and neck zzso cultured in zzso medium containing zzso growth factor and basic zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the growth of zzso cell lines in a zzso manner as measured by zzso zzso Moreover, zzso induced cell cycle arrest and zzso in these zzso cell zzso Interestingly, the expression of cancer stem cell zzso zzso and zzso on zzso cell lines was decreased by zzso zzso In addition, zzso decreased zzso expression levels of zzso genes and suppressed the zzso transition zzso of zzso As expected, the combination of zzso and zzso agents, including zzso and zzso had a synergistic effect on zzso cell zzso Taken together, our data indicate that zzso not only inhibit the growth of zzso cell lines by inducing zzso and cell cycle arrest, but also alter the cancer stem cell zzso in zzso raising the possibility that zzso may have therapeutic potential for cancer stem cells of zzso
