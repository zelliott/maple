The nuclear expression of zzso zzso factor A zzso which is required for zzso DNA zzso zzso and zzso must be linked to cellular energy zzso Because zzso generates zzso oxygen species as a zzso we tested the idea that zzso oxygen species regulate zzso expression through zzso of nuclear respiratory factor zzso and binding to the zzso zzso In zzso rat zzso cells that zzso zzso zzso and zzso increases were found in zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso binding of zzso to zzso promoter was demonstrated by zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso zzso zzso binding was zzso under zzso zzso zzso gene zzso produced zzso zzso of zzso expression and decreased zzso zzso To evaluate zzso zzso regulation of zzso in zzso zzso blockade of upstream zzso zzso was used to demonstrate loss of zzso stimulation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso response was also zzso by specific zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso acid sequence revealed an zzso zzso consensus at which zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso by zzso Finally, zzso zzso and zzso zzso predictably lacked zzso regulation in a cancer line having no zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso This study zzso novel zzso regulation of zzso zzso and nuclear zzso by zzso zzso zzso signaling in controlling zzso induction by an zzso zzso zzso
