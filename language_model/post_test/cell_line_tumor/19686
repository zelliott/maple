To study the selective killing of human zzso vein zzso cells zzso by a double suicide gene under the regulation of a zzso domain insert containing zzso zzso promoter and zzso by an zzso gene zzso 

Human zzso promoter was cloned by zzso chain reaction zzso and two zzso zzso plasmids zzso zzso were constructed according to a zzso transformation zzso These two newly constructed plasmids were then zzso into zzso packaging cells to grow zzso which were further multiplied and zzso zzso and zzso cells were infected with either of the two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, and the infection rates were estimated by detection of green fluorescent protein zzso zzso zzso cells were cultured in culture media containing different zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the killing effects were zzso 

The two zzso zzso plasmids zzso zzso were successfully constructed and zzso into zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso infected cells caused similar infection zzso and the infected cells exhibited different sensitivity to the zzso zzso infected with zzso and zzso cells infected with zzso were highly sensitive to the zzso and zzso infected with zzso were similarly sensitive but significantly more sensitive than the zzso cells infected with zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Selective killing of zzso may be achieved by gene transfer of double suicide gene under the regulation of the zzso zzso This finding may provide an optional way to target gene therapy of zzso tumors by zzso of tumor blood zzso
