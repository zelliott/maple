This study examines the performance of novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which were prepared using an zzso zzso technique, as targeted and controlled drug delivery zzso These zzso zzso have recently been proposed as targeted and controlled drug delivery vehicle systems to zzso due to their ability to loosen the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso efficiency and loading capacities of the zzso demonstrated that these zzso displayed sufficient binding ability, which depends on the pH and initial concentration of the zzso The zzso effects of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were assessed using zzso zzso and the zzso were found to be less zzso than the zzso zzso after incubation for zzso The particle sizes of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were between 300 and 580 zzso as determined by a zzso zzso electron zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso exhibit a clear, smooth surface and fine zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and drug were confirmed by zzso zzso Atomic zzso zzso zzso analysis confirmed the size of the zzso composite zzso zzso this work established that the drug can be successfully zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso with a homogeneous zzso These zzso can be potential carriers for targeted and controlled drug delivery to cancer zzso
