Emerging evidence suggests that zzso arise in zzso zzso Yet, the requirements for transformation of these primitive cells remains poorly zzso In this study, we have exploited the zzso system that selects for primitive zzso zzso cells to explore their potential and requirements for zzso Introduction of zzso zzso 40 Early Region and zzso into zzso cells led to the generation of zzso an immortalized zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso largely comprised of zzso zzso with long-term zzso and zzso differentiation zzso zzso and zzso analyses revealed the existence of zzso population within zzso with varied zzso differentiation and zzso zzso zzso injection of zzso into zzso mice resulted in the generation of invasive zzso zzso Further, these cells zzso a zzso of zzso fraction that alone had zzso and zzso potential and resembled the breast cancer stem cell gene zzso Interestingly, prolonged in zzso zzso led to their further zzso The zzso cells also showed increased expression of zzso and zzso to zzso transition zzso zzso zzso zzso activated zzso response and zzso zzso zzso of which are likely to have contributed to their zzso zzso Thus, unlike previous in zzso transformation studies that used zzso more differentiated human zzso zzso cells our study demonstrates that the zzso zzso cells undergo zzso conversion with only two genetic zzso without requiring zzso zzso Moreover, the striking zzso and molecular resemblance of the zzso tumors with naturally arising breast zzso supports the notion of a primitive breast cell as the origin for this zzso of breast zzso Finally, the zzso represent a zzso population of cells with striking zzso capable of zzso zzso and zzso thus offering a unique model system to study the molecular mechanisms involved with these zzso
