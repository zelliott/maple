To investigate the differential expression of genes zzso zzso zzso protein 2 zzso zzso and zzso in human normal liver cell line zzso zzso cell line zzso and its zzso counterpart zzso cell zzso 

The total zzso was extracted from zzso zzso and zzso cells, respectively, and the zzso were zzso transcribed into zzso The expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected according to the standard curve using real-time zzso quantitative zzso 

The expression of zzso zzso in zzso cell line was significantly higher than that in zzso and zzso cells zzso and the latter two cells showed similar expression levels of zzso zzso zzso The expressions of zzso and zzso zzso showed statistically significant difference between the 3 cell lines zzso 

zzso might play a role in the intrinsic drug resistance, and zzso and zzso are related to the acquired drug resistance of zzso zzso
