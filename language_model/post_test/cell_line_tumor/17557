Cellular acquisition of folate is zzso by folate receptors zzso in many zzso and normal human zzso Although zzso are zzso in folate zzso and zzso following folate zzso the zzso basis for this relationship is zzso Previously we demonstrated that interaction of an zzso zzso in the zzso region of zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso E1 zzso zzso is critical for zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanisms controlling this interaction, especially within the context of zzso regulation and folate status, have remained zzso Human cervical zzso cells exhibited progressively increasing zzso of zzso after shifting of zzso cells to zzso media, without a zzso rise in zzso zzso or rise in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was accompanied by a progressive zzso of the zzso homocysteine within cultured cells, which zzso interaction of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso E1 as well as zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso reversal of folate zzso also led to a rapid parallel reduction in homocysteine and zzso zzso to levels observed in zzso zzso zzso these results suggest that homocysteine is the key zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and establishes the linkage between zzso folate metabolism and coordinated zzso of zzso
