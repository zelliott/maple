zzso zzso factor 1) is a novel zzso binding protein that can antagonize zzso and sensitize cells to other cell death zzso Our previous results have shown that zzso zzso of the zzso sites in zzso promoter is strongly associated with lower expression of zzso in gastric zzso In our study, we investigated the effect of restoration of zzso expression on growth of gastric zzso We found that the restoration of zzso expression suppressed zzso and zzso growth and increased sensitivity to TRAIL and drug-induced zzso zzso cell clones expressing zzso exhibited delayed tumor initiation in nude zzso Restoration of zzso expression zzso by zzso zzso greatly increased zzso in gastric cancer cell lines in a zzso and zzso manner and zzso cancer cells to TRAIL and zzso zzso zzso zzso induced cell cycle zzso arrest and zzso the expression of zzso and zzso the expression of zzso B1 and zzso zzso zzso treatment significantly inhibited tumor growth, strongly enhanced the zzso activity of TRAIL in a gastric cancer zzso model in zzso and significantly prolonged the survival time of animals bearing tumor zzso Complete zzso of established tumors was achieved on combined treatment with zzso and zzso Our results document that the restoration of zzso zzso gastric zzso and tumor growth and that zzso is a promising candidate for cancer gene zzso
