As one of the best known cancer zzso zzso zzso is zzso exclusively in germ line zzso such as the zzso as well as in a variety of solid and zzso zzso cells including acute zzso zzso zzso zzso has been recognized as a promising target for both active and adoptive zzso zzso However, in most patients with zzso acute zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso response are either zzso or too weak to exert immune surveillance presumably due to the inadequate zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso presentation by leukemia zzso In this study, we observed remarkably increased zzso zzso expression in human acute zzso leukemia cell lines and primary acute zzso leukemia cells after treatment with a novel zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso in zzso zzso expression was further enhanced in acute zzso leukemia cell lines after combined treatment with zzso and DNA zzso agent zzso zzso of an zzso acute zzso leukemia cell line zzso with zzso and/or zzso increased sensitivity to zzso zzso that recognize zzso or zzso zzso presented by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso also contributed to increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso Our data thus provide a new line of evidence that zzso zzso of cancer zzso zzso by a zzso zzso inhibitor or in combination with zzso agent increases zzso zzso and may represent a new opportunity in future design of treatment strategy targeting specifically zzso acute zzso zzso
