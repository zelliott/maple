zzso translation plays an important role in human zzso We previously reported decreased zzso initiation factor 3 zzso f zzso expression in pancreatic zzso Whether decreased zzso expression can transform normal zzso cells is not zzso In our current study, we found evidence that stable zzso of zzso in normal human pancreatic zzso zzso cells increased cell size, nuclear zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso resistance, migration, and formation of zzso irregular zzso Our findings support the tumor zzso role of zzso in pancreatic zzso zzso we found that zzso inhibited both zzso and zzso zzso An increase in the zzso zzso zzso level was suggested to promote the generation of zzso The regulatory mechanism of zzso degradation in zzso is not well zzso We demonstrated here that zzso promotes zzso degradation through direct interaction with zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso We showed that zzso K is required for maintaining zzso zzso under stress conditions, zzso zzso zzso K from zzso thereby preventing it from protecting zzso from zzso We also demonstrated that zzso degradation occurred in zzso body, zzso zzso zzso zzso that contain zzso Our findings established a new mechanism of zzso zzso regulation zzso by zzso zzso and suggest that the tumor zzso function of zzso may link to impaired zzso degradation and zzso
