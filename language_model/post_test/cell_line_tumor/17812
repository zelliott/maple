We recently reported that synthetic zzso targeting promoter regions can induce gene expression in a phenomenon referred to as zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso U S A zzso The present study investigates the in zzso zzso activity zzso can elicit through triggering the expression of cell cycle zzso protein zzso zzso in human zzso cancer zzso zzso of a zzso zzso targeting the zzso promoter zzso was used to induce zzso expression in zzso and zzso zzso cancer cell zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis zzso the increase zzso zzso and protein levels, respectively, in zzso zzso In association to zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso cancer cell proliferation and zzso Further analysis of cell viability and cell cycle distribution revealed that zzso zzso also enhanced zzso cell death and caused an zzso in the zzso phase in both cell zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso by zzso has zzso activity in zzso in zzso cancer zzso These results suggest that zzso could be used for cancer treatment by targeted zzso of tumor zzso zzso
