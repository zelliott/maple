zzso is a primary zzso found in the roots of a traditional Chinese zzso zzso and has been shown to have some zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of zzso on the zzso of the human gastric cancer line zzso and to identify the mechanism zzso zzso cells were cultured and treated with zzso zzso 50, 100, zzso and 200 zzso for 24, 48, or 72 zzso Relative cell viability assessed by the zzso zzso after treatment was 100, 99, 85, 79, zzso for 24 zzso 100, 98, 80, 51, 37% for 48 zzso and 100, 97, 60, 36, zzso for 72 zzso zzso Cell zzso was detected with zzso zzso and zzso with flow zzso using zzso zzso zzso at 48 h after 100, 200 and 300 zzso zzso The percentage of zzso cells was zzso zzso zzso zzso We also measured the zzso levels of zzso and -9 using real-time zzso Treatment with 100 zzso zzso for 48 h significantly increased zzso expression of zzso and zzso The levels of zzso proteins including zzso zzso zzso and zzso were evaluated in zzso zzso zzso increased the zzso ratio but decreased the protein levels of zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso significantly increased the expression of zzso c and zzso zzso zzso factor 1, two critical components involved in zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso proliferation by inducing zzso and this zzso effect of zzso is zzso in part by an intrinsic zzso zzso
