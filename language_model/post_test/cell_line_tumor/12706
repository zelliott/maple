The T helper 17 zzso cells recently identified as distinct T helper cell lineage are zzso by their production of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Although much effort has been made in understanding the function of zzso cells in the zzso of different diseases, their influence in zzso remain largely zzso 

We studied the prevalence and induction of zzso cells in head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso patients by flow zzso To determine the migration mechanism of zzso cells into primary zzso and zzso of zzso we performed zzso zzso We zzso the proliferation and the zzso proteins of zzso in the presence of zzso cells with zzso proliferation zzso and an zzso protein zzso 

In this study, we showed that the prevalence of zzso cells is elevated in peripheral blood of zzso zzso In addition, zzso tissue and zzso zzso zzso are infiltrated by a huge number of zzso cells representing an important fraction of the zzso zzso zzso We further showed that zzso cells can be induced and expanded in zzso zzso through zzso produced by zzso cells and zzso and in addition can be recruited to the zzso milieu through a zzso zzso Furthermore, we showed that the proliferation and zzso of zzso are impaired in the presence of zzso zzso 

We conclude that zzso cells have a substantial impact on the zzso of zzso and on their zzso and could serve as a potential therapeutic target to zzso zzso response in zzso
