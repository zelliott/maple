Changes in DNA copy number are one of the hallmarks of the genetic instability common to most human zzso Previous zzso methods have been used to identify zzso gains and zzso however, they are unable to zzso zzso at the level of single zzso zzso zzso Here we describe a novel zzso that uses a recently developed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso method, whole zzso sampling analysis zzso to identify zzso zzso gains and losses at high zzso zzso simultaneously zzso over 10,000 zzso by zzso zzso to perfect match zzso and mismatch zzso zzso zzso on a single zzso The copy number zzso jointly uses PM intensity and discrimination ratios between paired PM and zzso intensity values to identify and estimate genetic copy number zzso zzso from an experimental sample are compared with zzso zzso derived from a reference set containing over 100 normal individuals to gain statistical zzso zzso regions with statistically significant copy number changes can be identified using both single point analysis and zzso point analysis of zzso zzso We identified multiple regions of amplification and deletion using a panel of human breast cancer cell zzso We verified these results using an independent method based on quantitative zzso chain reaction and found that our approach is both sensitive and specific and can tolerate samples which contain a mixture of both zzso and normal zzso In addition, by using known zzso zzso from the reference set, statistically significant zzso intervals can be identified containing zzso stretches of zzso zzso potentially allowing the detection of regions undergoing loss of zzso zzso without the need for a matched normal control zzso The zzso of zzso analysis, via zzso zzso with copy number zzso using a single array provides additional insight into the structure of zzso zzso With mean and median zzso zzso distances of zzso zzso zzso and 119 zzso respectively, this method zzso a resolution that is not easily achievable with zzso experimental zzso
