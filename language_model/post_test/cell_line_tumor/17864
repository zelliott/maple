This study provides comprehensive characterization of the mode of action of zzso A and identifies structural requirements of zzso compounds that are responsible for severing zzso filaments and zzso growth of cancer cells in zzso and in zzso We rationally designed and assembled a series of structural zzso of the natural product, including a zzso labeled zzso We used zzso zzso to directly observe zzso filament severing by this series of small zzso which established that the combination of the zzso and the zzso zzso was sufficient to enable rapid zzso filament zzso in zzso In addition, we demonstrated that the zzso zzso of zzso A is responsible for zzso modification of the protein in zzso and in zzso cells, resulting in further increase in the zzso of the natural zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso A elicits its potent zzso activity by a dual mechanism of action, which zzso both severing of zzso filaments and zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso
