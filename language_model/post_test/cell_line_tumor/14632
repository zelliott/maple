Although zzso A zzso has been reported to be zzso in cancer cells and solid tumors, its expression and role in zzso have not been zzso zzso we show that expression of zzso in human zzso cell lines and zzso is significantly higher than in normal human zzso and normal counterparts of brain zzso To determine the role of zzso zzso in glioblastoma, stable zzso interference zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was performed in zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso zzso stable single clones decrease zzso zzso migration, and zzso growth in zzso and with slower growth in zzso as zzso in zzso nude zzso We have also observed that zzso of zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso a zzso and zzso zzso zzso enforced expression of zzso in the zzso zzso cell line, zzso markedly enhanced zzso transcripts and restored zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso production provides a growth advantage to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is due to reduced activity of zzso which is one of the major zzso factors regulating zzso zzso These results not only establish the relevance of zzso to zzso growth in zzso and in zzso but also suggest that small interfering zzso zzso zzso could be an effective therapeutic approach against zzso
