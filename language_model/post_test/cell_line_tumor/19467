An zzso zzso trial was conducted to evaluate a flow zzso method for scoring zzso in mouse zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso scoring by flow zzso differential zzso of zzso versus zzso and zzso zzso enhances zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 47 zzso zzso A reference laboratory investigated the potential of six chemicals to induce zzso -- the zzso zzso C zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The latter two zzso were selected as extreme challenges to the zzso because of their potent zzso zzso Three collaborating laboratories were supplied with zzso In zzso zzso zzso and each was assigned one zzso and one zzso zzso were treated continuously for zzso over a range of zzso up to 5 zzso or overtly zzso zzso zzso were scored via standard zzso and flow zzso In addition to enumerating zzso zzso a zzso measurement that is simultaneously acquired with the flow zzso zzso scoring procedure was evaluated zzso With this method, latex particles served as counting zzso and facilitated relative survival zzso that exclude the presence of zzso zzso For comparison purposes, additional zzso zzso were measured, including several that are based on cell number, and others that reflect compromised membrane integrity, including dye zzso and/or zzso zzso Key findings for this set of compounds include the zzso zzso significant discrepancies in top concentration selection were found when zzso zzso were based on different methods, with the zzso approach tending to be the most sensitive, zzso both zzso and flow zzso scoring methods detected zzso zzso formation for the three zzso agents zzso with good agreement between the reference laboratory and the collaborating laboratories, and zzso whereas flow zzso analyses showed no significant increases for the zzso when top concentration selection was based on zzso significantly elevated zzso zzso were observed for zzso that were chosen based on zzso zzso zzso zzso these results indicate that rapid assessment of zzso can be accomplished with a relatively simple flow zzso technique, and that the scoring system is zzso across zzso Furthermore, a concurrent assessment of zzso zzso may help reduce the occurrence of irrelevant positive results, as it may represent a more appropriate means for choosing top concentration zzso Finally, the data presented zzso reinforce concerns about the manner in which zzso limits are described in guidance documents, since these recommendations tend to cite fixed zzso values without reference to zzso
