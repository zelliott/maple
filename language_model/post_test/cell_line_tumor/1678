In order to promote zzso transfer in zzso cells, we used an original zzso zzso zzso in our laboratory, zzso zzso zzso were prepared from this zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso Its zzso capacity was evaluated using zzso cell zzso and zzso in zzso the zzso effect of zzso zzso This zzso efficiently delivered zzso zzso in two human cancer cell lines abundantly zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed that 50 zzso of zzso zzso carried by zzso zzso already silenced more than zzso of zzso in these zzso A comparative study with two commercial carriers indicated that the zzso induced by zzso zzso transported by zzso zzso zzso was comparable to that induced by zzso and better than zzso zzso Moreover, a zzso by a zzso zzso followed by a zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso compared to zzso were less efficient for zzso but better for zzso zzso Following one of our previous works concerning cell delivery of zzso ( zzso et zzso 2004 ), the main interest of results presented here resides in the double potential of zzso zzso to deliver zzso zzso as well as large zzso acids in zzso
