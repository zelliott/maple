zzso resistance is a major problem in zzso lung cancer zzso zzso zzso is a widely used herb in traditional Chinese zzso We tested the effects of zzso on zzso zzso and zzso resistant zzso human zzso zzso Both cells showed equal zzso when incubated with extracts of zzso of 9 species of zzso including zzso zzso zzso treated with the zzso of zzso zzso and analyzed by flow zzso zzso showed increases in S zzso When compared zzso controls or zzso cells treated with extracts of zzso zzso species, cells treated with extracts of zzso zzso species responded with an induction of zzso similar to cells treated with the zzso drugs zzso and zzso This was shown by four criteria: increased DNA fragmentation within cells as measured by zzso increased zzso zzso for DNA breaks; increased specific activities of zzso 3 and 9, but not zzso 8 by zzso zzso indicating the zzso zzso and similar patterns changes in the expressions of 9 genes involved in the cell zzso as measured by zzso and zzso zzso zzso of drug-resistant zzso cells with zzso zzso reduced the zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These results show that extracts of several species of zzso are zzso to both zzso and drug-resistant zzso cells, are zzso induce gene expression patterns that are similar to zzso cells treated with zzso drugs, and can reverse resistance to zzso zzso
