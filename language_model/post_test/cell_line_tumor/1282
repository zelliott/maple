zzso converts zzso to zzso and it is expressed in zzso and zzso zzso zzso brain and zzso zzso As circulating levels of zzso in males are low, we zzso that local zzso production is important for the regulation of zzso functions zzso zzso and pathological development zzso breast and prostate zzso by acting in a zzso and/or zzso zzso We generated a zzso zzso zzso transgenic mouse to test this zzso The zzso construct zzso consists of a full-length human zzso zzso zzso and a zzso gene under the control of a zzso zzso promoter zzso which is regulated by zzso zzso or zzso and zzso Our in zzso studies using zzso cells zzso expressing zzso showed that zzso treatment induced zzso expression of zzso transcripts by zzso zzso zzso activity by zzso zzso and zzso activity by zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso generated four zzso founder zzso A male founder was bred with a female zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso to produce zzso zzso zzso Upon zzso treatment via drinking water, human zzso expression was detected by zzso specifically in zzso zzso zzso zzso and seminal zzso of zzso zzso zzso expression and activity was detected in these zzso by in zzso zzso imaging, in zzso zzso zzso and zzso In zzso we generated a transgenic mouse model that expresses the human zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso manner, which will be a useful model to study the zzso importance of local zzso zzso
