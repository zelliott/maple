zzso zzso regulates zzso turnover and is required for zzso zzso zzso and dynamic zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso regulatory domain has been zzso to regulate zzso function, possibly through zzso of the efficiency of zzso zzso Here we have zzso novel zzso zzso zzso to four major zzso zzso and zzso zzso sites to monitor individual zzso events and their zzso Surprisingly, zzso and not zzso interaction is the main zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, the zzso of these four zzso had no obvious effect on zzso role in zzso complex stabilization or zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso was dramatically induced by zzso zzso but zzso pathways were also zzso The data suggest that zzso zzso at these sites is modulated by multiple cell surface receptors primarily through zzso zzso but these changes do not seem to reduce zzso zzso
