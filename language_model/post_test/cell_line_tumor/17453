An improved expression zzso zzso growth zzso zzso was constructed and transferred into zzso coli zzso for the expression of zzso zzso growth zzso The zzso zzso growth zzso was produced as inclusion bodies, and the zzso zzso growth zzso content was as high as zzso of the total protein zzso For production of zzso zzso growth zzso in zzso coli, zzso zzso cultures were used to achieve a high cell density zzso A cell concentration zzso dry cell weight zzso was obtained after zzso zzso and zzso stability was maintained at high zzso zzso of zzso growth zzso was induced at three different cell zzso 50, zzso and zzso dry cell zzso When cells were induced at a cell concentration of zzso dry cell weight, the amount of zzso growth zzso produced was zzso zzso of the total zzso Using a simple zzso process including inclusion body isolation, zzso zzso and zzso affinity zzso zzso of zzso growth zzso was obtained from a zzso of culture, and the recovery yield was zzso The biological activity of the zzso zzso was demonstrated as promoting the growth of four different cell lines by the zzso zzso and the best growth stimulation ratio was obtained for the zzso clone zzso cell zzso
