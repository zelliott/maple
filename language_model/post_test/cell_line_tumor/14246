A previously described zzso zzso zzso zzso was converted to a zzso variable zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso and has been used for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso the variable regions of the heavy chain zzso and light chain zzso were used as the template for zzso zzso The sequences were joined by the addition of a zzso sequence and then cloned into several expression zzso A variety of expression plasmids and zzso coli hosts were used to determine the optimal expression zzso zzso was highest with the zzso zzso and the zzso host strain, which produced approximately 60 zzso zzso zzso zzso per liter of culture zzso g wet weight zzso Although the production of soluble zzso was zzso zzso zzso formed inclusion bodies under every expression zzso zzso inclusion bodies had to be isolated, washed, zzso and zzso The zzso protein zzso kit and zzso zzso zzso were zzso used to determine the optimal zzso conditions that would produce active zzso zzso zzso metal affinity zzso was used for the final zzso of the zzso active zzso The zzso of the zzso was determined by an zzso zzso Although the zzso loses considerable affinity for its zzso it maintains similar zzso as the parent zzso zzso zzso zzso
