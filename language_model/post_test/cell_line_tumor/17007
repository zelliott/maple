zzso and related zzso compounds have zzso zzso Since the infectious pathogen of prion diseases is composed of zzso zzso zzso we hypothesized that this zzso property could be enhanced by attaching multiple zzso zzso or zzso zzso to a zzso In addition to exploring zzso red dye and zzso zzso acid zzso which already possess intrinsic zzso zzso zzso acid was used in this zzso In practice, zzso red itself could not be modified with zzso or zzso units, and a modified zzso analog was also zzso The latter also lacked zzso activity in infected cultured zzso While addition of zzso to a zzso zzso acid scaffold resulted in some reduction of zzso zzso attached to a zzso acid scaffold exhibited zzso zzso as well as a toxicity profile superior to zzso zzso activity of these molecules was influenced by the zzso zzso and rigidity associated with the variable linear or zzso zzso zzso and in some instances was modulated by zzso and/or strain zzso zzso several compounds in our series increased zzso zzso Overall, zzso and enhancing properties of these zzso compounds offer new avenues for zzso investigation of prion zzso
