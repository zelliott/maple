In melanoma, transition to the vertical growth phase is the critical step in conversion to a deadly zzso zzso Here, we offer the first evidence that an zzso zzso has a key role in this zzso We found that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated with the zzso capacity of human melanoma zzso zzso zzso expression zzso proliferation and migration, whereas zzso expression of zzso produced the opposite zzso zzso investigations indicated that zzso zzso regulated zzso zzso status, which in turn fortified zzso junctions function by increasing zzso expression and zzso retention of zzso in the plasma zzso In zzso melanoma cells, zzso zzso enhanced lung zzso in zzso Interestingly, the natural compound zzso which is known to exert a zzso activity, inhibited proliferation and migration as well as lung zzso of zzso melanoma zzso Overall, our findings reveal that zzso is a key regulator of invasion and zzso in melanoma, and also suggest a zzso strategy to effectively decrease deadly zzso forms of this zzso
