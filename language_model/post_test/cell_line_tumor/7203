Previous studies have demonstrated the in zzso and in zzso activity of zzso zzso an zzso analog zzso of zzso in multiple myeloma zzso In the present study, we have examined the zzso activity of zzso zzso a specific zzso zzso combined with zzso Based on the zzso method, combination zzso of less than 1 were obtained for all dose ranges of zzso when combined with zzso suggesting strong zzso zzso this combination was able to overcome drug resistance when tested against zzso cell lines resistant to conventional zzso Moreover, the zzso but not zzso alone, was able to overcome the growth advantage zzso on zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso growth zzso zzso or adherence to bone zzso zzso cells zzso Combining zzso and zzso induced zzso of zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso including the zzso protein zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were targeted by these drugs individually and in zzso suggesting the molecular mechanism by which they interfere with zzso growth and zzso These studies, therefore, provide the framework for clinical evaluation of zzso zzso combined with zzso to improve patient outcome in zzso
