Cancer zzso is a leading cause of cancer morbidity and zzso More needs to be learned about mechanisms that control this zzso In particular, the role of zzso receptors in zzso remains zzso Here, using a highly zzso breast cancer zzso model, we show that lung zzso is a feature of only a proportion of the tumor cells that express zzso Moreover, the primary tumor growing in zzso pads activates remotely the expression of zzso and zzso in the zzso These zzso acting through zzso attract both tumor and immune zzso However, zzso zzso was not sufficient to produce zzso as tumor cells in the lung were efficiently eliminated by natural killer zzso zzso Lung zzso required zzso regulatory T cells zzso which directly killed zzso cells using zzso zzso Thus, strategies that abrogate any part of this process should improve the outcome through zzso of zzso cells and prevention of tumor cell zzso We confirm this prediction by killing zzso cells through delivery of zzso toxins or depleting zzso and preventing lung zzso
