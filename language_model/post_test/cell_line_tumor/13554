zzso of zzso zzso from both resident and invading zzso within the pancreatic zzso impacts the development of Type 1 diabetes zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso from pancreatic zzso in response to zzso signaling pathways influences immune cell recruitment into the pancreatic zzso zzso we investigated the positive and negative regulatory components controlling expression of the zzso gene using isolated rat zzso and zzso zzso zzso We discovered that zzso of the zzso gene by zzso required the zzso zzso of zzso and was dependent on zzso response elements located in the zzso zzso region of the zzso gene zzso zzso gene zzso in response to zzso was blocked by pharmacological zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso increase in zzso zzso was also impaired by zzso zzso zzso and by zzso Moreover, multiple synthetic zzso inhibited the zzso induction of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene by zzso or by zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso which diminished zzso gene zzso promoter activity, and release of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso repression of zzso zzso gene zzso and protein zzso occurs in part through the zzso of the zzso gene and subsequent zzso of the zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso actions observed with zzso zzso were obtained without suppressing zzso insulin zzso Thus, zzso is a possible target for zzso therapeutic intervention with preservation of zzso zzso
