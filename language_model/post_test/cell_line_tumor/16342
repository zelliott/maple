The zzso plays a significant role in human cancer zzso However, the role of the tumor zzso in the zzso control of genes critical to cancer progression remains zzso As transient zzso expression is central to many stages of zzso and is sensitive to regulation by the zzso we have studied if zzso control of zzso expression is linked to transient zzso regulation of its promoter, contributing to the unstable and zzso expression of zzso seen during tumor zzso We used zzso zzso human tissue zzso that mimic the complexity of their in zzso counterparts, to show that the tumor zzso can direct the zzso of zzso through the reversal of zzso zzso of its zzso This loss of DNA zzso results from the induction of zzso zzso interactions as cells undergo tissue zzso zzso zzso is associated with multiple zzso changes including altered zzso of a small number of zzso specific zzso zzso and control of zzso zzso These zzso changes may drive the plasticity of zzso zzso in different tissue zzso during tumor cell invasion and zzso Thus, we suggest that zzso regulation is a mechanism through which tumor cell colonization of zzso sites occurs as zzso cells arise from zzso zzso
