Exposure to environmental radiation and the application of new clinical zzso such as zzso have heightened the need to understand cellular responses to low dose and zzso rate zzso zzso Many tumor cell lines have been observed to exhibit a hypersensitivity to radiation doses zzso zzso which zzso as a significant zzso from the zzso survival response predicted by a zzso fit to higher zzso However, the underlying processes for this phenomenon remain zzso Using a gel zzso zzso zzso to monitor single cell proliferation at early times zzso we examined the response of human zzso lung zzso zzso zzso and zzso breast zzso cell lines exposed to gamma radiation doses from 0 to 200 zzso delivered at zzso and 22 zzso The zzso and zzso cells, but not zzso cells, showed the marked hypersensitivity at doses zzso zzso To further characterize the zzso zzso we examined the influence of zzso radiation on cell cycle status and zzso by zzso for active zzso and zzso zzso zzso V zzso We observed that zzso zzso and zzso V binding mirrored the proliferation zzso for the cell zzso Furthermore, the zzso hypersensitivity and zzso V binding to zzso zzso and zzso cells were eliminated by treating the cells with zzso an inhibitor of zzso When zzso cell lines zzso skin zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were examined for similar patterns, we found that there was no zzso and zzso was not zzso by zzso V or zzso zzso Our data therefore suggest that zzso hypersensitivity is associated with zzso zzso
