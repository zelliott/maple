Although zzso between zzso and nuclear zzso signaling pathways has been implicated in the development and progression of zzso zzso evidence of direct zzso of these signaling pathways has remained zzso Here we show that zzso promotes an association between zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso and the zzso growth factor zzso zzso family member zzso zzso expressed as well as zzso zzso interacts with and zzso zzso zzso indicating that the zzso interaction is zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso of the zzso processed zzso zzso domain zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso requires functional zzso zzso The nuclear zzso complex is selectively recruited to zzso gene promoters such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor 1 zzso but not to zzso factor 1 precursor zzso zzso with zzso promoter zzso suppression of zzso expression by interfering zzso shows that zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso and zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso zzso itself is an zzso gene and the zzso promoter harbors a consensus zzso response element zzso zzso with overlapping zzso zzso elements that bind zzso and zzso in response to zzso Using a cell proliferation zzso and a small interfering zzso approach, we show that zzso expression is required for the zzso action of zzso in the zzso breast cancer cell zzso Our results indicate that zzso is a unique zzso of zzso directly zzso zzso and nuclear zzso actions in breast zzso We propose that the contribution of an zzso zzso signaling zzso to tumor growth and therapeutic response should be considered when managing patients with zzso breast zzso
