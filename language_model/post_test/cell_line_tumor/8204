Combined effects of zzso zzso a member of zzso group of drugs and caffeine on human cell lines, zzso and zzso were investigated in this zzso zzso zzso zzso was enhanced while caffeine was zzso The cell death was confirmed by observing zzso changes, zzso zzso and membrane zzso zzso Also such combined effects induced elevated level of zzso and depletion of zzso The mechanism of cell death induced by simultaneous treatment of zzso and caffeine was associated with the zzso zzso of zzso release of zzso zzso zzso B, zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Our results indicate that, zzso alone zzso zzso in human cells but in the presence of caffeine it zzso necrosis in a zzso zzso Thus our observations strongly suggest that, zzso and caffeine together produce severe zzso in human cell zzso
