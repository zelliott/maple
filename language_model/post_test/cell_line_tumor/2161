Although surgical zzso with zzso chemotherapy and/or zzso are used to treat breast tumors, normal tissue zzso development of zzso and inherent tumor resistance to radiation or chemotherapy can hinder a successful zzso We have developed a zzso responsive zzso based on the sequence of zzso zzso zzso that zzso breast cancer cell proliferation by blocking the activity of the zzso protein zzso Following systemic administration, the zzso - delivered zzso zzso zzso was targeted to tumors using focused zzso and significantly reduced tumor growth in an zzso mouse model of breast zzso This work provides a new zzso for targeted delivery of a specific zzso zzso zzso and this strategy may be expanded for delivery of other therapeutic peptides or small zzso zzso
