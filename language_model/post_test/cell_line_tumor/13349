zzso is a cell surface protein expressed on zzso cells and cortical zzso that could potentially be used as an zzso target in zzso Cell zzso zzso the cortical zzso of zzso acute zzso zzso zzso and other zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was selected from a panel of six fully human zzso isolated from a zzso zzso display library, based on specificity and zzso against cells expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso recognized zzso in zzso cell lines and patient zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso complex was zzso at zzso Furthermore, while zzso induced moderate zzso zzso zzso potent zzso cell zzso zzso activity was observed against zzso expressing cell lines as well as zzso cell lines and zzso patient zzso In zzso experiments showed that zzso as a naked zzso has modest but specific zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso is a zzso human zzso zzso with significant zzso zzso These properties make zzso a candidate for clinical diagnostic imaging and therapeutic targeting of zzso as well as potential use in other clinical zzso
