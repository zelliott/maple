zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso factors, is known to be involved in zzso zzso However, its role in zzso is zzso zzso to this uncertainty, the zzso locus can express multiple gene products from two different zzso zzso of the upstream promoter results in expression of the zzso zzso with an zzso domain similar to zzso In contrast, the zzso deleted zzso zzso zzso transcribed from a cryptic promoter in zzso 3, lacks such an zzso zzso Thus, the zzso and zzso zzso possess a wide ranging ability to zzso zzso target zzso zzso the disparity in zzso potential between zzso zzso has given rise to the hypothesis that the zzso zzso can serve as zzso by opposing the activity of the zzso zzso and zzso However, recent studies have revealed a zzso activity for zzso This study was undertaken to address the zzso activity of the zzso zzso Here, we showed that all zzso deleted zzso zzso retain a potential in zzso and growth zzso Interestingly, zzso possesses a remarkable ability to suppress cell proliferation and zzso target zzso which is consistently higher than that seen with zzso In contrast, zzso has a weak or zzso activity dependent upon the cell lines zzso We also demonstrate that an intact zzso domain is required for zzso zzso In addition, we found that the novel zzso domain for the zzso zzso is composed of the 14 unique zzso zzso along with the adjacent region, including a zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrated that a zzso motif shared by zzso and zzso is required for optimal zzso of target gene zzso suggesting that the zzso motif is requisite for zzso zzso
