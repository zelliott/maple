Head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso are known for their aggressive growth and propensity to zzso The authors investigated the effect of a novel zzso mixture zzso containing zzso acid, zzso zzso and green tea extract on human zzso cell line zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso male nude mice zzso zzso zzso were zzso with 3 zzso zzso zzso cells zzso and randomly divided into 2 groups: group A was fed a regular diet and group B a regular diet supplemented with zzso zzso Four weeks later, the mice were sacrificed and their tumors were zzso zzso and processed for zzso In zzso zzso cells were cultured in zzso modified zzso medium and exposed to zzso at 0 to 1000 zzso in zzso Cell proliferation was assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso invasion through zzso zzso by zzso zzso and cell zzso by zzso zzso zzso inhibited the growth of tumors by zzso zzso zzso zzso and exhibited zzso toxicity on zzso cells in zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso at 1000 zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso of both zzso in a zzso manner, with virtual total zzso at 1000 zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso invasion through zzso with total block at 1000 zzso zzso induced zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso has therapeutic potential in the treatment of zzso by significantly suppressing tumor growth and significantly zzso zzso zzso and invasion of zzso cells in zzso
