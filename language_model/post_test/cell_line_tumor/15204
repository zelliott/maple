Previous studies have shown that the small zzso iron transport inhibitor zzso zzso acts by zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso In this investigation, we show that another small zzso zzso II zzso acts in a similar manner to degrade the zzso through a zzso zzso raft zzso zzso zzso of the zzso necessary for interactions with the zzso zzso do not appear to be necessary for zzso II induced degradation of zzso While zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso with or without zzso the presence of zzso blocked zzso II induced degradation of zzso This effect of zzso was lost in a zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso binding to its zzso interferes with the drug's zzso zzso treated with zzso II have lower zzso in zzso These effects are associated with reduced zzso zzso zzso lower serum iron and zzso zzso but no change in liver zzso iron zzso The observed zzso promoted by degradation of zzso by zzso II appears to be due to induced zzso gene zzso
