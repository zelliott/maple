We have previously reported that human zzso zzso reference strains clearly show zzso resistance to zzso whereas different species of zzso are equally sensitive to zzso All the zzso tested were susceptible to zzso whereas only zzso from species C were sensitive to zzso Here, we aimed to extend these investigations to clinical zzso 

In zzso we tested 126 zzso obtained from 65 patients included in a European survey of zzso zzso 

Among the 126 zzso tested, all presented zzso 50% zzso concentration zzso in the same range as the zzso 5 reference zzso Regarding zzso all zzso from species C (79 zzso showed an zzso comparable with previously reported results for reference zzso however, zzso zzso and zzso tested zzso from species A, B and D, respectively, were shown to have a zzso zzso comparable with the zzso 5 reference strain zzso zzso contrary to previous observations for reference strains of the same zzso Among patients who were treated with zzso for zzso zzso infection, zzso or zzso 4 sequential zzso could be obtained from 9 zzso no variation in zzso zzso could be zzso 

zzso is active in zzso in all zzso clinical zzso zzso was revealed to be active on most zzso zzso from species A, B and D, and in all zzso from species zzso Finally, no resistance to zzso became apparent in sequential zzso obtained from treated zzso
