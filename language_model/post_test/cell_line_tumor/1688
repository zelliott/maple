zzso junctions are an integral part of zzso and are often disrupted in cancer cells during zzso transition zzso which is a main driver of zzso zzso We show here that zzso zzso zzso Missing in zzso zzso a member of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso junction zzso in wound healing or zzso scatter zzso by enhancing zzso junction zzso zzso not only makes cells more resistant to zzso junction zzso but also zzso the zzso of zzso junction zzso zzso drives enhanced junction formation specifically by zzso zzso Lastly, we show that zzso depletion reduces recruitment of zzso at zzso zzso We thus propose that zzso promotes zzso zzso and zzso recruitment driving junction zzso We suggest that the observed loss of zzso in zzso may compromise junction stability and thus promote zzso and zzso
