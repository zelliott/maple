zzso occurring zzso compounds have been shown to sensitize prostate cancer cells to zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso TRAIL is a potent zzso of zzso in cancer cells and an important immune zzso zzso in the surveillance and elimination of developing zzso However, many cancer cells are resistant to zzso zzso In this study, we aimed to determine the mechanisms by which TRAIL resistance can be overcome in prostate cancer cells by zzso acid zzso zzso is a zzso component of Brazilian green zzso that possesses zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso prostate cancer cells were treated with TRAIL and zzso zzso was measured by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected using zzso zzso zzso by flow zzso and zzso zzso Death zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression was analyzed using flow zzso zzso membrane potential zzso was evaluated using zzso zzso by zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso was confirmed with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities were determined by zzso zzso zzso The results showed that zzso zzso the zzso zzso cells by engaging the zzso zzso and intrinsic zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the expression of zzso and decreased the activity of zzso zzso with TRAIL and zzso induced the significant zzso of zzso and zzso as well as the disruption of zzso These findings show that prostate cancer cells can be zzso to zzso zzso by zzso and confirm the role of zzso compounds in prostate cancer zzso
