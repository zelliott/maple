zzso is a type of zzso bone tumor with high zzso and poor zzso Previous studies have demonstrated the involvement of zzso zzso 1 zzso in the proliferation of zzso zzso zzso is zzso in human zzso zzso and cell zzso To further study zzso mechanisms, we used zzso targeted to the zzso gene to block its expression in the zzso cell lines zzso and zzso zzso promoted the proliferation of zzso cells in a zzso and zzso manner, however, this insulin induced proliferation was significantly inhibited by zzso of zzso targeted to the zzso zzso as well as by the zzso inhibitor zzso but not by the zzso protein zzso zzso inhibitor zzso The level of zzso zzso was increased significantly following stimulation of insulin for zzso indicating the zzso of zzso zzso cell proliferation was also significantly inhibited by zzso vitamin D3 zzso in a zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso negated the zzso effect of zzso zzso indicating that zzso is important in the zzso zzso of zzso The present study confirms that zzso is important in regulating zzso cell proliferation via the zzso signaling pathway, thus the development of gene therapy for zzso targeting zzso is zzso
