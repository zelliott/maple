zzso human zzso zzso zzso cell zzso is critical for medical zzso In this paper, we propose a sparse zzso zzso transfer learning method for zzso cell zzso First, the low level image feature is extracted for visual zzso Second, a sparse coding scheme with the zzso Net penalized convex objective function is proposed for zzso feature zzso At last, a Support zzso zzso zzso is zzso for model learning and zzso To our knowledge, this work is the first to transfer the zzso visual feature, sensitive to the variation of appearance and shape during cell movement, to the high level representation which directly denotes the correlation of one sample and the bases in the zzso zzso zzso the proposed method can overcome the difficulty in zzso feature zzso for different kinds of cells with irregular and changing visual zzso Large scale comparison experiments will be conducted to show the superiority of this zzso
