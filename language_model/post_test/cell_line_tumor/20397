zzso cancer zzso is the second most commonly diagnosed and sixth leading cause of cancer death in American men and one for which no zzso therapy exists after zzso To meet this need for novel therapies, our laboratory has previously generated zzso replicating zzso zzso zzso expressing the sodium zzso zzso zzso This virus zzso zzso cells and induced functional zzso zzso allowing for zzso tumor imaging and combination therapy with zzso referred to as zzso We have now generated two new modified zzso to further improve zzso zzso and zzso include a hybrid zzso fiber zzso to improve zzso efficiency, and express zzso from the zzso major late promoter to restrict zzso expression to target zzso Additionally, zzso includes the zzso death protein zzso which zzso the release of viral particles after zzso These two zzso specifically induce zzso zzso zzso effect, and viral replication in zzso zzso zzso cell lines with zzso showing earlier zzso zzso and zzso at low zzso of zzso zzso imaging of zzso tumors infected with zzso showed steady zzso whereas infection with zzso led to increasing zzso indicating viral zzso zzso of zzso zzso tumors with zzso showed the most significant survival extension versus control tumors zzso but the benefit of zzso was not statistically significant compared with zzso alone in this zzso These results show the potential of zzso as a zzso for treatment of prostate zzso
