There has been a zzso increase in melanoma related mortality in the United States from 1973 to zzso Although few successful treatments for zzso melanoma exist, it is known that genetic zzso and environmental factors contribute to the initiation and progression of zzso zzso zzso exposure is considered the main zzso factor in melanoma zzso however, zzso and experimental evidence suggests that exposure to environmental zzso contribute to zzso We propose that exposure to environmental chemicals that activate the zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso contribute to melanoma zzso specifically through stimulation of the expression and activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso we investigated the effect of zzso zzso on normal human zzso and several melanoma cell zzso The data presented here demonstrate that normal zzso and melanoma cells express the zzso and zzso and are responsive to zzso by zzso Furthermore, zzso of this zzso in transformed melanoma cells zzso results in increased expression and activity of zzso zzso and zzso as well as increased invasion using in zzso invasion zzso Furthermore, zzso expression of the zzso promoter in melanoma cells appears to require different elements than those required in zzso cells, indicating that this zzso may have multiple mechanisms for zzso of zzso zzso
