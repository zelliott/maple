In a previous study, we developed newly zzso zzso derivatives of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are zzso against both zzso toxicity in zzso cells and zzso toxicity in zzso zzso In the present study, we showed that these compounds and their lead compound, zzso are potent zzso of zzso cell zzso zzso factor zzso expression in zzso zzso cells and primary zzso These zzso zzso zzso also induced the gene expression of nerve growth factor and, to a lesser extent, zzso zzso zzso The induction of zzso zzso was zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso attenuated the ability of the zzso zzso to stimulate zzso gene zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso increase zzso gene expression partly via the zzso zzso A growing number of reports demonstrate the importance of increasing the amounts of zzso factors, especially zzso in zzso zzso Although the precise mechanisms by which the zzso compounds inhibit cell death are under investigation, an increase in zzso factors may contribute to the diverse pharmacological properties of zzso zzso in zzso and will make them potentially valuable in the treatment of neurodegenerative zzso
