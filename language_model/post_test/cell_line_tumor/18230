To identify the role of zzso and zzso zzso deleted on zzso 10 zzso during zzso radiation zzso treatment for zzso lung cancer zzso 

zzso zzso or zzso forms of zzso plasmids were zzso to construct stable zzso of the zzso zzso lung cancer cell zzso Combined effects of zzso expression and zzso treatment were tested using zzso zzso and zzso zzso Related signaling pathways were studied with zzso and zzso zzso 

At steady state, stable zzso showed almost the same proliferation rate but had different zzso zzso zzso When treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso showed higher levels of cell death compared with mock zzso or zzso zzso and showed increased zzso zzso arrest accompanied by zzso induction and zzso zzso zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso resulting in reduced zzso zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso and zzso resulted in increased zzso arrest and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso and then zzso with zzso however reduced zzso levels did not induce zzso arrest or zzso zzso 

Taken together, these findings indicate that zzso may zzso cell death or the cell cycle via zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso We also propose that a zzso zzso could regulate cell death and the cell cycle by zzso zzso
