Aurora zzso are zzso zzso zzso that play key roles in regulating the zzso phase of the zzso cell zzso zzso are zzso in numerous tumors including zzso zzso zzso and are validated zzso zzso zzso a zzso inhibitor inhibited growth and survival of multiple solid tumors in zzso and in zzso In this study, we demonstrated that zzso had potent activity against Aurora B in a variety of aggressive zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso treated with zzso exhibited zzso confirming the mechanism of action of an Aurora B zzso Also, treatment of zzso cell lines with zzso induced zzso in a dose and time dependent manner and inhibited cell proliferation with an zzso zzso 1 zzso It is well known that zzso of zzso (A or zzso zzso enhances the effects of zzso targeting agents such as zzso and zzso zzso to induce zzso and zzso We evaluated whether zzso in combination with zzso is more efficient in inducing zzso than zzso or zzso zzso At very low doses (5 zzso zzso was doubled in the combination zzso compared to zzso or zzso alone zzso A mouse zzso model of mantle cell zzso demonstrated that zzso at 15 zzso and zzso (10 zzso alone had modest zzso zzso However, zzso at 20 zzso and zzso (15 or 20 zzso plus zzso (10 zzso demonstrated a statistically significant tumor growth zzso and enhanced zzso Together, our results suggest that zzso plus zzso may represent a novel therapeutic strategy in zzso NHL and warrant early phase clinical trial zzso
