zzso aromatic zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso to zzso which are able to bind to DNA and initiate zzso zzso induce zzso and zzso activity, which increases the risk of development of zzso zzso zzso naturally occurring in zzso vegetables, possess zzso properties and are able to reduce the zzso zzso zzso In this paper we report our study of the ability of zzso zzso and its zzso zzso and zzso to inhibit zzso and zzso zzso activity induced by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in human breast cancer cell line zzso The aim was to determine whether the differences in structure of zzso change their zzso properties, and whether these properties depend on the type of zzso The results indicate that the properties of zzso depend on the type of zzso zzso are more potent in zzso activity induced by the weaker zzso It was also found that the change in zzso structure influences their zzso zzso zzso was the weakest zzso whereas zzso and zzso exhibited similar zzso The study revealed that zzso of zzso activity is direct whereas zzso of zzso activity is not only direct but is also caused by the level of protein zzso
