zzso zzso is a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are being developed for the treatment of prostate cancer zzso To develop optimal zzso zzso it is important to understand the mechanisms of resistance to zzso that may potentially occur in cancer zzso 

zzso and zzso cells were derived from human PC zzso and zzso cells, respectively, by incremental exposure to zzso Growth zzso Western zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and real-time zzso chain reaction zzso Northern zzso zzso and zzso were used to study these zzso 

zzso cells are zzso and zzso cells are zzso resistant to zzso Although expression of both zzso and zzso can mediate zzso resistance in zzso cells, neither is modulated in zzso zzso In contrast, in zzso cells, zzso and not zzso is significantly zzso but cannot by itself account for the zzso resistance to zzso in these zzso Several genes not previously identified to be altered by zzso selection are modulated in zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, the spectrum of genes modulated in zzso cells are distinct from that in zzso cells, even though both cells are of prostate origin and share the same zzso zzso 

PC cells can adapt to zzso zzso by zzso However, they demonstrate cell zzso plasticity with respect to gene expression upon zzso zzso Further, previously not described mechanisms of resistance appear to be recruited in the zzso PC cells, which provide a novel model to study mechanisms of resistance and adaptation in PC on zzso zzso of zzso zzso
