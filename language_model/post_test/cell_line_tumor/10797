zzso replication of the zzso and protection of its integrity are essential for cell zzso In a zzso screen studying zzso zzso we identified zzso as a regulator of zzso zzso zzso zzso not only induced zzso zzso but also triggered a general zzso acid zzso damage response zzso and caused a block in DNA zzso resulting in zzso of cells in S zzso zzso cells showed a decrease in replication fork speed, demonstrating the involvement of zzso in DNA zzso zzso zzso in cells treated with short treatment of zzso enhanced the zzso which suggests that zzso specifically protects the stability of stalled replication zzso zzso the zzso induced by depletion of zzso critically depends on the zzso zzso and we found that zzso of zzso and zzso zzso the S phase zzso zzso zzso and zzso interact in zzso suggesting direct zzso Altogether, these results demonstrate a novel role of zzso in controlling zzso and DNA replication in human zzso
