A major obstacle to developing small interfering zzso zzso as cancer drugs is their zzso delivery to zzso cancer zzso Fusion proteins of zzso fragmented zzso zzso and positively charged peptides deliver zzso into specific target zzso However, the therapeutic potential of zzso zzso delivery has not been evaluated in zzso Here, we tested whether zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso fusion protein zzso could suppress zzso breast cancer cell lines and primary human zzso in zzso breast cancer zzso zzso transferred by zzso inhibited target gene zzso reduced zzso and induced zzso of zzso breast cancer cell lines and primary human cancer cells in zzso without triggering an zzso zzso zzso injected zzso complexes concentrated in zzso zzso breast cancer zzso and persisted for at least 72 hours, leading to suppressed zzso gene expression and tumor cell zzso The zzso injected zzso complexes retarded zzso breast tumor growth, reduced zzso and prolonged survival without evident zzso zzso delivery of a cocktail of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was more effective than an equivalent dose of zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso could be used to deliver zzso to treat zzso breast zzso
