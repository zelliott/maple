We reported earlier that exposure to zzso bone zzso protein 7 zzso could strongly inhibit serum zzso zzso to zzso cell line, a zzso of the zzso human prostate cancer cell line with propensity for bone zzso Whereas serum zzso suppressed the expression of zzso a member of the inhibitor of zzso protein family, its expression was sustained in the presence of zzso In this study, we present evidence that zzso exposure zzso zzso promoter activity, an effect that was associated with zzso of zzso and could be zzso by zzso zzso Additionally, serum zzso suppression of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso cells could be mostly restored by zzso and a zzso inhibitor could counteract the zzso effect of zzso without a significant effect on the level of zzso zzso Thus, we identified zzso zzso as another signaling mode for the zzso function of zzso To test the effect of zzso zzso of zzso we genetically modulated the zzso cell line to zzso zzso zzso Not only was this altered cell line resistant to serum zzso zzso but it also exhibited patterns of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso similar to those of the parental zzso cells exposed to zzso zzso zzso with these in zzso findings of zzso action, we acquired zzso results of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the progression of prostate cancer in the conditional zzso deletion mouse model, in which we first obtained the evidence of zzso zzso
