zzso Growth Factor zzso zzso targeting in zzso cell lung cancer zzso is an established treatment zzso however, it only benefits a minority of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso plays an important role in the zzso signal zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso results in zzso growth zzso and zzso We have previously shown that combined zzso of zzso and zzso by small molecules resulted in improved therapeutic efficacy as compared with blocking zzso zzso However, the zzso protein has a number of zzso negative regulators including zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso In this study, we investigated for the first time the role of zzso in modulating zzso zzso signaling zzso in lung cancer and the zzso effect of using zzso in conjunction with zzso blockade in zzso We demonstrate that zzso is expressed in variable degrees in all zzso zzso zzso and zzso stimulation resulted in the association of zzso with zzso The zzso complex then bound the zzso DNA binding sequence resulting in zzso regulated gene zzso zzso of zzso using a zzso expression zzso decreases zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso consistently decreased zzso zzso blockade and zzso zzso in combination had significantly greater zzso effects as compared with either zzso blockade or zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso is expressed in zzso cell lines and its zzso decreased zzso zzso activity, decreased proliferation of zzso cells and when used in conjunction with zzso zzso increased the zzso zzso
