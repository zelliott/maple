Despite the experimental evidence of significant biological effects of extremely low frequency zzso magnetic fields zzso the underlying mechanisms are still zzso Among the few mechanisms proposed, of particular interest is the so called zzso zzso resonance zzso hypothesis, frequently referred to as theoretical support for medical zzso We studied the effect of different combinations of zzso zzso and alternating zzso zzso zzso tuned on resonance conditions for zzso zzso on zzso zzso outward zzso currents in the human zzso zzso cell zzso zzso through the cell membrane were measured by zzso patch clamp before, zzso and after exposure to zzso No significant changes in zzso current density were zzso This study does not confirm the zzso hypothesis at the level of zzso zzso outward zzso currents in our experimental zzso However, this is not a direct disprove of the hypothesis, which should be investigated on other zzso channels and at single channel levels zzso
