The integral membrane type 1 zzso zzso zzso is a pivotal zzso in a number of zzso and pathological processes and zzso both zzso and zzso cell lines with a specific growth advantage in a three-dimensional zzso Here we show that, in a melanoma cell line, the majority zzso of zzso is sorted to zzso membrane zzso however, it is only the zzso fraction zzso of zzso that zzso zzso processing to the mature zzso Also, this processed zzso is the sole form responsible for zzso degradation in zzso Finally, zzso processing of zzso is shown to occur zzso after exit from the zzso apparatus and prior to its arrival at the plasma zzso It is thus proposed that the association of zzso with different membrane zzso might be crucial in the control of its different activities: for instance in cell migration and invasion and other less defined ones such as zzso signaling zzso
