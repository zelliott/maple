zzso zzso zzso is the best-known biologically active component in freshly crushed garlic zzso We developed a novel, simple method to isolate active zzso which yielded a stable compound in zzso solution amenable for use in in zzso and in zzso zzso We focused on the in zzso effects of zzso on cell proliferation of colon cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso and assessed the underlying zzso This zzso preparation exerted a zzso and zzso zzso effect on these cells at zzso ranging from zzso to 310 zzso Treatment with zzso resulted in zzso zzso cell death as demonstrated by enhanced zzso DNA content, decreased levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso increased levels of zzso and increased capability of releasing zzso c from zzso to the zzso zzso also induced zzso of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso reporter gene zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso knock down of zzso significantly affected the capacity of zzso to inhibit zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso mediates the zzso zzso death of colon cancer zzso
