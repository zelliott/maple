The clinical value of assessing tumor zzso metabolism via zzso zzso zzso PET imaging in zzso is well zzso however, the poor spatial resolution of PET is a significant limitation especially for early stage zzso An alternative technology is optical molecular imaging, which allows for zzso spatial resolution and can be effectively used with topical contrast agents for imaging zzso derived zzso The goal of this study was to evaluate the potential of optical molecular imaging of zzso metabolism to aid in early detection of oral zzso zzso labeled zzso zzso zzso was applied zzso to tissue zzso fresh oral zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso tumors specimens zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging results show that zzso can be rapidly delivered to oral zzso using topical zzso In normal zzso the zzso of zzso is limited to zzso zzso zzso In contrast, high-grade zzso and zzso show zzso of zzso in zzso cells throughout the zzso Following zzso zzso the mean zzso intensity of zzso tissue averages zzso times higher than that of matched zzso oral zzso in samples from 20 zzso zzso zzso images of zzso oral specimens were obtained zzso and zzso with zzso Prior to zzso zzso samples showed significantly lower zzso than zzso zzso The zzso of zzso samples increased dramatically after zzso the differential increase in zzso was on average 30 times higher in zzso samples than in normal zzso zzso application of zzso can therefore provide image contrast in both zzso and high-resolution zzso imaging zzso highlighting its potential in early detection of oral zzso
