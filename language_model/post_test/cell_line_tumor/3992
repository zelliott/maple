We previously reported that a zzso to zzso low-fat fish oil zzso diet did not affect serum zzso growth factor zzso levels zzso zzso but resulted in lower zzso to omega-3 fatty acid ratios in prostate tissue and lower prostate cancer proliferation zzso as compared with a Western zzso In this post hoc analysis, the effect of the zzso intervention on serum zzso zzso zzso B4 zzso and zzso acid zzso and the zzso progression zzso score were zzso zzso fatty acids and zzso were measured by gas zzso and zzso zzso score was determined by quantitative real-time reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso between serum zzso zzso and zzso score were evaluated using partial correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was determined in prostate cancer cell lines and zzso zzso zzso zzso fatty acids and zzso levels were significantly reduced, and serum omega-3 levels were increased in the zzso group relative to the Western diet group, whereas there was no change in zzso zzso The zzso score was significantly lower in the zzso compared with the Western diet zzso The zzso change correlated with tissue zzso (R zzso zzso P zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso The zzso change correlated with the zzso score zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but not with zzso The zzso zzso zzso was detected in prostate cancer cell lines and human prostate cancer zzso In conclusion, an zzso diet resulted in decreased zzso levels and lower zzso score relative to a Western zzso Further studies are warranted to determine whether the zzso diet zzso effects are zzso through the zzso and zzso zzso
