zzso a potent natural zzso and one of the most promising medicinal zzso is known to possess a broad range of biological zzso zzso a zzso and complex I zzso is commonly used to produce experimental models of Parkinson's disease both in zzso and in zzso The present study was designed to examine the effects of zzso on cell injury induced by zzso in the human zzso cells and to zzso the possible zzso clues in its zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso protects zzso cells from zzso cellular injury and zzso cell zzso zzso also prevented the increased generation of zzso oxygen species and zzso membrane potential zzso loss induced by zzso Similarly, zzso treatment inhibited zzso c release, zzso ratio changes, and zzso zzso zzso specifically inhibited zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso may serve as a potent agent for prevention of zzso zzso through multiple mechanisms and thus has therapeutic potential for the treatment of neurodegenerative zzso
