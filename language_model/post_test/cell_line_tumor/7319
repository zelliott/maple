zzso of the zzso precursor protein zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the first step in the generation of the zzso zzso which is deposited in the brain of Alzheimer's disease zzso Whereas the subsequent zzso by zzso was shown to originate from the cooperation of a zzso complex, it is currently unknown whether in a cellular environment zzso is zzso active as a zzso or in concert with other zzso Using blue native gel zzso we found that zzso and zzso zzso has a molecular mass of 140 zzso instead of the expected mass of 70 zzso under zzso zzso This suggests that under native conditions zzso exists as a zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso of full-length zzso carrying different zzso zzso In contrast, the soluble active zzso zzso was exclusively present as a zzso both under native and zzso zzso A domain analysis revealed that the zzso zzso zzso as long as it was attached to the zzso whereas the zzso domain and the zzso domain were zzso for zzso By adding a zzso zzso retention signal to zzso we demonstrate that zzso of zzso occurs already before full maturation and zzso zzso Furthermore, kinetic analysis of the zzso native zzso zzso revealed a higher affinity and turnover rate in comparison to the zzso soluble zzso zzso of zzso might, thus, facilitate binding and zzso of zzso zzso
