zzso zzso zzso are promising zzso therapeutic agents that have been proven safe in hundreds of zzso While clinical efficacy was limited with the viral zzso alone, outcomes were improved in combination with zzso To further increase efficacy of zzso therapies it is necessary to explore the cellular mechanisms responsible for enhanced zzso elimination in combination with zzso drugs and to develop zzso with higher zzso To this end we generated a set of novel zzso zzso with deletions of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso deletion significantly increased zzso cell killing in combination with zzso drugs including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso through enhancement of drug-induced zzso but did not zzso normal cells to zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso had high cell killing activity in prostate and pancreatic zzso zzso zzso was similar to the parental zzso and zzso viruses in all zzso cells and was attenuated in normal zzso In combination with zzso zzso zzso enhanced cell death in all tested cancer cell lines and in prostate and pancreatic zzso in zzso These data suggest that the zzso zzso is a candidate for targeting of solid zzso specifically in combination with zzso zzso Our findings imply that less toxic doses than currently zzso in the clinic could efficiently target zzso when combined with the zzso zzso
