Exposure to zzso increases the risk of breast and zzso zzso It is proposed that the zzso zzso zzso may contribute to zzso zzso by zzso of the hormonal signal and as a zzso zzso concentrating zzso zzso zzso in the nucleus to complex with DNA, enhancing DNA zzso zzso zzso the major zzso zzso of zzso zzso present in zzso replacement zzso zzso to a zzso zzso that has been shown to cause DNA zzso zzso was found to be an zzso of zzso potency in cell culture using a zzso reporter zzso and, using a zzso zzso zzso was found to activate zzso binding to zzso genes in zzso zzso DNA damage was measured in cells by comparing zzso versus zzso cells and zzso versus zzso a zzso oxygen species zzso but zzso zzso zzso selectively induced DNA damage in zzso cells, whereas zzso damage was not dependent on cellular zzso zzso The rate of zzso DNA damage was significantly enhanced in zzso cells, whereas zzso status had no effect on the rate of zzso zzso Imaging of zzso induced by zzso showed zzso selective for the nucleus of zzso cells within 5 zzso whereas in zzso or zzso cells, no selectivity was zzso These data support zzso acting as a Trojan horse concentrating zzso in the nucleus to accelerate the rate of zzso generation and thereby amplify DNA zzso The Trojan horse mechanism may be of general importance beyond zzso zzso
