Adult T cell leukemia zzso is an aggressive zzso disease, in which a quarter of the patients develop opportunistic infections due to cellular zzso However, the underlying mechanism responsible for the zzso has remained zzso Recent studies have demonstrated that the leukemia cells from a subset of patients with ATL express zzso a specific marker for zzso regulatory T zzso cells, which regulate the immune response by suppressing zzso T cell zzso However, whether there is a functional resemblance between ATL cells that have zzso expression and zzso cells is still zzso In this report, we confirmed the high expression of zzso in leukemia cells from 5 of 12 ATL patients and demonstrated that ATL cells from 3 patients suppressed the proliferation of zzso T zzso Similarly, one of six zzso cell lines showed both high zzso expression and zzso zzso Like zzso cells, the suppression induced by the ATL cells from two patients and the zzso cell line appeared to be zzso by a zzso zzso zzso Nevertheless, among the ATL cells that strongly expressed zzso those from two of the five patients showed no apparent zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of zzso did not zzso any zzso function on low zzso zzso cell zzso These results indicate that zzso may be essential but is not sufficient for the zzso zzso activity of ATL cells and zzso cell zzso
