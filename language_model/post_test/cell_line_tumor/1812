We have investigated the use of zzso virus zzso zzso as platforms for the zzso of genes and drugs to cancer zzso With its regular zzso zzso dimensions, lack of zzso and high infection efficiency in a wide range of human cells and zzso zzso is a promising zzso for such zzso We tested the zzso zzso of zzso onto zzso zzso zzso present on the virus zzso zzso results suggest successful attachment of drug molecules to the virus zzso zzso the reaction conditions did not reduce the gene delivery efficiency of the zzso zzso Unfortunately, decrease in cancer cell viability was not observed with our zzso zzso For future attempts at zzso drugs to the zzso zzso we have identified several improvements than can be considered to achieve the desired zzso in target zzso
