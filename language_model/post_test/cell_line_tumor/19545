Composite promoters combining the zzso zzso zzso zzso core element with promoter elements derived from gene coding for human zzso zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso rat zzso or zzso zzso were characterized for their ability to specifically express the enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso gene in prostate versus zzso cancer cell lines when transferred with a human zzso zzso zzso zzso By themselves minimal zzso promoter elements were found to zzso promote relevant zzso zzso in all the zzso tested, addition of the zzso zzso core element markedly improved zzso expression in zzso a cancer prostate cell line used as a model for prostate zzso The composite promoter was inactive in zzso a zzso cell line used as a model of neighboring zzso cancer zzso Among the promoters tested, the combination of the zzso zzso and the rat zzso promoter showed both high specificity and a strong zzso zzso Neither a high viral input nor the presence of the zzso sequence affected composite promoter zzso Our data suggest that composite zzso promoters constructed by combining key elements from various promoters can improve and/or zzso tissue specific expression in a zzso zzso zzso
