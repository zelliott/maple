The influence of zinc status on the expression of proteins known to be involved in the stability of zzso the human tumor zzso gene product, was examined in zzso zzso zzso zzso were cultured in zzso zzso zzso zinc normal zzso zinc adequate zzso or zzso zzso zzso which contained zzso zzso 4, 16, or 32 zzso zzso zzso Nuclear zzso levels were almost zzso and zzso higher in zzso and zzso cells, respectively, than in zzso zzso zzso zzso which mediates zzso degradation, was zzso and zzso higher in the nucleus of zzso and zzso cells, respectively, than in zzso zzso In addition, the observed reductions of nuclear zzso in zzso and zzso cells to 50% and zzso of zzso cells, respectively, may be a cellular response attempting to zzso nuclear zzso zzso because nuclear zzso is known to zzso zzso and nuclear export of zzso Moreover, no changes in total cellular zzso zzso and zzso or nuclear zzso were observed among the treatment zzso Furthermore, in zzso and zzso cells, the reduction in total and nuclear zzso which is known to complex with zzso protein and zzso in the nucleus for the generation of zzso zzso form of zzso may have depressed the degradation zzso for zzso and zzso and contributed to the nuclear zzso of these proteins in zzso zzso
