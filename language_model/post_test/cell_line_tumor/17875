Breast tissue possesses the zzso for local zzso zzso We measured the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso using breast cancer zzso and zzso breast cells zzso zzso were cultured in zzso steroid depleted fetal calf serum for 3 days and subsequently incubated with each steroid for either 24 h or directly in cell zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso and its zzso zzso were determined by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was evaluated by zzso zzso breast cells with zzso The products E1 and zzso were separated by thin layer zzso zzso was zzso with the zzso marker protein zzso and the zzso zzso marker protein zzso Treatment did not significantly alter zzso zzso zzso zzso protein expression was increased by each steroid in zzso cells but by zzso only in zzso zzso 24 h incubation with zzso and zzso did not alter zzso activity in both cell zzso However, zzso activity was significantly diminished in zzso but slightly increased in zzso cells by 24 h treatment with zzso zzso incubation of cell zzso eliminating cellular regulation of zzso reduced zzso zzso regardless of cell line and zzso In conclusion, the immediate reduction of zzso zzso by zzso is zzso by an increased zzso protein zzso On the contrary, zzso exerts a differential effect on zzso in zzso and zzso zzso The transition from normal to zzso breast cells may be accompanied by an abolished zzso of local zzso zzso
