Patients with zzso zzso develop more zzso at a younger age, and have an increased risk of zzso peripheral nerve sheath tumors zzso We zzso that the increased risk of zzso could be due to zzso in addition to zzso of a second tumor zzso gene located in the typical zzso zzso found in most of the zzso zzso We investigated the expression of zzso the other 16 zzso genes and the 2 zzso located in the zzso zzso by means of real-time quantitative zzso zzso chain reaction zzso in a large series of human zzso and zzso zzso and zzso Five genes were significantly zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso in zzso More interestingly, two genes were significantly zzso zzso and zzso in tumor zzso cells from zzso zzso and in zzso cell zzso This study points to the involvement of several genes zzso zzso and zzso in the increased risk of zzso observed in zzso zzso
