To evaluate the suitability of reference genes in gastric tissue samples and cell zzso 

The suitability of genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was assessed in 21 matched pairs of zzso and adjacent zzso gastric zzso from patients with gastric zzso 27 normal gastric zzso from patients without cancer, and 4 cell lines using reverse zzso quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction zzso The ranking of the best single and combination of reference genes was determined by zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, zzso software was used to determine the optimal number of reference zzso To validate the results, the zzso expression of a target zzso zzso was zzso using the different reference gene combinations suggested by the various software packages for zzso 

zzso was the best reference gene for all gastric zzso cell lines and all gastric zzso plus cell zzso zzso + zzso or zzso + zzso was the best combination of reference genes for all the gastric zzso On the other hand, zzso + zzso was the best combination for all the cell lines tested and was also the best combination for analyses involving all the gastric zzso plus cell zzso According to the zzso software, 2 or 3 genes were the optimal number of references genes for all the gastric zzso The relative zzso of zzso showed similar patterns when zzso by each combination of reference zzso The level of expression of zzso in zzso adjacent zzso and normal gastric zzso did not differ when these samples were zzso using zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso + zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso + zzso or zzso + zzso is the best combination of reference gene for all the gastric zzso and zzso + zzso is the best combination for the cell lines zzso
