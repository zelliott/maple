In recent years, several zzso targeted therapies have been approved for clear cell zzso cell zzso zzso a highly aggressive zzso Although these therapies significantly extend overall survival, nearly all patients with advanced zzso eventually succumb to the zzso To identify other molecular targets, we zzso gene expression in 90 zzso patient specimens for which tumor grade information was zzso Gene set enrichment analysis indicated that zzso zzso in particular, zzso zzso 1 zzso were associated with disease zzso We also carried out zzso screening to identify zzso and zzso that when inhibited could prevent cell zzso As expected, zzso zzso of zzso and other zzso zzso was sufficient to suppress zzso cell zzso The association of zzso in both disease aggression and in zzso growth prompted us to examine the effects of a zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso zzso zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso cell lines at zzso required to inhibit zzso zzso activity, and sustained zzso of zzso by zzso zzso led to dramatic zzso of zzso zzso tumors in zzso Taken together, these findings highlight zzso as a rational therapeutic target for zzso
