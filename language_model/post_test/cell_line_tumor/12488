The chemical reaction of zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso atom zzso zzso zzso in alkaline zzso medium yielded a mixed zzso zzso complex, zzso zzso The complex has been characterized by different zzso and zzso zzso The complex showed intense zzso charge transfer zzso transition in the long wavelength region of zzso spectrum zzso zzso The zzso X-ray structure of complex, zzso is zzso The zzso complex upon zzso from zzso methanol zzso produces an assembly of zzso three zzso zzso guest zzso within the reference zzso host zzso The water assembly showed a unique type of zzso of a distorted cube zzso by hydrogen bonded network of a zzso zzso The complex displayed one zzso zzso response at zzso V and two irreversible zzso responses at zzso and zzso V versus zzso reference zzso The zzso processes are characterized by zzso and zzso zzso theory calculations were employed to confirm the structural features and to support the spectral and zzso properties of the zzso The zzso complex has been found to zzso zzso Fluorescence zzso circular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso together with DNA melting studies have been employed to characterize the binding of zzso with calf zzso zzso zzso gel zzso indicates that the complex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA to its zzso circular zzso form via zzso zzso As determined by a zzso zzso zzso exhibits significant zzso with zzso value 58 zzso
