zzso genetic models suggest that function of the zzso zzso promotes zzso We tested the hypothesis that zzso and/or promoter single zzso zzso zzso in the human zzso gene zzso alter the risk of symptomatic coronary artery disease zzso 

We zzso zzso and then zzso a common promoter and a less common novel coding zzso zzso in zzso subjects with zzso and zzso controls from Kaiser zzso including a subset of participants of the zzso zzso zzso Development in Young Adults zzso We found no association between the promoter zzso and the risk of zzso However, zzso carriers of the zzso zzso had an increased risk of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso In zzso studies demonstrated a zzso reduction in the zzso activity of zzso when compared to zzso We then zzso zzso in zzso participants of the zzso zzso in Communities study and similarly found that zzso carriers had an increased risk of zzso compared to zzso zzso HR, zzso zzso In both population studies, zzso carriers were rare and associated with a zzso decreased risk of zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and HR, zzso zzso 

A coding zzso in zzso zzso results in a near zzso zzso of human zzso Assuming a zzso mode of zzso this zzso does not protect against zzso Assuming a zzso mode of zzso the effect of this zzso remains zzso but is unlikely to provide a protective effect to the degree suggested by mouse knockout zzso
