In this work we studied the zzso zzso pathways in zzso disease zzso versus control zzso zzso a cell model in which the contribution of zzso defects from patients is zzso HD zzso exhibited an interesting increase in zzso levels, when compared to zzso zzso zzso we observed increased zzso rate in HD zzso as revealed by increased zzso ratio, which was reverted after zzso of zzso A decrease in zzso zzso activity in HD zzso further indicated decreased rate of the zzso zzso zzso levels of HD zzso were significantly decreased under zzso zzso which was accompanied by a decrease in zzso Nevertheless, zzso supplementation could not recover HD zzso zzso or zzso levels, suggesting a dysfunction in zzso use of that zzso zzso also caused a decrease in zzso levels, suggesting a partial support of zzso generation by the zzso Nevertheless, zzso zzso levels were decreased in HD zzso which was correlated with a decrease in zzso zzso activity and protein zzso suggesting decreased zzso acid cycle zzso input from zzso Interestingly, the activity of zzso zzso a critical zzso complex that links the zzso to zzso acid synthesis and degradation, was increased in HD zzso In zzso zzso levels of zzso were increased and zzso was zzso whereas zzso and zzso levels were unchanged in HD zzso zzso zzso zzso activity from total cell extracts was unchanged in HD zzso Our results suggest that inherent dysfunction of zzso from HD patients affects cellular zzso in an otherwise functional nuclear zzso
