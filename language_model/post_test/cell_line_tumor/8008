Human zzso zzso zzso and treatment resistance are directly zzso to patient zzso Cell intrinsic factors are reported to contribute to human zzso zzso zzso but suitable animal models to examine the role of aging are zzso Here, we developed an zzso zzso zzso model to test the hypothesis that the age of neural zzso cells zzso presumed cells of zzso origin, influences zzso zzso zzso generated from transformed donor zzso zzso and 18-month-old zzso in zzso adult hosts formed highly invasive zzso tumors that zzso the human zzso Survival analysis indicated increased zzso of zzso generated from older 12- and 18-month-old transformed zzso compared with their zzso counterparts zzso survival of zzso and zzso zzso 77 days, zzso This study showed for the first time that age of target cells at the time of transformation can affect zzso and demonstrated the feasibility of a zzso model using transformed zzso for future examination of the relative impacts of age-related cell intrinsic and zzso factors in zzso zzso
