Classical pharmacology allows the use and development of conventional zzso faster and more economically than conventional zzso This approach should be tested for their efficacy in terms of zzso and disease zzso The purpose of this study was to determine the molecular mechanisms by which zzso a zzso found in the well-known medicinal plant zzso zzso controls zzso zzso 

Using in zzso zzso zzso growth, zzso zzso and zzso models, we investigated the mechanisms of its growth zzso in zzso 

We show that zzso or an ethanol soluble fraction of zzso zzso leaves zzso that contains zzso as the principal zzso agent is highly zzso against zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso caused zzso arrest, most prominently at the zzso stage in zzso zzso cells expressing zzso an zzso present in about zzso to zzso of zzso zzso zzso directly inhibited zzso zzso activity leading to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso arrest at zzso and cell zzso Independent of zzso zzso zzso also significantly reduced zzso and survival advantage of zzso zzso cells in zzso and in tumor zzso by zzso zzso and blocking growth zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2, and zzso These effects were specific because zzso did not affect zzso or other zzso zzso In zzso zzso completely prevented initiation and inhibited progression of zzso zzso zzso 

Our zzso findings demonstrate zzso as a potent zzso agent that blocks cell cycle and zzso zzso growth in zzso and in zzso
