zzso zzso zzso a ubiquitous environmental zzso is generally believed to induce mainly zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in human zzso However, both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are found in the zzso gene in zzso zzso lung zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso methods, we mapped the distribution of bulky DNA zzso zzso and zzso DNA damage zzso in the zzso gene in zzso human lung zzso We found that both zzso and zzso formed at zzso zzso and zzso zzso To understand the causes for these zzso DNA damages, we mapped the distribution of zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso gene DNA fragments induced by zzso zzso and zzso the three major cellular zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso at zzso is a major zzso binding site followed by zzso and zzso zzso does not bind to zzso zzso zzso binding specificity is distinctly different from the zzso binding in which zzso and zzso are preferential sites, zzso zzso binding sites include all of zzso and zzso binding sites and zzso zzso and zzso induce zzso sites at zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso induction of zzso and zzso at zzso and zzso zzso is through zzso zzso We propose that these zzso zzso and zzso contribute to zzso of the zzso gene that leads to lung zzso
