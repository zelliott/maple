We report the zzso of three new zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso a zzso or an zzso zzso that were designed to target the cell zzso The zzso and zzso are poorly soluble in water, forming zzso zzso in zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso zzso zzso bearing a low molecular weight zzso zzso is highly zzso and does not zzso in zzso zzso The zzso quantum yields determined for all zzso were higher at low pH zzso and the zzso zzso had the highest quantum yields in zzso zzso All zzso showed low dark toxicity toward human zzso zzso cells, and the zzso was the most zzso zzso 50 zzso zzso zzso at 1 J zzso zzso followed by the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at 1 J zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso accumulated the most within cells of all zzso at all times investigated and the zzso accumulated the zzso Both the zzso and zzso localized within cell zzso and, in addition, were found in the zzso and the zzso (in the case of the zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso localized mainly within the cell zzso
