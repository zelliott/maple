The zzso of circulating tumor cells zzso in the peripheral blood of cancer patients and their frequency has been correlated with disease zzso 

In this study, zzso were characterized by flow zzso and zzso zzso after zzso enrichment from zzso blood samples collected from patients with prostate cancer in evacuated zzso tubes that contained an zzso and a zzso Events were classified as tumor cell candidates if they expressed zzso lacked zzso and stained with the zzso acid dye zzso 

In the blood of prostate cancer patients, only few of these events were intact zzso Other zzso events appeared as damaged cells or cell fragments by zzso By flow zzso these events stained zzso with zzso and frequently expressed the zzso zzso zzso zzso Similar patterns of cell disintegration were observed when cells of the prostate line zzso were exposed to zzso before zzso the cells into normal blood zzso 

The different observed stages of tumor cell degradation or zzso varied greatly between patients and were not found in blood of normal zzso zzso of zzso and identification of zzso undergoing zzso may provide relevant information to evaluate the response to therapy in cancer zzso
