Stem cells derived from fetal zzso zzso blood are of zzso at early zzso They are sensitive to zzso from the environment, and may be transformed under the effects of zzso zzso This study was to explore the sensitivity of stem cells derived from fetal zzso zzso blood to zzso zzso 

zzso cells were isolated from fetal zzso zzso blood, and the attached cells were cultured in the medium containing zzso conditional medium of zzso zzso zzso A new cell line was gained, termed zzso The biological features of zzso cells were detected by electron zzso zzso analysis, cell zzso Western zzso and colony formation zzso 

zzso cells proliferated faster after passage zzso The cells were zzso and zzso with the ratio of nucleus to zzso zzso Under electron zzso many zzso on the surface and numbers of zzso in the zzso of the cells were observed, the zzso were large and zzso zzso phenomena were zzso zzso analysis indicated that the cells were zzso and the number of zzso was between 50 and zzso zzso zzso data indicated that the proliferation period was zzso zzso and the zzso was between zzso and zzso Western zzso showed that zzso protein and zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso were zzso in zzso zzso According to flow zzso the positive rates of surface markers of zzso cells were zzso for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso those of control zzso cells were zzso for zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso The colony formation rate of zzso cells in soft zzso was zzso 

zzso cells are derived from zzso cells, and are transformed as zzso cells with tumor cell zzso
