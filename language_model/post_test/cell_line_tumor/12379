In the search of new symmetrical derivatives with zzso activity, we have looked for novel compounds able to induce a selective zzso mechanism in cancer zzso The potential zzso activity of several zzso derivatives was evaluated in zzso examining their zzso effects against human breast, colon and zzso cancer cell zzso The zzso value of the compounds that showed zzso activity was zzso These compounds were tested for their ability to induce zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso zzso human cell lines were used to test the selectivity of the zzso compounds against cancer zzso Several compounds showed no zzso in these cell zzso Finally, zzso zzso was chosen as the best candidate and its mechanism of action was studied in more zzso A time dependent evaluation of zzso was performed in the three cancer cell lines, followed by an evaluation of the cell cycle regulation involvement that showed a decrease of cells in zzso phase and increase of cells in zzso phase before cell zzso zzso treatment produces few changes in the expression of genes as evaluated by using zzso zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso is a promising zzso drug showing zzso and zzso effects mainly in a zzso independent zzso
