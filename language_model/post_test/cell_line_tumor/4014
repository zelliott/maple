The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the zzso effects of zzso acid zzso a natural compound extracted from zzso against zzso zzso and its underlying mechanisms in cultured cells and mouse model of zzso zzso zzso induced cellular damage in rat zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells, zzso as reduced cell zzso increased zzso zzso release, elevated zzso zzso oxygen species zzso and zzso zzso zzso also caused zzso phase arrest, increased zzso rate and increased zzso membrane zzso by suppressing the zzso membrane potential and zzso a ratio of B cell zzso 2 zzso and zzso zzso activated zzso protein zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but these zzso effects were attenuated by zzso with zzso a zzso zzso zzso with zzso a zzso zzso also abolished the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso remarkably inhibited growth of zzso zzso grafted on nude zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso effect of zzso is associated with its zzso actions by zzso zzso zzso protein zzso pathways in particular zzso that may serve a linkage between zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso and zzso This study provides experimental evidence in the support of further developing zzso as a zzso agent for zzso zzso
