zzso cells show increased zzso zzso which is thought to be zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso is critical for growth, zzso and migration of tumor cells and zzso zzso is associated with poor overall survival in zzso zzso The present study was designed to determine the role of zzso in the growth and invasion of the zzso cell line zzso using zzso interference technology in zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting the zzso gene were constructed, which were zzso expressed in zzso zzso The level of zzso zzso was investigated using real-time reverse zzso chain reaction, and the protein expression of zzso zzso was observed using western zzso zzso cellular zzso zzso zzso and migration were detected by zzso zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso which could efficiently inhibit the zzso and protein expression of zzso to zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso inhibited the cellular zzso zzso growth, and invasion of zzso cells in zzso These results indicate that zzso interference targeting of zzso could be an effective strategy for the treatment of zzso zzso
