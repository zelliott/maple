The role of vascular zzso growth factor zzso 1 zzso in tumor zzso remains incompletely zzso Recent reports suggested that blocking zzso activity or the interaction with its zzso zzso and zzso has zzso zzso Moreover, several studies showed that zzso mediates tumor progression to distant zzso All these effects may be exerted indirectly by recruitment of bone zzso cells zzso such as zzso zzso We investigated the role of zzso activity in zzso during the zzso phase, zzso prior to zzso zzso formation in mice after surgical removal of the primary zzso Using zzso blockade or genetic deletion of the zzso zzso domain of zzso we demonstrate that zzso activity is not required for the zzso of de zzso zzso zzso in the zzso lungs in two tumor models and in two mouse zzso Moreover, in line with emerging clinical zzso we show that blockade of zzso activity neither prevents nor changes the rate of spontaneous zzso formation after primary tumor zzso Prevention of zzso will require further identification and exploration of cellular and molecular pathways that mediate the zzso of the zzso zzso
