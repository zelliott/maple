Cancer cells acquire drug resistance via various mechanisms including enhanced cellular zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso exerting potent zzso cell proliferation and drug zzso We aimed to investigate roles of zzso in human zzso zzso cells for zzso against zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell lines with high and low zzso expression levels, respectively, were used to evaluate the sensitivity to zzso agents, zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso by zinc zzso IX zzso zzso both cell types to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso gene zzso by zzso validated the zzso effect of zzso on zzso cells against zzso zzso of zzso protein expression by zzso zzso enhanced the zzso and suppression of zzso caused by zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso was associated with increased zzso formation and loss of zzso zzso potential, while zzso alone did not show any zzso A zzso scavenger, zzso abolished the zzso effect of zzso on zzso Combination of zzso and zzso enhanced the release of zzso c and increased zzso zzso The results show that zzso played a critical role in zzso in zzso cells against zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso may be a strategy to overcome drug resistance in chemotherapy of zzso duct zzso
