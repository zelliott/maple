We investigated the effects of zzso radiation treatments on the life spans of zzso rats bearing zzso brain zzso 

zzso zzso or zzso zzso human zzso cells were implanted into the brains of zzso rats, and the resulting tumors were zzso once daily with various doses of zzso radiation for 5 consecutive days or for 10 days with a zzso break after Day zzso 

Five daily doses of 1 and zzso zzso and 10 doses of zzso and 1 zzso cured some zzso zzso zzso However, five daily doses of zzso zzso increased the survival time of animals bearing zzso zzso tumors 5 days without curing any animals of their zzso Ten doses of zzso zzso given over 2 weeks extended the lifespan of the host animals 9 days without curing any zzso For zzso zzso tumors, 5 daily doses of 3 zzso produced an increased lifespan of 8 days without curing any animals, and 10 doses of 1 zzso prolonged lifespan zzso days without curing any zzso The differences in extension of life span between the zzso and zzso protocols were minor for either tumor zzso 

The finding that the zzso zzso tumors are more sensitive than zzso zzso tumors, despite the fact that zzso zzso tumors contain many more hypoxic cells than zzso zzso tumors, suggests the intrinsic cellular zzso of these cell lines are more important than zzso in determining their in zzso zzso
