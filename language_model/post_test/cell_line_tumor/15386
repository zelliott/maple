zzso is a new born science of the modern era and taps into the potential of particles at zzso Bulk materials reduced to zzso dimensions thus obtain unique properties such as zzso zzso magnetic and zzso As far as synthesis of zzso is concerned, biological synthesis has recently sparked a great interest as compared to other available chemical and physical methods on account of its zzso and zzso Here we report, for the first time, the zzso of silver zzso by the zzso fungus zzso zzso The fungus when reacted with zzso zzso reduces the precursor solution and leads to the formation of zzso zzso as monitored by ultra violet visible zzso zzso The zzso of zzso is found to be zzso with good zzso as revealed by transmission electron zzso zzso Cell viability zzso were carried out to assess the zzso of silver zzso on zzso mouse embryonic zzso cell line and zzso human breast zzso cell zzso
