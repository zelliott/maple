The retrograde zzso transport mechanism of motor zzso has been exploited to deliver the gene zzso zzso cell zzso zzso factor zzso into the central nervous system to provide zzso support following zzso A zzso gene delivery system, consisting of a zzso zzso zzso that binds the zzso zzso zzso coupled to zzso was constructed and used to deliver the gene via a zzso zzso The zzso complex was injected into the hind limb of newborn rats to allow gene expression within motor zzso prior to zzso nerve zzso In adult rats, the gene delivery complex was zzso in gel foam placed on a zzso zzso zzso We show that the delivered construct is zzso following binding to zzso and is transported into the brain and spinal cord, bypassing the zzso zzso The presence of the zzso zzso and its transcript could be detected for up to 8 weeks in spinal zzso and brain zzso zzso of the zzso protein rescued 38% of the targeted motor zzso 1 week zzso in newborn rats while the survival rate in control group was below zzso In adult rats, zzso death induced by zzso was almost completely reversed by the introduction of the zzso (95 zzso zzso Thus, the significant functional outcomes of this novel gene delivery system are demonstrated both in zzso and adult motor zzso
