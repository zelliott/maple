zzso zzso lymphoma, zzso type zzso is closely associated with zzso virus zzso To zzso its zzso role, we examined the expression profiles of zzso zzso especially focusing on zzso membrane protein 1 zzso 

zzso was carried out using clinical samples from zzso cases, which were diagnosed between 1996 and 2010 at our zzso We statistically assessed the correlation between zzso zzso and the zzso data and further examined zzso status of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cell zzso 

Most of the 30 examined cases showed zzso zzso natural killer cell zzso and a localized zzso zzso detected zzso but not zzso in all zzso zzso and zzso were positive in 22 zzso and 12 cases zzso zzso zzso cases tended to show a localized disease zzso zzso zzso the Fisher exact zzso Nuclear zzso of zzso zzso and detection of zzso zzso were predominantly observed in zzso cases zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso respectively, the Fisher exact zzso zzso zzso experiments of zzso in zzso cells suggested a positive correlation between zzso expression and zzso of zzso and zzso With a median follow-up period of zzso months zzso zzso zzso the zzso overall survival rates for zzso and zzso cases were estimated at zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso expression shows correlations with zzso of zzso and zzso and possibly has a favorable impact on clinical outcome in zzso
