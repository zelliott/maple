zzso also called zzso a zzso growth and zzso factor that belongs to the transforming growth zzso zzso is a known negative regulator of zzso in zzso zzso of zzso contributes to the lack of differentiation in human zzso zzso zzso We investigated whether a zzso zzso interference zzso system against zzso expression in human zzso cells would enhance zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso system was developed that zzso the zzso zzso III promoter to drive efficient expression and deliver the zzso short hairpin zzso zzso in human zzso cell zzso In this system, the zzso zzso was integrated into the host cell zzso and allowed stable expression of zzso zzso expression was determined by real-time zzso chain reaction and western zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso was performed to determine the cell zzso zzso differentiation markers were monitored by western zzso zzso Cell cycle and zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso and zzso in a flow zzso 

In the zzso zzso cell pools, the levels of both zzso zzso and protein were dramatically reduced by this zzso zzso In differentiation conditions, zzso of myostatin synthesis led to enhanced cell cycle withdrawal, consequently zzso zzso differentiation and increased the rate of tumor cell zzso 

The results demonstrate that zzso of myostatin by using zzso zzso thus may be useful for therapy in zzso
