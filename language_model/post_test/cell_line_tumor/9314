zzso is a zzso factor that plays an important role in cellular survival in zzso and amplification of the zzso zzso is the primary adverse zzso indicator for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a survival factor that has been shown to be zzso in many types of human zzso In this study, we investigated the role of zzso regulation of zzso expression in zzso We first found a correlation between zzso and zzso expression in zzso Real time quantitative zzso demonstrated an increase in zzso zzso abundance in the zzso zzso compared with the zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso protein expression also correlated positively with zzso expression in the zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso cell zzso The same results were seen with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso showed that activity of the zzso promoter was increased in the zzso zzso cell line, in the zzso zzso zzso cell line, and in the zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines compared with the zzso and zzso cell zzso We also identified two zzso binding sites in the zzso promoter sequence and showed binding of zzso zzso factor to the zzso promoter through zzso mobility shift, zzso zzso and dual zzso zzso Finally zzso of zzso expression in zzso zzso cell lines with zzso small interfering zzso or a zzso zzso inhibitor zzso significantly decreased viability and increased zzso in the zzso zzso cells compared with the zzso zzso zzso cells, demonstrating the biological significance of zzso zzso in the zzso cell zzso This is the first report linking zzso and zzso in zzso and it clearly demonstrates that zzso zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso regulation of zzso expression can control cellular functions in zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso
