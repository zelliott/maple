zzso zzso is an zzso zzso that is used clinically for the treatment of melanoma in the zzso zzso The cellular actions of zzso are regulated by the zzso of zzso signaling zzso family of zzso We hypothesized that the zzso activity of zzso zzso would be enhanced in zzso zzso zzso zzso or control zzso mice on an zzso zzso background bearing zzso zzso zzso zzso melanoma cells were treated for 30 days with zzso injections of zzso or PBS zzso zzso zzso survival zzso were used to evaluate zzso zzso control zzso mice receiving zzso had significantly enhanced survival versus zzso mice zzso zzso zzso The zzso effects of zzso therapy were significantly enhanced in zzso zzso zzso zzso of these mice survived tumor challenge, whereas zzso zzso mice all died at zzso days zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso depletion of zzso T cells zzso the zzso effects of zzso in zzso mice as compared with mice receiving a control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso depletion from zzso mice also inhibited the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not alter expression of zzso or zzso on zzso of zzso or zzso mice, or the proportion of T regulatory cells or zzso zzso cells in zzso or zzso zzso An analysis of zzso function did reveal increased proliferation of zzso zzso at baseline and in response to zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso of zzso function in zzso zzso could enhance the zzso effects of zzso in the setting of zzso
