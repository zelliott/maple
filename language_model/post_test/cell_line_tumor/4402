zzso gene zzso are key zzso in many zzso and solid tumors, often representing the primary zzso driver zzso Here, we report an experimental and zzso pipeline for detecting fusion transcripts using zzso zzso FISH and unbiased correlation analysis zzso We constructed a zzso database of optimal zzso zzso enabling quick design of zzso zzso against known and novel zzso We implemented zzso in cell lines, tissue zzso and zzso zzso reliably detecting one zzso positive in 10,000 negative zzso In 34 zzso samples, we detected zzso transcripts with high specificity and zzso Finally, we measured zzso expression zzso and dynamics in single zzso cells exposed to the zzso inhibitor zzso Our resource and methods are ideal for streamlined validation of zzso newly identified by next-generation sequencing, and they pave the way to studying the impact of fusion expression zzso on clinical zzso
