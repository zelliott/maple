A series of zzso derivatives zzso belonging to the zzso class of zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso are endowed with a strong zzso effect and induce zzso in zzso melanoma zzso Among tested compounds, the most potent is zzso zzso which also zzso zzso in a zzso manner and zzso tumor growth in animal zzso All these effects are similar or even more pronounced than those previously reported for other zzso or zzso zzso of reverse zzso or by functional knockout of the zzso long zzso element 1 by zzso interference zzso Taken together with our previously reported results, these data further confirm our idea that cellular zzso induced by zzso are a consequence of the zzso of the zzso reverse zzso in zzso cells and support the potential of zzso as valuable agents in cancer zzso
