zzso zzso has been shown to play a potential role in the development of zzso stem zzso However, the relationship between zzso and zzso stem cells is still zzso This study was designed to zzso this potential zzso We established a highly invasive zzso stem cell and zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso cell suspensions were injected into nude mice brains in zzso and the zzso of graft tumors was analyzed using zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso was used to measure the expression levels of zzso in zzso and other zzso In zzso zzso cells expressed zzso and zzso as well as differentiation markers zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso III, which were consistent with the characteristics of zzso stem zzso zzso zzso indicated that the migration ability of zzso cells was stronger than that of zzso stem cells zzso In zzso zzso cells invaded into each part of the mouse brain from the zzso nucleus in a diffuse pattern and highly expressed invasive and zzso cell markers zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso results revealed that the levels of zzso and zzso were significantly higher in zzso and zzso also a highly invasive zzso cell line we established before, than in zzso High expression of zzso both in newly established zzso zzso and long-term cultured zzso zzso suggests that zzso exhibits zzso zzso This behavior should be considered in further studies of zzso in cancer stem zzso Furthermore, zzso which plays a role in cancer stem cell invasion, may be a target gene of zzso
