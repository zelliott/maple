We compared the acute effect of insulin on the human zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso and the transformed human zzso cell line zzso Over 24 zzso 100 zzso and 10 zzso insulin significantly inhibited the zzso of zzso zzso zzso from zzso cells to 63 and zzso of control, zzso zzso had no effect on the zzso of zzso from zzso zzso There was no effect of insulin on the cholesterol zzso or free cholesterol zzso in zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells bound insulin with high zzso leading to similar stimulation of insulin zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C or zzso protein zzso activity in the presence or absence of insulin was not correlated with zzso production in zzso zzso zzso insulin acutely decreases the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells, but does not acutely zzso the production or zzso of zzso from zzso zzso zzso
