zzso germ cell tumors are the most frequent zzso tumors in young Caucasian zzso with increasing zzso The actual model of zzso is based on the theory that a block in maturation of fetal germ cells lead to formation of the zzso germ cell zzso zzso Early fetal germ cells and zzso germ cell tumors express zzso markers such as the zzso factor zzso It has been demonstrated, that zzso modifications such as promoter zzso is able to silence gene expression in normal and cancer zzso Here we show, that zzso zzso expression of zzso can be silenced by zzso of promoter zzso We found that global zzso of DNA decreased from fetal zzso to mature zzso In contrast, zzso in the zzso promoter were found zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso This selective repression might reflect the cells need to suppress zzso in order to prevent zzso zzso Finally, zzso of zzso in the zzso promoter in germ cell tumors and derived cell lines correlated to differentiation zzso
