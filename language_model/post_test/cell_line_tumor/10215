zzso disease zzso is a zzso neurodegenerative condition, some types of which zzso zzso are caused by zzso in the zzso gene that encodes a protein of unknown molecular function implicated in regulation of zzso zzso Here we present for the first time a functional analysis of the zzso gene promoter which we found to be zzso regulated by zzso a broadly studied factor that seems to be involved in regulating many of the same cellular phenomena as zzso We show that zzso is broadly expressed in cancer cell lines of different tissue origin, contrasting with the restricted zzso distribution reported by some zzso There is a consensus zzso binding site in the zzso core promoter which we show to be functional in both in zzso binding zzso and in living zzso zzso of zzso activated the zzso promoter in a reporter gene system as well as increased the level of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells led to decreased zzso zzso While zzso is known to exert both positive and negative regulatory influences on zzso zzso zzso as well as on zzso zzso in all cell lines we studied (including zzso the effect of zzso on zzso expression is zzso This leads to interesting conclusions about the possible clinical role of this interaction and suggests a broader regulatory zzso
