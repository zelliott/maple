zzso is a well-known cell cycle regulatory protein which is zzso in several cancer cell lines, and known to determine cell zzso We generated three zzso zzso zzso that expressed either the full-length zzso zzso a zzso zzso with a deletion of the zzso zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso binding domain zzso or a zzso zzso with a deletion of the zzso zzso zzso binding domain zzso We zzso these zzso into five cancer cell zzso zzso zzso was induced in all of the lines only following zzso with zzso and zzso In addition, zzso was also induced in zzso and zzso cells that zzso zzso zzso and the zzso oxygen species zzso level was higher than in zzso zzso Finally, the induction of zzso was inhibited by using zzso to zzso zzso This observation implies that there is a feedback signaling loop involving zzso in zzso zzso It appears to be, at least in part, driven by high levels of zzso zzso Next, we investigated the cell death effect of zzso zzso protein on cell fate using sodium zzso zzso Treatment with 1 zzso zzso or 2 to 5 zzso zzso induced zzso or zzso zzso The level of zzso zzso in 5 zzso zzso treated cells was zzso higher, compared with that in 1 zzso zzso treated zzso We also demonstrated that DNA damage response signals including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were involved in zzso cell zzso The magnitude of zzso zzso levels in response to zzso zzso either zzso or zzso in the cancer cell zzso
