The success of complex molecular zzso studies depends on having properly spread zzso However, inconsistency of optimum zzso spreading remains a major problem in zzso zzso 

The zzso spreading process was carefully timed to identify the most critical phase of zzso zzso The effects of dropping height of cell suspension, slide condition, drying time, zzso ratio, and relative humidity on the quality of zzso spreads were studied by quantitative examination of zzso zzso zzso zzso and immortalized human zzso zzso cells, zzso cells, and normal zzso were zzso 

zzso over the slide was the most important variable affecting the quality of zzso zzso zzso improvement in zzso spreading zzso zzso area, less zzso zzso or lower zzso of broken zzso was obtained for all cell types if dynamic cell zzso occurring as zzso absorbs moisture from air, was made to coincide with the prompt fixation of spread zzso to the zzso This was achieved by dropping cells on dry glass slides placed in a shallow metal tray and then quickly lowering the tray into a covered 50 degrees C water bath for slide zzso 

A new and simple method for improving zzso zzso spreading was developed based on our study on the characteristics of zzso zzso
