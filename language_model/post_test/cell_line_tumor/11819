zzso zzso is thought to be largely regulated at the level of transcription, where zzso zzso factors drive specific cell zzso zzso zzso vital to many cell functions, act zzso to decrease the expression of target zzso zzso acute zzso leukemia exhibits both zzso and zzso surface zzso suggesting that the transformed cells are zzso zzso zzso zzso Through zzso and zzso experiments, we demonstrated that zzso 126 zzso drives zzso zzso zzso leukemia differentiation toward B cells without changing expression of zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso early zzso factor 1 zzso or paired box protein 5, which are critical zzso factors in zzso Similar induction of zzso differentiation by zzso was observed in normal zzso cells in zzso and in zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells, with insulin regulatory zzso acting as a target of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells, which fail to differentiate into B cells, zzso significantly zzso zzso and induced the expression of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso These data suggest that zzso can at least partly rescue zzso development independently of zzso These experiments show that zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso fate through an alternative machinery, establishing the critical role of zzso in the lineage zzso of zzso zzso zzso
