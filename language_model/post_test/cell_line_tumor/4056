The zzso of zzso with zzso zzso acids zzso or reactions of zzso with the corresponding zzso zzso afforded zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso with a terminal zzso group on the zzso chain were efficiently fluorinated under conditions that are compatible with protocols for zzso zzso The zzso showed potent zzso activities in the low zzso range against a panel of tumor cell lines, whereas zzso of the zzso were in the low zzso zzso The zzso for the zzso zzso was reduced approximately by 2 orders of magnitude in the zzso zzso zzso zzso cell line, whereas zzso of the zzso was only zzso times zzso None of the compounds acted as efficient zzso for zzso zzso therefore, the zzso zzso need to be converted first to zzso to display a significant zzso potential, whereas zzso derivatives attain modest activity without measurable conversion to zzso
