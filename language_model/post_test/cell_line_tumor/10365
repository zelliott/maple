zzso host inflammatory response causes many diseases, including cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and zzso Sensitive detection of the site of inflammation will, therefore, produce a wide-ranging impact on disease diagnosis and zzso We hypothesized that zzso designed to mimic the molecular interactions occurring between inflamed zzso and zzso may possess selectivity toward diverse host inflammatory zzso To incorporate zzso molecular zzso super zzso iron oxide zzso were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso I domain, engineered to mimic activated zzso in zzso Whole body optical and magnetic resonance imaging zzso revealed that zzso zzso localized zzso to the zzso within and in the invasive front of the zzso as well as to the site of acute zzso This study explored zzso detection of zzso zzso with zzso injected zzso zzso presenting a possibility of tumor detection by inflamed tumor zzso
