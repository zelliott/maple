We have previously shown that zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso plays an important role in gastric zzso In this study, we have used a differential display approach to identify basic zzso growth factor zzso genes in gastric cancer zzso Here, we report that one of these genes is predicted to zzso a zzso finger zzso designated zzso The zzso gene was found to zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acids with a novel zzso finger module at the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Using an in zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso has intrinsic zzso zzso zzso activity and promotes zzso Our data indicate that zzso zzso in response to zzso in gastric cancer might be implicated in zzso through zzso of growth zzso
