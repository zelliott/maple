zzso proteins act to zzso the promoter zzso architecture and zzso of target zzso We used zzso and zzso approaches to show that two such factors, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso exhibit a zzso pattern of zzso binding at many zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was enriched and zzso was depleted at these zzso This pattern of binding was associated with actively transcribed zzso Furthermore, we showed that zzso acts to exclude zzso from a subset of zzso zzso suggesting a functional interplay between zzso and zzso at the level of zzso zzso Thus, although zzso and zzso have similar zzso properties and effects on zzso structure in zzso they have distinct roles in determining gene expression outcomes in zzso
