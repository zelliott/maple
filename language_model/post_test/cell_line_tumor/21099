A majority of species B zzso zzso use zzso as their primary zzso however, the precise mechanisms involved in the binding of different Ad types to zzso have not been zzso Although previous studies indicate close similarities between two members of species B2 zzso in their usage of zzso our current investigations revealed a surprisingly low zzso binding affinity of the species B1 zzso fiber zzso zzso zzso constant of zzso zzso We determined the crystal structure of the zzso fiber zzso and constructed a model of this protein in complex with zzso A comparison of this model to that of the zzso complex revealed structural differences in the zzso and zzso zzso that are part of the zzso binding zzso An analysis of a panel of zzso fiber knobs with zzso targeting these regions in zzso and zzso uncovered a major contribution of the zzso loop on zzso zzso Two extra zzso in the zzso loop of the zzso fiber significantly reduce zzso zzso Although zzso effects permit the use of zzso on host cells by zzso virus binding occurs with lower efficiency than with B2 Ad zzso The longer zzso loop of the zzso fiber zzso also is shared by other species B1 Ad fibers and, thus, may contribute to the low zzso binding efficiencies observed for these Ad zzso Our findings provide a better understanding of how different Ad types associate with zzso and could aid in the selection of specific Ad fibers for more efficient Ad gene delivery zzso
