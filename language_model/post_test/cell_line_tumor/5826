zzso zzso is a widespread environmental zzso zzso that damages DNA by forming zzso This damage along with zzso of the zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso zzso complex zzso responses in zzso To investigate whether human cells are more susceptible to zzso in a particular phase of the cell cycle, zzso breast zzso zzso cells were exposed to zzso Cell cycle progression was zzso by flow zzso DNA zzso formation was assessed by zzso analysis, zzso of zzso human zzso zzso and zzso were used to detect gene expression zzso changes and Western zzso was performed to determine the expression of some zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are involved in zzso zzso 

Following zzso exposure, cells evaded zzso arrest and accumulated in zzso Higher levels of DNA damage occurred in zzso and zzso compared with zzso zzso Genes that were found to have altered expression included those involved in zzso zzso zzso cell cycle regulation and DNA zzso Gene zzso and zzso analysis showed the involvement of various zzso pathways in response to zzso exposure, such as the zzso zzso in zzso the zzso zzso in zzso and zzso the zzso zzso in S and zzso and the zzso zzso in zzso An important finding was that higher levels of DNA damage in zzso and zzso cultures correlated with higher levels of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, exposure of zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso the ultimate zzso zzso of zzso did not result in significant changes in DNA zzso levels at different zzso of the cell zzso 

This study zzso the complex gene response to zzso in zzso cells and revealed a strong correlation between the varying efficiency of zzso metabolism and DNA damage in different zzso of the cell zzso Our results suggest that growth zzso within a zzso population may be important zzso of zzso and response to a zzso zzso
