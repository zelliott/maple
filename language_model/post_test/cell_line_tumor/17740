zzso fusion transcripts are expressed in acute zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Patients who express zzso fusion transcripts respond favorably to high-dose chemotherapy and are generally spared zzso bone zzso zzso Hence it is important to identify this fusion in all patients with acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso The fusion can be detected by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or by molecular analysis with zzso Multiple fusion transcripts arising as a result of various zzso in the zzso and zzso have been zzso In this report we describe a comprehensive zzso zzso to identify all known fusion transcripts and provide an zzso for molecular analysis of zzso zzso from patient zzso Further, identification of the fusion transcript by such an zzso would help in the diagnosis and follow up of patients with cryptic inversion 16 zzso (such as patient 2 in this zzso not detected by standard zzso or FISH and for rational design of zzso for quantitative analysis by real-time zzso
