This study focuses on determining the zzso zzso and efficacy of the zzso zzso zzso zzso administered as a single agent in a novel oral dosage zzso To obtain these data and to characterize the stability of zzso appropriate zzso zzso development was carried zzso The zzso and stability of zzso were determined, and the compound was formulated for oral zzso zzso levels in blood and zzso following oral administration to zzso nude mice were determined using liquid zzso zzso zzso The efficacy of zzso was determined upon oral administration to zzso nude mice bearing zzso human prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso analysis of tumor zzso was performed to establish zzso zzso and zzso expression as markers of zzso The maximum zzso of zzso in ethanol was zzso zzso zzso administered at a dose of 70 zzso yielded a zzso of approximately 40 zzso and a zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso and no toxicity was zzso zzso accumulated largely in the stomach and small zzso and was also present in the zzso This dose engendered a significant delay in zzso tumor growth, an increase in zzso index, and a decrease in zzso zzso We have shown that zzso is a stable compound that can be formulated for oral zzso zzso studies demonstrate the ability of this compound to be absorbed after oral zzso Future studies will assess the activity and zzso of zzso when administered in combination with standard zzso
