To identify zzso molecular zzso of early clinical therapeutic response in zzso lymphoma, an in zzso zzso study was performed on human zzso diffuse large zzso zzso zzso zzso grown in the zzso of female zzso zzso zzso zzso which have been demonstrated to be zzso clinical zzso of response zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but which provide lower spatial resolution, were included for zzso The animals received zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso chemotherapy for three zzso cycles, resulting in stable disease based on tumor zzso zzso of total zzso and zzso zzso in zzso was achieved with zzso echo acquisition mode and image selected in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decreases in zzso were detected by the selective multiple quantum zzso spectral editing technique after the first cycle of zzso whereas total zzso and the zzso zzso ratio did not change until the third zzso zzso zzso extract MRS of tumors zzso the in zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso to zzso revealed a decrease in proliferation rate in zzso tumors that coincided with the decrease in zzso This study demonstrates the utility of zzso as an early zzso indicator of therapeutic response in a mouse model of zzso zzso and serves as a basis for future clinical zzso of these zzso
