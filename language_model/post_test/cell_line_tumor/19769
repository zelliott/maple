This study was undertaken to characterize zzso zzso interactions for human zzso between the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso Multiple tumor cell lines of varying zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso as well as cells derived from primary human zzso tumors that are likely a more clinically relevant model were treated with zzso or zzso alone or in zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced a marked increase in zzso injury and zzso reflected by zzso c release, zzso zzso and zzso zzso degradation in a broad range of solid tumor and leukemia cell zzso These findings were accompanied by several zzso changes, including decreased zzso of vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso growth factor zzso and zzso and increased zzso of stress-related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was required for zzso as a zzso active zzso protected cells against zzso induced by the zzso zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso could also protect cells from zzso induced by the zzso indicating that both zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso were required for the zzso These findings show that zzso interacts zzso with zzso to induce zzso in a broad spectrum of zzso cell lines and show an important role for the zzso and zzso pathways in zzso zzso Further clinical development of this combination seems zzso
