zzso three zzso zzso zzso zzso human breast cancer cell lines, Xu et zzso found a zzso and zzso zzso or zzso of zzso zzso expression by zzso zzso or the zzso zzso respectively, in the two zzso zzso zzso cell lines but not in the zzso zzso zzso cell zzso This study aimed to confirm the findings of Xu et zzso at the protein level by means of western zzso and zzso binding studies using zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso breast cancer cell lines were exposed to 1 zzso M zzso or a combination of 1 zzso M zzso plus 100 zzso M tamoxifen or zzso 182 zzso zzso for 48 zzso zzso and zzso controls were incubated with increasing zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the absence and the presence of 20 zzso M of zzso zzso plots were derived using commercially available zzso zzso zzso responsible for zzso changes in zzso binding were identified by means of western zzso Mean zzso values for zzso were 13 zzso M, 7 zzso M and 4 zzso M for zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells, zzso After stimulation with zzso the zzso cell line zzso demonstrated a mean increase of zzso ( zzso in zzso zzso Adding the partial zzso tamoxifen and full zzso zzso 182 zzso to zzso blocked the induced increase in zzso cells, either reducing zzso expression or restoring it to control zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso showed a mean decrease in zzso binding of zzso as compared to control zzso this difference, however, proved to be not statistically zzso Similarly, zzso values did not change in zzso cells exposed to zzso in combination with an zzso zzso as compared to control zzso Finally, no influence of zzso on zzso binding was observed in the zzso cell line zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso were expressed at high levels in zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso drastically increased in the absence of zzso and was restored to the original detection level after zzso zzso The presented findings support an zzso regulation of zzso expression in breast cancer cell zzso
