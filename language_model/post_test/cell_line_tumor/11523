zzso compounds are emerging as a new generation of zzso agents with limited toxicity in cancer zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the potential impact of zzso zzso the major constituent of black seed, on survival, invasion of cancer cells in zzso and tumor growth in zzso Exposure of cells derived from lung zzso liver zzso colon zzso melanoma zzso and breast zzso and zzso tumors to increasing zzso zzso resulted in a significant zzso of viability through the zzso of zzso zzso leading to DNA damage and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We provide evidence that zzso at zzso zzso inhibited the invasive potential of zzso zzso and zzso cancer zzso Moreover, we demonstrate that zzso zzso with zzso agent zzso to inhibit cellular zzso The zzso activity of zzso was also investigated in zzso mice zzso with the zzso lung zzso Administration of zzso (10 zzso for 18 days inhibited the zzso tumor growth by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth zzso was associated with significant increase in the activated zzso The in zzso target identification suggests several potential targets of zzso mainly zzso proteins and the zzso zzso In this context, we demonstrated that zzso treatment resulted in a significant zzso of zzso zzso In view of the available experimental findings, we contend that zzso and/or its zzso may have clinical potential as an zzso agent alone or in combination with zzso drugs such as zzso
