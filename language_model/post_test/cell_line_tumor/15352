zzso zzso play important roles in many biological zzso including cancer zzso Among those zzso zzso shows zzso activity in some human zzso However, the function and mechanism of zzso in lung cancer cells remains zzso Here we explored the role of zzso in lung zzso 

According to zzso we found that zzso was notably zzso in 19 zzso zzso and 5 cell zzso In zzso experiments showed us that zzso could significantly suppress the migration and invasion of zzso cell lines while it had no effects on the growth of zzso cell lines, and in zzso zzso zzso showed the same zzso Finally, we found that the mechanism of zzso zzso the migration and invasion of zzso might be through targeting zzso 

The zzso zzso in lung cancer could significantly inhibit cell migration and invasion, and this might work through targeting zzso which was newly identified by zzso
