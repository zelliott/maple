The zzso state of pocket proteins during the cell cycle is determined at least in part by an equilibrium between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso 2A zzso Two zzso zzso consisting of the core zzso zzso zzso and either the zzso or zzso regulatory zzso have been implicated in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso While the zzso state of zzso is very sensitive to forced changes of zzso levels in human cell lines, regulation of zzso in response to zzso zzso of zzso has not been zzso Here we show that zzso growth factor 1 zzso which zzso maturation and cell cycle exit in zzso triggers rapid zzso of zzso complexes coinciding with zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso analysis identified the zzso complex as a major component in zzso complexes, which also contain zzso DREAM zzso and/or zzso zzso Of note, zzso is one of the preferred partners of zzso which also associates with zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso results in its rapid zzso in the nucleus and formation of larger complexes containing zzso and enhances its interaction with zzso and other zzso zzso zzso with a key role of zzso in the rapid zzso of zzso in zzso limited zzso expression of zzso results in marked zzso of zzso while zzso zzso results in zzso More importantly, zzso of zzso dramatically delays zzso zzso of zzso and slows down cell cycle zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso in response to zzso treatment results in early recruitment of zzso to the zzso promoter, an zzso zzso Our results suggest a model in which zzso mediates rapid zzso and zzso of zzso independently of the zzso activities that maintain zzso and zzso zzso for several hours after zzso zzso in maturing zzso
