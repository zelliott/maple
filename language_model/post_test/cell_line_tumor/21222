Liver is the most common organ of zzso cancer zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is regulated by complex protein zzso zzso we initiated a zzso survey to seek interrelated multiplex markers related with zzso A total of 34 unique differential proteins were identified in the primary tumor zzso from 14 zzso patients zzso zzso A differential protein zzso consisting of 17 proteins throughout zzso pathway, was deduced and validated by Western zzso A zzso signature zzso from the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was detected by zzso on 105 pairs of zzso and normal zzso The positive protein signature was specifically correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and classified the zzso risk of zzso patients with high sensitivity zzso zzso zzso and specificity zzso zzso zzso The high-risk group had significantly decreased overall survival zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso two colon cancer cells with different expression status of the protein signature, were used to construct the nude mouse model of zzso And the zzso occurrence of zzso cell zzso was dramatically higher than that of zzso cell zzso zzso the protein signature derived from zzso zzso is likely a promising multiplex zzso for zzso of zzso
