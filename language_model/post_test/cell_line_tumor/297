The zzso system zzso and the zzso zzso zzso are the two most important components of cellular mechanisms for protein zzso In the present study we investigated the functional relationship of the two systems and the zzso role of zzso in zzso Our study showed that the zzso inhibitor zzso induced an increase in zzso level and zzso activity, whereas zzso of zzso by zzso or small interference zzso zzso of zzso attenuated the zzso induction and increased protein zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso with the zzso inhibitor zzso or zzso 1 zzso further activated zzso and its downstream zzso zzso while the zzso zzso zzso showed the opposite zzso Moreover, we demonstrated that zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso protein level in zzso zzso zzso which was associated with its induction of zzso to degrade zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso can mediate zzso zzso zzso enhancement which in turn can partially block zzso or its downstream zzso zzso zzso Further zzso induction with zzso protects zzso zzso from zzso cell death by zzso zzso and its related zzso pathways and by inducing zzso to degrade zzso zzso zzso zzso may be a promising drug for protection against zzso injury relevant to Parkinson disease zzso Our studies thus provide a zzso insight into the functional link between the two protein degradation zzso
