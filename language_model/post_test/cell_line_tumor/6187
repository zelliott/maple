zzso gene zzso by short hairpin zzso zzso has recently emerged as an indispensable tool for understanding gene function and a promising avenue for drug zzso However, a wider biomedical use of this approach is hindered by the lack of straightforward methods for achieving uniform expression of zzso in zzso cell zzso Here we report a zzso and zzso zzso zzso cassette exchange zzso technology that yields virtually homogeneous cell pools containing zzso zzso elements in a matter of days and with minimal zzso To ensure immediate utility of this approach for a wider research community, we modified 11 commonly used human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines to be compatible with the zzso zzso Because of its technical simplicity and cost efficiency, the technology will be advantageous for both low- and zzso zzso zzso We also provide evidence that zzso will facilitate a wider range of molecular and cell biology applications by allowing one to rapidly engineer cell populations expressing essentially any zzso of zzso
