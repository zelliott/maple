zzso zzso are zzso and can zzso several protein targets that can be zzso simultaneously on zzso using multiple molecular zzso We aim to demonstrate a zzso scanning fiber zzso for zzso zzso detection of zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso zzso is delivered into a single spiral scanning zzso and zzso is collected by a ring of zzso optical fibers placed around the instrument zzso zzso peptides are selected with zzso display technology using the zzso mouse model of spontaneous zzso zzso zzso of zzso specificity is performed on flow zzso and in zzso zzso The peptides zzso zzso and zzso are selected and labeled with zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Separate droplets of zzso zzso and zzso are distinguished at zzso of 100 and 1 zzso Separate application of the zzso peptides demonstrate specific binding to zzso zzso The average zzso ratios are zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso Administration of these two peptides together results in distinct binding patterns in the blue and green zzso zzso binding of two or more peptides can be distinguished in zzso using a novel zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso on real-time zzso zzso
