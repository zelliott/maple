While it is well known that zzso B2 zzso increase plasma protein zzso zzso in brain tumors, the zzso B1 zzso tested thus far are unable to produce this zzso Here we examine the effect of the selective B1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a compound resistant to zzso degradation with prolonged activity on zzso in the blood circulation in the zzso rat zzso zzso 

zzso administration significantly enhanced zzso in zzso rat brain zzso compared to saline or BK zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso B1 zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked the zzso zzso in the tumor zzso 

Our data suggest that the B1 zzso zzso zzso in the blood tumor barrier of zzso zzso A possible role for the use of zzso in the chemotherapy of zzso deserves further zzso
