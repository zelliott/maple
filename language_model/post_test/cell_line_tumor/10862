zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso are highly expressed in zzso and zzso zzso systems, and participate in motor control, zzso and learning and zzso In zzso functional expression of zzso zzso is essential for full pharmacological characterization of these receptors and for drug zzso but has been zzso We expressed zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, leading to functional zzso zzso currents were zzso with 300 zzso zzso in zzso zzso of cells with evenly expressed zzso in zzso and zzso We dramatically increased chances of detecting functional zzso zzso by zzso introducing two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso and zzso choosing cells with abundant zzso zzso exit zzso Both zzso also modestly increased zzso zzso current zzso zzso zzso were also activated by nicotine and by zzso The zzso currents were zzso by zzso zzso blocked by zzso zzso partially inhibited by zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso recordings showed that zzso zzso had similar single-channel zzso to, but longer open time than, zzso zzso These methods provide avenues for developing cell lines expressing zzso of zzso zzso for both pharmacological study and drug zzso
