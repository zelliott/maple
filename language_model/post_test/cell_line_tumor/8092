Two series of zzso and their zzso zzso were zzso through a zzso zzso The prepared zzso were evaluated for their in zzso capacity to inhibit zzso and the growth of the human zzso colon zzso tumor cell zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited the strongest zzso zzso when zzso but not zzso is the zzso with a zzso zzso which indicates a highly selective mechanism of zzso zzso On the other hand, compound zzso zzso was the most active in zzso colon tumor cell growth with a zzso of zzso The electronic effects, zzso effects and zzso aspects of Id seem to be the most crucial for the zzso zzso Meanwhile, zzso factors and the zzso capability seem to be the most important factors for tumor cell growth zzso zzso zzso there is no direct correlation between zzso zzso and zzso activity for the prepared zzso An in zzso zzso experiment indicates the potential involvement of other potential molecular targets such as zzso zzso to explain its tumor cell growth zzso zzso
