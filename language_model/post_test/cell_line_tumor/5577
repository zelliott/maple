zzso cells cultured in three-dimensional models provide a more realistic and biologically meaningful analysis of the initial zzso of cancer development and drug zzso Several studies have demonstrated that culture of cancer cells in three dimensions zzso cellular resistance to a variety of zzso drugs by poorly understood zzso The role of the zzso factor zzso and zzso of zzso proteins zzso in the onset and development of drug resistance during tumor zzso growth has not been zzso In this work, we found a significant increase in the activity and expression of zzso and its downstream target zzso zzso zzso in cancer cells grown as zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso expression with zzso interference markedly increased the sensitivity of cancer tumor zzso cells toward zzso drugs, indicating a role for zzso in establishing drug zzso In turn, zzso of zzso by negative zzso suppressed zzso formation, whereas zzso of the upstream zzso zzso increased their growth and zzso The present data suggested that zzso and its downstream target zzso were essential for the growth and drug resistance of small avascular zzso
