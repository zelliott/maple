The objective of this study was to design zzso for zzso drug zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and characterized by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The critical zzso concentration zzso of zzso zzso was around zzso M and decreased with increasing length of zzso zzso zzso zzso could efficiently load a model drug zzso into its zzso core and significantly improve its zzso The loading capacity was dependent on the zzso core structure, but the length of zzso core had little zzso zzso formed both zzso and zzso zzso which were dependent on the zzso structure and zzso zzso zzso with various zzso core lengths showed similar drug release profiles, which were slower than that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso loaded zzso zzso showed significant zzso of zzso prostate cancer cell zzso while no obvious cellular toxicity was observed for blank zzso
