zzso are widely used for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis and are also effective in the treatment of bone zzso of prostate zzso Several mechanisms underlying the zzso effect of zzso have been proposed, including direct effects on tumor cells, such as induction of zzso and zzso of zzso 

The detached and adherent cells after zzso treatment were collected separately and stained with zzso blue zzso 

It was found that zzso induced cell detachment with zzso of focal zzso zzso zzso The induction of cell detachment by zzso was prevented by zzso with zzso The zzso of zzso was observed in zzso floating cells, but not in the adherent zzso A zzso inhibitor did not inhibit cell detachment by zzso but it markedly prevented cell zzso 

These results suggest that zzso zzso cell zzso followed by zzso zzso
