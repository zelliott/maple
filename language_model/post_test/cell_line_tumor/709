A better understanding of drug resistance mechanisms is required to improve outcomes in patients with pancreatic zzso Here, we characterized patterns of sensitivity and resistance to three conventional zzso agents with divergent mechanisms of action zzso zzso zzso and zzso in pancreatic cancer zzso Four zzso zzso zzso and zzso were sensitive and five zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were resistant to all three agents based on zzso zzso growth zzso Gene expression profiling and zzso zzso zzso revealed that the sensitive and resistant cells formed two distinct groups and differed in expression of specific zzso including several features of zzso to zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, an inverse correlation between zzso and its zzso zzso zzso was observed in the gene expression data and was confirmed by real-time zzso Independent validation experiment using five new pancreatic cancer cell lines confirmed that an inverse correlation between zzso and zzso correlated closely with resistance to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso lines not only increased the expression of zzso but also other zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso and restored drug zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso in primary tumors confirmed that expression of the two proteins was mutually exclusive zzso zzso zzso zzso our results suggest that zzso and other regulators of zzso may maintain drug resistance in human pancreatic cancer cells, and therapeutic strategies to inhibit zzso and reverse zzso should be zzso
