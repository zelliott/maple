The zzso zzso zzso was extracted and zzso from red mold rice zzso and its zzso activities against human gastric zzso zzso cells were studied both in zzso and in zzso zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso cells with an zzso concentration zzso of zzso zzso while it exhibited no significant toxicity to normal gastric zzso cell zzso at the same zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso resulted in a zzso and zzso zzso as validated by the increase in the percentage of cells in zzso phase and zzso zzso The in zzso experimental data demonstrated that zzso could offer similar therapeutic benefits in comparison with the same dose of zzso After five times of intravenous injection, tumor weight in zzso nude mice reduced zzso at the dose of 8 zzso and zzso at the dose of 32 zzso zzso The expressions of 30 genes related to induction of zzso were found zzso zzso The two most expressed genes were tumor necrosis factor zzso and zzso zzso transcript zzso zzso was considered as a major zzso of zzso induced by zzso This is the first report describing the zzso effect of zzso and its zzso mechanism on zzso zzso zzso has potential to be developed as a new natural zzso zzso
