zzso zzso content is increased in many types of tumor zzso We have investigated the mechanism by which zzso a zzso that is zzso in many tumor cell lines, causes zzso in human head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso cells by a mechanism involving cellular zzso zzso cells treated with zzso for 24 zzso with or without selected zzso were zzso zzso for the presence of nuclear activated zzso zzso and zzso zzso for evidence of zzso and zzso by zzso zzso to demonstrate zzso binding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso of these zzso These effects were blocked by zzso of either zzso or zzso zzso zzso also caused zzso binding to the zzso promoter and increased abundance of zzso protein in zzso cell zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso was dependent upon zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were blocked by the zzso zzso zzso and by zzso of cells with zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso and induction of nuclear zzso zzso share dependence on the zzso signal zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso of zzso is essential for zzso zzso and zzso zzso in these cancer zzso
