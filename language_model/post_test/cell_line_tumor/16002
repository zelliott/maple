zzso zzso zzso can mimic zzso in inducing zzso factor 1 zzso Several cultured cells were examined for zzso to zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here we report that zzso expression of zzso cells by zzso was largely dependent on the culture zzso zzso protein and zzso response element zzso reporter activity were strongly induced in zzso zzso but not in zzso in several cultured cells including zzso a human breast cancer cell zzso Analysis of zzso nutrients has revealed that zzso which is contained richer in zzso acts as the zzso zzso for zzso zzso expression of zzso cells in zzso zzso also inhibited the zzso activity at the same level as zzso suggesting that zzso of free zzso zzso by zzso with zzso was the cause of the zzso These results demonstrate that selection of the culture medium must be considered with caution in cell culture experiments using zzso as a zzso zzso
