zzso zzso zzso formation such as zzso occurs frequently during aging in zzso zzso resulting in the zzso of their structures and biological zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso collagen and zzso and in zzso and zzso motifs during aging, as well as the resulting effects on cell biological functions such as migration and zzso Using protein zzso zzso zzso to monitor the presence of zzso zzso we showed their zzso during in zzso aging in zzso collagen from zzso In zzso aging of zzso as well as of peptides containing an zzso or zzso motif such as zzso zzso and zzso also resulted in the formation of zzso zzso While aged zzso does not alter cell zzso and migration, zzso collagen aged 20 months reduced by zzso cell zzso but not zzso when compared to zzso zzso zzso Finally, by repairing zzso zzso collagen with zzso zzso zzso cell migration was recovered by zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso zzso formation in zzso proteins such as zzso collagen could play an important role in reducing cell migration and that zzso could be a therapeutic tool to restore normal cell migration in pathological conditions where cell zzso is zzso
