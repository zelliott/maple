In zzso bone zzso zzso we studied the characteristics of donor zzso cells, recipient leukemia cells, and the zzso environment that predict the zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso We found that the risk of zzso in pediatric patients with zzso zzso was best predicted by a model taking into consideration the presence of zzso killer cell zzso receptors zzso on the donor's zzso cells and the absence of corresponding zzso zzso in the zzso zzso repertoire (a zzso zzso The risk of zzso was zzso less precisely by the zzso zzso zzso zzso mismatch model or by a natural zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso model, we found that the new zzso model was accurate when analysis was applied to patients with zzso zzso These findings corroborate our observations that the zzso zzso repertoire, which was derived from highly zzso zzso zzso cells, resumed a zzso pattern within 3 zzso of zzso but did not correlate evidently with the donor or recipient zzso zzso In an in zzso zzso and an in zzso mouse model, human zzso cell zzso toward human leukemia cells with zzso zzso zzso increased with the number of zzso mismatch pairs or zzso with zzso and zzso These findings provide new insights into the zzso of zzso effects of zzso zzso cells and therapeutic zzso
