To investigate effect of zzso T cell zzso gene zzso on memory T cell differentiation in zzso 

zzso gene was transferred into peripheral blood zzso cells zzso obtained from healthy adults, and the expression of zzso was detected by flow zzso before and after the zzso Memory T cell differentiation was induced by stimulation with the zzso cell line zzso in zzso The expression of surface molecules zzso zzso and zzso was analyzed by flow zzso to identify the zzso and zzso of the memory T zzso zzso cell sorting was performed to detect the zzso of the tumor cells, and zzso zzso zzso was used to determine the production of zzso zzso for assessing the immune function of the memory T zzso 

zzso zzso showed that zzso gene was efficiently expressed after zzso After stimulation by the tumor cells in zzso the expression of zzso in zzso zzso T cells increased zzso and analysis of the zzso of zzso and zzso revealed that the zzso memory T cells constituted the majority of the differentiated memory T zzso The zzso rate of the tumor cells induced by the T cells increased significantly with also obviously increased zzso zzso in the memory T zzso 

zzso zzso gene zzso can promote the differentiation of the memory T cells, the majority of which belongs to zzso memory T cells that perform immune functions by inducing zzso and zzso zzso
