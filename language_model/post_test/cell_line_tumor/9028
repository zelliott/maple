An important phenomenon observed in zzso metabolism is increased zzso zzso in tumor cells, which is generally referred to as the Warburg zzso zzso growth factor zzso which we previously showed to be induced by zzso acid, is a key zzso factor in glioblastoma, leading to increased invasion and severe local zzso after zzso zzso from its zzso associated zzso In this study we tested the hypothesis, that zzso regulates zzso expression and zzso cell migration via induction of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso 

zzso levels were reduced by zzso of zzso using specific small interfering zzso zzso and competitive zzso of zzso by sodium zzso zzso of zzso was performed using specific zzso Western zzso zzso and zzso were used to investigate expression levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of cells was examined by zzso zzso and zzso Chamber zzso 

zzso of zzso with subsequent decrease of zzso concentration leads to reduced levels of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso addition increases zzso zzso leading to increased zzso of zzso zzso of zzso reduces zzso protein and migration of zzso zzso zzso of synthetic zzso can rescue reduced zzso protein levels and zzso cell migration in zzso treated zzso 

We define a regulatory cascade between zzso zzso and zzso leading to enhanced migration of zzso zzso Our results demonstrate a specific interaction between tumor metabolism and migration and provide a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying zzso cell zzso
