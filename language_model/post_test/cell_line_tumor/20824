zzso zzso mainly by gene amplification, is one of the most frequent molecular events in zzso zzso zzso and is associated with increased zzso and decreased zzso differentiation zzso The frequency of zzso loss of zzso at the zzso zzso which zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicates that zzso and zzso zzso may cooperate in the zzso of zzso We have previously shown that zzso zzso are zzso in zzso zzso and that zzso zzso zzso with zzso for zzso of zzso cells, whereas zzso activates the expression of zzso differentiation genes such as zzso zzso using both zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso amplified zzso cells, we show that zzso zzso inhibit zzso expression at both transcript and protein levels, in spite of zzso effects on zzso zzso To explain this paradox, we found that zzso exerts negative zzso effects leading to reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments suggest that this dominant zzso zzso effect could be due to an interaction between the zzso protein and zzso zzso a hypothesis also raised for the regulation of certain genes by the zzso zzso
