To study the effects of zzso gene zzso by zzso on human pancreatic cancer cell line zzso 

zzso gene was cloned into the zzso expression zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was introduced into the pancreatic cancer cell line, zzso The mechanism of zzso was studied and zzso 

The zzso expression zzso zzso was identified by the restriction zzso zzso was zzso integrated into the target cells and expressed by Western zzso and zzso tests, and inhibited the vascular zzso cells proliferation in zzso In addition, the effects of the zzso zzso on reducing the volume of tumors implanted in nude mouse models were also zzso 

This study demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso by zzso may play a potential role in the treatment of pancreatic cancer in the zzso
