In this paper, we report a method for the recognition of zzso liver cancer cells with the use of a novel fluorescent label based on organic zzso fluorescent zzso zzso The novel organic zzso zzso zzso are prepared with a zzso zzso zzso The zzso network is produced by the controlled zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The organic dye zzso zzso is doped inside as a zzso signaling element, through zzso bonding to the zzso group of zzso The organic zzso zzso zzso are highly zzso and exhibit minimal dye leaching and excellent zzso A novel fluorescent label method based on biological fluorescent zzso has been zzso The zzso fluorescent zzso zzso are zzso immobilized with zzso liver cancer zzso zzso zzso We have used zzso fluorescent zzso to recognize zzso liver cancer zzso It has been observed that the zzso based on the organic zzso zzso can identify the target cells selectively and zzso The fluorescent zzso label also exhibits high zzso
