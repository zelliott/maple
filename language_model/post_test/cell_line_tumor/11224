There is evidence that chronic zzso even when mild, may cause neurological signs and zzso These have been traditionally associated with water movement into nervous cells, as a result of the zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to determine whether low zzso sodium directly exerts negative effects on human zzso cells, independently of reduced zzso We exposed zzso zzso and zzso cells to sustained low zzso zzso thus mimicking a condition of chronic zzso both in the presence of reduced and in the presence of zzso zzso We found that very low sodium zzso 115 zzso in zzso and 90 zzso in zzso significantly reduced cell zzso However, intermediate low sodium was able to cause cell distress, as assessed by the altered expression of zzso genes and the reduced ability to differentiate into a mature zzso zzso zzso these effects were observed also in the presence of zzso zzso Moreover, we performed a comprehensive zzso analysis in cells maintained in normal sodium or in low sodium and zzso zzso and we found that the most altered zzso included genes involved in zzso death and zzso Among the more than 40 zzso expressed zzso the zzso zzso zzso which represents a zzso response to zzso stress, showed the highest increase in the expression zzso This study demonstrates that low zzso sodium causes zzso effects in zzso cells that are at least in part independent of reduced zzso These findings further support the recommendation to effectively correct zzso even when mild and zzso
