zzso is regarded as one of the most promising and realistic approaches in the prevention of human zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso component of garlic has been known for its zzso activities against various zzso and also in recent years, numerous investigations have shown that zzso compounds induce zzso in multiple cell lines and experimental zzso Thus the present study was focused to zzso the zzso effect and the mode of action of zzso against Colo 320 zzso colon cancer zzso zzso induced zzso in Colo 320 zzso cells was revealed by flow zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso zzso also promoted cell cycle arrest substantially at zzso phase in Colo 320 zzso zzso The production of zzso oxygen zzso which were examined by zzso zzso zzso increased with time, after treatment with zzso The activities of alkaline zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were decreased upon zzso treatment, which shows the zzso and the zzso effects, zzso The expression of zzso was zzso in zzso treated cells, compared to normal zzso Further, zzso promoted the expression of zzso and suppression of zzso Regulatory zzso zzso activity in Colo 320 zzso cells that was determined by Western zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso increased the production of zzso caused cell cycle arrest, decreased cell proliferation and induced zzso in Colo 320 zzso zzso Thus, this study put forward zzso as a drug that can possibly be used to treat zzso
