We used zzso cells as a model to study the effects of the zzso zzso zzso factor 1 zzso in zzso zzso In these cells, zzso induced proliferation and growth hormone zzso suggesting a possible regulatory role for this zzso at zzso zzso We evaluated the zzso signaling involved in these zzso zzso increased zzso zzso and activated zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso and zzso zzso zzso channels zzso zzso To correlate these zzso zzso with the zzso and zzso effects, we inhibited their activity using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso ammonium zzso channel zzso All of these compounds reverted zzso zzso suggesting the involvement of multiple zzso zzso zzso only zzso reverted growth hormone zzso To identify a possible zzso and a molecular ordering among these zzso we tested these zzso on zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso From these experiments, we observed that the zzso of zzso increase or zzso channel activity did not affect zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso was purely zzso not involving zzso or zzso zzso and zzso channel activity was antagonized by zzso but not by zzso zzso These data suggest that an zzso increase of zzso activates zzso which in turn regulates zzso channel zzso zzso zzso zzso is an independent zzso In conclusion, we demonstrate that zzso causes both proliferation and growth hormone release from zzso zzso cells, suggesting that the zzso of zzso may represent a novel regulatory mechanism for growth hormone zzso and zzso cell zzso which may contribute to zzso zzso zzso
