In this study, the effects of zzso acid zzso on the expression of zzso and the mechanism by which it regulates expression of zzso was examined in two different colon cancer cell lines zzso and zzso zzso The study shows that under zzso zzso aspirin zzso zzso level expression of zzso zzso as well as expression of zzso zzso Using a transient zzso zzso a region corresponding to zzso to zzso region of zzso promoter has been identified which shows maximum responsiveness to aspirin treatment and found that this region is sufficient for the zzso zzso of zzso A stable integration of a single copy of this region coupled to zzso reporter gene into the zzso zzso also behaved zzso Using gel mobility shift zzso it is found that the zzso zzso region between zzso and zzso is responsible for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso of this region reduced zzso zzso zzso identify that the bound proteins at this region are zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis showed more than zzso increase in the binding of zzso and a zzso increase in the binding of zzso in this region and this zzso zzso to an increased binding of zzso zzso zzso in this zzso Since an increase in the expression of zzso zzso to an increase in the migration of the cell, a migration zzso was performed and result showed a zzso increased migration of zzso cells through the zzso zzso Thus, an zzso zzso zzso for aspirin induced zzso of zzso has been zzso
