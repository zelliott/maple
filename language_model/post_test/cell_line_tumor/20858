Previous studies show that a number of natural compounds from our diet have zzso zzso zzso is the most characterized zzso zzso which are identified in zzso zzso zzso is viewed as a zzso promising agent in cancer zzso Because of its ability to induce cancer cell zzso it zzso progression of benign tumors to zzso tumors and interrupts zzso However, the effect of zzso on tongue cancer cell proliferation has not yet been reported, and the mechanisms that zzso zzso cancer development are still zzso zzso factor 1 zzso expression is associated with zzso and zzso It regulates the expression of many genes including vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso and zzso zzso zzso In our study, we investigated the effects of zzso on expression of zzso zzso zzso which was zzso in many human zzso tumors, human tongue zzso cell zzso and prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso induced expression of zzso via zzso synthesis of zzso zzso was also found to inhibit zzso induced zzso expression through zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso but not zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso resulted in decreasing expression of zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso is an effective zzso compound against tongue zzso and prostate cell zzso in zzso and that the zzso target provides a new sight into the mechanisms of zzso zzso against tumor cell zzso
