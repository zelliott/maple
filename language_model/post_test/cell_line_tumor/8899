A zzso was composed of metal oxide zzso decorated with peptides and fluorescent dye and tested for DNA zzso following zzso light zzso The zzso design was based on a DNA binding domain, the so called zzso domain of the zzso zzso This zzso zzso enabled cellular zzso of zzso and their entry into cell zzso The control zzso carried no zzso it consisted only of the metal oxide zzso prepared as zzso zzso and the fluorescent dye zzso red zzso These components of either construct are responsible for zzso zzso by zzso light and the zzso production of zzso oxygen species zzso zzso of zzso at different zzso locations causes damage to different components of zzso only zzso inside cell zzso can be expected to cause DNA zzso zzso of cellular DNA with zzso zzso decorated zzso exceeded the DNA damage obtained from control, zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso and cell death were more extensive in the same zzso
