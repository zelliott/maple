Using the rat zzso cell line zzso we generated zzso clones that are most efficient for gene transfer, as they contain an zzso site for zzso zzso zzso integration of a single copy zzso zzso the zzso can be introduced by DNA zzso without the need to select individual cell zzso Additionally, the clones contain the zzso zzso allowing zzso induction of the zzso By zzso zzso we define the zzso specific zzso of the zzso zzso cell zzso Using a clone expressing the zzso zzso and zzso zzso factors at a limited level, we introduced the expression zzso zzso these zzso We show efficient zzso induction of these zzso factors by western blots and zzso zzso reveal that these three factors affect a similar number of genes with only few genes regulated in zzso zzso analysis reveals that the three zzso factors affect genes zzso to different biological zzso Furthermore, we document the usefulness of these zzso zzso cells for the functional analysis of zzso zzso zzso factors found in human zzso zzso We show that the expression of the zzso zzso and zzso affects only very few transcripts and these are predominantly distinct from those induced by zzso zzso
