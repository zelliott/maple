We constructed a zzso using a zzso synthesis through zzso of three core zzso compounds zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with 30 zzso acids via zzso bond zzso The simplified structural core compound zzso was selectively coupled with 9 zzso acids as zzso zzso zzso zzso of the crude zzso showed that zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso had an increased zzso against zzso cells as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso with molecular zzso suggested that zzso of these compounds is mainly due to the zzso of zzso regulating cellular zzso
