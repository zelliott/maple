A nerve zzso is designed to improve peripheral nerve zzso by providing guidance to the nerve zzso zzso of such guides is reported to enhance this zzso In the current study, a nerve guide was constructed from zzso zzso zzso which was loaded with zzso carbon zzso zzso to introduce zzso zzso zzso were designed to have a porous structure to facilitate the transportation of the compounds needed for cell nutrition and growth and also for waste zzso We showed that when loaded with relatively high zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso the zzso guide was more zzso and more zzso than pristine zzso zzso The mechanical properties of the zzso were better when they carried zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso loaded zzso was twofold higher zzso zzso zzso zzso and similar to that of the soft zzso zzso zzso was significantly improved zzso from 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso loaded zzso On application of electrical potential, the zzso zzso cells seeded on zzso carrying zzso maintained their zzso whereas those on pure zzso could not, indicating that zzso helped conduct electricity and make them more suitable as nerve zzso
