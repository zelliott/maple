zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso into zzso IX to produce zzso Previously, it was found that this zzso also zzso in the reverse reaction of iron removal from zzso To clarify the role of the reverse reaction of zzso in cells, mouse liver zzso were zzso to examine the zzso of zzso and it was found that the zzso zzso not only to the inner zzso but also to the outer zzso Observations by zzso zzso confirmed the dual zzso of zzso in zzso human embryonic kidney cells and mouse liver zzso The conventional zzso activities of the zzso in the inner and outer zzso were similar, whereas the zzso activity was high in the outer zzso zzso gel analysis revealed that two types of the zzso with different zzso points were present in zzso and the zzso form, which was enriched in the outer zzso was found to be zzso zzso of human zzso showed that zzso zzso at positions 130 and zzso were zzso and zzso at position 130 may be involved in the balance of the zzso zzso zzso When mouse zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso an zzso of protein zzso C, or zzso zzso levels increased, with a zzso decrease in zzso activity and a slight increase in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso to both the zzso outer and inner zzso and that the change in the equilibrium position of the forward and reverse activities may be regulated by the zzso of zzso
