The purpose of this investigation was to determine the zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso obtained from zzso of the commonly used zzso plant zzso zzso zzso 

We evaluated the effects of zzso on various zzso zzso cells in zzso and in zzso We further examined the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso dramatically inhibited cellular growth of zzso cells by inducing zzso Because zzso zzso zzso cells were most sensitive to zzso we used zzso cells for further zzso zzso of zzso oxygen species triggered zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells was in association with the loss of zzso zzso potential zzso and zzso of zzso suggesting that zzso death signaling is zzso through a zzso oxygen stress zzso In addition, zzso activated zzso zzso by inducing of zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso did not inhibit zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso did not block generation of zzso oxygen species, indicating that both pathways were involved independently in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso had a survival advantage in zzso in a zzso zzso combined zzso mice leukemia model without any toxic zzso 

We conclude that zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells via independent dual zzso In addition, zzso has potential as a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of zzso zzso
