The cell growth and cell cycle zzso properties of the bacterial zzso zzso A and zzso C were investigated in an attempt to determine their mechanism of action and to develop these or their zzso as zzso zzso Both zzso A and zzso C have a highly unusual and potentially zzso zzso zzso Even with short zzso both the zzso were shown to have very potent cell growth zzso effects on either Chinese zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso C induced a rapid zzso response in zzso zzso The cell cycle analysis results in synchronized Chinese zzso zzso cells treated with zzso A revealed that they only displayed a zzso phase block upon entry to the second zzso Both zzso inhibited the zzso zzso activity of DNA zzso zzso but neither zzso acted as a zzso II zzso Their zzso of zzso activity was not correlated with cell growth zzso zzso zzso of the zzso with zzso protected the zzso zzso activity, which suggested that they may be targeting critical protein zzso groups, either through reaction with the zzso or with an activated zzso zzso zzso Neither zzso A nor zzso C zzso into DNA, nor were they able to zzso zzso Although the cellular zzso of the zzso has yet to be identified, the cluster map analysis, and the cell cycle and zzso effects suggest that zzso C has a target different than other established zzso zzso
