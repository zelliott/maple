The zzso extracts of both shoot and root parts of zzso zzso zzso displayed potent zzso zzso zzso analysis of these active extracts led to the isolation of six zzso constituents, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (from zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (from zzso for the first time from this zzso The constituents were identified using spectral techniques in the light of zzso zzso B zzso screening of the isolated constituents was carried out against four human cancer cell lines including Lung zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso exhibited the highest zzso with zzso values of zzso zzso zzso and zzso against Lung zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer cell lines zzso To test against in zzso skin cancer models zzso zzso zzso zzso all the zzso were further subjected to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso being highly zzso was again evaluated against mouse melanoma zzso and human zzso zzso zzso cells by zzso zzso displaying zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso Finally a simple and reliable zzso method was developed zzso and validated for the simultaneous zzso of these zzso constituents in zzso zzso zzso Excellent specificity and high zzso for all the standard zzso zzso having zzso zzso of the respective linear equations in the range of zzso was zzso Relative recovery rates varied between zzso and zzso with relative standard zzso less than zzso Based on our results, the developed method features good zzso zzso zzso precision and can serve as effective quality control method for zzso of zzso zzso zzso
