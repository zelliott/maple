zzso zzso of primary lung cancer leads to therapeutic resistance and zzso clinical zzso therefore, identification of key molecules associated with zzso conversion has significant clinical zzso We previously identified a link between early brain zzso of lung zzso and amplification of the zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso The aim of present study was to investigate the zzso and functional significance of zzso expression in cancer cells for the zzso potential of lung zzso 

zzso expression was analyzed in tumor cells from 263 patients with primary lung zzso by zzso and was correlated with zzso zzso The expression of zzso in human lung zzso cells was modulated with short hairpin zzso zzso and zzso specifically targeting zzso 

The patients with lung zzso with high zzso expression in tumor cells showed significantly enhanced distant zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso remarkably impaired in zzso migration, invasion, zzso and zzso penetration of lung zzso cells without affecting zzso zzso with the in zzso results, depletion of zzso in human lung zzso zzso cells significantly reduced their zzso potential without altering their zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in lung zzso cells was also reduced by zzso zzso and zzso and was accompanied by a loss of zzso zzso 

These findings indicate that zzso regulates zzso and zzso expression in lung zzso cells, which positively and selectively influence zzso zzso zzso zzso could be a promising zzso zzso and/or therapeutic target for zzso lung zzso
