Fetal liver zzso zzso 3 internal tandem zzso zzso zzso zzso are the most common molecular zzso associated with adult acute zzso leukemia zzso To exploit this molecular target, a number of potent and specific zzso zzso zzso have been developed and are currently being tested in early phase clinical trials of patients with zzso zzso To explore the efficacy of combining a zzso inhibitor with standard zzso chemotherapy drugs, we tested the effect of combining the zzso inhibitor zzso with zzso or zzso on the proliferation and survival of cell lines expressing either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso had zzso zzso effects on zzso zzso cell proliferation when combined with zzso or zzso The synergistic interaction of zzso and the traditional zzso agents was more pronounced for induction of zzso zzso inhibited the proliferation of primary zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso Combining zzso and zzso zzso inhibited the proliferation of primary zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that the addition of potent zzso zzso such as zzso to zzso chemotherapy regimens could result in improved treatment zzso
