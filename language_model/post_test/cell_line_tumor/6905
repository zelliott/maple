zzso zzso protein 22 zzso is a zzso membrane zzso the zzso of which is associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso produce the highest levels of zzso yet the function of the protein in peripheral nerve biology is zzso To investigate the potential roles of zzso we engineered a novel zzso zzso mouse line by replacing the first two coding zzso of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso mice show strong zzso zzso in peripheral nerves, cartilage, zzso and zzso whereas zzso they display the characteristics of zzso zzso In the absence of zzso zzso of peripheral nerves is delayed, and numerous zzso profiles show loose zzso zzso suggesting altered interactions of the zzso cells with the zzso zzso The levels of zzso zzso a zzso involved in the linkage between zzso and the zzso zzso are severely reduced in nerves of zzso zzso During early stages of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso at the cell surface and can be zzso together with zzso and zzso zzso In agreement, in clone A zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso forms a complex with zzso zzso Together, these data indicate that zzso is a binding partner in the zzso complex and is involved in zzso the interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso
