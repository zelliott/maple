It has previously been demonstrated that in cultured and in zzso zzso cells of classical zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso promoter is inactive and its zzso factors zzso and/or zzso are zzso In this study, the analysis of these zzso factors has been extended to a broad spectrum of zzso zzso and the findings have been related to the situation in normal zzso of various differentiation stages and to the expression of zzso Furthermore, an additional zzso zzso factor, zzso recently described to be absent from zzso and a further regulatory element of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso have been zzso zzso and zzso were present in all zzso expressing zzso whereas zzso proved to be absent from late zzso differentiation stages and from a subset of zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, there were several normal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso populations zzso a proportion of diffuse large zzso zzso zzso that were zzso despite their zzso and zzso zzso This study further shows that absence of zzso alone, as well as zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is not sufficient to zzso zzso zzso Taken together, the simultaneous absence of zzso zzso and/or zzso is unique to zzso and zzso zzso cells and cannot be detected in normal zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso This supports the concept that the zzso of zzso in zzso does not reflect a zzso situation, but a zzso probably closely linked to the zzso of zzso
