Breast cancer is a major health problem that threatens the lives of millions of women worldwide each zzso Most of the zzso agents that are currently used to treat this complex disease are highly toxic with long-term side zzso zzso novel generation of zzso drugs with higher efficiency and specificity are urgently zzso 

Breast cancer cell lines were treated with zzso and zzso was measured using the zzso zzso while zzso zzso associated with flow zzso was zzso in order to determine the induced cell death zzso The effect of zzso on zzso and zzso zzso both in zzso and in tumor zzso was assessed by zzso While zzso was used to determine zzso effect on the zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, we tested the effect of zzso on cell proliferation using the real-time cell electronic sensing zzso 

zzso at low dose (2 zzso has specific toxicity against different breast cancer zzso This killing effect was zzso mainly through inducing the internal zzso zzso and strong zzso of zzso and its downstream zzso target zzso independently of the status of zzso and zzso zzso inhibited also several other breast cancer related zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso the versatile zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and inhibited the proliferation of breast cancer cells in a zzso zzso zzso these zzso and zzso effects were also observed in zzso in zzso human breast zzso 

zzso exhibits zzso cancer properties both in zzso and in zzso indicating that it could be used to consolidate the zzso treatment of breast cancer through targeting the zzso pathway, especially for the less responsive zzso zzso of the zzso
