The authors have previously reported that zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso exerts widely variable zzso effects on 9 human zzso zzso zzso cell lines in zzso and in zzso These effects were independent of zzso baseline expression levels, raising the possibility that more complex genetic properties form the molecular basis of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to determine candidate genes for zzso the cellular response of human zzso to zzso 

zzso zzso obtained in cell lines selected to represent the sensitive, somewhat responsive, and resistant zzso were zzso to zzso Human Whole Genome zzso 

zzso analysis of zzso zzso selected genes involved in major proliferation and zzso signaling pathways identified 19 genes whose expression significantly correlated with zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that 2 genes zzso and zzso were significantly associated with sensitivity to zzso and 10 genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were associated with resistance to zzso Moreover, 5 genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso involved in zzso pathways were unexpectedly found to be associated with zzso Gene expressions were confirmed by quantitative zzso chain zzso 

Based on an analysis of gene expressions in cell lines with sensitive, somewhat responsive, and resistant zzso the authors propose candidate genes for zzso response to zzso The 10 gene candidates for zzso zzso resistance to zzso may represent therapeutic targets for enhancing the efficacy of zzso against zzso Five additional genes warrant further investigation into their role as putative zzso of zzso
