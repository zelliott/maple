zzso zzso zzso is the most common primary zzso tumor and despite recent advances in treatment regimens, prognosis for affected patients remains zzso Active cell migration and invasion of zzso cells ultimately lead to ubiquitous tumor recurrence and patient zzso To further understand the genetic mechanisms underlying the ability of zzso cells to zzso we compared the matched zzso profiles of migratory and stationary populations of human zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso migration zzso zzso and stationary cell populations from seven human long term zzso cell lines and three primary zzso cultures were isolated and prepared for expression zzso 

Gene expression signatures of stationary and migratory populations across all cell lines were identified using a pattern recognition approach that zzso a zzso knowledge with expression zzso Principal component analysis zzso revealed two discriminating patterns between zzso and stationary zzso zzso zzso global zzso and zzso global zzso profiles that were used in a zzso rule function implemented in GABRIEL to find zzso of genes having similar expression zzso Genes with zzso pattern in zzso zzso cells were found to be zzso in zzso of human zzso biopsy specimens compared to normal zzso A 22 gene signature capable of zzso zzso cultures based on their migration rate was zzso Fidelity of this discovery zzso was assessed by validation of the invasion candidate zzso zzso tissue growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso yielded reduced in zzso migration and ex zzso invasion; zzso on zzso invasion tissue zzso confirmed zzso of zzso in invasive zzso zzso 

Gene expression profiling of migratory zzso cells induced to disperse in zzso zzso discovery of zzso zzso selected candidates were validated clinically at the zzso and zzso levels as well as through functional zzso thereby zzso the zzso of the discovery zzso
