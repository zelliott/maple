zzso a zzso of zzso was zzso in the zzso cell line to evaluate the feasibility of using it for gene therapy in neuroendocrine zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso in nude zzso zzso zzso cell line, zzso zzso zzso cell line, zzso as well as zzso cells zzso and zzso were used for evaluating the function of zzso The results demonstrated that zzso transfer caused enhanced zzso behavior of neuroendocrine tumor cell line, zzso Cell zzso spreading and cellular invasion were also enhanced in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes including zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Moreover, cell cycle regulatory zzso zzso and cell zzso protein zzso zzso were also significantly zzso Furthermore, expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Mice implanted with zzso zzso cells showed an earlier and faster tumor growth compared to wild zzso zzso effects of zzso could not be proven in other cells except in zzso These results indicated that zzso does probably not have a tumor growth zzso effect by itself, but rather zzso processes which are necessary for tumor zzso zzso one should be very careful when using zzso as an zzso agent in clinical trials, at least for neuroendocrine zzso
