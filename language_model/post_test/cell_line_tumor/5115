The zzso zzso A chain protein zzso was transported into living cells by zzso carbon zzso zzso as a cellular carrier, as performed by natural zzso B chain protein zzso The zzso of the toxin protein zzso and zzso was found to zzso to the zzso of various cell lines and performed biological functions, as evidenced by the induction of cell zzso The delivery of zzso into the cells via zzso carriers was directly zzso by transmission electron zzso zzso and zzso zzso About three times higher cell death rates for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells were demonstrated induced by zzso zzso compared to those achieved by zzso zzso Especially for zzso cells, the cell mortality reached approximately zzso In addition, obvious selective destruction of cancer cells was achieved by zzso zzso which selectively recognize the zzso zzso on certain breast cancer zzso This is the first example of zzso protein toxin zzso targeting destruction for tumor cells via carbon zzso molecular zzso The transporting capabilities of carbon zzso combined with functional proteins may open exciting new venues for drug delivery and cancer zzso
