zzso sites are zzso zzso with a propensity to form gaps or breaks during early zzso and their instability is implicated as being zzso in certain neurological disorders and zzso Recent work has demonstrated that the so-called common fragile sites zzso often impair the faithful zzso of sister zzso in zzso However, the mechanisms by which zzso express their zzso and the cellular factors required to suppress zzso instability, remain largely zzso Here, we report that the DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso in early zzso cells, and promotes the zzso appearance of characteristic gaps or breaks observed at zzso in zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso breakage is an active, zzso process, and not a result of zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso by zzso promotes faithful sister zzso zzso Our findings challenge the prevailing view that zzso breakage is a zzso process that is zzso to cells, and indicate that zzso zzso actually promotes zzso zzso
