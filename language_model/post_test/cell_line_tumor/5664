Recent studies have shown that promoter zzso of tumor zzso genes is an important factor in zzso of several human zzso The purpose of this study was to examine the zzso status of zzso a novel cell cycle regulatory zzso in both primary oral cancer tumors and the adjacent normal zzso and to clarify the relation between the zzso status and expression of the zzso zzso passenger protein zzso The zzso status of the zzso gene was examined by the zzso zzso zzso in 49 primary oral zzso cell zzso zzso and 6 zzso cell zzso In 13 cases, the adjacent normal oral zzso zzso were also zzso zzso oral zzso from 18 healthy volunteers was used as the zzso The zzso level of zzso and zzso in zzso cell lines was investigated by real-time zzso zzso and the protein expression of zzso in certain tumor samples was confirmed by zzso zzso promoter zzso of the zzso gene was detected in zzso (17 of 49) of zzso zzso As for the 13 zzso cases with paired zzso and adjacent normal zzso promoter zzso of the zzso gene was detected in zzso (6 of zzso of the zzso zzso In contrast, promoter zzso of the zzso gene was recognized in only zzso (1 of zzso of the surrounding normal zzso No zzso of the zzso gene was detected in healthy zzso Only one zzso cell line shows zzso of the zzso gene with zzso silenced zzso zzso however, zzso was expressed abundantly in all cell zzso Furthermore, there is no significant relationship between zzso status of the zzso gene and zzso protein expression in zzso zzso of the zzso gene was detected in a certain part of zzso cases whereas it had very low frequency in adjacent normal oral zzso Although further study is needed, zzso gene expression seems to be independent from zzso status of the zzso gene in zzso
