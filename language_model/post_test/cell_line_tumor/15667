The zzso zzso zzso are zzso in solid zzso and zzso zzso and promote cell growth and zzso Here, we find that a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso blocked the zzso zzso target of zzso zzso activity by stimulating the zzso and thus zzso the zzso negative regulator zzso protein zzso zzso Mouse embryonic zzso zzso deficient for all three zzso zzso zzso knockout zzso zzso demonstrated activated zzso driven by elevated ratios of zzso relative to zzso zzso zzso with these findings, zzso zzso were found to grow slowly in culture and have decreased rates of protein synthesis secondary to a diminished amount of zzso zzso zzso expression alone in zzso zzso was sufficient to reverse zzso zzso increase protein zzso and drive zzso growth similar to wild zzso zzso expression was found to markedly increase the protein levels of both zzso and the zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso zzso capable of regulating zzso and zzso zzso which were diminished in zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso elevated zzso levels and inhibited the zzso of zzso These results demonstrate the zzso zzso control of energy metabolism and thus regulation of zzso zzso We identify an important role for zzso in modulating zzso and zzso protein levels and cell zzso
