To overcome the unresolved issues of conventional therapeutic approaches such as radiation therapy, chemotherapy, zzso chemotherapy, and surgical treatment, we designed an zzso zzso long-term therapeutic zzso zzso system as an zzso approach for brain zzso The zzso system consists of a zzso zzso zzso (the magnetic zzso as a zzso imaging platform and an zzso drug as a therapeutic agent via a simple physical zzso The zzso system has adequate properties for the zzso long-term therapy as zzso zzso zzso due to fast zzso at body temperature, zzso zzso sustained drug release, and MR imaging zzso Since the zzso system only requires a very zzso pin hole injected into the area of brain tumors zzso we suggest that the zzso system can be an zzso approach to treat the zzso brain tumors without any surgical zzso Furthermore, we expect that the zzso system can minimize the side effects from either an intravenous injection or surgical operation because one of the aims of zzso is to focus on the sustained local delivery of zzso drugs via a one- or two-time zzso zzso Thus, we assessed successfully the zzso long-term therapeutic zzso of the zzso system for brain tumors and estimated the zzso efficacy of tumor growth via an zzso long-term therapy in this zzso
