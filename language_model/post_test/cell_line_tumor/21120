As part of the innate immune system, natural killer zzso cells detect and lyse tumor and zzso cells without prior zzso recognition and zzso To this end, they zzso zzso zzso that combine properties of conventional zzso and zzso zzso Upon zzso these zzso zzso zzso release their zzso molecules into the zzso zzso In addition, several molecules associated with zzso zzso become exposed on the plasma zzso Recent studies often took advantage of the few established zzso cell lines, for instance to analyze the zzso machinery associated with zzso cell zzso zzso cell lines and primary zzso cells zzso however, substantially in the expression of zzso surface receptors and their requirements to induce target cell zzso Here, we directly compared the zzso compartments of different zzso cell zzso We enriched zzso of two zzso cell lines zzso and zzso and zzso zzso cells by zzso zzso and characterized their zzso by zzso difference gel zzso and zzso Although the overall protein composition of the zzso preparations was very similar and more than zzso of the proteins were present at comparable levels, we define a cell zzso setup of functionally relevant proteins involved in zzso presentation and zzso zzso zzso
