zzso zzso has been described as a highly efficient gene carrier due to its efficient zzso sponge effect within zzso However, many studies have demonstrated that zzso is toxic and associated with a lack of cell specificity despite high zzso zzso In order to minimize the toxicity of zzso we prepared zzso zzso in a previous zzso zzso showed low toxicity and high zzso zzso However, this compound also had limited target cell zzso In the present study, we zzso zzso zzso zzso because this modified zzso could be delivered specifically into the liver due to zzso zzso zzso The zzso properties of zzso at various zzso weight ratios were evaluated by a gel zzso zzso The zzso zzso exhibited significant zzso ability and efficiently protected DNA from zzso zzso Using zzso transmission electron zzso zzso we observed dense zzso zzso zzso complexes with a zzso zzso Most importantly, zzso was associated with remarkably low zzso compared to zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso carriers specifically delivered the zzso into zzso in zzso as well as in zzso Our results suggest that the novel zzso described here is a safe and highly efficient carrier for zzso gene zzso
