The present work describes the zzso activity of zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its possible mode of action involving induction of zzso zzso stress and decrease in zzso against zzso zzso Dalton's zzso The structure of isolated compound was confirmed as zzso by X-ray zzso zzso zzso treatment showed potent zzso activity with an increase in life span zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso treatment induced zzso in Dalton's zzso cells and also caused an zzso stress due to generation of zzso oxygen species zzso and an increase in zzso zzso The observed zzso decrease in zzso and zzso related zzso activities in the tumor cells may weaken the cellular zzso zzso Moreover, zzso treatment also caused a significant decrease in zzso zzso c and simultaneous increase in zzso zzso c which ultimately zzso zzso of zzso 9 and 3 to augment zzso zzso zzso causing cancer cell zzso Based on the present findings, it may be suggested that zzso zzso activity could be due to decrease in the protective ability of cancer cells by zzso and subsequent zzso of zzso zzso leading to zzso cell zzso
