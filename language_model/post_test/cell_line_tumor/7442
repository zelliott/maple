The zzso protein zzso zzso signals to cell cycle and DNA repair components by zzso downstream targets such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso occurs in the human zzso zzso disorder zzso which is characterized by hypersensitivity to zzso radiation and a failure of cells to arrest the cell cycle after the induction of DNA zzso zzso It has thus been proposed that zzso zzso would cause cellular zzso and zzso Through screening a small zzso compound library developed for the zzso zzso zzso family, we identified an zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso with an zzso of 13 zzso and a Ki of zzso zzso zzso shows specificity with respect to zzso of other zzso zzso zzso Cellular zzso of zzso by zzso was demonstrated by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of a range of zzso targets, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not show zzso of zzso light DNA damage induced cellular zzso zzso Exposure of cells to zzso resulted in a significant zzso to the zzso effects of zzso radiation and to the DNA zzso zzso zzso agents, zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso by zzso also caused a loss of zzso zzso cell cycle zzso By contrast, zzso did not zzso the zzso effects of zzso radiation on zzso cells, nor did it affect their cell cycle profile after DNA zzso We conclude that zzso is a novel, specific, and potent inhibitor of the zzso zzso
