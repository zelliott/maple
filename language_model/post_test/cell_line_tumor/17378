Breast cancer zzso zzso 1 zzso suppresses zzso of multiple human and zzso cancer cells without zzso zzso By zzso zzso and zzso zzso interacts with zzso binding protein 1 and at least seven members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso complex in human breast and melanoma cell zzso zzso zzso zzso active zzso proteins and zzso zzso when recruited to a zzso promoter in zzso zzso exists in large zzso zzso of approximately zzso zzso but also forms smaller complexes with zzso zzso analyses show that the zzso 42 zzso acids of zzso are not critical for interaction with much of the zzso complex and that zzso appears to have more than one binding point to the zzso These results further show that zzso may participate in zzso regulation via interaction with the zzso complex and suggest a novel mechanism by which zzso might suppress cancer zzso
