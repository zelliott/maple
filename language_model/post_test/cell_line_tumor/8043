In the zzso chemical and electrical zzso couple zzso into functional zzso New candidates zzso for electrical zzso proteins have recently zzso In the present study, we determined the zzso of the candidate protein zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and studied the functional properties of zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified on the surface of horizontal cell zzso zzso deeply into the cone zzso near the zzso release sites of the cones, providing in zzso evidence for zzso formation at that zzso This strategic position of zzso in the zzso zzso could potentially allow zzso of cone zzso Using whole cell zzso clamp and excised patch recordings of zzso zzso cells, we demonstrated that zzso forms zzso zzso with a large zzso zzso in zzso These channels can open at zzso membrane zzso zzso channels were not formed following zzso of a single zzso acid within a zzso protein motif recently shown to be zzso in zzso zzso Together, these findings indicate that zzso displays properties similar to its zzso zzso and can potentially play an important role in functions of the outer zzso
