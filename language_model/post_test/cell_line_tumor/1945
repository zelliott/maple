zzso diseases associated with the conversion of the cellular prion protein zzso to the zzso zzso zzso affect the central nervous system zzso of humans and zzso zzso an zzso of class III zzso zzso zzso is important in attenuating cellular injury and zzso zzso The present study investigated the effects of zzso zzso on prion zzso zzso cell death and examined its possible signals in zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment significantly increased both zzso protein expression and zzso activity and protected zzso cells against zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased the zzso of zzso and zzso induced by prion protein and zzso zzso zzso zzso also inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and increased the expression of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso by using zzso zzso protected zzso cells against zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell death by regulating zzso activity and zzso zzso and suggest that zzso disease may be attenuated by zzso zzso or by intake of zzso zzso
