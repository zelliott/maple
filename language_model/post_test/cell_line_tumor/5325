zzso zzso manifest frequent tumor recurrence after surgical zzso and/or other treatment because of their nature of zzso and zzso The recognized brain zzso property of neural zzso cells opened the possibility of targeting zzso brain tumors using neural zzso zzso We and others have previously shown that fetal neural zzso cells can be used to deliver therapeutic molecules to brain zzso Our recent work has further shown that gene delivery by bone zzso neural zzso cells achieves therapeutic effects in a zzso zzso In this study, we isolate and characterize bone zzso neural zzso cells, which also express the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso We show that zzso is required for their zzso and zzso zzso invasion against a zzso of zzso soluble zzso Furthermore, zzso bone zzso neural zzso cells implanted in the zzso side of the brain were shown to track zzso as early as day 1 and increased through days 3 and zzso zzso zzso tracking by bone zzso neural zzso cells is significantly inhibited by zzso of bone zzso neural zzso cells with a blocking zzso zzso suggesting a zzso tracking zzso zzso tracking bone zzso neural zzso cells were found to express zzso cell zzso as well as zzso Although zzso incorporation zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicated that tumor tracking bone zzso neural zzso cells were mostly zzso these cells survive in the local tumor environment with little zzso zzso the molecular mechanism of brain tumor tracking by adult source stem cells may provide basis for the development of future targeted therapy for zzso brain zzso
