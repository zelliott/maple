Genes coding for DNA zzso zzso iota and zzso or for both Pol zzso and Pol iota have been zzso by zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso cell line, thus providing for the first time the total suppression of these zzso in a human zzso The zzso sensitivities and zzso zzso on an zzso shuttle zzso have been analyzed for these deficient cell zzso The double Pol zzso deficient cell line was more zzso sensitive than the Pol zzso cell line and zzso hotspots specific to the Pol zzso context appeared to require the presence of Pol iota, thus strengthening the view that Pol iota is involved in zzso damage zzso synthesis and zzso zzso A role for Pol zzso in a damage repair process at late zzso stages is reported, which may explain the drastic zzso zzso observed when this zzso is zzso A specific zzso pattern was observed for the zzso shuttle zzso zzso in Pol zzso cell lines, which, in contrast to zzso at the zzso locus previously reported, zzso resembled zzso observed in zzso skin zzso in zzso Finally, a Pol zzso zzso zzso (without its zzso binding zzso could completely restore the zzso resistance in a Pol zzso deficient cell line, in the absence of zzso zzso zzso as observed for Pol iota in a Pol zzso background, that zzso may occur without the zzso of microscopically visible repair zzso
