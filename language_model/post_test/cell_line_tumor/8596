A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been cloned and characterized for the first zzso zzso zzso of natural zzso and zzso zzso was observed, with zzso the preferred natural zzso zzso zzso 61 zzso Several zzso zzso zzso zzso proved to be susceptible to zzso zzso and a markedly decreased or increased zzso activity was observed in zzso zzso human breast zzso zzso cell cultures zzso depending on the properties of the released zzso zzso We demonstrated an zzso loss of zzso activity of zzso in zzso cells and observed a rapid and complete zzso of this drug when it was exposed to the zzso of zzso zzso This conversion zzso could be prevented by a specific zzso zzso These findings correlated well with the high efficiency of zzso zzso of zzso to its less toxic base zzso zzso zzso 80 zzso In contrast, the zzso activity of zzso zzso carrying a highly toxic zzso base and being a zzso for zzso but not human zzso was substantially increased in zzso cells zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso of the mycoplasma from the tumor cell cultures or selective zzso of zzso by a zzso inhibitor restored the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso Since several studies suggest a high and preferential colonization or association of tumor tissue in cancer patients with different zzso (including zzso the data presented here may be of relevance for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso drug zzso
