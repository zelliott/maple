The zzso of infection by zzso zzso is largely due to its zzso zzso which consist of a carrier zzso the protective zzso zzso in combination with either the zzso or zzso zzso During zzso zzso infections, PA zzso by bacteria binds to membrane receptors of susceptible cells, is zzso zzso zzso to lethal factor or zzso factor, zzso zzso and zzso and zzso its toxin partners to zzso zzso where they are released into the zzso To identify specific host functions that mediate these events, we used zzso zzso by a zzso library of approximately 40,000 human zzso to zzso zzso genes in a human cell population, and we isolated clones that survived zzso zzso zzso This zzso screen and subsequent analysis identified zzso which is a zzso protein implicated previously in membrane zzso trafficking and zzso organization, as a zzso zzso gene that is essential for normal anthrax zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso expression of an zzso zzso impaired entry of PA and its bound zzso zzso into both human and mouse cells, resulting in reduced toxin zzso Our results demonstrate the usefulness of zzso zzso libraries for global zzso gene zzso establish the practicality of zzso zzso screens for the identification of zzso zzso required for pathogen effects in zzso cells, and reveal an important role for zzso in cellular zzso of anthrax zzso
