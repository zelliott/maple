This article describes the production and characterization of zzso zzso particles constituted with zzso zzso 100, plus different zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso ammonium zzso zzso as a transport and delivery system for zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso hybrids and zzso zzso zzso particles could offer advantages over other delivery systems because they maintain zzso zzso properties for long time zzso allowing long-term storage, and are suitable for industrial zzso zzso particles were characterized in terms of size, size distribution, zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, the in zzso activity and ability of zzso particles to complex different types of zzso acids were zzso Finally, the ability of zzso particles to deliver functional genes to cells cultured in zzso was determined by a zzso activity zzso demonstrating that zzso particles possess superior zzso efficiency with respect to commercially available, zzso zzso zzso
