In order to apply zzso therapy zzso to pigmented melanoma, the efficacy of zzso zzso by zzso alpha from zzso zzso zzso and commercial zzso against zzso melanoma was comparatively studied from the in zzso zzso using zzso zzso From in zzso zzso zzso the proliferation of zzso cells treated with zzso (more than zzso zzso and light zzso zzso zzso were significantly inhibited with the zzso zzso This indicated that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso was not influenced by zzso from zzso From the assessment of the in zzso zzso activity, the tumor growth was further delayed in groups treated with zzso compared to that treated with zzso zzso The survival rate of tumor bearing mice treated with zzso was closely associated with its zzso zzso In addition, the zzso effect of zzso showed a dose dependent tendency in light zzso These results demonstrated that zzso melanoma cells were significantly zzso by zzso regardless of the influence of zzso from melanoma, and zzso at very low drug dose (1 zzso and light dose zzso zzso showed the zzso efficacy zzso zzso against zzso melanoma in mice zzso
