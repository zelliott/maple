The zzso of zzso precursor protein zzso by zzso and zzso results in the production of zzso zzso in Alzheimer's zzso We raised two zzso zzso zzso and zzso that recognize the zzso zzso site on zzso but not zzso We hypothesized that these zzso would reduce zzso levels via zzso hindrance of zzso Both zzso decreased zzso zzso levels from zzso cells, but zzso was more potent than zzso zzso of soluble zzso from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were not affected by either zzso nor were there any effects on cell zzso zzso exhibited a higher affinity for zzso than zzso and its zzso appeared to span the zzso site, whereas zzso bound slightly zzso Both of these factors probably contribute to its greater effect on zzso zzso After 60 zzso incubation at pH zzso most zzso and zzso remained bound to their zzso suggesting that the zzso will remain bound to zzso in the zzso zzso where zzso zzso probably zzso Only zzso and zzso but not control zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso by zzso in a zzso zzso where the effects of zzso zzso and zzso degradation were zzso zzso virtually abolished this zzso In addition, levels of zzso zzso fragments, generated following zzso zzso zzso were significantly reduced in cells after incubation with zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso site zzso can generically reduce zzso levels via zzso of zzso by zzso hindrance and may provide a novel alternative therapy for Alzheimer's zzso
