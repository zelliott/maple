zzso zzso zzso zzso are commonly used as flame zzso in zzso zzso and electronics and represent a group of persistent environmental zzso They have been found to accumulate in human and marine zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso have zzso properties and zzso zzso However, the mechanisms under the zzso disruptions are still not well zzso In this study, we explored the effects of zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso and possible mechanisms in mouse zzso tumor cells zzso Our results showed that zzso could reduce zzso production and decrease the zzso zzso level induced by zzso or zzso These suggested that zzso decreasing zzso production in zzso cells may be associated with the decline of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, our data also indicated that the site G protein in zzso zzso may be involved in this zzso Furthermore, the addition of zzso zzso zzso could not reverse the decrease of zzso zzso indicating that a zzso site (or zzso might be involved into the zzso zzso zzso In addition, we found zzso reduced the activity of zzso side chain zzso zzso zzso which was zzso with the decline of zzso zzso and protein level in zzso zzso Put all together, these results suggested that zzso synthesis decrease induced by zzso may be associated with zzso of zzso generation and reduction of zzso zzso
