zzso zzso are used as convenient tools in exploration of zzso functional mechanisms and in treatment of zzso zzso When we employed the zzso zzso zzso to express an zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso zzso zzso the yield did not exceed 1-2 zzso in shake flask zzso As we considered that the poor zzso usage bias may be one limiting factor leading to the inefficient translation and zzso production, we designed and zzso the full-length zzso gene by choosing the zzso zzso preferred zzso while keeping the zzso content at relatively low zzso zzso zzso increased the zzso expression level 3- to zzso and up to 6-10 zzso Northern zzso further confirmed that the increase of zzso expression was mainly due to the enhancement of translation zzso Investigation of culture conditions revealed that the zzso cell growth and zzso expression were achieved at pH zzso with zzso zzso acids after 72 h methanol zzso zzso zzso was easily zzso zzso homogeneous zzso from culture zzso in one step by using zzso zzso affinity zzso The yield was approximately zzso zzso zzso studies showed that the zzso zzso could be zzso with high efficiency after binding to the zzso cells, suggesting this zzso may prove especially useful for zzso zzso
