zzso receptors that include zzso signaling in series with zzso in the same zzso have been demonstrated to activate zzso human primary T cells more efficiently than a zzso providing zzso signaling zzso We examined whether this type of zzso can also activate resting human primary T cells, and whether molecules other than zzso could be included in a single zzso zzso in series with zzso to mediate the zzso of resting human primary T zzso Human zzso zzso receptors were generated with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso signaling regions in series with zzso signaling region and zzso by zzso into resting human primary T zzso Their ability to mediate zzso zzso was analyzed in comparison with a zzso providing zzso signaling zzso zzso of any of the zzso signaling regions in series with zzso enhanced the level of specific zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso production and enabled resting primary T cells to survive and zzso in response to zzso in the absence of any zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso enhanced zzso zzso target cell zzso zzso receptors providing B7 and zzso family zzso signals in series with zzso in the same zzso can zzso self-sufficient zzso expansion and enhanced zzso function to resting human T zzso This type of zzso zzso may now be used to discover the most potent combination of zzso signals that will improve current zzso zzso
