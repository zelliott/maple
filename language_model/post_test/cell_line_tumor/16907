zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso It processes several growth regulatory proteins into their active forms, which are critical to tumor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso could occur in liver cancer and a previous study showed that zzso of zzso promoted zzso cell invasion in tail vein zzso zzso However, the clinical relevance of zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso remained zzso Surprisingly, in a zzso survival analysis for zzso patients, it was found that the zzso zzso ratio of zzso expression zzso zzso in zzso zzso predicted a better zzso zzso survival zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, subcutaneous zzso experiments demonstrated a significant suppression effect of tumor growth in the zzso zzso zzso compared to the mock zzso Administration of a synthetic zzso inhibitor for zzso of the zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso to the zzso zzso bearing mice restored the repression effect of tumor zzso In contrast, administration of zzso to the mock zzso zzso bearing mice showed no change in growth zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso inhibited zzso tumor growth in a subcutaneous zzso model and predicted a better zzso zzso in clinical zzso
