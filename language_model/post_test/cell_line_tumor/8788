T cells are known to participate in the response to tumor cells and react with zzso and zzso zzso At the same time tumors established versatile mechanisms for zzso the immune zzso The interplay is far from being completely zzso In this study we show contacts between tumor cells and zzso revealing novel characteristics in the interaction of T cells and cancer cells in a way not previously zzso 

zzso are based on the usage of a zzso fluorescent dye that occurs free in the zzso and thus transfer of fluorescent zzso from one cell to the other can be observed using flow zzso zzso cells from cell lines of different origin or primary zzso zzso zzso cells were incubated with zzso from human and zzso This exposure provoked a contact dependent zzso of tumor derived zzso by zzso in zzso T cells and zzso B zzso could not be detected after incubation of zzso with healthy zzso The interaction was a direct one, not requiring the presence of accessory cells, but independent of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso disclosed zzso zzso large gaps in the cell zzso of connected cells which separated viable and revealed astonishing zzso While the zzso were induced to zzso in a long term fashion, the tumor cells underwent a temporary break in cell zzso The in zzso results were confirmed in zzso using a zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso The arrest of tumor proliferation resulted in a significant prolonged survival of challenged zzso 

The reported zzso contacts reveal new characteristics zzso the enabling of zzso flow between the cells including biological active proteins that influence the cell cycle and biological zzso of the recipient zzso This adds a completely new aspect in tumor induced zzso
