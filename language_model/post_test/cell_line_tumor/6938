We studied the zzso effects of zzso zzso on the growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines in zzso and assessed the effectiveness of zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment combined with zzso zzso for patients with this zzso 

In the in zzso experiments, zzso cell lines were exposed to various zzso of zzso in either saline solution or distilled water for up to 5 zzso After 48 h zzso we calculated the zzso of cell zzso In the clinical study, five patients with zzso underwent zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment combined with zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso treatment inhibited cell growth at a significantly greater rate than the zzso zzso zzso Just zzso zzso exposure to 10 zzso of zzso zzso inhibited growth by more than zzso zzso no recurrence was found in four of the five patients after a median follow-up period of 27 months zzso zzso zzso although zzso multiple pulmonary zzso were found in one patient 10 months after zzso 

zzso zzso treatment is effective against zzso and should be investigated zzso
