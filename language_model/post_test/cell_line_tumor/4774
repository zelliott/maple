Cancer zzso resistance zzso is a major impediment to effective chemotherapy in human cancer, in which zzso and zzso zzso protein figure zzso Design and exploitation of novel clinical zzso zzso is greatly hindered by a lack of understanding of drug zzso dynamics in zzso and resistant zzso The aim of our study was to provide a zzso method for measuring the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso as well as a corresponding data analysis method for zzso the zzso kinetic zzso We performed experiments using carbon fiber zzso to detect zzso zzso from a zzso of human breast cancer zzso cells and derived zzso cells zzso established a material transport model and proposed a novel inverse method to zzso characterize the diffusion zzso The kinetic parameters of zzso zzso from zzso and zzso cells in the presence or absence of zzso zzso were zzso Our investigations showed the average initial zzso zzso rate of zzso that was zzso times faster than of zzso After treatment by zzso or zzso the drug zzso rate of the zzso cells was reduced by about half that of those without zzso The novel methodology presented suggests new and expanded applications for zzso reconstruction of the drug zzso process, zzso design, and zzso drug zzso
