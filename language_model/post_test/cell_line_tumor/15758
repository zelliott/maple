Because tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso selectively kills tumor cells, it is being tested in cancer zzso Unfortunately, patients develop resistance to the zzso therefore, agents that can sensitize cells to TRAIL are urgently zzso In this study, we investigated whether zzso zzso can sensitize cancer cells to TRAIL and zzso zzso zzso As indicated by zzso of the membrane zzso zzso DNA breaks, zzso zzso activity, and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso we concluded that zzso zzso zzso zzso in colon cancer zzso zzso also converted TRAIL zzso to zzso When examined for the zzso we found that zzso decreased the expression of zzso proteins and decoy zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso also induced both death zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso by small interfering zzso zzso reduced the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso In addition, zzso increased the expression of zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso decreased the induction of zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso of receptors by zzso however, was zzso as deletion of zzso had no effect on zzso zzso We observed that zzso induction of zzso and zzso was zzso through generation of zzso oxygen species zzso as zzso blocked the induction of death receptors and suppression of cell survival proteins by zzso Overall, our results show that zzso zzso zzso zzso through zzso of cell survival proteins and zzso of death receptors via zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso
