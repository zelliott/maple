A series of new zzso zzso derivatives were zzso and evaluated as dual zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso It was found that all these synthetic compounds inhibited zzso zzso zzso effectively with their zzso values ranged from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso These derivatives also showed zzso activity to zzso with their zzso values ranged from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso Their zzso relationships zzso and mechanisms of inhibitions were zzso This study provided potentially important information for further development of zzso derivatives as zzso agents for Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso
