The study aim was to investigate the zzso safety of zzso isolation and zzso 

Between 1996 and 2002, prospective zzso screening was performed on all zzso procured for zzso zzso zzso transport media and zzso preparations were screened for zzso zzso Prior to isolation, zzso were washed with either Hanks solution zzso I, zzso zzso zzso or decontaminated with antiseptic and zzso drugs zzso II, zzso zzso zzso 

zzso contamination of the zzso preservation media was shown in zzso Analysis of the zzso showed zzso zzso zzso zzso organisms, and zzso zzso The donor condition or procurement center did not influence the contamination zzso zzso zzso transport duration was significantly associated with bacterial contamination zzso zzso In group I, 16 zzso of 170 zzso preparations presented microbial contamination at the end of the isolation zzso zzso organisms were present in 10 zzso zzso organisms in 4 zzso and zzso in 2 zzso zzso Four zzso preparations zzso from zzso with zzso transport medium were positive on zzso cultures, all with zzso zzso In group II, only 2 of 45 zzso preparations zzso presented microbial contamination at the end of the isolation zzso 

The rate of microbial contamination during zzso procurement and transport is zzso zzso zzso present when beginning zzso isolation become zzso by the conclusion of zzso zzso the zzso by zzso decontamination reduces the risk of contamination of the final zzso zzso
