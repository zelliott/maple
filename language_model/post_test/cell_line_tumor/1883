Because zzso and zzso zzso zzso are immune stimulants, we evaluated the zzso effects of zzso gene therapy and zzso treatment in a poorly zzso zzso cancer zzso We used a zzso zzso cancer zzso cell line zzso the zzso gene zzso zzso with zzso and zzso enhanced bone zzso zzso cell zzso maturation in zzso In addition, zzso zzso production was significantly increased in zzso zzso after they were zzso with zzso and zzso When mice bearing zzso zzso tumors were zzso zzso with zzso cells and zzso the outgrowth of established parental tumors was significantly suppressed compared to those in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso A marked zzso of zzso cells in the established parental tumors of mice treated with zzso and zzso was confirmed by zzso analyses zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected when zzso of zzso + zzso mice were zzso by zzso zzso cells and zzso twice weekly in zzso and used as zzso cells in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso at an zzso to target ratio of zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso treatment promotes potent zzso zzso immune zzso zzso the combination of zzso gene therapy and zzso treatment for cancer should be evaluated in clinical zzso
