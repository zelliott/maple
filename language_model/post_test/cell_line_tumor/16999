To investigate the effect and possible mechanism of zzso to induce zzso in zzso cancer resistant cell lines zzso 

zzso cells were treated with different concentration of zzso with or without the combination of chemotherapy drugs zzso zzso and zzso zzso for 48 zzso The growth zzso rates of zzso cells were studied by zzso method, and the zzso ratios were measured with flow zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was studied by zzso in zzso treated cells, zzso treated cells and their combination treated zzso 

After the treatment of different concentration of zzso for 48 hours, the growth zzso rates and the zzso rate of zzso cells were gradually increased accordingly with increasing zzso zzso zzso zzso in combination with chemotherapy drug obtained higher zzso rate and zzso rate than single chemotherapy drug did zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso of zzso cells treated with zzso combined zzso was much lower than that treated only with zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso can increase the zzso rate of zzso cells, so has synergistic effect on with chemotherapy drugs on the induction of cell zzso Its possible mechanism may be related to the zzso of zzso
