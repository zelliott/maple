In contrast to normal cells, zzso cells are frequently zzso and contain multiple zzso To allow for bipolar zzso division, zzso zzso are clustered into two functional zzso poles in many cancer zzso Recently, we have shown that zzso forces tumor cells with zzso zzso to undergo zzso zzso resulting in zzso cell zzso Here, we describe the characterization of the novel small zzso zzso a zzso of zzso as a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso in zzso zzso At zzso where zzso had no significant impact on zzso zzso zzso tension was markedly reduced in zzso cells upon exposure to zzso Moreover, zzso cells with conditional zzso amplification were more sensitive to zzso than parental zzso In a wide array of tumor cell lines, mean zzso zzso zzso for proliferation and survival were in the range of 1 to 5 zzso and were associated with zzso cell zzso zzso treatment of mouse zzso models of human colon cancer and multiple myeloma resulted in tumor growth zzso and significantly prolonged zzso These results show the in zzso and in zzso zzso efficacy of a zzso small zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso and strongly support the further evaluation of this new class of zzso
