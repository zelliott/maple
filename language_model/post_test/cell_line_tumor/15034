Small cell lung cancer zzso is a disease characterized by aggressive clinical behavior and lack of effective zzso zzso to its tendency for early zzso only a third of patients have zzso disease at the time of zzso zzso is thought to derive from pulmonary neuroendocrine zzso Although several molecular abnormalities in zzso have been zzso there are relatively few studies on zzso zzso in this type of zzso Here, we have used zzso profiling with the zzso island recovery zzso in combination with zzso and conducted the first zzso analysis of zzso changes that occur in primary zzso and zzso cell zzso Among the hundreds of zzso zzso genes discovered, we identified 73 gene targets that are zzso in zzso of primary zzso tumors, most of which have never been linked to zzso zzso in zzso These zzso targets have potential for zzso development for early detection and therapeutic management of zzso zzso cell lines had a greater number of zzso genes than primary zzso Gene zzso analysis indicated a significant enrichment of zzso genes functioning as zzso factors and in processes of zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso regions identified enrichment of binding sites for several neural cell zzso zzso factors including zzso zzso zzso and zzso We zzso that two potential mechanisms, loss of cell zzso zzso factors by zzso of their promoters and functional zzso of their corresponding zzso sites by DNA zzso can promote a differentiation zzso of neuroendocrine cells thus enhancing the ability of tumor zzso cells to transition toward zzso
