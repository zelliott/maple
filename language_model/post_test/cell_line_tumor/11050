We tested the zzso status of zzso induced gene 1 zzso in head and neck cancer cell lines and primary tumors by the zzso zzso chain reaction zzso MSP showed that the zzso promoter was zzso in all cell zzso We then used MSP to check the zzso status of zzso in primary head and neck cancer zzso zzso zzso MSP showed zzso zzso in 31 zzso head and neck zzso and no zzso in any normal zzso To confirm MSP results, we directly zzso dense zzso zzso We found that promoter regions contained zzso zzso We thus observed a zzso pattern of zzso zzso in primary head and neck zzso Our results support the notion that promoter zzso is an important mechanism of zzso gene zzso and occurs frequently in head and neck zzso zzso zzso represents a new molecular marker for targeting diagnostic and therapeutic approaches in these zzso
