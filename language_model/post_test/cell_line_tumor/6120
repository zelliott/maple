Lung cancer is a highly zzso zzso and most deaths of lung cancer are caused by zzso The zzso associated with zzso transition zzso may be related to the cancer cell zzso Nevertheless, the mechanism of lung cancer zzso remains zzso We conducted a study in zzso to investigate whether transforming growth zzso zzso could induce changes of, such as cell zzso expression of relative protein zzso and cellular zzso and invasive zzso In this research, the changes of cell zzso were first investigated under a phase contrast zzso then western zzso was employed to detect the expression of zzso zzso and zzso and finally cell zzso and invasion were evaluated by cell zzso as well as invasion zzso The data indicated that human lung zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso cells of zzso cell zzso were induced to undergo zzso by zzso Following zzso treatment, cells showed dramatic zzso changes assessed by phase contrast zzso accompanied by decreased zzso marker zzso and increased zzso markers zzso and zzso More importantly, cell zzso and invasion were also enhanced in the zzso zzso These results indicated that zzso may promote lung zzso invasion and zzso via the mechanism of zzso
