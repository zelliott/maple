Previous studies have shown that unlike most zzso cells, zzso cells do not zzso zzso zzso upon zzso Here we show that zzso cells are resistant to intrinsic zzso agents, but sensitive to zzso triggered zzso zzso Treatment of intrinsic zzso zzso cells with vitamin E implicated zzso oxygen species in intrinsic zzso because, like zzso cells, they became resistant to zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso of zzso in both cell types with zzso resulted in rapid disruption of the zzso membrane potential, release of zzso c from the zzso to the zzso and zzso of zzso by a mechanism that was not inhibited by the pan zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that although cell death and zzso zzso are both zzso zzso they are distinct and zzso zzso
