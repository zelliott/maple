We report a unique amplification technique that works efficiently and specifically over a temperature range, rather than at one specific temperature, throughout the amplification zzso As zzso DNA is one of the difficult to amplify templates, we used this technique to amplify regions of zzso zzso island for 11 genes using this zzso This technique amplified specific products for every gene without requiring any zzso
