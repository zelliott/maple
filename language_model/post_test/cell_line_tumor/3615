A beam formed zzso zzso zzso employing a horn zzso a zzso zzso and a culture case in an zzso chamber is developed for large scale in zzso zzso The combination of an open type zzso exposure source and a culture case through which zzso is transmitted realizes a uniform electric field zzso zzso in a 300 zzso 300 zzso area that zzso 49 35 zzso diameter culture zzso This large culture dish area enables simultaneous zzso exposure of a large number of cells or various cell zzso The zzso exposure source operates at zzso zzso corresponding to the middle frequency of the zzso band of the International Mobile zzso 2000 zzso cellular zzso The zzso zzso which has a gain of 7 zzso focuses zzso energy in the direction of the culture case and provides a uniform electric zzso The culture case is sealed and connected to the main unit for environmental control, located outside the zzso chamber, via zzso The temperature at the center of the zzso which contains the culture dishes in the culture room, is maintained at zzso zzso zzso degrees C by air zzso In addition, the appropriate CO2 density and humidity supplied to the culture case realizes stable long-term culture zzso zzso zzso rate zzso zzso is performed using an electric field measurement technique and the zzso zzso Time zzso zzso calculation zzso The results indicate that the mean zzso of the culture fluid at the bottom of the 49 (7 zzso 7 zzso culture dishes used in the in zzso experiments is zzso zzso for an antenna input power of 1 W and the standard zzso of the zzso distribution is zzso When only 25 culture dishes (5 zzso 5 zzso are zzso the mean zzso is zzso zzso for the same antenna input power and the standard zzso of the zzso distribution is zzso The proliferation of the zzso cell line in 72 h in a pair of zzso zzso reveals that the culture conditions are equivalent to those of a common CO2 zzso
