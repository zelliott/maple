zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role in the formation of many zzso tumors, and has been shown to be an important therapeutic zzso In the present study, small hairpin zzso zzso expression zzso that target sequences of human zzso and zzso were used to examine the proliferation and invasion zzso effects on zzso gastric zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso Cell growth was inhibited by over zzso as indicated by a zzso zzso and was accompanied by zzso phase arrest in the zzso treated group, indicating poor cell growth zzso The number of cells invading through the zzso in the zzso treated group were significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso compared with that of the control group zzso zzso zzso and the nonsense sequence group zzso zzso zzso In addition, the tumor volumes in the zzso subcutaneous nude mouse model treated with zzso were significantly smaller than those of the control group and nonsense sequence zzso When zzso and zzso were dramatically zzso zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso while zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Our results demonstrated that zzso targeting zzso and zzso zzso their expression significantly in a zzso manner, exerting proliferation and invasion zzso effects on zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, our data suggests a novel mechanism for the regulation of zzso tumor cell growth and provides evidence for new zzso gene therapy for zzso zzso
