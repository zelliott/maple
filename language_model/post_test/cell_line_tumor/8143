zzso is a newly identified zzso zzso zzso known to inhibit tumor zzso zzso function via zzso and zzso zzso We have identified two novel zzso zzso zzso that zzso different zzso zzso and named these zzso and zzso zzso the full-length protein is now classified as zzso zzso The central region of zzso harbors a zzso finger domain that is critical for its zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso lacks zzso acids zzso whereas zzso is missing zzso zzso acids zzso which for each zzso results in a zzso domain deletion and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Our findings further indicate that the zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso is capable of binding to zzso suggesting that the zzso region absent in zzso is critical for zzso zzso Similar to zzso both zzso and zzso interact with zzso however, interactions between zzso and zzso appear stronger than those between zzso and zzso Interestingly, although both zzso and zzso are not able to promote in zzso zzso zzso both are capable of zzso regulating zzso protein stability and promoting the zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, like zzso both zzso are able to inhibit zzso zzso zzso We have also for the first time demonstrated that zzso as well as the novel zzso also interact directly with zzso within a region encompassing zzso zzso and zinc finger zzso It is therefore possible that zzso and the novel zzso zzso identified in this study may also zzso zzso function by engaging zzso
