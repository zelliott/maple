zzso immunity to viruses involves receptors such as zzso Acid zzso zzso zzso which senses viral zzso and triggers a signaling zzso involving the outer zzso membrane protein zzso zzso signaling zzso Recent work has identified that zzso a member of another class of innate immune zzso sequesters zzso away from zzso and thereby prevents zzso zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso associates with zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso results in a potent zzso of zzso and zzso zzso promoter zzso conversely, depletion of zzso with small interference zzso enhances zzso type I zzso production, with zzso reduction of virus zzso Furthermore, a striking reduction in the abundance of zzso zzso with zzso zzso was found and virus infection leads to transient increase in the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso is a negative regulator of the zzso innate immunity that probably serves to zzso the establishment of an zzso state during viral infection, highlighting the biological significance of zzso association as an important cellular regulatory zzso
