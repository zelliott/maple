To study the relative biological effectiveness zzso of carbon zzso beams relative to zzso for local tumor control in a zzso rat prostate tumor zzso zzso zzso 

A total of 198 animals with tumors in the zzso thigh were treated with increasing single and split doses of either zzso zzso or photons using a zzso zzso Bragg zzso zzso of the study were local control (no tumor recurrence within 300 zzso and zzso changes after zzso The resulting values for zzso zzso at 50% tumor control zzso were used to determine zzso zzso 

The zzso values for single doses were zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso The respective values for split doses were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The corresponding zzso values were zzso zzso zzso for single and zzso zzso zzso for split zzso The most prominent side effects were dry and moist zzso of the skin, which disappeared within zzso 

The study confirmed the effectiveness of carbon zzso therapy for severely zzso zzso For zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso radiation, we have established individual zzso values for local tumor control as well as related zzso zzso
