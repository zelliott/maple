The zzso zzso zzso is consistently zzso in zzso cells as compared to their normal counterparts, but its precise role in drug resistance is yet to be zzso It has been reported that zzso of zzso results in increased resistance to zzso in zzso cells zzso et zzso zzso In this study, we zzso changes in expression of zzso zzso associated with pulse selection of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso which showed increased resistance to this drug as compared to parental zzso cells, showed a noteworthy increase in zzso zzso zzso paralleled by increased zzso zzso activity zzso This effect was not observed in zzso or zzso zzso cells, or in zzso zzso lung or pancreatic zzso zzso zzso treatment with zzso induced zzso zzso expression in zzso 453 and zzso breast zzso cells, but not in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso did not significantly affect zzso zzso but it decreased cell survival in the absence of zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso did not affect drug toxicity in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso does not directly zzso zzso but rather might promote cell survival in zzso zzso cells, providing an explanation for its association with drug zzso
