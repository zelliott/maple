zzso zzso cell death 5) zzso zzso of certain tumor cells and the zzso zzso may be a promising agent for enhancing zzso In this study, a zzso zzso replicating zzso zzso carrying zzso gene expression zzso zzso was zzso In zzso the zzso gene with a deletion of 24 zzso within zzso region is controlled under the human zzso reverse zzso zzso promoter, the zzso gene expression is directed by the zzso response element zzso whereas the zzso gene is controlled by the zzso zzso The zzso replication of this virus and its zzso efficacy were characterized in several zzso cell lines in zzso and in zzso models of human zzso cell line in nude zzso It was found by zzso zzso that zzso expressed zzso efficiently in zzso zzso In zzso tumor zzso models, zzso displayed a tumor killing zzso At a dose of 1 zzso zzso zzso units, zzso alone could completely inhibit the tumor growth and more effective than zzso zzso zzso examination revealed that zzso administration resulted in zzso cell zzso We concluded that the zzso zzso as a more potent and safer zzso zzso could provide a new strategy for leukemia zzso
