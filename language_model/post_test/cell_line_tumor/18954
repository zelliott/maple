In this study, we demonstrated that zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso expression of zzso and zzso depend on the activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso These cells zzso zzso and produce a high amount of zzso Treatment with either zzso a specific chemical inhibitor of zzso or the expression of a zzso zzso form inhibited zzso production of zzso and zzso which block zzso zzso and zzso invasive zzso Our data provided evidence that in zzso cells, the maintenance of the zzso level of zzso which determines the cellular invasive potential, operates through an zzso loop involving the zzso production of zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, we found that zzso added zzso stimulates zzso production of zzso and that blocking zzso activity curbed zzso cell invasive zzso
