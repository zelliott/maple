zzso of the gene coding for zzso zzso zzso 3) are associated with zzso zzso forms of mental zzso zzso in which the only distinctive clinical feature is the cognitive zzso The mechanisms through which zzso zzso produces the mental handicap remain zzso although an involvement in the mechanisms that regulate the formation or plasticity of synaptic networks has been zzso Here we show, using a transient zzso approach, that zzso and small interfering zzso suppression of zzso or expression of a zzso zzso carrying the human zzso zzso in rat zzso zzso slice cultures results in the formation of zzso zzso zzso spines and zzso zzso and a decrease in mature spine zzso zzso analysis of the changes induced by expression of zzso carrying the zzso zzso reveals that many zzso spines fail to express zzso zzso or contact zzso zzso These defects are associated with a reduced spontaneous activity, altered expression of zzso zzso zzso and defective long-term zzso Together, these data identify zzso as a key regulator of zzso formation and plasticity in the zzso and support interpretations that these defects might contribute to the cognitive deficits underlying this form of mental zzso
