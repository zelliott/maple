To investigate the effects of serum containing zzso zzso extract zzso on zzso rate and zzso zzso potential zzso of liver cancer cell line zzso from mice in zzso 

zzso cells were cultured in zzso and divided into 5 groups: blank control group, zzso zzso group, zzso zzso group, high-dose zzso group and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso to determine the proliferation rates of zzso zzso Cellular zzso was observed under a transmission electron microscope zzso The zzso 123 was used as a zzso probe to label the zzso cells, and the zzso zzso were observed with a laser scanning zzso zzso The zzso intensity of zzso cells indicated the zzso of zzso zzso 

The zzso of serum containing zzso on the proliferation of zzso cells in zzso was observed in a zzso zzso The typical zzso changes of zzso were observed after incubation with zzso serum in high dose for zzso The zzso rates of blank control group, zzso group, zzso zzso group, zzso zzso group and high-dose zzso group were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could reduce the zzso of zzso cells from mice as compared with the zzso zzso The zzso of the blank control group, zzso group, and zzso zzso and high-dose zzso groups were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, which were zzso correlated with the zzso zzso 

zzso serum effectively zzso zzso which may be related to the decrease of zzso in zzso zzso
