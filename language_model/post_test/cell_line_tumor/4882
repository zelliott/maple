In the zzso zzso protein hydrolysate increases the zzso and release of zzso zzso from zzso cells of the zzso zzso Our recent discovery that a G zzso zzso zzso is activated by dietary protein hydrolysate causing induced zzso zzso signaling events in zzso zzso cells raises a possibility that zzso might be involved in the protein hydrolysate induction of zzso expression and/or zzso Using the zzso zzso cells as a model, the present study demonstrates that increasing expression of zzso zzso the zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso A similar increase in zzso transcription, indicated by the zzso reporter activity driven by an zzso zzso promoter, is also observed in response to zzso at a dose as little as zzso zzso but not to zzso acid zzso an zzso of zzso We discovered that the zzso of zzso zzso involves zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso by zzso zzso a response in zzso release at 15 zzso which continues over a zzso zzso The zzso level in zzso cells zzso zzso is induced at a greater extent by zzso than by zzso suggesting a possible explanation of the different effects of zzso and zzso on zzso zzso and zzso Our data indicate that zzso can contribute to the observed induction of zzso expression and zzso by zzso and provide evidence that G zzso receptors can zzso dietary zzso zzso
