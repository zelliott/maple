Because channels of zzso zzso are not directly accessible to the zzso technique, the activity zzso zzso of zzso zzso channels in intact cells has so far eluded direct zzso Here, we present strong evidence that the ratio zzso of the zzso cellular zzso zzso at zzso upon zzso at zzso reflects the open probability of an zzso zzso zzso release channel, the zzso zzso zzso in both intact and zzso zzso zzso The time course of the zzso release signal induced by high levels of zzso in intact cells and that of zzso were strongly zzso The zzso specific zzso zzso the zzso type 3 and 1 but not type 2 specific zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso red, depressed consistently the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed that the dual fluorescent signal zzso by zzso zzso with the zzso zzso not the zzso A novel regulatory mechanism was identified zzso zzso activity under zzso conditions is partially suppressed zzso zzso whereas the channel becomes nearly fully activated after exposure to zzso zzso of bulk zzso zzso and subsequent zzso of zzso zzso zzso Upon zzso the dependence of zzso on the zzso zzso concentration was remarkably similar to that of the open probability of the zzso type 3, not 1 or 2, reported from zzso zzso So, zzso appears to be a zzso fluorescent probe for the activity of zzso zzso which in our zzso zzso zzso cell preparations probably reports the type 3 zzso zzso
