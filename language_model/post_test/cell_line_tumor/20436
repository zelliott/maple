zzso of the enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso in living zzso cells is limited to zzso conditions due to requirement of oxygen during zzso zzso Since many diseases or disease models are associated with acute or chronic zzso zzso of structures of interest in experimental studies might be unreliable leading to biased zzso Thus, a zzso yielding a stable zzso under hypoxic conditions is zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso fluorescent proteins zzso does not require molecular zzso Recently, the advantages of zzso for several bacterial strains and zzso were zzso specifically, their usage as a real time zzso marker in bacterial expression studies and their ability of zzso formation under zzso zzso Our objective was to verify if zzso also function in zzso cells in order to potentially broaden the repertoire of zzso with ones that can reliably be used in zzso studies under hypoxic zzso In the present study, we demonstrate for the first time, that zzso can be expressed in different zzso cells, among them zzso neural stem cells during zzso and differentiated zzso Fluorescence zzso were comparable to zzso In contrast to zzso the zzso zzso did not decrease when cells were exposed to defined hypoxic conditions neither in zzso nor in differentiated zzso Thus, zzso can be regarded as an alternative to zzso in studies that target cellular structures which are exposed to hypoxic zzso
