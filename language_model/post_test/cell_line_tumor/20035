Recently unbiased sequencing efforts identified zzso zzso in clear cell zzso zzso zzso Similar zzso were also noted with high frequency in zzso zzso zzso Because the zzso develops from the same zzso precursors we further examined the hypothesis that zzso zzso might also occur in diverse zzso zzso of zzso zzso We zzso the zzso in 22 cell line models of zzso cancer and 10 primary zzso We found no zzso in the cell lines originally derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso clear cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, we found a CCC zzso to zzso zzso zzso 179 zzso in the zzso zzso zzso cell line, a CCC zzso to zzso zzso in a primary zzso zzso as well as a zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso 258 zzso in a poorly differentiated zzso zzso We zzso a large panel of zzso zzso zzso and found 12 zzso zzso we confirmed a high frequency of zzso in 8 of 25 zzso zzso zzso a zzso with zzso poor zzso zzso were zzso in zzso cancer and absent in clear cell and zzso zzso The zzso zzso regions are zzso among species and known to interact with the regulatory zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may represent good candidates for personalized drug therapies particularly for women with the lethal zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso
