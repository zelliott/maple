The expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been found in zzso zzso and zzso from the nervous zzso Evidence suggests its association with zzso recognition, zzso zzso and zzso migration during central nervous system zzso In the present work, we detected increased levels of zzso in differentiated human zzso zzso cultured in zzso To identify which zzso zzso zzso the zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specificity and Western zzso analysis were carried zzso Strong activity toward zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso together with strong zzso detection by Western zzso and presence of transcripts showed that zzso was the zzso associated with zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso was detected at the plasma membrane of zzso zzso in zzso marked with zzso membrane protein 1 zzso and it was found for the first time to zzso with the zzso zzso zzso membrane protein zzso that defines the zzso zzso compartment that is involved in zzso zzso Furthermore, incubation with zzso zzso zzso zzso led to impaired zzso of zzso zzso to the surface zzso and inhibited zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso and its product zzso are detected specifically in human zzso zzso and our results indicate that they zzso cell zzso cell zzso and initiation of zzso outgrowth in those zzso
