In response to zzso agents, normal tissue cells are instructed by zzso either to perform DNA repair or to undergo zzso Studies showed that zzso and/or zzso damage both normal and zzso cells zzso To this end, severe side effects inflicted by zzso zzso in normal zzso would possibly be zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso gene transcription, as well as down stream responsive gene zzso The objective of this study was zzso to evaluate zzso for differential cellular protection in response to zzso zzso and cadmium zzso exposure of normal and zzso cells, and zzso to evaluate the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso genes in rat liver cells and zzso zzso cell zzso Cell survival was detected by zzso zzso zzso and zzso Mean zzso and zzso for zzso cells following exposure to zzso were zzso zzso zzso with zzso alpha and zzso zzso zzso zzso without zzso zzso For rat liver cells it was 670 zzso zzso zzso with and zzso zzso zzso without zzso ( zzso On exposure to cadmium zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso for zzso cell line in presence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in its absence zzso The results revealed significant differences from controls only upon exposure of rat liver cells to zzso zzso in presence of zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso in rat liver cells and resulted in repression of zzso zzso zzso zzso G and zzso genes by zzso zzso zzso cells exposed to zzso zzso and zzso showed expression of only the zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that zzso exhibits zzso effect, zzso the zzso influences of known zzso agents in normal cells and has the potential for use as an zzso to cancer zzso
