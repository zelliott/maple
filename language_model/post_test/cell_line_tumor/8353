zzso was chemically zzso to zzso zzso in order to obtain zzso profiles of zzso from zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso with zzso zzso and subsequently zzso to zzso via an zzso zzso A mixture of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso formed physical gels at 37 degrees zzso zzso was subsequently performed to chemically zzso the physical zzso at 37 degrees zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso significantly reduced burst release of free zzso from zzso zzso compared zzso without the zzso Upon zzso zzso zzso at 37 degrees C, zzso zzso were confirmed to be zzso into more zzso zzso by zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso using released media from zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso had zzso comparable to free zzso zzso nude mice bearing human lung zzso were subjected to zzso injections of physical zzso After zzso injected zzso using surgical zzso tumor sizes, body zzso and zzso were measured for 1 zzso Released media from zzso zzso exerted similar zzso to free zzso and the tumor volume was significantly reduced for 1 month compared to other zzso Thus, zzso zzso containing zzso zzso can be employed as a novel zzso zzso drug aiming to achieve sustained release of zzso for several weeks against solid zzso
