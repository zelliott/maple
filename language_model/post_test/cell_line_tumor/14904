zzso functions of zzso zzso have been associated with zzso cancer zzso zzso is transcribed from a stable zzso of a zzso coding zzso and is reportedly zzso in different tumor zzso We investigated the role of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso 

We analyzed the expression of zzso by real-time zzso chain reaction zzso analysis of zzso cell lines and 180 paired tumor samples and surrounding healthy zzso We zzso and knocked down zzso in zzso cell lines and assessed the in zzso zzso We also studied the effects of zzso zzso on zzso of tumors grown from zzso cells in nude zzso 

zzso of zzso inhibited zzso cell migration and invasion in zzso and formation of zzso and pulmonary zzso in zzso We identified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a direct target of zzso and observed an inverse correlation between the level of zzso and zzso protein in zzso tumor zzso zzso was required for zzso of zzso markers and zzso of zzso markers in zzso cells, indicating that it promoted the zzso zzso zzso of zzso reduced the levels of zzso to block the zzso transition zzso Loss of zzso and promoter zzso each contributed to the zzso of zzso zzso levels of zzso were associated with a more aggressive tumor zzso and short zzso survival times of patients zzso zzso zzso overall survival, P zzso zzso 

zzso is zzso in human zzso zzso via genetic and zzso zzso zzso might prevent tumor progression by targeting zzso zzso zzso reduction of zzso could be a zzso marker for patients with zzso zzso and zzso might also be therapeutic targets for zzso
