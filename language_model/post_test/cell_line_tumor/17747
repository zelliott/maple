The human zzso zzso an essential zzso zzso plays a central role in the repair of zzso base damage via the DNA base zzso repair zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is often observed in tumor cells, and zzso resistance to various zzso zzso its zzso zzso tumor cells to those agents via induction of zzso Here we show that wild type zzso but not zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso decrease was observed in zzso zzso and protein levels in the human zzso cancer line zzso zzso but not in the zzso zzso zzso zzso after treatment with zzso a DNA zzso I zzso Furthermore, zzso expression of zzso in the zzso zzso cells significantly reduced both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso is bound to the zzso promoter region that includes a zzso zzso We show here that zzso interferes with zzso binding to the zzso promoter, which provides a mechanism for the zzso of zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that zzso is a negative regulator of zzso zzso so that repression of zzso by zzso could provide an additional zzso for zzso induction of zzso in response to DNA zzso
