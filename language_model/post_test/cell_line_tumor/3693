zzso and Dan, two zzso zzso zzso of bone zzso zzso have been shown to regulate early development, zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we report that zzso and Dan physically and functionally interact with zzso and zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso depends on its zzso and is not zzso with by bone zzso zzso zzso zzso and Dan function as zzso for zzso migration induced by zzso zzso factor zzso zzso or zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso by Dan is not due to blocking the binding of zzso to its zzso Thus, the results identify that zzso and Dan can interact with zzso proteins and act as zzso of zzso zzso demonstrating a previously unidentified biological role for these zzso
