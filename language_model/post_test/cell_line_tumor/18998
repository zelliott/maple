zzso a member of the inhibitor of zzso protein family, is involved in both, zzso of zzso and regulation of cell zzso Because of the zzso expression of zzso the reduction of its expression is an important therapeutic option in the treatment of zzso zzso Thus, we analyzed the zzso regulation of zzso in order to establish zzso as a target gene for new therapeutic zzso Here, we describe a novel regulatory region within the zzso zzso After treatment with zzso zzso the early growth response zzso zzso factor binds to the sequence zzso 3' within the human zzso promoter in zzso and in entire zzso In zzso zzso and zzso experiments, zzso is zzso following zzso expression of zzso zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso cell lines, we show that zzso zzso regulates zzso expression and zzso cell lines to zzso zzso
