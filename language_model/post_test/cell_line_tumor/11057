The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of human zzso cell line zzso zzso which zzso by zzso formation, and treatment with sodium zzso zzso as a cell source for hybrid artificial liver zzso zzso zzso spontaneously formed zzso in zzso foam zzso within 3 days of culture and restored weak zzso removal zzso Treatment with zzso which is a zzso zzso zzso further increased the zzso removal activity of zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso cycle zzso significantly related to the zzso of zzso removal by zzso formation, but scarcely contributed to the further zzso following zzso zzso In contrast with zzso zzso treatment with zzso reduced the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso In the zzso module in a circulation culture, the zzso removal rate and zzso zzso rate zzso unit volume of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso treated with 5 zzso zzso were almost the same as those of primary zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that simultaneous use of zzso formation and zzso treatment in zzso zzso is beneficial in enhancing the functions of human zzso with potential applications in zzso medicine and drug zzso
