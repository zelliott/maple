zzso zzso the zzso gene are usually more aggressive and are associated with poor zzso Although zzso has significantly improved the outcome, many tumors do not respond or acquire resistance to current zzso To provide an alternative zzso therapy, we have developed and characterized a novel zzso protein combining an zzso zzso and modified zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso which, after binding to zzso is zzso and delivered to the zzso of the tumor cell, where it blocks protein synthesis by zzso zzso of zzso 

The effect of the zzso on cell viability was assessed using zzso zzso To assess zzso zzso zzso nude mice bearing zzso breast cancer, zzso zzso cancer, and zzso gastric zzso zzso were treated with the zzso zzso or zzso which was injected every third zzso zzso zzso in female zzso mice was investigated using standard zzso production and zzso proliferation zzso 

In zzso experiments proved that zzso is a potent agent that eliminates zzso cells at low zzso zzso zzso efficacy studies showed complete zzso of relatively large zzso tumors and significant effects on zzso and zzso zzso zzso cleared quickly from circulation zzso zzso 10 minutes) and was well tolerated by mice at doses of zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies indicated that zzso induced zzso development after the third injected zzso 

Our findings showed that zzso is an effective zzso agent and a potential candidate for clinical zzso
