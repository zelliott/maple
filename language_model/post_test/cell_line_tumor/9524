The zzso nuclear zzso zzso of Human zzso zzso 8 zzso alternatively called zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed in all zzso infected zzso zzso accumulates in zzso zzso that zzso with the viral zzso We have previously shown that these zzso are tightly associated with the borders of zzso zzso We have also shown that zzso expressed zzso causes an extensive zzso of zzso zzso DNA zzso patterns of the zzso in zzso infected cells zzso Here we show that this effect includes the release of the bulk of DNA from zzso areas, in both human and mouse cells, without affecting the overall levels of zzso associated zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso The release of DNA from the zzso zzso in zzso zzso mouse cells zzso with the zzso of the zzso associated zzso binding protein 2 zzso The zzso of zzso to the remnants of the zzso remains zzso Moreover, zzso expressed zzso leads to the relocation of the zzso to the nuclear zzso indicating extensive changes in the positioning of the zzso zzso in the zzso harboring zzso zzso Using a series of deletion zzso we have shown that the zzso rearranging effects of zzso require the presence of a short zzso zzso zzso region that is located immediately upstream of the internal zzso zzso This sequence lies within the previously mapped binding site to zzso zzso zzso We suggest that the highly concentrated zzso anchored to the host zzso in the nuclear zzso of zzso infected cells and zzso through each cell generation, may function as zzso zzso The induction of zzso modification in adjacent host genes may lead to altered gene zzso thereby contributing to the viral zzso
