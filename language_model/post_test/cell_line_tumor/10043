zzso is a zzso that maintains the length of zzso and thus controls the proliferation and lifespan of zzso Recent studies suggest the involvement of zzso in the protection of cells from zzso Adult human zzso zzso cells zzso possess the capacity to zzso and differentiate into a variety of cell zzso zzso derived from a healthy donor lack zzso activity but their expression has not been investigated in zzso derived from diseased zzso Cell replacement therapy using adult zzso has been suggested as a promising therapeutic approach for zzso lateral sclerosis zzso zzso we characterized the zzso activity and expression in zzso derived from bone zzso zzso of ALS patients and compared them with those derived from a healthy zzso 

zzso activity was examined with a zzso zzso and real-time zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was detected by Western zzso and zzso analysis, and zzso zzso transcripts were identified by Northern zzso 

zzso activity, zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso transcripts were demonstrated in zzso derived from zzso but were zzso in zzso from the healthy zzso zzso activity in the zzso of ALS patients was zzso lower compared with tumor zzso 

The detection of zzso expression in zzso derived from ALS patients and not a healthy donor suggests a possible role for zzso in the response of zzso to the zzso The presence of zzso expression did not impair the ability of the ALS zzso to zzso suggesting the use of these cells for zzso zzso
