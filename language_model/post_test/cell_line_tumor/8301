The accurate mass and time zzso tag strategy has been recognized as a powerful tool for zzso analysis in liquid zzso zzso zzso zzso Due to the complexity of the human zzso this strategy requires highly accurate mass zzso for confident zzso We have developed a method of building a reference map that allows relaxed criteria for mass errors yet delivers high confidence for zzso zzso The samples used for generating the zzso database were produced by collecting zzso peptides from zzso cells and then zzso the peptides using strong zzso exchange zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso data from the zzso zzso were combined to create a comprehensive reference zzso After the reference map was built, it was possible to skip the zzso step in further zzso zzso We found that the zzso identification increases the overall zzso and zzso coverage by identifying peptides with low intensity or complex zzso The use of the reference map also zzso the zzso process by allowing extraction of zzso zzso of interest and incorporating models of theoretical isotope zzso
