zzso is a common feature of tumors that occurs across a wide variety of zzso Multiple myeloma is an incurable zzso disorder of plasma cells in the bone zzso Although bone zzso zzso is crucial for normal zzso the effect of zzso on multiple myeloma is poorly zzso In this study, we demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased cell viability and altered gene expression in zzso human multiple myeloma zzso zzso induced the loss of cell viability in a zzso zzso In addition, zzso analysis revealed that the loss of cell viability was related to zzso Using zzso analysis, we identified zzso expression profile changes in response to zzso treatment in zzso zzso Four hundred and zzso zzso exhibited zzso changes in expression in zzso zzso cells compared to their expression in control zzso A follow-up zzso study revealed that a great number of genes with altered expression were involved in zzso cell cycle, zzso and zzso In conclusion, these results provide novel evidence that zzso zzso affects the expression profiles of genes that are functionally related to zzso and zzso in zzso multiple myeloma zzso
