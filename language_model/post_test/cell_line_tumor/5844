Several zzso mediate the functions of zzso family zzso Here we characterize zzso as a new target of this zzso In response to DNA damage, zzso zzso the expression of zzso which, in turn, reduces the level of zzso a Down zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso has the opposite zzso zzso of zzso reduces zzso levels and leads to the nuclear retention of zzso a protein zzso of zzso and the induction of zzso whereas a zzso inhibitor prevented the nuclear import of zzso Together, these results indicate that zzso zzso zzso expression through the induction of zzso
