zzso is a zzso G zzso zzso zzso that has been implicated in the pathological processes of a number of diseases, including zzso and zzso Currently, there are no available zzso zzso drug compounds that can block zzso of zzso We have developed a zzso zzso zzso that specifically recognizes zzso and acts as a functional zzso 

zzso binding of zzso was demonstrated by zzso using cells that zzso individual members of the zzso zzso zzso We show, in zzso that zzso can inhibit the zzso of zzso cellular zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and calcium zzso We also demonstrate that zzso blocks zzso of zzso in zzso 1) by preventing zzso due to systemic zzso and 2) by altering the progression of breast tumor zzso 

We have developed the zzso zzso zzso that selectively recognizes a zzso zzso and blocks functional zzso In addition to serving as a lead drug compound for the treatment of zzso and breast cancer, it also provides proof of concept for the generation of novel zzso therapeutic zzso
