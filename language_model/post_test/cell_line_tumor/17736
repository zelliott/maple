The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso were prepared via total synthesis and tested in zzso for zzso against zzso and zzso zzso breast cancer cell lines and in a zzso assembly zzso The zzso values ranged from zzso to zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and from zzso to zzso zzso in the cell zzso The presence of a zzso and/or zzso zzso on the zzso zzso ring increased zzso in the zzso cell line compared to the zzso zzso zzso The most potent compound in this series possessed a zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso The zzso analogue had zzso values of 50 and 580 zzso in the zzso and zzso cell lines, zzso Its activity was very similar to the parent compound zzso zzso of the zzso group in zzso with a zzso zzso did not significantly affect zzso against zzso and zzso cells compared to the parent zzso These results demonstrated that the zzso group in zzso is not essential and can be replaced with zzso or zzso zzso
