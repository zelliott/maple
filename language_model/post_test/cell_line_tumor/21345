zzso plays an important role in the zzso and progression in multiple myeloma zzso and zzso cells zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso which further promotes proliferation of the tumor zzso zzso we evaluated the zzso effect of zzso small interfering zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells and whether it can be zzso by the additional application of zzso directed against the zzso zzso After zzso with zzso zzso we observed a reduction of zzso expression in all studied cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as in cells of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly induced zzso and inhibited proliferation in zzso cells ( zzso zzso ( zzso and zzso ( zzso versus zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells resulted in an exaggerated zzso of proliferation and induction of zzso compared with zzso zzso or zzso alone ( zzso In addition, the combination of zzso zzso and zzso significantly ( zzso reversed zzso resistance gene zzso resistance of zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso zzso may be associated with an additive zzso activity and might be a suitable target for new, therapeutic strategies using zzso interference in zzso
