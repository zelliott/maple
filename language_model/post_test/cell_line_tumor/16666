The fatty acid zzso zzso genes code for the zzso zzso required for the zzso of zzso zzso fatty acids zzso Here we report discovery and function of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso alternative transcript 1 zzso enhances zzso of zzso leading to increased production of zzso zzso the first case of an zzso modulating the zzso activity zzso by another zzso Multiple protein zzso were detected in zzso liver, zzso and zzso In human zzso cells, their expression patterns are modulated by differentiation and result in zzso of cellular fatty zzso zzso but not zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrates that all three zzso genes are translated at similar zzso The zzso regulation of zzso zzso by zzso is a novel, plausible mechanism by which several zzso zzso zzso zzso may regulate zzso zzso in a manner specific to zzso zzso and zzso zzso
