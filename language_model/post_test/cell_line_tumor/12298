To investigate the effect of the zzso zzso zzso specific for human zzso zzso zzso on radio zzso and proliferation zzso in human zzso cells zzso 

zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Before and after zzso of zzso gamma zzso zzso activity was zzso by zzso repeat amplification protocol ( zzso and DNA damage and repair were examined by the comet zzso The classical colony zzso was used to plot the zzso curve, to detect the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso could zzso the zzso activity, increase radiation induced DNA damage and reduce the subsequent zzso Furthermore, it could inhibit the proliferation and decrease the zzso ) value which demonstrates rising zzso However, zzso length was unchanged over a short period of zzso 

These findings suggest that an zzso strategy may be used to develop zzso zzso which can efficiently sensitize zzso
