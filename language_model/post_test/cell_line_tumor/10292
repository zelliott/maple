A new class of inflammatory zzso T cells that produce zzso zzso zzso zzso has been identified, which plays a critical role in numerous inflammatory conditions and zzso zzso The active form of vitamin D, zzso zzso zzso has a direct repressive effect on the expression of zzso in both human and mouse T zzso In zzso treatment of mice with ongoing experimental zzso zzso zzso a mouse model of multiple zzso diminishes paralysis and progression of the disease and reduces zzso zzso T cells in the periphery and central nervous system zzso The mechanism of zzso repression of zzso expression was found to be zzso repression, zzso by the vitamin D zzso zzso zzso zzso gel shifting, and zzso zzso zzso zzso indicate that the negative effect of zzso on zzso involves blocking of nuclear factor for activated T cells zzso recruitment of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso factor 1 zzso by zzso and a direct effect of zzso on induction of zzso Our results describe novel mechanisms and new concepts with regard to vitamin D and the immune system and suggest therapeutic targets for the control of zzso zzso
