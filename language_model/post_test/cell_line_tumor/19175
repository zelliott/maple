zzso zzso are highly aggressive tumors of the central nervous system that rely on production of growth factors for tumor zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso for example, are zzso in these tumors to promote zzso and zzso zzso stability, zzso through zzso and zzso elements zzso in the 3' untranslated region, is a critical control point for regulating these growth zzso zzso zzso is predominantly governed by a balance between stabilizing and zzso factors that bind to zzso We have previously shown that the stabilizing factor zzso is zzso in zzso zzso and linked to zzso stabilization of zzso growth zzso Here, we report that the zzso factor zzso zzso is also zzso expressed in primary zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso In contrast to benign zzso zzso however, the protein was zzso with evidence implicating the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso as a zzso in zzso zzso cells led to zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso of protein zzso Analysis of in zzso zzso binding indicated a shift of zzso toward zzso zzso and away from zzso zzso This zzso zzso was associated with a decrease in cell zzso loss of cell zzso and zzso We zzso that zzso of zzso via zzso promotes progression of zzso zzso by zzso regulating its zzso zzso zzso
