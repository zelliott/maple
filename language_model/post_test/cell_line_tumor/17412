zzso is an zzso zzso on zzso cells and has been demonstrated as a primary zzso zzso for mouse zzso zzso zzso rejection of class zzso zzso zzso cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso acid early zzso was critically dependent upon zzso cell zzso and occurred independently of T zzso zzso zzso cell rejection of zzso acid early zzso tumor primed a secondary zzso T cell response zzso by both zzso and zzso T cells in the zzso zzso Surprisingly, during the zzso phase, zzso T cells, but not zzso T cells, were also required to generate this secondary T cell zzso however, T cell zzso was independent of zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso These data imply a novel zzso for zzso T cell zzso that is, zzso upon zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso tumor cells, dependent upon zzso T cells in the primary phase, and independent of conventional zzso zzso
