zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso zzso drug zzso for targeting delivery to cancer cells with zzso of folate zzso To increase therapeutic effect, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was added during the zzso zzso The zzso study showed that the mixed zzso of zzso and zzso formed a homogeneous zzso The addition of zzso did not result in much variation in the zzso size, surface charge, and drug zzso zzso The cellular zzso study showed that mixed zzso with zzso had higher cellular zzso compared with the ones without zzso to drug-resistant cancer zzso These mixed zzso also selectively increased the zzso of drug on cancer cells but exhibited minimal zzso enhancement on normal zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso study showed that the mixed zzso with zzso increased the cellular zzso of drugs on zzso zzso This indicates that zzso in the mixed zzso may act as zzso inhibitor to reduce drug zzso This new zzso with zzso may have dual functions of zzso targeting and zzso resistance zzso and can be promising in improving the therapeutic efficacy of zzso zzso targeting delivery zzso
