zzso we report a method for studying slow acting pharmaceutical zzso zzso in the zzso breast cancer cell line where cells are grown in a three-dimensional format within an zzso zzso The cancer cells are suspended in zzso and zzso in a cell culture dish, where they will form small zzso zzso in the zzso The time frame for conducting experiments is up to zzso weeks, and gives ample time for zzso zzso to induce cell zzso zzso was used for these experiments, and was found to induce cell death in a time dependent manner over a zzso zzso This is in contrast to the cell line grown in zzso and treated with the same zzso of zzso This method is appropriate for determining mechanisms of cell death caused by zzso zzso
