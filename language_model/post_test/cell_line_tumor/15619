We have described three potential zzso type 5 zzso zzso cancer gene therapy zzso named zzso zzso and zzso All three zzso zzso an zzso protein named zzso Death zzso zzso also named zzso K zzso zzso is required for efficient zzso of zzso cells and spread of virus from cell to cell, and thus its zzso increases the zzso activity of the zzso zzso and zzso contain zzso in the zzso zzso gene that knock out binding of the zzso proteins to cellular zzso and zzso these zzso allow zzso and zzso to grow well in cancer cells but not in normal zzso zzso has zzso zzso Here we report that radiation increases the zzso activity of zzso zzso and zzso This increased activity was observed in cultured cells, and it was not because of zzso replication of the zzso The combination of radiation plus zzso suppressed the growth of zzso lung zzso zzso in nude mice more efficiently than radiation alone or zzso zzso The combination of zzso zzso and radiation may have potential in treating zzso
