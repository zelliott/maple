The number of genes that are up regulated or down regulated during zzso is large and still zzso In an attempt to characterize differential gene expression during serum factor induced zzso in zzso cells (a rat zzso we found zzso 6 and zzso 8 of the zzso zzso channel and zzso alpha of the zzso core of the zzso zzso zzso zzso complex to be up regulated during zzso The increase in the expression levels of these zzso was zzso with a transient increase in the zzso zzso levels, suggesting that the increase in cellular zzso content is a result of the increase in the expression of zzso zzso zzso gene and de zzso protein zzso zzso the cellular zzso levels with zzso inhibited zzso significantly, pointing to the requirement of zzso during zzso zzso 1 and zzso 3 activity and the loss of zzso membrane potential were also inhibited by zzso during zzso in these cells, suggesting that the zzso induced zzso of zzso could be due to zzso of zzso activity and zzso of zzso zzso However, zzso C release during zzso was found to be completely independent of zzso zzso zzso Besides the zzso zzso complex zzso other zzso genes like zzso C zzso zzso II and III also showed elevated levels of expression during zzso This kind of a zzso gene expression profile suggests that in zzso cells, these genes are zzso in a zzso manner to ensure sufficient zzso zzso levels and an efficient functioning of the zzso respiratory chain for successful completion of the zzso zzso
