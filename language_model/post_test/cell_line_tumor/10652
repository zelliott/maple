Our previous studies showed that zzso acid B zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso oral zzso in zzso and such zzso effects might be related to the zzso of zzso This study was aimed to further investigate the zzso effect of Sal B on the most common type of oral cancer, oral zzso cell zzso zzso and the possible mechanisms of action with respect to zzso zzso 

Two zzso oral zzso cell zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso and zzso zzso cells were treated with different zzso of Sal zzso zzso was assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso to evaluate the expression of 96 genes known to be involved in modulating the biological processes of zzso zzso reverse zzso chain reaction analysis was conducted to confirm the zzso zzso zzso 

Sal B induced growth zzso in zzso cell lines but had limited effects on zzso zzso A total of 17 genes showed a greater than zzso change when comparing Sal B treated zzso cells to the zzso Among these zzso zzso zzso and zzso are specifically zzso expression of zzso was zzso 

Sal B has zzso effect on zzso cell zzso The zzso effect can be attributed to zzso potential induced by a decreased expression of some key regulator genes of zzso Sal B may be a promising zzso for treating oral zzso cell zzso
