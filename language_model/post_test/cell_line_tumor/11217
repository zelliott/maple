zzso peptides have received increasing attention as potential zzso drugs due to their new mode of zzso However, the systemic toxicity at high concentration always zzso their successful zzso for tumor zzso Here, we designed a new type of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso to its zzso binding partner zzso via a zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso displayed significant zzso activity at zzso pH and low zzso at normal zzso The results of MD simulations demonstrate that the changes of structure and membrane binding tendency of zzso at different pH values played an important role in its zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso showed significant zzso stability compared with zzso suggesting a potential for in zzso zzso In short, our work opens a new avenue to develop zzso peptides as potential zzso drugs with high zzso
