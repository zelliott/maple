zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which is due to integration of viral zzso in zzso regions, are considered significant obstacles to obtaining a consistent level of zzso expression in gene zzso The inclusion of zzso zzso into zzso has been proposed to counteract this zzso zzso of zzso zzso Here, we show that the sea zzso zzso zzso zzso protects a zzso zzso zzso from the negative influence of zzso in zzso zzso This element increases the probability of zzso expression at different zzso integration sites, which reduces both zzso and zzso By zzso zzso zzso analysis, we demonstrated the specific binding of zzso and zzso zzso factors and the enrichment of zzso zzso to zzso zzso The results suggest that this new zzso is able to maintain a zzso state inside the zzso locus with mechanisms that are common to other characterized zzso On the basis of its ability to function as barrier element in zzso milieu and to bind the zzso specific factor zzso the inclusion of zzso zzso in viral zzso may be of practical benefit in gene transfer applications and, in particular, for gene therapy of zzso zzso
