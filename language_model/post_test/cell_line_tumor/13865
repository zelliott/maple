zzso system may play a role in liver zzso injury in some pathological zzso In this paper, the effects of the three active components of the root of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso induced liver injury were studied in liver zzso liver zzso and human zzso cell line zzso zzso It was found that zzso could induce liver zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and liver zzso protein zzso it also caused a decrease of zzso cells zzso zzso zzso and zzso could inhibit protein zzso and zzso zzso in liver zzso as well as in zzso cells in a zzso manner, the zzso order was zzso These three zzso also inhibited the zzso of protein in liver zzso the decrease of cell viability and the content of zzso in zzso cells, among which zzso represented the most zzso zzso Besides, zzso induced cell injury could be zzso with the existence of zzso indicating protein zzso involved in zzso induced liver zzso These results demonstrated zzso could induce liver injury through zzso or zzso different zzso zzso zzso and zzso could inhibit zzso induced liver injury in zzso manners by zzso zzso and zzso
