The transfer of zzso acids to the zzso terminal positions on sugar chains of zzso is zzso by zzso zzso Increased zzso is correlated with zzso transformation and zzso zzso ST zzso may be potentially valuable as zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we evaluated the effects of zzso I zzso zzso a known inhibitor of zzso on tumor zzso through studying a highly zzso cancer cell line zzso zzso I specifically inhibited the expression of zzso zzso acids without affecting other zzso on the zzso cell zzso We also found that zzso I decreased the migratory ability of cells, enhanced cell zzso to zzso zzso zzso Finally, a pulmonary zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso of zzso in this way significantly reduced the ability of tumor cells to distribute to the lungs of zzso zzso these findings suggested that zzso zzso acids may play an important role in zzso potential of zzso zzso
