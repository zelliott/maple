zzso zzso kills tumor cells via multiple actions including zzso and zzso Previously, we have reported that formation of zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso contributed to zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso against zzso To further characterize the effects of NO on zzso zzso colony formation zzso was applied to evaluate the effects of various NO donors on rat zzso zzso cells challenged with zzso zzso We demonstrate that NO donors including zzso zzso zzso zzso and sodium zzso zzso substantially reduced the extent of colony formation in zzso cells treated with zzso agents, namely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Without zzso agents these zzso agents alone had no effects on zzso potential of rat zzso zzso zzso Among these three NO donors used, the effectiveness in zzso zzso zzso is in the order of zzso when applied at the same zzso zzso also exerted similar synergistic actions reducing the zzso of colony formation when zzso with zzso zzso zzso another zzso agent that mimics the zzso action of zzso Together with our previous findings, we propose that NO donors may be used as adjunct chemotherapy with zzso agents for such zzso brain tumors as zzso zzso zzso In contrast, production of NO as a result of zzso zzso such as that occurring after surgical zzso of brain tumors, may compromise the efficacy of zzso zzso
