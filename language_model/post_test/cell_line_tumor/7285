zzso is a well-known natural zzso agent with severe side effects, which led us to zzso its numerous zzso in search of zzso of improved therapeutic zzso Here, we report an efficient method for the synthesis of a series of zzso zzso with spectral characteristics and their biological zzso The OH of a known zzso zzso zzso 2, was coupled with the zzso groups of different zzso with the help of zzso and zzso zzso zzso to produce high yields of their respective zzso zzso zzso techniques, particularly zzso and zzso proved to be suitable tools to characterize the new zzso These molecules of greater zzso character were tested for their in zzso zzso against four human solid tumors, one human leukemia cell, and one zzso zzso zzso 4-6 and 11 showed moderate zzso zzso unexpectedly, none were found to be active against solid zzso zzso were also investigated for their in zzso activity against zzso and zzso II zzso All the compounds showed zzso of the zzso activity of zzso II, whereas zzso also inhibited zzso zzso These results suggest the need for further screening of these molecules against a larger panel of zzso zzso
