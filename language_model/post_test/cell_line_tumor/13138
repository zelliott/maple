Emerging evidence has pointed to biological roles of zzso zzso zzso in cancer development, progression and resistance to zzso However, the mechanisms involved remain to be fully zzso In this report, we show that one of the zzso zzso zzso suppresses the expression of tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso death zzso 2 zzso and plays an important role in protecting melanoma cells from zzso induced by zzso zzso was commonly expressed at increased levels in melanoma cells compared with zzso Although its zzso by small interfering zzso zzso did not cause cell death, it rendered melanoma cells more sensitive to zzso zzso This was associated with enhanced formation of TRAIL zzso signaling complex and zzso of zzso and was blocked by a zzso zzso zzso protein or zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso by zzso appeared to be zzso by zzso in that zzso zzso did not zzso zzso in zzso or zzso zzso melanoma zzso In addition, zzso of zzso did not result in zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cell lines with zzso inhibited by short hairpin zzso Indeed, zzso of zzso led to zzso of zzso due to a zzso zzso The regulatory effect of zzso on zzso expression and zzso zzso was zzso in studies on fresh melanoma zzso Taken together, these results identify the expression of zzso as an important mechanism that inhibit zzso zzso and suggest that targeting zzso may be a useful strategy in improving the therapeutic efficacy of TRAIL in zzso
