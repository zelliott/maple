zzso zzso zzso zzso expression is known to correlate with poor prognosis of pancreatic zzso We investigated the molecular mechanisms of zzso expression of zzso in pancreatic cancer cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso and protein as well as its zzso activity were observed in three pancreatic cancer cell zzso zzso zzso zzso of two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso showed high levels of zzso in pancreatic cancer cells compared with zzso producing zzso The zzso promoter region of zzso gene contained three zzso zzso zzso sites and the strong zzso activity was detected by zzso mobility shift zzso zzso In these cells, production and zzso of zzso were commonly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were also detected in two of the three cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed in zzso The promoter activity, zzso activity and zzso production were suppressed by a specific inhibitor of zzso or zzso zzso zzso reported to be present in three cell lines used, is known to activate zzso and zzso zzso Considering the facts together, our results revealed that zzso of zzso or zzso zzso plays crucial roles in zzso zzso of zzso in these cancer zzso This study contributes to provide new insights into strategies for zzso tumor cell invasion in pancreatic zzso
