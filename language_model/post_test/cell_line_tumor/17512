We investigated the role of zzso A in the zzso effect of zzso zzso on cancer cell zzso zzso were performed using gastric cancer zzso zzso and zzso zzso established by repeated exposure to zzso zzso inhibited cell growth of zzso in a zzso zzso Low zzso of zzso did not inhibit cell growth of zzso while high zzso slightly inhibited cell zzso zzso of the cell cycle pattern of zzso cells showed zzso at zzso at 10 zzso M and at zzso at 100 zzso M of zzso Cell cycle pattern of zzso cells did not change zzso zzso zzso increased zzso A zzso level in zzso cells but not zzso zzso In the presence of 100 zzso M zzso zzso A protein level increased zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso increased the percentage of zzso zzso zzso cells, but not zzso zzso The percentage of zzso zzso cells in other zzso sensitive zzso colon and gastric cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso increased in the presence of 1 and 10 zzso M zzso while zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso and colon zzso cell lines zzso and zzso did not increase with the same zzso Our results indicate that the zzso effects of zzso in human cancer cell lines correlate with zzso A and it may be used as a zzso factor for chemotherapy zzso
