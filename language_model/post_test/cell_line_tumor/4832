The present study demonstrates the efficacy of utilizing zzso zzso zzso 9) zzso as a potential therapy for colon zzso We examined the effects of two types of zzso zzso a traditional zzso zzso and a novel zzso zzso in models of colon cancer, both alone and in combination with conventional cancer zzso Because the tumor zzso zzso is involved in many zzso zzso and is zzso in more than 50% of zzso we determined whether zzso is necessary for the zzso effects observed following treatment with zzso zzso We also established that colon cancer cells express zzso which has not been demonstrated zzso The effects of zzso zzso on the growth, proliferation and zzso of colon cancer cells in zzso was then zzso We report five major zzso zzso zzso zzso results in significant activity in models of colon cancer, zzso zzso zzso increase the zzso effects of radiation and chemotherapy, zzso zzso is not required for the zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso human colon cancer cells express zzso and zzso zzso zzso leads to decreased cell survival and proliferation and zzso zzso of colon cancer cells in zzso These results provide a basis for future studies determining the potential of utilizing zzso zzso for human colon cancer zzso
