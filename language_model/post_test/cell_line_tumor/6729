zzso and its zzso are potent zzso zzso of zzso zzso function, through a zzso zzso interaction with specific zzso zzso In addition, fluctuations in the concentration of zzso and zzso in particular, have been shown to zzso zzso zzso gene expression and zzso In this study, mouse zzso cells were induced to differentiate into zzso zzso which express specific zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cell death, induced in the presence of zzso was efficiently prevented by zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso was accompanied by zzso c release to the zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso while the levels of the zzso proteins zzso and zzso remained zzso In the presence of the most potent zzso zzso DNA fragmentation as well as zzso c and zzso zzso were zzso On the other hand, short-term exposure zzso zzso 24 zzso of zzso zzso to zzso and zzso significantly increased the levels of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso while the levels of zzso zzso of zzso zzso were not zzso These results suggest that zzso interfering with the zzso zzso pathway, are able to act as survival factors in zzso cells, while they contribute to zzso zzso plasticity modulating the expression of its zzso
