The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso as well as the expression of zzso resistance 1 zzso and lung zzso protein zzso of the human zzso lung cancer cell line zzso 

zzso was used to inhibit zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso Western zzso analysis was used to detect the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to detect the drug sensitivity of tumor zzso zzso zzso was used to detect the zzso zzso zzso Western zzso and real-time zzso zzso were used to detect the expression of tumor zzso and zzso 

zzso can zzso the cellular zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso After treatment with zzso zzso and 10 zzso of zzso the cells became more sensitive to the drug and the reversal folds zzso of tumor cell sensitivity to the drug were zzso and zzso zzso The zzso content of zzso improved by zzso and zzso zzso The zzso levels of zzso were zzso and zzso of the control, zzso The zzso level of zzso was zzso and zzso of the control, zzso The expression of zzso and zzso protein significantly zzso 

The zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso cells can reverse zzso resistance and increase the sensitivity of the cells to the zzso The mechanism may be related to the zzso of cellular zzso and zzso
