The expression levels of zzso zzso zzso which are gap junction zzso zzso are often decreased in many zzso and restoring their levels has been shown to have zzso zzso Previously, dysfunctional gap zzso zzso communication zzso has been observed in several zzso zzso zzso and among the many zzso zzso zzso is prominently expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso we investigated whether zzso zzso has an zzso effect on an zzso cell line zzso zzso especially with regard to drug zzso After treatment with the zzso agent zzso zzso zzso cell viability significantly zzso and zzso induction was observed in zzso zzso A specific zzso inhibitor could not abrogate this zzso On the other hand, the zzso protein is known to zzso zzso which results in zzso zzso This suggests that zzso activity might also be regulated by the zzso of zzso In fact, the zzso protein level was decreased in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso reinforced zzso zzso in parental zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso could improve the resistance to zzso in a zzso manner, which may be partly zzso by the suppression of zzso zzso
