zzso are critically dependent on zzso for their zzso zzso survival, and zzso of zzso zzso We previously showed that the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso which is shared by zzso zzso and zzso is directly zzso and zzso by the zzso in a zzso zzso However, studies describing the spatial distribution, zzso regulation, and trafficking of zzso receptors in human zzso are currently zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso methods, we clearly demonstrate that zzso reside in and are zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses in zzso cells and human zzso revealed significant zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso positive zzso Moreover, whereas zzso zzso were detected in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso data revealed that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Lastly, we show that optimal zzso signaling requires entry of activated zzso into the zzso zzso as zzso of key signaling molecules with the zzso was completely blocked when either zzso zzso was zzso These data provide the first evidence that zzso segregate and traffic into two distinct plasma membrane zzso and they further establish that zzso zzso regulates signaling both positively and zzso
