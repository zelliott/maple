Little evidence is known from experimental research for zzso zzso zzso zzso This study was to investigate the effect of zzso chemotherapy on gastrointestinal cancer cells in zzso and explore the possible factors which may affect this zzso 

zzso cancer cell line zzso and zzso cancer cell line zzso were zzso zzso were treated with different drugs, temperatures and zzso Cell viability and growth were measured by zzso zzso The zzso of the cells was observed under a zzso 

zzso synergistic effect was observed when the two cancer cell lines were treated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso in combination with elevated zzso from 41 degrees C to 45 degrees C compared with control group ( zzso The strongest effect was achieved at 45 degrees C, which the zzso effects of these four drugs were zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso The zzso effect demonstrated a time and zzso manner in zzso cells within a certain period of zzso The effect revealed a flat curve after 90 zzso when zzso was treated with 43 zzso zzso had the strongest effect at any conditions among all tested drugs ( zzso Either simple zzso or zzso displayed considerable killing effects on cancer cells which were confirmed by microscope zzso And a great deal of dead cells were observed when treated with zzso 

zzso or zzso reveals relatively satisfactory zzso effects with the optimal temperature of zzso degrees zzso Taken practical application into consideration, 60 zzso may be selected in clinical zzso zzso zzso effects of zzso in combination with zzso were prior to zzso zzso or zzso which deserve further clinical zzso
