The zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso play critical roles in blood vessel zzso and are frequently zzso in a wide variety of zzso We studied the zzso expression and biological role of zzso in head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso We tested the effect of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso on cell growth, migration and invasion, and the effect of zzso zzso on tumor growth in zzso All zzso tumor samples express zzso and levels of expression correlate directly with higher stage and zzso zzso zzso Six of 7 zzso zzso cell lines express zzso which is induced either by zzso zzso or by zzso gene zzso zzso was expressed in zzso tumors and 5 of 7 zzso cell zzso zzso provides survival advantage to tumor cells in that zzso zzso and zzso significantly inhibit tumor cell zzso induce zzso activate zzso and sensitize cells to zzso cell zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso significantly zzso the growth of zzso tumor zzso in zzso zzso of zzso in zzso tumor cells zzso survival and invasive properties, and thereby provides a strong rationale for targeting zzso as novel therapy for zzso
