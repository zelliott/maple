zzso zzso viruses show promise for cancer zzso However, it is unlikely that they will fulfill their therapeutic potential when used as zzso An alternative strategy is to use these viruses not only as zzso agents but also as a delivery mechanism of therapeutic zzso to enhance tumor cell zzso The zzso zzso virus 1 deletion zzso zzso is a zzso replicating zzso virus that selectively replicates in and zzso dividing tumor zzso It has a proven safety profile in clinical trials and has demonstrated efficacy as a zzso zzso To enhance its therapeutic potential, we have engineered zzso to convey the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso whose expression zzso infected cells with the capacity to accumulate the zzso analog zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso cells are susceptible to targeted zzso using zzso zzso a strategy that has already shown promise for combined targeted zzso therapy in cancer cells after zzso zzso 

We used zzso as a dual cell zzso delivery vehicle for targeting the zzso zzso to human tumor zzso in zzso 

In tumor zzso that did not express zzso zzso or intravenous injection of zzso induced the capacity for active zzso of zzso Administration of zzso and zzso resulted in decreased tumor growth and enhanced survival relative to injection of either agent zzso zzso was dependent on the scheduling of delivery of the 2 zzso 

These findings support a role for combination zzso therapy for cancer using zzso expressing the zzso zzso and targeted zzso zzso
