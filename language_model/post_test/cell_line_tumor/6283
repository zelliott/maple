zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso of Alzheimer's disease, is generated by zzso metabolism of zzso zzso precursor zzso In general, mature zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is subject to successive zzso by zzso or zzso and zzso in the late protein zzso zzso and/or at plasma zzso while immature zzso zzso zzso zzso locates in the early zzso zzso such as zzso zzso or zzso in which zzso is not subject to zzso zzso zzso zzso is a neural zzso protein composed of a zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso zzso suppresses zzso zzso of zzso by direct binding of zzso through its zzso domain, thereby generation of zzso zzso zzso expresses another function in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso 

In order to analyze novel function of zzso in zzso trafficking of zzso we performed a functional dissection of zzso Using cells expressing various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso trafficking was examined along with analysis of zzso metabolism including maturation zzso processing and zzso of zzso 

zzso accumulates zzso into the early zzso zzso by mediation of its zzso zzso zzso without being bound to zzso zzso With this novel function, zzso suppresses overall zzso metabolism and results in further suppression of zzso zzso Interestingly some of the accumulated zzso in the early zzso zzso are likely to appear on plasma membrane by unidentified zzso zzso of zzso to plasma membrane is observed in other zzso family zzso zzso and zzso but not in other zzso partners such as zzso and zzso It is zzso clear that respective functional zzso of zzso regulate zzso metabolism at multiple steps in zzso protein zzso zzso
