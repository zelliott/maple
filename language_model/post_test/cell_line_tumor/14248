The zzso II from zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso toxin family of zzso microbial proteins that includes the zzso zzso zzso Compared with other proteins of the family, zzso II has 90 extra zzso acids at its zzso To examine more closely the zzso and zzso properties of the zzso we have cloned and expressed it in zzso zzso We developed a zzso procedure for the matured zzso protein from both culture media and cell extracts using a combination of zzso exchange and affinity zzso together with zzso In both cases, the fully processed zzso protein was zzso as confirmed by zzso sequence zzso The zzso protein exhibits zzso activity of different extent on zzso from various kinds of zzso The results presented here show for the first time that two types of human cells are sensitive to zzso zzso In view of its broad zzso activity as well as the ability to interact with artificial zzso we assume that zzso needs no specific zzso to bind to cell zzso
