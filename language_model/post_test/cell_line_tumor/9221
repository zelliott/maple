Nuclear zzso zzso plays a crucial role in the regulation of inflammatory zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso signaling may represent a therapeutic strategy in cancer and inflammation zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of zzso isolated from zzso namely zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A, B, D and zzso on the zzso of zzso cell growth of cancer cells, cell cycle progression and zzso In addition, their effects on the activity of zzso zzso zzso were also zzso 

zzso reporter gene zzso was conducted in zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and cell growth zzso was determined by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Cell cycle analysis was carried out by flow zzso and zzso was observed by zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso cells, zzso zzso by zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso A and zzso A, B, D and zzso while zzso zzso zzso was not zzso zzso zzso activity was inhibited by zzso zzso A and zzso but not by zzso A, zzso B and zzso These compounds were effective in zzso the growth of a panel of human tumor cell lines in a zzso zzso Cell cycle analysis and zzso zzso indicated cell cycle arrest in zzso phase and induction of zzso 

zzso zzso A and zzso A, B, D and E inhibited tumor cell growth and induced cell cycle arrest and zzso These effects may be related to zzso of zzso zzso
