Natural compounds are a great source of cancer zzso zzso Our investigation indicates that zzso a zzso extracted from medicinal plants, zzso the proliferation of zzso cells in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso cells in a zzso manner, as determined by zzso zzso and flow zzso The zzso was accompanied by increased zzso protein levels and decreased zzso protein levels in zzso zzso Furthermore, the treatment of zzso cells with zzso altered the expression of zzso We found that 27 zzso were zzso expressed in zzso cells, of which 8 zzso target genes related to cell proliferation and zzso In zzso our results demonstrate that zzso has a significant zzso effect on the proliferation of zzso zzso It is possible that zzso of zzso and regulation of expression of specific zzso play a role in zzso of proliferation and induction of zzso in zzso zzso zzso can be applied to lung zzso as a zzso zzso
