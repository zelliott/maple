Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer death due to the high zzso of zzso therefore, novel and effective treatments are urgently zzso A current strategy is zzso targeted gene zzso Although many identified that zzso promoters are highly specific, they tend to have low activity compared with the ubiquitous zzso zzso promoter, limiting their zzso We developed a targeted gene therapy expression system for lung cancer that is highly specific with strong zzso Our expression zzso uses the zzso promoter, highly expressed in many zzso but not normal adult zzso We enhanced the zzso promoter activity comparable to the zzso promoter in lung cancer cell lines using an established platform technology, whereas the zzso promoter remained weak in normal zzso In mouse models, the zzso was specifically expressed in the lung tumor zzso compared with the zzso promoter that was expressed in both normal and tumor zzso In addition, the therapeutic gene zzso a zzso form of zzso zzso interacting killer, induced cell killing in zzso and inhibited cell growth and prolonged mouse survival in zzso zzso there was virtually no toxicity when zzso was expressed with our expression zzso Thus, the current report provides a therapeutic efficacy and safe strategy worthy of development in clinical trials treating lung zzso
