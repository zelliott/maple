We investigated the metabolism of zzso a selective zzso zzso and the potential for zzso zzso Although zzso zzso zzso zzso appeared to be the major zzso zzso zzso involved in the metabolism of zzso the results suggested that zzso metabolism was inhibited less than 50% by zzso a zzso zzso zzso or by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibited little effect on zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso inhibited zzso and/or zzso and zzso with zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso ratios were zzso and zzso zzso The zzso values were about zzso greater than the zzso therefore it is suggested that, at clinical doses, zzso will not affect the zzso of zzso administered drugs that are primarily zzso by zzso and/or zzso or zzso
