The zzso growth factor zzso zzso is commonly zzso zzso and zzso in glioblastoma, making it a compelling molecular target for zzso We have recently shown that zzso of zzso and zzso protein by zzso cells is strongly associated with clinical response to zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso loss, by zzso zzso of the zzso from downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso seems to act as a resistance zzso Because zzso to 50% of zzso are zzso zzso a critical challenge is to identify strategies that promote responsiveness to zzso zzso zzso in patients whose tumors lack zzso Here, we show that the zzso target of zzso zzso inhibitor zzso enhances the sensitivity of zzso tumor cells to the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso In two zzso model systems zzso zzso cells expressing zzso zzso and zzso in relevant combinations, and zzso zzso cells in which zzso protein expression has been zzso zzso we show that combined zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor cell growth and has an additive effect on zzso downstream zzso zzso zzso We also show that combination therapy provides added benefit in promoting cell death in zzso tumor zzso These studies provide strong rationale for combined zzso zzso inhibitor therapy in zzso patients, particularly those with zzso zzso
