This study investigated the enrichment of cancer stem cells zzso in zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso cells were zzso into mice treated with 0, 2, 5 or 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso from the resulting zzso was zzso into zzso mice two more times, thus producing three generations of zzso cells for each dose of zzso zzso and zzso cell sorting analyses were performed to determine the purity of the enriched zzso zzso culture, colony formation and proliferation zzso demonstrated that the zzso potential, zzso activity and zzso of the enriched cells in zzso increased with increasing chemotherapy dose and zzso The ability of the enriched cells to produce zzso zzso in mice was also dependent on chemotherapy dose and zzso In conclusion, subjecting zzso cells to chemotherapy in zzso enriched the samples for zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso
