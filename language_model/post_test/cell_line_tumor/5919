zzso DNA regions, which include those recognized by the zzso zzso factor in several gene zzso also zzso potential binding sites for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso We explored the differences between changes in gene expression caused by the ability of these drugs to compete with zzso for binding to DNA and those produced by zzso zzso By quantitative zzso of around 100 zzso most of them involved in control of cell cycle zzso we found that the treatment of human zzso breast zzso cells with zzso zzso for 24 h produced a profile of gene zzso markedly different from the profile caused by zzso treatment or by stable zzso zzso These observations are rationalized by considering a zzso effect of zzso on zzso interaction with several gene zzso thus representing potential therapeutic targets for zzso in contrast to a less specific effect of reducing the availability of zzso through zzso zzso Genes zzso upon each treatment were mapped to their molecular and biological functions, which documented the zzso among other things, of genes involved in zzso zzso regulation, granting us insights into the effects of challenging the zzso of gene expression by zzso
