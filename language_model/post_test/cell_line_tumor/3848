Breast cancer accounts for more than 450,000 deaths per year zzso Discovery of novel therapeutic targets that will allow zzso treatment of this disease is an emerging area of scientific zzso Recently, zzso has been identified as one such therapeutic zzso Its zzso is indicative of worse overall survival in the zzso patient zzso In this paper, we analyze data from a large invasive breast zzso study and confirm zzso zzso In search for genes that are zzso with zzso we identify a potential novel breast zzso zzso located on zzso zzso Furthermore, we search for zzso zzso zzso genes that interact with a statistically significantly high number of genes which are zzso with zzso and confirm their involvement in this female zzso Among the influential zzso we find genes which belong to the core zzso (a recently identified zzso relevant set of genes which is known to drive disease zzso and propose that they might be important for breast cancer zzso and serve as its novel therapeutic zzso Finally, we identify a zzso that may play a role in zzso amplification process and we zzso confirm downstream signaling mechanism of zzso in breast cancer zzso
