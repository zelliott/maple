We sought to investigate the role and diagnostic value of zzso 155 zzso in zzso zzso 

Using real-time quantitative zzso chain reaction analysis, zzso expression levels were assessed in zzso cell lines and a zzso HB cell zzso The correlation between zzso expression level and clinical parameters was analyzed in 46 patients with zzso In addition, the effects of zzso on zzso cell proliferation were evaluated by modulating its expression using an zzso mimic and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso was found in zzso cell lines and in zzso of patients with zzso The receiver operator characteristic analysis indicated zzso zzso zzso of zzso correlated with the zzso grade zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso enhanced zzso cell zzso 

In zzso zzso of zzso correlated with the zzso grade and can be used as a potential zzso zzso
