To zzso investigate the zzso of human gastric cancer zzso cell zzso and then compare the zzso ability of different clones in order to identify the tumor stem cell zzso 

zzso derived from gastric cancer zzso cells were assessed by zzso zzso and the clone formation rate and proportion of each clone were zzso The expression of zzso and zzso in different clones was detected by zzso zzso and Western zzso Furthermore, different clones were isolated and zzso and their zzso property was zzso zzso of different clones were zzso zzso into nude mice and the zzso ability of each group was zzso 

zzso derived from gastric cancer zzso cells had three types, zzso clones of tight, transitional and loose zzso The total clone formation rate was zzso zzso zzso and the proportion of tight, transitional and loose type clones was zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results of zzso microscopic examination showed that the signal of zzso was significantly stronger in the tight clones than in the transitional and loose zzso however, the signal of zzso was weakest in the tight zzso The results of Western zzso were consistent with that of zzso microscopic zzso zzso cells of tight clones possessed strong ability of zzso and in zzso zzso in the nude zzso 

zzso cell clones vary in zzso and zzso and the tight type clones may include rich gastric cancer stem zzso
