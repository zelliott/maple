Few human zzso zzso head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso cell lines zzso We established University of zzso cell zzso zzso a new zzso zzso cell line from a zzso oral cavity zzso and characterized it for the presence of cancer stem cells zzso 

zzso cells were tested for zzso expression by zzso and the presence of zzso was assessed by several zzso 

zzso has a unique zzso contains zzso and expresses zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells in an zzso mouse resulted in tumor growth from the zzso cells after 6 weeks that zzso the zzso of the primary, whereas zzso cells did not produce zzso 

zzso a new zzso zzso zzso cell line will aid in studying zzso zzso zzso The aggressive nature of this tumor is consistent with high uniform expression of zzso growth factor zzso zzso and a functionally significant proportion of zzso zzso
