Although the zzso effect of iron on zzso production of zzso free radical zzso oxide zzso has been reported, its possible influence on zzso zzso activity has not been zzso In the present study, zzso markedly reduced zzso + zzso NO synthesis in mouse and rat zzso The effect of iron coincided with the loss of zzso zzso activity against zzso zzso rat zzso and zzso mouse zzso cell lines, as measured by zzso zzso for cellular zzso and the crystal violet test for cell zzso zzso cell survival did not improve further in the presence of zzso if zzso NO release and zzso were already blocked by zzso In accordance with the results obtained with zzso iron, cell membrane permeable iron zzso zzso enhanced both zzso NO release and zzso zzso Iron also zzso NO production and increased the viability of zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso + zzso in the absence of zzso However, neither NO release nor cell viability was affected by iron addition to cultures of the zzso zzso cell zzso Iron was unable to prevent zzso and zzso cell death induced by the NO releasing chemicals zzso and zzso indicating that zzso zzso of NO zzso rather than interference with its zzso action, was responsible for the protection of zzso zzso zzso these results indicate that iron might protect zzso cells by reducing both zzso and zzso zzso NO zzso
