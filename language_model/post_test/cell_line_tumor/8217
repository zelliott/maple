The effect of zzso therapy zzso on neural cells is important when zzso are within or adjacent to the nervous zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso on rat zzso and satellite zzso compared with human zzso cells zzso 

Fluorescence zzso confirmed that zzso was incorporated into all three cell zzso zzso of cells exposed to zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined in a novel zzso collagen gel culture zzso Cell death was zzso using zzso zzso and cell types were distinguished using zzso In some cases, zzso survival was confirmed by measuring subsequent zzso growth in zzso zzso 

zzso and satellite zzso were significantly more sensitive to zzso than zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso caused no significant zzso death compared with zzso controls but was sufficient to elicit substantial cell death in the other cell zzso Initially, treatment reduced zzso zzso zzso then extended zzso equivalent to those of zzso zzso The protocol was validated using zzso zzso zzso zzso which caused zzso death equivalent to other cell zzso 

zzso in culture can survive zzso under conditions sufficient to kill zzso cells and other nervous system zzso
