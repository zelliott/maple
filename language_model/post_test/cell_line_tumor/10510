zzso a yellow zzso extracted from zzso is widely used to inhibit tumor zzso Since it can either promote or suppress the immune system, how zzso affects the immune system in zzso bodies is not yet zzso Our study found that zzso mice treated zzso once a day with zzso zzso for ten days led to a retarded tumor growth and a longer survival, which might be contributed to T zzso zzso immune zzso The in zzso study also showed that a high-dose zzso decreases T cells whereas a zzso increases T cells derived from zzso zzso mice, especially zzso T zzso zzso these increased zzso T cells exhibited the enhancement of zzso zzso proliferation and zzso specifically against zzso tumor cells, which may result in the success of zzso zzso Our research demonstrated a beneficial effect of zzso on zzso T cells derived from zzso mice, which can provide a potential application in zzso zzso
