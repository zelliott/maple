Mouse zzso have been suggested to resemble common fragile sites zzso showing disrupted zzso fluorescent in zzso zzso signals after zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso is induced by deletion of zzso a zzso protein that binds zzso DNA and promotes efficient replication of the zzso zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso repeats present at human zzso zzso form an zzso zzso zzso binds to and zzso zzso zzso but does not affect other zzso establishing zzso as the first zzso controlled by a zzso DNA binding zzso The data show that zzso DNA is inherently fragile regardless of its zzso position and imply that zzso can be caused by a specific DNA zzso
