Breast cancer zzso molecular variations can dramatically affect patient responses to existing zzso It is thought that zzso zzso protein zzso might be a useful zzso zzso of drug response in the zzso However, the accurate detection and quantitative analysis of zzso protein zzso and zzso in tumors are limited by current zzso Using a novel, fully automated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designed to separate protein molecules based on their zzso point, we developed a reliable and highly sensitive zzso for the detection and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in breast zzso This zzso enabled the measurement of activated zzso in breast cancer cells using protein produced from as few as 56 zzso zzso we were able to assign an identity for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso the major form of activated zzso involved in multiple zzso including breast, and a current focus in clinical trials for targeted zzso The ability of our zzso zzso to detect and measure zzso zzso from very low amounts of total protein will allow the accurate evaluation of patient response to drugs targeting activated zzso using scarce clinical zzso Moreover, the capacity of this zzso to detect and measure all three zzso zzso using one single zzso zzso enables the study of the multiple and variable roles that these zzso play in zzso zzso
