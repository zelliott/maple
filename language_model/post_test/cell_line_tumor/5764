zzso evidence suggests that recurrence of zzso head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso is due to the outgrowth of zzso residual tumor cells as well as to the zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso We studied the impact of processes triggered by zzso surgery in stimulating both residual tumor cells zzso to zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso cells surrounding the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso by zzso and gene status by FISH were investigated in 23 primary zzso and surrounding zzso The ability to induce cell proliferation of wound healing zzso collected from 12 relapsed and 11 not relapsed patients was evaluated by a zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso three zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso therapeutic zzso 

zzso tumors showed zzso zzso expression zzso zzso zzso and zzso FISH zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso surrounding the zzso tumor displayed zzso zzso zzso zzso and gene amplification were observed in normal and zzso zzso zzso Each tested wound healing drainage induced the cells to zzso and the proliferation was significantly higher in relapsed compared with not relapsed zzso patients zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso treatments inhibited the zzso zzso with the highest zzso efficiency by zzso on zzso cells, while zzso cell growth was more efficiently inhibited by zzso zzso zzso 

Surgery could favor the proliferation of cells showing zzso zzso such as residual tumor cells and/or zzso zzso cells already present after zzso Treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso according to the zzso family zzso
