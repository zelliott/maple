zzso drug delivery systems are used not only to improve zzso zzso of drug molecules but also to achieve desirable zzso and an enhanced therapeutic zzso New zzso zzso are needed to improve the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso In this study, the synthesis and characterization of zzso zzso zzso zzso containing multiple PG chains centered on a zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso were zzso The zzso PG zzso were obtained by zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso using zzso or zzso as the zzso These zzso were zzso in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso B, albeit more slowly than linear zzso Unlike conventional linear zzso each zzso PG possessed multiple terminal zzso zzso This made it possible to attach multiple targeting zzso selectively to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso to the chain ends of zzso PG was demonstrated in the presence of side chain zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso acid, a model targeting zzso and the zzso dye zzso green, a model diagnostic agent, were successfully zzso to the terminal zzso groups and the side chain zzso groups of zzso zzso zzso The resulting zzso had reduced zzso interaction and bound selectively to tumor cells expressing folate zzso Thus, zzso PG may be useful as a zzso carrier for targeted drug zzso
