zzso zzso represents a major problem in zzso since this type of cancer responds poorly to conventional zzso Many groups are actively involved in the search of new experimental strategies to bypass this zzso We investigated the effects of zzso zzso which derives from the zzso zzso zzso metabolism of zzso This compound has raised much interest in the past few decades for its zzso effects on the growth of cancer cells of different zzso however, little is known about its use on colon zzso cell zzso In the present study, we investigated the effects of zzso on cell proliferation and cell cycle of two human colon zzso cell lines, namely zzso and zzso Our results showed a net zzso effect of zzso on both cell lines, which is accompanied by cell cycle zzso moreover, we demonstrated that zzso is able to induce zzso as well as zzso This body of evidence points out that zzso could be considered as a promising tool against colon zzso
