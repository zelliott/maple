The zzso factor zzso zzso zzso mediates zzso of the sonic zzso zzso pathway, a process that precedes the transformation of tissue stem cells into zzso stem cells and that is involved in early and late zzso zzso zzso that targeting the zzso region zzso of zzso zzso would effectively inhibit zzso tumor cell zzso we evaluated several complementary zzso molecules for their ability to do zzso The synthetic zzso and corresponding zzso zzso zzso were introduced as zzso zzso zzso into zzso portions of the zzso zzso zzso One particular zzso zzso zzso and its corresponding duplex zzso zzso significantly inhibited proliferation of zzso zzso zzso and pancreatic zzso tumor cells by delaying cell division and zzso late zzso in zzso zzso Here, we describe the design of effective zzso sequences and their applications as zzso zzso
