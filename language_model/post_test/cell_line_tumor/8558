To investigate whether bone zzso zzso zzso expression was involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso osteogenesis in human zzso cells in zzso 

zzso zzso human zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso zzso for 48 zzso Cell cycle zzso were determined using flow zzso zzso The protein levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were measured with Western zzso while the zzso level of zzso was measured with zzso zzso The expression of zzso in zzso cells was also studied using zzso zzso The level of zzso was measured with zzso zzso 

zzso treatment significantly zzso proliferation of zzso cells, and increased the expression of zzso and the zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso signaling inhibitor zzso zzso zzso did not affect zzso proliferation and zzso zzso but abolished the zzso increases of the zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso treatment markedly increased zzso level in zzso cells, whereas zzso with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso (5 zzso abolished the zzso increases of zzso level and zzso zzso 

In zzso cells, the zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso differentiation but not in zzso whereas the zzso zzso is involved in the expression of zzso
