To determine the zzso ability of combined zzso of natural killer zzso cells and zzso cells zzso in a melanoma mouse model and the functions of zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso mouse model of subcutaneous melanoma and lung zzso was zzso zzso cells and zzso were cultured and labeled in zzso zzso zzso of both zzso cells and zzso were zzso transferred into zzso zzso zzso liver, zzso and lung were studied for the number and distribution of zzso zzso Additionally, zzso cell numbers in the lung and numbers of zzso lung zzso were zzso 

zzso of zzso cells and zzso might maintain and promote zzso cell activity without zzso zzso Both zzso cells and zzso were distributed in the tumor zzso and zzso We found significant zzso differences in the numbers of zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso the highest zzso of zzso cells 4 h after transfer and the lowest at 12 zzso Low zzso cell numbers were found in the zzso and fewer numbers were found in liver and zzso zzso of tumors with zzso cells was greatest following mixed cell transfers as compared to single zzso and markedly increased zzso cells were associated with significant decreases in lung zzso 

zzso cells and zzso adoptive zzso targeted the tumor and exhibited improved therapeutic efficacy as compared to that of the cells given zzso This strategy could induce zzso zzso memory and suggests that mixed zzso cells and zzso adoptive zzso offers therapeutic options against zzso
