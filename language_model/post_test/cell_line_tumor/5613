zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells results in cell zzso We have hypothesized that this is due to an increase of de zzso DNA zzso We show here that zzso of zzso leads to an increased DNA zzso as measured by the expression levels of the proliferation markers zzso zzso and zzso The enhancing effect was even higher with zzso zzso and zzso zzso The mechanism for this did not involve the zzso activity of the zzso but, rather, the presence of the protein zzso zzso zzso as zzso with zzso for zzso zzso the zzso The two zzso zzso had in common a zzso consensus site that, in the zzso counterparts, could be recognized by zzso zzso such as zzso Even though zzso and zzso cannot bind zzso they could still find other protein partners, one of which, we have reasoned, could be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is indeed activated by zzso and zzso by zzso in zzso We concluded that zzso zzso aided by zzso mediates zzso activity, whereas zzso zzso mediates an induction of cell zzso and the specific zzso involved in this newly discovered regulation of zzso are zzso and zzso
