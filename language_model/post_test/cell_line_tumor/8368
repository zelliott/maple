Breast cancer zzso gene zzso is implicated in the control of zzso zzso although the underlying zzso remains to be further zzso zzso of zzso function leads to disrupted zzso machinery and zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso physically interacts and zzso with zzso an important zzso involved in zzso maturation and zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso and its protein stability are regulated by normal cellular zzso function because cells containing zzso zzso or silenced for zzso zzso exhibit disrupted zzso zzso to zzso and enhanced zzso zzso Its is likely that the zzso regulation of zzso stability involves zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso via the small interfering zzso approach results in zzso zzso formation, aborted zzso zzso and zzso which mimic the zzso of disrupted zzso Thus, zzso interaction of zzso might be required for the successful zzso zzso and abnormalities of zzso lead to zzso zzso
