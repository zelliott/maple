The von zzso zzso protein protects zzso zzso from zzso by zzso zzso Based on this zzso zzso with zzso end points, zzso has been reported to directly stabilize the zzso zzso To investigate the dynamic changes in zzso induced by zzso in living cells, we measured the influence of zzso on zzso turnover using zzso recovery after zzso zzso To this end, we engineered zzso zzso cell zzso cells to zzso incorporate zzso labeled zzso and to zzso express zzso zzso of zzso in these cells resulted in a decrease of zzso turnover as measured by zzso at the cell zzso while minimally influencing zzso dynamics around the zzso Our data indicates that zzso changes the behavior of zzso dependent on their zzso zzso zzso a role for zzso in cellular processes such as migration, zzso and zzso zzso Here we propose a complementary method to directly measure zzso zzso changes in zzso zzso which may serve as a tool to study the effect of zzso binding proteins such as zzso
