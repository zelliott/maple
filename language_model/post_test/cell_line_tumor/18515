zzso of the zzso protein zzso has been associated with several zzso including small cell lung cancer zzso In the present study, we have investigated if zzso contributes to the emergence of zzso resistance in zzso zzso zzso The ability of zzso to induce zzso was decreased in zzso cells that acquired resistance to zzso zzso The level of zzso was, however, substantially reduced in zzso cells compared to parental zzso zzso There was little change in zzso content in zzso cells that were resistant to zzso zzso or zzso zzso was zzso zzso at zzso 70 in zzso cells but not in zzso cells and zzso had little effect on zzso zzso The level of zzso was elevated in zzso cells but the ability of zzso to induce zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was compromised in zzso zzso The level of the zzso protein zzso and the zzso protein zzso was slightly reduced in zzso cells but the ratio of zzso and zzso zzso family proteins was not sufficient to explain cellular resistance to zzso These results suggest that the acquisition of zzso resistance by zzso cells was not due to an increase in the zzso status of the zzso protein zzso
