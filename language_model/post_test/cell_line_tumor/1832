Our expression signatures of human zzso including head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso of zzso zzso were frequently observed in cancer zzso The restoration of zzso in cancer cells revealed that it functions as a tumor zzso In this study, we investigated the novel molecular targets of zzso in zzso cancer cells and its zzso function, especially as it contributes to cancer cell migration and zzso The zzso gene expression analysis and zzso study showed that zzso protein 2/3 complex zzso 5 zzso is a candidate target of zzso Furthermore, zzso reporter zzso demonstrated that zzso is directly regulated by zzso zzso of zzso revealed significant zzso of cell migration and invasion in zzso cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso In zzso cells, restoration of zzso or zzso zzso led to a reorganization of the zzso zzso and a subsequent change in cell zzso to a round, zzso zzso The expression levels of zzso were significantly higher in zzso zzso than in zzso zzso zzso showed that the levels of zzso expression were significantly higher in invasive cancer zzso zzso contributed to cancer cell migration and invasion in zzso and this gene was directly regulated by zzso Our analysis of novel zzso zzso cancer pathways provides new insights into the potential mechanisms of zzso zzso
