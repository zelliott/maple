To determine the effect of zzso ultrasound zzso on zzso cell killing, zzso and zzso cell lines were exposed to zzso zzso US with 50% of duty factor at zzso zzso and zzso at 1 zzso immediately after exposure to zzso at 0, zzso zzso and 5 zzso The cells were zzso 24 h after the zzso The result showed significant enhancement of cell killing in the combined zzso However, the ratio of zzso cells induced either by zzso or US alone did not significantly zzso These findings suggest that zzso US can enhance the zzso effect of zzso due to US streaming under zzso zzso zzso This combined treatment can potentially enhance the therapeutic effect of radiation zzso
