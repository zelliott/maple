zzso zzso 1 zzso plays an important role in the transport of zzso in the zzso During early pregnancy, zzso occurs in a relatively hypoxic environment that is essential for appropriate embryonic development, and zzso expression is enhanced in response to oxygen zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in the induction of zzso expression in other zzso The present study was designed to test whether zzso is involved in zzso zzso of zzso expression using zzso human zzso and rat zzso cells as zzso zzso zzso and protein expression were elevated under zzso zzso or in the presence of zzso zzso which has been shown to mimic zzso Using rat zzso zzso zzso zzso we showed that this zzso was zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso promoter indicated that a 184 zzso zzso element zzso of the promoter was essential to increase zzso reporter gene expression in response to zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells cultured under zzso zzso or with zzso showed increased expression of zzso protein compared with those cultured under zzso zzso To test whether this factor is directly involved in zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso and zzso cells were zzso zzso with an zzso expression zzso zzso zzso markedly increased the zzso promoter activity from zzso containing the zzso site, while the zzso promoter zzso lacking the zzso site were not activated by zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso is zzso under zzso zzso or in the presence of zzso in the zzso cell lines through zzso interaction with a consensus zzso site of the zzso zzso
