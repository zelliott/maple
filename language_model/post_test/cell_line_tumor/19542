To investigate the mechanisms of tumor zzso and zzso of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso mice were chosen to observe the effects of tumor zzso and detect the proliferation function of T zzso the toxicity function of zzso cells, the changes of T zzso and the contents of zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso could obviously inhibit the growth of zzso cancer in mice, and the tumor zzso rat was zzso The stimulation index of T zzso transformation and percentage of zzso cells in zzso zzso group were obviously higher than those in the normal control zzso The zzso proportion of T zzso in zzso zzso group was changed more than the normal control zzso The production of zzso and zzso by T zzso obviously increased in zzso zzso group ( zzso zzso 

zzso zzso has the effect of zzso the growth of tumor zzso and regulating zzso function on mice with zzso Its mechanisms include the reinforcement of T zzso immune function, zzso cell killing function and zzso immune zzso
