The Id zzso of DNA zzso proteins are a family of zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso that lack the basic domain necessary for DNA zzso The zzso protein enhances cell proliferation and zzso cellular differentiation in a variety of cell zzso We have previously demonstrated that the zzso gene is zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso In this study we characterized the expression and distribution of the zzso protein in normal, zzso and zzso human zzso zzso We also evaluated the effect of the zzso gene on zzso cancer cell growth and markers of zzso cell zzso We used zzso zzso to characterize zzso protein expression in normal, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso tissue from 103 zzso zzso zzso tissue had the lowest level of zzso protein expression zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer had the highest level zzso benign and zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso protein expression was higher in zzso zzso tissue than in zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso We found no significant association between the level of zzso protein expression and patient age, sex, zzso stage, tumor size, primary tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso primary tumor zzso zzso tumors, and extent of tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cancer cell lines using zzso zzso zzso resulted in growth zzso zzso zzso zzso and decreased zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso is zzso in zzso and zzso zzso tissue and directly regulates the growth of zzso cancer cells of zzso cell origin, but is not a marker of aggressive zzso in differentiated zzso zzso
