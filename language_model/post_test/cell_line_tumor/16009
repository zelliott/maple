zzso are enveloped zzso viruses with a zzso life cycle that cause acute and persistent zzso Here, we investigated the role of the host cell's unfolded protein response zzso in infection of the zzso zzso zzso zzso virus zzso In zzso cells, the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso functions as the principal sensor for the induction of the zzso and interacts with three zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor 6 zzso Acute infection with zzso resulted in a selective induction of the zzso branch of the zzso whereas pathways controlled by zzso and zzso were neither activated nor zzso zzso of individual zzso proteins revealed that the viral zzso precursor zzso but not that of other viral zzso was responsible for the induction of zzso Rapid zzso of the viral zzso during transition from acute to persistent zzso infection restored zzso levels of zzso zzso To address a possible role of zzso signaling in zzso infection, we used cells deficient in site 2 zzso zzso a zzso required for the zzso of zzso zzso deficient in zzso showed significantly lower levels of production of infectious virus during acute but not persistent infection, indicating a requirement for zzso signaling for optimal virus zzso In zzso acute zzso infection seems to selectively induce the zzso branch of the zzso that is likely beneficial for virus replication and cell zzso but it avoids induction of zzso and zzso whose zzso may be zzso for virus and the host zzso
