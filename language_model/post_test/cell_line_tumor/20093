zzso zzso is a zzso with roles in immune responses as well as in tumor zzso zzso is often used in cancer treatment together with other zzso Here we report a novel approach to enhancement of cancer cell killing by combined treatment of zzso with zzso zzso We found that zzso treatment alone in zzso cells induced zzso of zzso in a zzso and zzso manner, and resulted in cell zzso zzso zzso treatment was correlated with zzso of zzso as the treatment shortened protein zzso of zzso As zzso is an essential cell cycle regulator for viability after DNA damage, zzso of zzso by zzso zzso in zzso cells resulted in increased cell death following zzso radiation about zzso than zzso radiation treatment alone whereas zzso treatment alone had little effect on cell zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso factor 1 zzso an zzso zzso seems to partly regulate zzso zzso zzso and radiation sensitivity because transient depletion of zzso by zzso prevented zzso zzso zzso and partly protected cells from zzso radiation cell zzso Therefore the results provide a novel rationale to combine zzso zzso and zzso zzso drugs such as zzso radiation to enhance cancer cell zzso
