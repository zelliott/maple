zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso is an important zzso factor in liver that can be activated zzso by zzso or zzso by using zzso synthetic zzso Here we initially set out to zzso the similarities in gene induction between zzso and zzso Numerous genes were commonly regulated in liver between the two treatments, including many classical zzso target zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso several genes induced by zzso were zzso by zzso independently of zzso including zzso and zzso suggesting involvement of another zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso and zzso were shown to be direct targets of zzso during zzso whereas zzso and zzso were exclusive targets of zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso and zzso genes followed the plasma free fatty acid zzso zzso consistent with zzso of zzso by plasma zzso zzso experiments using transgenic and knockout mice for zzso a potent stimulant of zzso tissue zzso confirmed the zzso effect of plasma zzso on zzso and zzso expression levels via zzso In contrast, the data did not support zzso of zzso by plasma zzso The results identify zzso and zzso as novel zzso target genes and show that zzso of gene expression by zzso is sensitive to plasma zzso zzso In contrast, this is not the case for zzso revealing a novel mechanism for functional differentiation between zzso
