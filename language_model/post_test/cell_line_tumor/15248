zzso is characterized by high resistance to zzso The aim of this study was to investigate combined effects of zzso and zzso on melanoma zzso 

zzso blue zzso zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso were used to evaluate zzso The zzso levels and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were assessed by western zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso and quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction zzso were used to evaluate changes in nuclear zzso zzso activity and gene zzso zzso 

Both drugs reduced the viability of melanoma cells and induced zzso zzso of the zzso cassette zzso B zzso zzso zzso was enhanced by zzso zzso induced activity of zzso and zzso zzso markedly reduced the zzso and zzso zzso activity measured as the nuclear zzso and expression of zzso zzso zzso and it had no effect on zzso 

zzso and zzso affected distinct pathways in melanoma, and zzso was capable of combating some zzso effects of zzso in the combined zzso This provides a rationale for in zzso investigation of this drug zzso
