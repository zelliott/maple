In order to find candidate proteins that are potentially associated with the zzso zzso in combination with drug resistance, we analyzed the differential protein expression in zzso in the human pancreatic cancer cell line zzso and classical and zzso zzso zzso and their zzso counterparts using zzso This study identifies sets of proteins that may lead to the development of zzso These results provide a fundamental basis to zzso the molecular mechanism of zzso and zzso phenomena that may assist the therapy of zzso zzso
