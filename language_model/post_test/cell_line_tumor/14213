zzso zzso zzso a zzso analogue of vitamin zzso zzso zzso in multiple cell lines in a selective manner, by zzso the intrinsic zzso Since it is a highly zzso compound, it may require a carrier protein for its trafficking to zzso targets like zzso We studied the role of the ubiquitous zzso zzso zzso or zzso 2) in zzso induction by zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells zzso them to zzso by low doses of zzso which were zzso for the parental zzso zzso induced in zzso cells was zzso and zzso as suggested by dissipation of zzso zzso potential and zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso showed affinity of zzso for zzso Finally, zzso zzso cells accumulated zzso at higher levels compared to their normal zzso We suggest that zzso may act as an zzso shuttle for zzso promoting zzso initiated by this vitamin E zzso as shown here for zzso zzso
