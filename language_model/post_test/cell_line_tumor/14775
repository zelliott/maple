This work reports the surface zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso of a zzso chemical zzso zzso zzso zzso for targeted cancer zzso We dissolved zzso in zzso solution of zzso during zzso of zzso by a modified zzso emulsion zzso evaporation zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was confirmed by zzso transform infrared zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used as a model drug and a cell specific target, zzso zzso were characterized for particle size, zzso potential and surface zzso The qualitative assessment of zzso attachment was performed by transmission electron zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed zzso attachment of zzso However, zzso attachment was abolished upon blocking the functional groups of zzso The availability of functional zzso was evaluated by the presence of a light chain fraction after gel zzso We further evaluated the in zzso release zzso of zzso from zzso coated and zzso zzso The release of zzso is enhanced upon zzso attachment and followed an anomalous release zzso We also observed that the cellular zzso of zzso was significantly higher in zzso zzso positive cells than in negative zzso zzso these results demonstrate the potential use of this method for zzso as well as to deliver zzso agents for treating zzso
