zzso therapy zzso has become an attractive option used in tumor treatment via its direct zzso activities or its zzso zzso On the other hand, heat shock protein 70 has been found to be largely associated with the establishment of zzso activities offered by zzso treated tumor zzso In the present study, we found that injection of zzso mice with colon cancer cell line zzso treated with zzso based zzso therapy zzso zzso zzso based zzso zzso together with zzso demonstrated the most effective therapeutic effects against tumor growth, followed by cells treated by zzso zzso zzso cells treated only with zzso failed to provide any therapeutic effects, although significant cell death was induced by zzso Compared to zzso treatment, zzso induced more efficient surface zzso of zzso on zzso cells which correlated with efficient zzso of zzso zzso T cells and with effective zzso zzso Thus, our study demonstrated that the surface expression of zzso may play a more important role than the total expression or release of this zzso in the zzso of immune zzso And our study offered a novel modified zzso approach to the treatment of tumor cells zzso low on zzso zzso
