Four known compounds have been isolated from the stems of zzso zzso and the structures of these pure constituents were determined using zzso zzso zzso compounds were screened for free radical scavenging ability, metal zzso power zzso and zzso reducing zzso power zzso zzso The zzso effects of zzso zzso compounds were calculated the zzso of zzso of zzso to L-dopa according to an in zzso mushroom zzso zzso The study also examined the zzso of the four compounds on the human melanoma zzso and showed that zzso zzso and zzso zzso significantly inhibited the proliferation of melanoma cells in the cell viability zzso zzso healing results indicated that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso exerted zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso neither zzso zzso nor zzso zzso showed promising zzso potential without inducing significant zzso Furthermore, a dramatically increased level of zzso zzso oxygen species zzso was detected from zzso zzso The cell cycle assessment demonstrated a moderate zzso zzso by zzso zzso The above results revealed the zzso effects of zzso zzso compounds, especially on the zzso ability indicating the promising zzso agents to human skin melanoma zzso
