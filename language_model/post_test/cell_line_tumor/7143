zzso zzso zzso zzso formerly known as zzso is a member of the zzso zzso It associates with zzso L and is involved in the regulation of zzso and in zzso zzso During zzso zzso and zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso to generate smaller zzso zzso proteins containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso form zzso zzso zzso The mechanisms that regulate zzso and stability of zzso zzso are still zzso In the present study, we demonstrate that in human melanoma cells zzso and zzso interact with zzso zzso protein zzso and its zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that the treatment of cells with the zzso inhibitor zzso leads to zzso and enhanced degradation of both zzso and zzso through a zzso zzso We also determined that zzso degradation of zzso slows down the progression of zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso stabilize zzso zzso and suggest that this stabilization is crucial for its zzso zzso
