To investigate the effects and the mechanisms on zzso zzso proliferation of zzso zzso 

zzso cells were zzso to zzso final zzso of which were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, 2, 5, 8, 10, 15 g zzso zzso respectively, zzso method was used to determine the zzso effects of zzso on zzso cells zzso followed by zzso and zzso zzso to observe the cell zzso The expression of zzso zzso and zzso were further investigated by zzso zzso 

zzso below dosage of 1 g zzso zzso showed the little zzso effect on the zzso cells proliferation and exhibited the significant zzso effect from 1 to 8 g zzso zzso in both a zzso zzso zzso Whereas the dosage was above 8 g zzso zzso zzso didn't showed the zzso and zzso zzso The results of zzso analysis indicated that the expression of zzso obviously increased and that of zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso could notably inhibit the zzso cells proliferation probably via zzso the expression of the zzso and zzso the expression of zzso and zzso
