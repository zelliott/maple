Bone zzso proteins zzso are zzso signaling molecules that have gained increasing interest in cancer zzso To obtain a systematic view on zzso signaling in pancreatic cancer we first determined the zzso expression levels of seven zzso zzso zzso and six zzso specific receptors in pancreatic cancer cell lines and normal pancreatic zzso zzso zzso expression was seen in all cancer and normal zzso Low expression levels of zzso and zzso were detected in cancer cells compared to the normal samples, whereas zzso expression was elevated in zzso of the zzso The impact of zzso and zzso signaling on cell zzso was then evaluated in five pancreatic cancer cell zzso Both zzso suppressed the growth of three cell lines (up to zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso mainly due to cell cycle zzso zzso and zzso zzso increased cell migration and invasion zzso a zzso increase in invaded zzso zzso zzso The zzso changes were typically associated with the zzso of the zzso zzso pathway, although such zzso was not observed in the zzso zzso Taken together, zzso and zzso simultaneously inhibit the growth and promote migration and invasion of the same pancreatic cells and thus exhibit a zzso role with both zzso and beneficial functions in pancreatic cancer zzso
