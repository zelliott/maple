Most human pancreatic cancer cells are resistant to tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the mechanisms by which pancreatic cancer cells zzso their zzso molecules to counteract the zzso signaling zzso by the zzso family are largely zzso In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that zzso a zzso decoy zzso that zzso pancreatic cancer cells express at a high level, acts as an zzso zzso zzso by binding to TRAIL and zzso its zzso zzso The reduction of zzso with zzso unmasked TRAIL and greatly enhanced zzso zzso zzso a zzso drug for pancreatic cancer, also reduced the level of zzso The addition of zzso zzso further enhanced zzso zzso zzso our in zzso study demonstrated that the therapeutic effect of zzso could be enhanced via further reduction of zzso suggesting that zzso of zzso in tumor cells could tip the balance of pancreatic cells towards zzso and potentially serve as a new strategy for pancreatic cancer zzso
