Human zzso cell lung zzso zzso express receptors for zzso The zzso analog of zzso zzso zzso consisting of zzso linked to a zzso analog zzso binds to receptors for zzso and is targeted to tumors expressing these zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of targeted zzso zzso analog zzso on a panel of human zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso (at zzso zzso zzso and in zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso into nude mice (at the dose of zzso zzso zzso once a zzso The expression of zzso for zzso zzso zzso was investigated by zzso in cell lines and tumor zzso zzso zzso proteins were also characterized by zzso competition zzso and Western zzso zzso significantly decreased cell proliferation in zzso and tumor growth ( zzso zzso all zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso Based on real-time zzso array data, zzso induced several zzso genes in zzso in both zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso analog zzso zzso should be considered for the further development of a therapy of patients with zzso
