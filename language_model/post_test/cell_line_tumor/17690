The use of zzso chemotherapy often leads to the rise of zzso zzso zzso We have previously reported the zzso of a zzso protein zzso in several zzso tumor cell zzso In this report we describe the cloning of a zzso zzso with an open reading frame of 344 zzso acids that encodes the zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso acid sequence showed it is identical to the human zzso I zzso zzso The identity of the isolated zzso zzso as zzso was confirmed by the specific binding of zzso zzso to a zzso protein following the in zzso expression of zzso full-length zzso Northern zzso analysis of total zzso from zzso and zzso cells revealed an increase in zzso (or zzso zzso in drug-resistant cells relative to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso into zzso zzso cells was carried out without further drug selection and showed zzso to zzso increase in resistance of zzso cells to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of reverse zzso zzso into zzso cells decreased the expression of zzso without affecting the expression of other members of the zzso family and showed a 3- to zzso increase in sensitivity to these zzso Of interest was the correlation between the presence of zzso and zzso in zzso cells when compared to zzso zzso zzso cells show 3- to zzso increase in resistance to zzso zzso and zzso in the absence of zzso levels of zzso zzso the zzso resistance protein zzso or the breast cancer resistance protein zzso Taken together, these results provide the first direct evidence for the role of zzso in zzso of tumor zzso
