Members of Snail family of zzso factors play an important role in oral cancer progression by inducing zzso transition, by promoting invasion and by increasing zzso zzso zzso zzso Although Snail zzso is the best characterized and the most extensively studied member of this family, the role and regulation of zzso zzso in oral cancer progression is less well zzso In this report, we show that transforming growth zzso zzso increases zzso levels in zzso oral zzso and in zzso oral zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso zzso To further examine the role of zzso in zzso zzso we generated zzso cells with zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells did not repress zzso levels or regulate individual movement of zzso zzso Instead, zzso enhanced cohort migration and zzso invasion by zzso zzso zzso increased zzso levels and zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso increases zzso via zzso zzso and thereby contributes to zzso zzso
