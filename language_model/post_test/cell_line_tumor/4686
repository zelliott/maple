zzso associated zzso zzso a zzso zzso was initially identified in cancer zzso by its zzso to a zzso zzso zzso In this study, we have analyzed the expression and zzso profiles of zzso in zzso cancer tissue samples of different stages and zzso zzso by zzso using a second generation high affinity zzso zzso zzso We have also studied the expression of zzso in zzso cancer cell lines by zzso zzso and zzso zzso A correlation between zzso expression and zzso with patients' prognosis was also analyzed using zzso zzso Eighty eight percent of the zzso cancer tissue samples zzso showed zzso with zzso zzso The expression of zzso in advanced stage cancer zzso zzso composite zzso was significantly higher zzso compared to the early stage tumors zzso composite zzso However, no significant correlation of zzso was observed with zzso tumor zzso A marginal correlation of zzso zzso with patients' survival was zzso Interestingly, the membrane zzso of zzso in tumors was significantly zzso associated to the poor clinical outcome, while zzso zzso was correlated significantly to a better prognosis zzso zzso analysis demonstrated the expression of zzso in three zzso cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso In conclusion, the zzso expression of zzso and its association with disease stage indicate its potential as a marker for effective disease management and targeted cancer zzso
