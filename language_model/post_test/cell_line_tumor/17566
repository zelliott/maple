zzso and zzso zzso play a critical role in proliferation and viability of a wide variety of cells, including prostate cancer zzso We examined two prostate cancer cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells was six to eight times more sensitive to the zzso effect of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than were zzso zzso Because zzso cell proliferation is sensitive to stimulation by zzso we assessed the physical and functional interaction between zzso zzso zzso and zzso We observed tight binding of zzso to zzso when zzso cell extracts were subjected to zzso column zzso zzso binding to zzso was zzso and was inhibited by zzso of the cell extracts with zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso zzso we demonstrated zzso of zzso and zzso in the nucleus of zzso zzso Furthermore, the functional relevance of zzso interactions in intact cells was revealed by the observation that zzso was as effective as zzso an zzso in blocking zzso expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso seems to interact with zzso directly because zzso human zzso could bind to zzso and zzso could be detected in zzso prepared from zzso soluble zzso These studies provide direct evidence for physical and functional interaction between zzso and zzso and suggest the potential usefulness of zzso zzso in blocking zzso activity in prostate zzso
