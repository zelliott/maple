Human zzso virus zzso zzso by combining different drug classes such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso has increased zzso life zzso zzso among these patients, an increase in zzso zzso has produced a patient cohort requiring both zzso and cancer zzso We hypothesized that zzso resistance protein zzso binding cassette zzso 4 zzso a widely expressed zzso of zzso zzso medications as well as cancer zzso might interact with zzso Among the zzso evaluated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso only zzso both effectively zzso zzso zzso activity and inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso and human embryonic kidney zzso cells engineered to zzso zzso were then used to assess transport and zzso zzso expression reduced zzso zzso of zzso and consequently zzso survival advantage to zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso export, which is consistent with its ability to increase the sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso In contrast, targeted zzso of zzso in mouse cells specifically enhanced zzso and zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is both an inhibitor and zzso of zzso Because zzso is a new zzso zzso we developed a zzso zzso model, which showed that the zzso binding site is shared with zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso Our studies zzso for the first time, that zzso a potent and zzso zzso is both a zzso and inhibitor of zzso These findings suggest that zzso cancer patients receiving zzso might experience both enhanced zzso efficacy and unexpected adverse toxicity given the role of zzso in exporting zzso zzso medications and cancer zzso
