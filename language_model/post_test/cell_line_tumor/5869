An underlying mechanism for zzso drug resistance zzso is zzso of the zzso zzso cassette (ABC) zzso zzso ABC zzso also determine the general fate and effect of pharmaceutical agents in the zzso The three major types of ABC zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso allows determination of the functional expression levels of ABC zzso in live cells, but most zzso used as indicators zzso zzso zzso zzso have limited zzso as they do not detect all three major types of ABC zzso zzso with broad coverage (such as zzso zzso and zzso lack sensitivity due to overall zzso and thus may yield a significant percentage of false negative zzso We describe two novel fluorescent zzso that are zzso for all three common types of ABC zzso and can serve as indicators of zzso in flow zzso zzso using live zzso The zzso exhibit fast zzso favorable zzso zzso and high sensitivity of zzso zzso as established by zzso resistance activity factor zzso values and zzso statistical zzso Used in combination with general or specific zzso of ABC zzso both zzso readily identify functional zzso and are capable of detecting small levels of zzso as well as defining the type of zzso zzso The zzso can be applied to the screening of putative zzso of ABC zzso zzso zzso zzso specific and relatively simple functional detection of ABC zzso activity, and ready zzso on widely available zzso
