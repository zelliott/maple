zzso zzso are important zzso regulators of various biological zzso Although our knowledge of zzso expression and regulation has been increased considerably in recent years, the regulatory elements for zzso gene expression (especially for zzso zzso are not fully zzso In this study, we identified zzso zzso regions zzso within 1000 zzso upstream from the start site of zzso zzso in human zzso cells using zzso Then we identified a unique sequence pattern, zzso within the zzso using motif zzso Interestingly, treatment of cells with a zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso significantly increased expression of zzso genes with a high frequency of the zzso motif in zzso zzso analysis showed that the frequency of the zzso motif in zzso is highly correlated with zzso zzso gene zzso suggesting that zzso motifs associated with DNA zzso regions play a role as regulatory elements for zzso zzso gene zzso
