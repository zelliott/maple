The zzso of pancreatic zzso is driven by the tumor cells ability to migrate causing invasion and zzso The correlation between the zzso expression of basement membrane proteins and the process of tumor invasion and zzso has not been fully zzso 

In the present study, the influence of zzso zzso and collagen type IV on migratory activity of 5 different cell lines has been investigated at the level of a single tumor cell using zzso zzso zzso 

All investigated cell lines have shown a high baseline migration that varied between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The addition of zzso zzso and collagen type IV to collagen type I zzso has significantly increased tumor cell zzso zzso cell migration was strongly inhibited after treating the tumor cells with zzso zzso zzso An abundant and continuous expression of zzso zzso and collagen type IV was found on the basement membrane of zzso which sharply promoted tumor cell zzso 

The continuous presentation of the basement membrane proteins by zzso contributes to the affinity of pancreatic cancer cells for the zzso tumor zzso zzso of zzso could represent a possible approach to control the basement zzso tumor zzso
