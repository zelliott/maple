The zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to induce cell death in cancer zzso A number of studies in zzso and in zzso have suggested this zzso may serve as an zzso agent, but some cells are zzso Here we wanted to examine the effects of zzso on zzso and zzso cells grown in culture for a prolonged period of exposure and at increasing zzso 

Six cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and three zzso lines zzso zzso and zzso were exposed to zzso zzso zzso for seven days and cell counts were taken every day to determine viability and cell cycle zzso The same cell lines were also exposed to higher doses of zzso up to 10 zzso and viability was zzso 

Five cancer cell lines showed high levels of cell death early in the trial, but three of the lines showed a second delayed increase in cell death at later zzso zzso cells were unaffected by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells also died when treated with zzso At high zzso all cell lines exhibited high rates of zzso No specific cell cycle arrest of the cells was zzso 

We found that there is considerable difference in the way cancer cells are affected by zzso Some have populations that are highly resistant to treatment, while others have stronger rates of death only after prolonged zzso We also found zzso cells are not all resistant to zzso a significant finding that has not previously been observed in other in zzso zzso zzso
