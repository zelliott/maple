In this study, we investigated whether zzso a nutritionally important zzso zzso fatty acid, modulated the sensitivity of brain tumor cells to the zzso drug, zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso and zzso zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso were exposed to zzso or zzso alone or in zzso The effects on cell proliferation and the induction of zzso were determined by using zzso and zzso zzso double zzso zzso and zzso cells were found to be insensitive to the addition of zzso and zzso whereas the two zzso cell lines showed high zzso zzso or zzso alone showed little effect on cell proliferation or death in either the zzso or zzso cell lines, but zzso with zzso enhanced the responsiveness to zzso in the zzso cell zzso To understand the mechanisms of combined zzso and zzso on zzso cells, zzso specific zzso array analyses were performed to dissect possible signaling pathways zzso The addition of zzso and zzso in comparison to zzso added alone, resulted in marked suppression in the expression of several genes involved in DNA damage repair, cell zzso survival, invasion, and zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These results suggest zzso that the effects of zzso and zzso in brain tumor cells are zzso in part by the down regulation of events involved in DNA repair and the zzso signaling pathways and zzso that brain tumors zzso zzso by zzso cells may benefit from therapies combining zzso with zzso
