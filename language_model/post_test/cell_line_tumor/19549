zzso a protein related to the tumor zzso zzso is a zzso factor that plays an important role in zzso differentiation and limb zzso The gene has two distinct promoters that allow the formation of proteins that either contain zzso or lack zzso a zzso zzso In addition, alternative zzso at the 3' end generates proteins with different zzso zzso zzso beta and gamma for a total of six zzso zzso zzso is the main zzso expressed at all stages of development, however the relative contribution of individual zzso zzso during zzso differentiation and zzso is still far from zzso zzso of zzso led to increased growth of transformed cells in zzso and in zzso while treatment of zzso with ultraviolet zzso causes zzso of zzso proteins and their corresponding zzso The zzso gene locus is often amplified in zzso cell zzso while zzso in the relative levels of zzso and zzso correlate with prognosis in several human zzso suggesting that fine regulation of zzso zzso levels must be of pivotal importance in controlling cell zzso death and zzso Despite its relevance little is known on the mechanisms controlling zzso protein zzso Here we show that zzso a zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso zzso Using a set of zzso deletion zzso we have identified a region and two critical zzso zzso of zzso associated to human zzso and Foot zzso zzso syndrome, which are involved in the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso
