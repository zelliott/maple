Recently, zzso zzso of the full length zzso zzso with two hot spots at positions zzso and zzso have been characterized in sporadic cases of zzso Here, we report similar zzso patterns of zzso zzso between the zzso zzso cell line, which expresses only the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso cell line, which exhibits a zzso zzso zzso zzso and expresses both zzso and zzso zzso We demonstrate that this lack of zzso increased zzso in zzso cells is a result of zzso retention and zzso degradation of the zzso zzso As a consequence, in zzso cells, plasma membrane appears strongly enriched for zzso whereas both zzso and zzso were present in zzso zzso We further explored zzso zzso trafficking by investigating the effect of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso and zzso either in zzso cells or in cells expressing only zzso We observe that treatment with zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso and zzso targeting for zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso induced zzso zzso and recycling to the plasma zzso zzso we correlate this differential trafficking of zzso in response to zzso with the recruitment of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso only after zzso zzso This study provides novel insights into the mechanisms regulating zzso trafficking and degradation, showing that various zzso zzso pools are regulated by zzso or zzso pathways according to their zzso zzso
