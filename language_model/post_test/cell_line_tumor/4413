Clinical responses to the zzso drug zzso have been observed in patients with zzso mantle cell zzso zzso although its mechanism of action remains partially zzso We investigated whether the expression and zzso zzso of zzso zzso a major zzso regulator zzso in zzso and the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso could identify zzso cases sensitive to zzso and whether the compound could zzso zzso zzso complexes in zzso zzso 

zzso primary samples and cell lines were analyzed for zzso levels of zzso zzso complexes by Western zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso zzso of zzso in zzso and its effect on zzso zzso complexes were evaluated by real-time zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso In zzso validation was carried out in a mouse zzso model of human zzso 

We found zzso D1 and zzso to be zzso expressed in all the zzso samples zzso zzso analyses and zzso zzso suggested a direct role of zzso D1 in the regulation of zzso zzso The nuclear zzso of both proteins correlated with zzso cell zzso in zzso and sensitivity to zzso activity in zzso and in zzso zzso mechanism of action relied on zzso D1 zzso and disruption of zzso zzso complexes, followed by zzso zzso of zzso cell proliferation arrest, zzso and zzso zzso 

These results highlight a mechanism of action of zzso in zzso cases with increased zzso in zzso which is zzso by the zzso of zzso zzso complexes, and subsequent proliferation blockade and zzso zzso
