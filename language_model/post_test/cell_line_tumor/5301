zzso zzso family 1 member B10 zzso is primarily expressed in the normal human colon and small zzso but zzso in liver and lung zzso Our previous studies have shown that zzso mediates the zzso degradation of zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso is critical to cell zzso In human colon zzso cells zzso and lung zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso In these cells, the total and subspecies of cellular zzso particularly of zzso were decreased by more than zzso zzso with zzso increase in zzso oxygen species, zzso zzso c zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso also increased the levels of zzso zzso leading to the zzso increase of cellular zzso zzso zzso the zzso cells with zzso acid zzso zzso the end product of fatty acid zzso partially rescued the zzso induced by zzso zzso whereas exposing the zzso cells to zzso an zzso zzso led to more than zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso resulting in zzso These data suggest that zzso affects cell survival through modulating zzso zzso zzso function, and zzso status, as well as zzso levels, being an important cell survival zzso
