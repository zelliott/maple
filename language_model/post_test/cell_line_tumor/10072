Syrian zzso is a practical animal model for studying the systemic effects of zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso replicates well in Syrian zzso zzso and Syrian zzso cell lines are available that are known to support zzso zzso In this study, we established four new Syrian zzso cell lines from zzso zzso zzso zzso and lung zzso The pancreatic cell line zzso and the zzso cell line were highly zzso for zzso zzso The zzso cell line formed zzso zzso tumors when cells were injected into the zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso completely reversed the growth of zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso following zzso injection of the zzso leading to zzso survival of the treated zzso zzso cells also formed subcutaneous tumors, whose growth was suppressed by zzso zzso following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in both the zzso and subcutaneous zzso zzso Following zzso injection, zzso zzso did not replicate in the zzso of zzso with zzso zzso tumors, and was not zzso These studies suggest that the zzso cell line may be useful as a model for zzso pancreatic cancer, and that zzso zzso may be a safe and effective zzso to treat these zzso
