zzso zzso has been implicated in the zzso progression of Barrett's esophagus zzso zzso zzso increase proliferation in a zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, it is not clear that these findings in cancer cells are zzso to zzso cells of benign zzso We examined the effect of zzso zzso on three human cell zzso normal zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso Barrett's cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso salt exposure activates zzso and zzso pathways to promote increased growth in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells were exposed to zzso acid zzso at a neutral pH for 5 zzso zzso was measured by Coulter counter cell counts and a zzso zzso incorporation zzso zzso zzso zzso was examined by Western zzso analysis for zzso zzso and zzso zzso was measured by zzso zzso zzso labeling and zzso V zzso after zzso and zzso zzso zzso significance was determined by zzso zzso cells exposed to 5 zzso of zzso did not increase cell zzso In BAR cells, zzso exposure increased cell number by zzso increased zzso zzso and zzso levels by two- to zzso increased zzso incorporation by zzso and decreased zzso zzso by zzso In conclusion, in a zzso Barrett's cell line, zzso exposure zzso proliferation by zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest a potential mechanism zzso zzso zzso may facilitate the zzso progression of zzso
