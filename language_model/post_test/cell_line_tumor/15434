The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is a crucial regulator of cell zzso survival, and resistance to zzso zzso zzso are being explored as a treatment option for patients with zzso zzso cancer who are not candidates for zzso zzso zzso clinical results of zzso zzso have yielded limited zzso activity in zzso cancer, indicating that rational combination strategies are zzso 

In this study, we conducted unbiased gene set enrichment analysis and synthetic zzso screens with zzso which identified the zzso zzso signaling zzso as a potential zzso of resistance to the zzso inhibitor zzso To test this, we used zzso zzso against relevant zzso receptors and zzso resulting in increased responsiveness to zzso in zzso cancer cell zzso Further, we evaluated the rational combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and showed synergistic zzso effects in in zzso and in zzso models of zzso zzso 

zzso this combination not only showed tumor growth zzso but also tumor zzso in the more clinically relevant zzso tumor zzso zzso models of zzso zzso In zzso studies, we observed a trend toward increased markers of zzso in response to the combination of zzso and zzso zzso which may explain the observed synergistic zzso zzso 

These results strengthen the hypothesis that targeting both the zzso and zzso pathways may be a clinically effective rational combination strategy for patients with zzso zzso zzso
