zzso viruses are the cause of yearly zzso and occasional zzso that represent a significant challenge to public zzso Current control strategies are imperfect and there is an zzso need for new zzso zzso Here, we report the identification of small zzso compounds able to effectively and specifically inhibit growth of influenza A and B viruses in cultured cells through targeting an assembly interface of the viral zzso zzso zzso Using an existing crystal structure of the primary zzso interface between the zzso and PA zzso of the influenza A virus zzso we conducted an in zzso screen to identify potential small zzso zzso zzso compounds were then screened for their ability to inhibit the interaction between zzso and PA in zzso using an zzso zzso and in cells, to inhibit nuclear import of a zzso zzso complex as well as zzso by the full viral zzso zzso Two compounds emerged as effective zzso with zzso values in the low zzso range and negligible zzso Of these, one compound also acted as a potent replication inhibitor of a variety of influenza A virus strains in zzso canine kidney zzso cells, including zzso and zzso seasonal and 2009 pandemic zzso zzso this included an zzso zzso Furthermore, potent zzso of influenza B viruses but not other zzso or DNA viruses was zzso Overall, these compounds provide a foundation for the development of a new generation of therapeutic agents exhibiting high specificity to influenza A and B zzso
