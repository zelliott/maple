The zzso zzso zzso zzso is frequently amplified in human tumors, resulting in high cell surface zzso and zzso zzso even in the absence of growth factor stimulation by its zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso We sought to identify mechanisms of signaling zzso that promote zzso zzso by searching for zzso that are zzso zzso with zzso zzso in human zzso Our zzso analysis identified zzso repeat zzso zzso which is amplified and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso in cultured tumor cells compromises zzso zzso and selectively reduces downstream zzso signaling to zzso and zzso Loss of these critical zzso pathways zzso cell cycle arrest and cell death due to loss of zzso production, indicating that zzso and zzso cooperate to promote efficient tumor cell growth and survival in these zzso
