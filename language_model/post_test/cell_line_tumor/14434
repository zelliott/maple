zzso of terminal differentiation represents a potentially less toxic cancer zzso Treatment of zzso human zzso melanoma cells with zzso plus zzso zzso promotes terminal differentiation with an irreversible loss of growth zzso During this process, the zzso factor zzso is zzso potentially zzso zzso of target genes including those involved in zzso progression and cell zzso We investigated the mechanism of zzso zzso and its zzso role in terminal zzso zzso and pharmacological studies revealed that zzso zzso was primarily caused by zzso zzso of zzso and zzso with zzso plus zzso zzso the effect of zzso zzso analysis with a zzso zzso on the zzso promoter, and in zzso and in zzso binding zzso confirm a direct role of zzso on zzso zzso Reduction of zzso and zzso of zzso by zzso plus zzso treatment should cause potent and persistent reduction of zzso expression during terminal zzso zzso of zzso restored expression of cell zzso genes and increased the proportion of cells in the S zzso Our experiments support a model for terminal differentiation in which zzso zzso via zzso of zzso followed by suppression of zzso zzso are zzso events in promoting growth zzso during terminal zzso
