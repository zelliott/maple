Previous in zzso studies suggest that the zzso A zzso zzso could be a potential therapeutic target for zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we assessed for the first time the role of zzso in zzso proliferation and pulmonary zzso in zzso zzso human zzso cells were zzso zzso with zzso zzso or scramble control zzso and injected into the zzso of nude mice to generate an zzso zzso zzso zzso The mice were divided into three groups zzso each zzso zzso the zzso control group, where the mice were injected with zzso zzso zzso zzso the scramble control group, where the mice were injected with cells zzso zzso with the scramble control zzso zzso the zzso group, where the mice were injected with cells zzso zzso with zzso zzso The zzso zzso knocked down more than zzso of zzso zzso expression and significantly inhibited invasion, but not zzso of zzso cells in zzso In the zzso zzso zzso mouse model, no significant difference in the tumor volume was observed over time among the zzso control, the scramble control and the zzso zzso However, a combination of clinical signs, organ examinations and quantitative zzso lung zzso zzso showed that lung zzso in the zzso group was significantly lower than that in the control zzso zzso analyses revealed that the zzso zzso zzso expression was significantly reduced in the zzso group compared with the control zzso The results were confirmed with western zzso analyses using primary tumor zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, we demonstrated in an zzso zzso zzso model that zzso is critical for zzso pulmonary zzso but not for tumor zzso This study provides the first in zzso evidence suggesting an important role for zzso in zzso pulmonary zzso
