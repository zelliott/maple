Gene therapy promises to become an alternative choice for the treatment of zzso zzso In many zzso the delivery of zzso proteins by zzso zzso has been reported to induce zzso This study was performed to evaluate whether the zzso zzso zzso zzso can induce zzso in zzso zzso cells in zzso and in zzso Several zzso zzso were constructed, and the expression of their zzso proteins was zzso The effects of the zzso zzso on zzso zzso cells and the normal zzso cell line were investigated through cell viability and zzso zzso after the cells were treated with zzso zzso zzso or zzso The mechanism involved was also zzso A zzso mouse model was used to evaluate the effects of the zzso on tumor volume and cell zzso in zzso zzso selectively suppressed growth of zzso zzso cells and induced zzso but it had little influence on the normal zzso The mechanism of this response may include the effect of the zzso promoter and the synergistic effect of zzso and zzso zzso also suppressed tumor growth in nude mice and induced zzso zzso may be a useful tool for gene therapy of zzso zzso
