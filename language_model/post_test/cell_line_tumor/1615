zzso therapy leads to zzso that limits tumor zzso However, the benefits of zzso zzso are typically transient and resistance often zzso In this study, we explored the hypothesis that zzso caused by zzso therapy zzso tumor cell zzso as a zzso zzso response, thereby promoting treatment zzso zzso zzso was dependent on signaling through the zzso zzso zzso pathway, and treatment of hypoxic cells with zzso zzso caused a shift from zzso to zzso cell death in zzso In zzso clinically resistant to the zzso zzso zzso increased regions of zzso and higher levels of zzso zzso were found when compared with zzso specimens from the same zzso When treated with zzso alone, human zzso zzso showed increased zzso expression and zzso growth, which could be prevented by addition of the zzso inhibitor zzso In zzso targeting of the essential zzso gene zzso also disrupted tumor growth when combined with zzso zzso Together, our findings zzso a novel mechanism of resistance to zzso therapy in which zzso zzso promotes tumor cell zzso One strong implication of our findings is that zzso zzso may help prevent resistance to zzso therapy used in the zzso
