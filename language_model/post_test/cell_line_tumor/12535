The objective of this study was to develop a novel folate zzso drug delivery system for zzso cells using zzso zzso as a model zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were prepared with various zzso zzso zzso and zzso The effects of zzso on zzso efficiency, particle size, and zzso were zzso The effects of zzso gel structure on the release of zzso from the zzso were also zzso zzso and quantitative zzso studies of zzso and zzso were carried out in zzso cell zzso zzso studies of zzso were performed on zzso zzso 

Based on size, zzso and zzso efficiency, zzso was found to be the most suitable zzso for the preparation of zzso zzso of zzso in zzso gel sustained drug release for a period of 2 zzso zzso of zzso was zzso times higher with zzso than zzso in zzso cells zzso folate zzso This was further confirmed from the quantitative zzso zzso zzso exhibited higher zzso in zzso cells when compared with pure zzso 

These zzso zzso systems suspended in zzso gels may provide sustained and targeted delivery of zzso agents to zzso cells following zzso zzso
