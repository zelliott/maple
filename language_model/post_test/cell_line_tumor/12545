The zzso inhibitor zzso represents an important advance in the treatment of multiple myeloma zzso zzso zzso the activity of the zzso zzso and zzso cell death in a variety of tumor zzso however, the mechanism of zzso is not well zzso 

We investigated the differential zzso upon zzso zzso by using stable isotope labeling by zzso acids in cell culture zzso in combination with zzso enrichment and zzso zzso In total 233 zzso were identified and 72 zzso showed a zzso or greater change upon zzso zzso The zzso with expression zzso zzso all major protein classes, including a large number of zzso acid binding zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso on zzso increased upon zzso treatment, suggesting new mechanisms associated to zzso zzso in zzso zzso Further studies demonstrated that zzso zzso profile was modified in response to zzso treatment and the regulation of zzso by zzso at specific zzso zzso participated in the cellular response induced by zzso 

Our systematic profiling of zzso changes in response to zzso treatment not only advanced the global zzso understanding of the action of zzso on myeloma cells but also identified previously zzso signaling proteins in myeloma zzso
