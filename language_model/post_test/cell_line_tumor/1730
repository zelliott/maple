zzso are a class of zzso that contain various zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso groups are known to increase cell zzso and stability, but small structural changes can result in large differences in biological zzso In this study, the zzso activities of several zzso zzso were tested using a zzso survival zzso The relationship between structural properties of zzso zzso and their zzso activities on zzso colon cancer cell lines were studied zzso using comparative molecular field analysis and comparative molecular similarity zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to identify structural changes in zzso that increase the zzso effect on zzso colon cancer cell zzso
