We are reporting a new set of zzso zzso zzso zzso lipids based on a zzso backbone on which zzso zzso tails are attached via an zzso zzso Due to their zzso zzso interface and packing zzso the new lipids are able to strongly zzso either alone or when zzso with zzso zzso or zzso The zzso zzso generated with the novel zzso zzso were characterized in bulk and in solution via a combination of techniques including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso potential, and zzso mobility zzso These zzso zzso can efficiently zzso and deliver DNA to a large variety of cell lines, as proven by our zzso correlation zzso Using the zzso reporter gene zzso we have also conducted a comprehensive zzso relationship study, which identified the best structural parameters and zzso for efficient and nontoxic gene zzso Several zzso greatly surpassed established zzso systems with proved in zzso and in zzso efficiency, being able to zzso a large variety of zzso cells even in the presence of elevated levels of zzso The most efficient zzso was able to zzso selectively primary rat zzso zzso harvested from nucleus zzso and zzso from the frontal cortex, a premise that recommends these synthetic zzso for future in zzso delivery studies for zzso zzso
