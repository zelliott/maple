To zzso the zzso drug design by the combined method of zzso analysis and secondary structure prediction and to get ideal zzso 

The zzso analysis and the secondary structure simulation were performed by zzso zzso zzso were designed against the zzso blocks with low local reaction free energy of protein zzso C zzso zzso The in zzso effects of zzso were evaluated by human zzso lung zzso cells and mouse zzso melanoma cells, the expression of target zzso was detected by in zzso zzso and zzso The in zzso effects of zzso were also evaluated by models of zzso zzso in nude mice and zzso melanoma in zzso 

Three zzso had significantly lower zzso values than that of zzso the positive control, on zzso cells in zzso Five zzso inhibited the growth of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso while zzso of zzso was zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso showed that the best candidate zzso inhibited the expression of zzso at zzso level in a zzso zzso zzso inhibited the growth of zzso and zzso tumors in zzso at zzso zzso The zzso rate of zzso on zzso tumors was greater than that of zzso at the same zzso zzso did not affect the growth of zzso zzso 

zzso may be of value as an zzso agent or zzso and the combined method of zzso analysis and secondary structure prediction is a potential helpful tool for zzso drug zzso
