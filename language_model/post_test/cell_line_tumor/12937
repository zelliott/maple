Members of the zzso small heat shock protein zzso family, such as zzso and zzso are zzso expressed in diverse zzso and have been linked to several hallmark features of cancer including zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso which shares an zzso promoter with zzso was discovered as a zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso and has not been previously implicated in zzso zzso Here we describe a new function for zzso as a novel inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Specifically, we demonstrate that zzso is expressed in a subset of human breast cancer cell lines and that zzso expression of zzso in breast cancer cells zzso resistance to zzso induced by both TRAIL and zzso We also show that zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso by suppressing zzso zzso and 10 zzso thereby blocking downstream zzso events, such as Bid zzso and zzso zzso zzso with these in zzso effects, zzso zzso the zzso activity of TRAIL in an zzso zzso model of breast zzso zzso our results reveal a novel function of zzso as an zzso protein that zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
