zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso bind with exquisite specificity to zzso but not to zzso duplex, or zzso zzso Studies have suggested that the zzso and possibly zzso activities of these compounds are linked to their zzso effect on zzso and/or zzso zzso In the current studies, we show that zzso a synthetic analog of zzso exhibits zzso activity against both zzso and zzso cells and zzso robust zzso within 16 h of treatment, suggesting a mode of action independent of zzso zzso was also shown to inhibit cell cycle progression causing zzso cell cycle arrest, as evidenced by zzso of cells with 4 zzso DNA content, increased zzso index, separated zzso elevated zzso zzso zzso at zzso (an zzso zzso and defective zzso alignment and zzso fiber assembly zzso by zzso zzso The zzso arrest caused by zzso paralleled with reduction in the expression level of the major zzso checkpoint regulator Aurora zzso All these cellular effects appear to depend on the zzso binding activity of zzso as its zzso binding zzso zzso is completely devoid of all these zzso In the aggregate, our results suggest that zzso which exhibits zzso and zzso activities, is also a novel zzso blocker, with a mode of action dependent on its zzso binding zzso
