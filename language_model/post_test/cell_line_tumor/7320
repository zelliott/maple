The zzso zzso A1 zzso has been shown to mediate zzso actions, possibly via zzso of the zzso factor nuclear zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that an zzso A1 zzso zzso zzso activated zzso zzso through zzso G proteins in human zzso zzso zzso To delineate the mechanism of action, different zzso G proteins were expressed in human embryonic kidney zzso zzso Only zzso supported the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso also modulated zzso as indicated by the zzso actions of zzso and the zzso of zzso response by zzso The participation of zzso zzso protein zzso C, and zzso zzso II in zzso zzso zzso were demonstrated by employing specific zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and numerous zzso along the zzso zzso zzso zzso cascade including zzso zzso zzso and zzso abolished the zzso zzso zzso Although zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were also activated by zzso they were not required for the zzso zzso Similar results were obtained using zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso zzso of zzso by zzso required a complex signaling network composed of multiple zzso
