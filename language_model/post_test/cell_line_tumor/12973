Cancer cells depend heavily on zzso as both energy and zzso sources and are found to zzso zzso transport and switch their main energy supply zzso from zzso zzso to zzso These molecular and zzso changes also provide targets for cancer zzso Here we report that novel small molecules inhibited zzso zzso transport and cell zzso and induced zzso in lung and breast cancer cells without affecting much their normal cell zzso Cancer cells survived the compound treatment lost their capability to zzso zzso study indicates that the cancer cell zzso by the test compounds has a component of zzso and the induced zzso was zzso and zzso zzso similar to those resulted from zzso zzso zzso treatment also led to cell cycle arrest in zzso zzso The zzso of cancer cell growth was partially relieved when additional zzso was supplied to cells, suggesting that the zzso was due to, at least in part, the zzso of zzso zzso zzso When used in zzso the test compounds demonstrated synergistic effects with zzso drugs zzso or zzso in zzso of cancer cell zzso All these results suggest that these zzso transport zzso mimic zzso deprivation and work through zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso have the potential to complement and replace traditional zzso zzso which cannot be used in animals, as new tools to study the effects of zzso transport and metabolism on cancer and normal zzso
