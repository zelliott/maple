zzso zzso zzso the second member of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso family, encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that signaling networks activated by zzso and zzso factor zzso are associated with cell response to zzso radiation zzso The present study shows that zzso of zzso enhanced zzso zzso induced by zzso in human breast zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso genes zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso or treatment with zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso regulation, zzso and zzso zzso a zzso downstream of zzso was activated in zzso cells and inhibited by zzso To identify specific genes affected by zzso zzso zzso a group of zzso elements zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso BAD and zzso were zzso zzso levels of zzso elements zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso BAD and zzso were zzso in zzso cells with striking enhancements in zzso and zzso zzso further induced zzso B1 and zzso D1 expression that was reduced by zzso zzso kept a high steady level after zzso treatment and, in contrast to control zzso cells, zzso was inhibited in zzso cells by zzso zzso However, all four zzso proteins were zzso by zzso of zzso in zzso zzso These results thus provide evidence suggesting that zzso of zzso is able to enhance zzso response to zzso and that a specific zzso network downstream of zzso is triggered by treatments using zzso zzso combined with zzso
