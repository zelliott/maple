zzso dots zzso are fluorescent semiconductor zzso that are emerging as superior alternatives to the conventional organic zzso used in biological zzso Although zzso offer several advantages over conventional fluorescent zzso including greater zzso and a wider range of zzso and zzso zzso zzso their toxicity has been an issue in its wider use as an zzso diagnostic and therapeutic zzso We prepared a zzso zzso with an zzso zzso and demonstrated that the zzso zzso is efficiently zzso into cells and is visible even after multiple zzso We demonstrate that the zzso zzso is nontoxic to cells and provides a sensitive tool for long-term molecular zzso
