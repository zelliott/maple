zzso tumor cells zzso are important zzso of cancer progression and zzso zzso The rarity of zzso in peripheral blood has driven the development of technologies to isolate these tumor cells with high zzso however, there are limited techniques available for zzso target zzso following zzso A strategy is described to capture and isolate viable tumor cells from whole blood using an array of zzso zzso termed zzso zzso capture of zzso cells or cells expressing zzso cell zzso molecules zzso was achieved by zzso zzso surfaces with either zzso zzso or zzso zzso Surface zzso of zzso zzso followed by zzso binding of protein zzso enabled efficient capture of zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso cells, a human breast zzso were retained on the array surface with zzso efficiency when using an zzso zzso To demonstrate the efficiency of tumor cell retention on zzso zzso in the presence of blood, zzso cells were mixed into whole blood and added to small zzso (71 zzso coated with zzso zzso or zzso These approaches achieved zzso cell capture from zzso zzso of whole blood with efficiencies greater than zzso Furthermore, zzso cells zzso with 1 zzso blood and loaded onto large zzso zzso zzso were captured with high efficiencies zzso could be isolated from the array by a zzso approach and were demonstrated to yield a high rate of colony formation zzso after removal from the zzso Clinical utility of this technology was shown through the capture, isolation and successful culture of zzso from the blood of mice zzso with primary human pancreatic zzso zzso capture and isolation of living tumor cells from blood followed by analysis or culture will be a valuable tool for cancer cell zzso
