This study evaluates targeted zzso loaded with the zzso generator zzso to selectively kill zzso membrane zzso zzso cells with the aim to assess their potential for targeted zzso zzso 

In this study, zzso zzso were loaded with zzso and labeled with the mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso or with the A10 zzso zzso The targeting zzso extent of zzso and killing efficacy of zzso were evaluated on zzso of prostate cancer cells zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso and rat zzso zzso and on zzso of zzso induced to express zzso zzso zzso 

The loading efficiency of zzso into zzso zzso ranged from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso of introduced zzso The zzso reactions resulted in approximately 17 zzso 2 zzso zzso and 9 zzso 2 A10 zzso per zzso The average size of zzso 107 zzso 2 zzso in diameter, was not affected by zzso or zzso zzso cells exhibit zzso relative zzso zzso compared with zzso and induced zzso respectively, based on flow zzso detecting association of the zzso zzso zzso zzso display higher levels of total specific binding to all cell lines than A10 zzso zzso zzso cell association of targeted zzso increases with incubation zzso zzso studies demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso are most zzso with median lethal dose values, after 24 h of zzso equal to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and induced zzso respectively, which are comparable to the values for the zzso zzso zzso For A10 zzso zzso the corresponding values are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our studies demonstrate that zzso zzso loaded with zzso selectively zzso become zzso and kill zzso cells including zzso cells induced to express zzso These zzso with the unique ability of zzso to be easily zzso in terms of size and surface zzso for zzso zzso the potential of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for selective zzso zzso zzso
