zzso transport of zzso zzso by zzso human zzso has been demonstrated previously in zzso zzso In the preceding communication, we demonstrated that the zzso activity of zzso was zzso higher in zzso as compared with zzso and it correlated with their inherent zzso zzso Present studies were performed to determine whether greater zzso activity of zzso in zzso translated into greater zzso zzso zzso zzso and to determine the overall contribution of zzso toward total zzso zzso zzso with the greater zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso transport in artificial zzso zzso with zzso zzso from zzso was zzso greater than in zzso zzso zzso completely zzso zzso transport in these zzso zzso whereas zzso or zzso zzso had no effect on zzso zzso transport studies in crude membrane zzso from zzso and zzso also showed a zzso higher rate of transport in zzso as compared with zzso zzso zzso which recognized only zzso in crude extracts of both zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso cell zzso of total zzso transport in crude membrane zzso from both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso transport by zzso and zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The mixture of the three zzso inhibited zzso transport by zzso zzso These studies demonstrate that zzso transport activity of zzso is significantly greater in zzso as compared with zzso and that zzso is the major zzso zzso in lung cancer cell zzso
