Regulatory T cells zzso play an important role in maintaining zzso tolerance that is one of the main obstacles to overcome for improving zzso zzso Recently, the zzso has been shown to zzso express zzso zzso which is a member of the zzso family that is zzso expressed on zzso T cells after zzso zzso and through which the signal enhances zzso zzso proliferation and memory zzso zzso However, little is known about the role of zzso zzso to zzso in tumor zzso Here we show that zzso signaling zzso the function of naturally occurring zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso expression on zzso was reduced by zzso zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso suppressed the proliferation of zzso zzso zzso T cells after zzso zzso in contrast, zzso zzso zzso that reduced zzso expression reversed the zzso zzso In addition, zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso zzso zzso T cells and zzso zzso T cells after zzso zzso however, zzso with zzso zzso lost their zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso minimally suppressed the proliferation or the zzso zzso of zzso zzso T cells after zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso function to the zzso effect was reversed by zzso zzso in zzso Our data indicate that, in addition to controlling zzso zzso function, zzso zzso directly controls zzso suppression in tumor zzso
