Green tea zzso exhibit multiple zzso activities in various in zzso and in zzso tumor models, and the mechanisms of action are not zzso Previously, we found that green tea extract zzso regulates zzso zzso in different cell culture zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in cancer cell zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso Using zzso approaches, we found zzso expression of zzso a zzso zzso binding zzso in these cell zzso In this study, we aimed to further define the functional role of zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso in lung zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso stimulates the expression of zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso zzso expression appears to be at the zzso level, and the increased zzso expression mediates zzso zzso resulting in enhanced cell zzso and decreased zzso zzso specific interference resulted in loss of zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso but not zzso In fact, zzso specific interference itself inhibited zzso even without zzso Together, zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso zzso and it may serve as a potential molecular target associated with the zzso activities of green zzso
