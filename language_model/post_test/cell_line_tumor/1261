zzso acid zzso a zzso zzso is a selective zzso agent that works directly in zzso Recent study has revealed that zzso zzso in zzso zzso activity of zzso N zzso zzso zzso which is known to play an important role in zzso but the zzso activity of zzso has not been reported zzso Data presented here show that zzso zzso inhibited basic zzso growth factor zzso invasion and tube formation of bovine zzso zzso cells zzso at a concentration which had no effect on the cell zzso To access whether the zzso nature of zzso originates from its zzso action against zzso N zzso activity, the effect of zzso on zzso was zzso Surprisingly, zzso did not inhibit in zzso zzso activity in zzso cells or zzso tumor zzso On the other hand, zzso significantly decreased the zzso reducing potential, and treatment with zzso zzso transition zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso These results imply that zzso activity of zzso occurs through a zzso of zzso function rather than zzso activity in zzso zzso
