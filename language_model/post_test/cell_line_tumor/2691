zzso zzso breast cancer zzso is a clinically and biologically distinct zzso entity defined by a characteristic linear zzso invasion pattern and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso for zzso zzso also lack zzso expression and show zzso zzso zzso of the zzso binding protein zzso The lack of a zzso zzso cell line has hampered the functional characterization of zzso cells in zzso We report the establishment of a permanent zzso cell line, named zzso which was derived from a patient with zzso zzso The DNA fingerprint of zzso verified genetic identity with the patient and had no match among the human cell line collections of several international biological resource zzso zzso expressed various zzso cell markers but lacked expression of zzso due to a previously zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the same zzso zzso zzso in archival zzso tissue of the corresponding primary zzso proved the zzso origin of zzso from this particular zzso zzso also lacked zzso expression and showed zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso analysis of zzso revealed a profile of zzso imbalances that included many distinct zzso previously observed in primary zzso zzso zzso of zzso showed a zzso zzso complement and numerous zzso structural zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso zzso in soft zzso and zzso in zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso cells zzso the linear zzso invasion pattern that defines zzso In zzso zzso significantly extends the biological spectrum of the established breast cancer cell lines and will facilitate functional analyses of genuine human zzso cells in zzso and in zzso
