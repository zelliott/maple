zzso V zzso are highly zzso proteins found in all zzso of zzso While the zzso zzso are DNA repair proteins for removal of zzso zzso zzso from the zzso no clear role for the zzso counterparts has zzso been zzso Here we report that human zzso V zzso and also zzso coli zzso V are highly active zzso specific for zzso in zzso zzso are normal zzso in certain zzso introduced by specific zzso zzso editing is essential for proper function of these transcripts and defects are linked to various human zzso Here we show that human zzso zzso an zzso zzso containing zzso in a position corresponding to a biologically important site for zzso in the zzso transcript of the zzso zzso Further, human zzso specifically zzso transfer zzso with zzso in the zzso zzso This previously unknown zzso incision activity may suggest a role for zzso V in normal zzso zzso
