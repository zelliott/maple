The zzso hormones zzso and zzso and their zzso zzso zzso C zzso are expressed in pancreatic duct zzso In colon cancer, zzso peptides are shown to exert strong zzso activity through the zzso zzso The objective of this study was to analyze the role of zzso and zzso in human pancreatic zzso 

zzso real-time zzso chain reaction zzso was used to show the expression of zzso zzso and zzso in specimens of human pancreatic cancer, chronic zzso donor and in pancreatic tumor cell zzso The presence of zzso and zzso in tumor cell lines and in pancreatic cancer zzso was shown by zzso and zzso The effect of zzso and zzso on cell cycle and cell death of pancreatic cancer cells was investigated by zzso activated cell zzso zzso analysis using zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the growth zzso effect of zzso on pancreatic cancer cells was assessed using the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso were expressed at zzso and protein levels in pancreatic cancer and cancer cell zzso As shown by zzso zzso expression was significantly zzso in pancreatic cancer compared with that in healthy pancreatic zzso ( zzso and chronic zzso ( zzso zzso and zzso were not zzso in pancreatic zzso The zzso zzso revealed significant zzso of pancreatic cancer cell proliferation by zzso in a zzso fashion, whereas zzso and zzso cell lines were significantly inhibited already at the lowest zzso concentration (2 zzso zzso 

Our data suggest therapeutic properties of zzso in pancreatic cancer via zzso zzso In addition, determination of zzso expression might be a useful marker for differentiation between pancreatic cancer and chronic zzso
