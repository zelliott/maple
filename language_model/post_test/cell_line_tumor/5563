zzso is a clinically important zzso agent used to treat zzso zzso High zzso zzso zzso of zzso have been used in numerous studies to induce zzso of zzso cells grown in zzso culture over zzso zzso These conditions may not be relevant to 3-D tumor tissue in zzso and the importance of zzso for tumor response is zzso We here studied the effects of zzso on a 3-D colon zzso in zzso model zzso zzso zzso at a dose of 40 zzso induced active zzso zzso in the peripheral 30 zzso cell layer of zzso mainly during late stages zzso zzso The zzso response to zzso was also largely confined to peripheral cell zzso Despite the use of a high zzso zzso a significant fraction of the cells in the zzso survived zzso A high proportion of surviving cells stained positive for zzso a marker of premature zzso zzso zzso by zzso treatment showed a higher spontaneous cell death rate than zzso zzso zzso We propose that acute zzso is of minor significance for the overall response of zzso cells to zzso zzso
