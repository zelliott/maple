Cellular interaction with the zzso milieu plays a significant role in normal biological and zzso zzso zzso degradation of basement membrane zzso by zzso zzso is a hallmark of tumor invasion and zzso and zzso zzso zzso D is implicated as a major contributor to this zzso zzso a zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso development and zzso zzso of zzso is decreased in primary tumors and lost in zzso zzso zzso is mostly zzso and is partially zzso however, the fate and function of zzso zzso has remained mostly zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso is incorporated into the zzso deposited by normal zzso zzso cells and thus could play a critical role in zzso zzso zzso degradation and zzso of zzso zzso In the absence of zzso as is the case with most cancer cells, zzso degradation proceeds zzso thus zzso the progression to zzso To test this, we employed an in zzso model where gels containing both types I and IV collagen were zzso with normal zzso zzso cells to allow the incorporation of zzso zzso This zzso zzso was used to examine zzso zzso collagen degradation by human breast cancer cell zzso Our results indicate that zzso of zzso and its deposition into the zzso milieu play an important role in zzso zzso In this capacity, zzso could potentially regulate zzso tissue zzso occurring under normal and zzso zzso In addition, these findings could have a potential effect on future therapeutic intervention strategies for breast zzso
