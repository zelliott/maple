zzso zzso reaction monitoring zzso is a highly specific and sensitive mass zzso zzso technique that is widely being applied to selectively qualify and validate candidate markers within complex biological zzso However, in order for zzso methods to take on these zzso zzso zzso of sample processing is required, in order to reduce zzso complexity, prior to zzso In this study, we have developed a targeted platform consisting of protein zzso enrichment on magnetic beads and zzso for measuring zzso zzso 12 zzso protein in a zzso cell zzso zzso cell line zzso a candidate zzso for zzso whose expression at the protein level has not been previously zzso Sample processing and zzso zzso were zzso for signature peptides selected as surrogate markers of zzso zzso Using zzso coupled with stable isotope zzso we achieved limits of zzso in the low zzso range sufficient for measuring clinically relevant zzso with good zzso and zzso accuracy and precision zzso Our results show that using a quantitative zzso capture approach provides specific, accurate, and robust zzso amenable to zzso zzso of potential zzso
