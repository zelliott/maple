zzso expression and activity of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso is associated with development and progression of head and neck cancer zzso and a poor zzso Clinical trials with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been disappointing in zzso To investigate the mechanisms zzso resistance to these agents, we developed an zzso cell line zzso with acquired zzso zzso In contrast to parental zzso zzso cells, zzso cells exhibited an zzso zzso zzso with increased migratory potential, reduced zzso and zzso zzso zzso and elevated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso profiling identified zzso zzso in zzso zzso Growth and migration of zzso cells were blocked with a specific zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso analysis of zzso cells confirmed the zzso zzso associated with acquired zzso resistance, and identified zzso of gene expression associated with cell migration and inflammation zzso Moreover, increased expression and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells suggested a role for inflammatory zzso signaling in zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the tumor zzso zzso was reduced in zzso cells and increasing its expression zzso zzso expression and reversed zzso zzso Finally, analysis of zzso zzso patients revealed that high tumor zzso zzso expression was associated with poorer survival zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In zzso our results identify zzso as a key zzso of acquired zzso resistance in zzso and suggest that therapeutic zzso of zzso by small zzso drugs or specific zzso might overcome zzso therapy zzso
