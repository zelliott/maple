To uncover mechanisms underlying progression of zzso zzso and to identify genes associated with liver zzso we analyzed expression profiles of 14 primary zzso zzso zzso with liver zzso and compared them with profiles of 11 zzso zzso and those of 9 zzso of the zzso A zzso cluster analysis using data from a zzso zzso containing zzso genes indicated that the zzso with zzso had different expression profiles from those without zzso although a number of genes were commonly zzso in primary zzso of both zzso We documented 54 genes that were frequently zzso and 375 that were frequently zzso in primary tumors with zzso to liver, but not in tumors without zzso zzso quantitative zzso experiments confirmed that zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso number zzso were expressed at significantly higher levels in tumors with zzso These data should contribute to a better understanding of the progression of zzso tumors, and facilitate prediction of their zzso zzso
