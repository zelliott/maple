To manufacture a zzso zzso cells expressing the desired protein are often grown in zzso zzso Feeding an zzso zzso hydrolysate helps the cells receive sufficient nutrition, but makes systems difficult to zzso Even different lots of the same hydrolysate may have significant zzso zzso individual components may actually be zzso to the zzso Switching to fully defined feeds could eliminate these zzso For zzso zzso zzso production by zzso zzso cells, this article describes the replacement of a zzso feed with a fully zzso zzso feed zzso The defined feed initially had 67 zzso but additional experiments allowed a reduction to 25 zzso The zzso zzso is approximately zzso higher than in the undefined system, and the feed volume is circa zzso zzso The two systems generated zzso with similar zzso zzso Other benefits of the defined feed system include lower raw material costs, the ability to zzso key zzso zzso greater confidence in raw material quality, and the elimination of potential, zzso zzso zzso
