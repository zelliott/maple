The breast cancer resistance protein zzso an zzso binding cassette (ABC) zzso zzso plays a role in multiple drug resistance zzso Previous studies of the zzso location of the ABC zzso zzso indicated that this protein is expressed in nuclear zzso This study examines the nuclear distribution of zzso in seven zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso expression was observed in the nuclear extracts of zzso cell zzso Using the zzso zzso cell line as a model, nuclear zzso protein was detected by zzso and zzso laser zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso was found in a zzso of zzso cells in a human brain zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso cell line was determined with and without the zzso inhibitor zzso C zzso and after zzso of zzso with small interfering zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso increased zzso zzso with a zzso reduction in the zzso and this effect was further zzso in the zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso is expressed in the nuclear extracts of select zzso and zzso cell lines and in a human zzso zzso zzso Its presence in the nucleus of cancer cells suggests new role for zzso in zzso
