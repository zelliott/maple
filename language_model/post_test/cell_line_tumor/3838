Contemporary cancer therapy refers to treatment based on genetic abnormalities found in patient's zzso However, this approach is faced with numerous challenges, including tumor zzso and molecular evolution, insufficient tumor samples available along with genetic information linking to clinical zzso lack of therapeutic drugs containing zzso information, and technical limitations of rapid drug efficacy tests with insufficient quantities of primary cancer cells from zzso To address these problems and improve clinical outcomes of current personalized zzso cancer therapy, we have developed a zzso chip platform, which is zzso suited for zzso primary cancer cells in zzso spots of zzso on the zzso generating efficacy data with various drugs, eventually allowing for a comparison of the in zzso data obtained from the chip with clinical data as well as gene expression zzso As a proof of concept in this study, we have zzso a zzso brain cancer cell line and three primary brain cancer cells from patients zzso zzso and zzso in 30 zzso droplets of zzso and then tested the therapeutic efficacy of 24 zzso drugs by measuring their dose zzso As a result, the zzso values of 24 zzso drugs obtained from the brain cancer cells clearly showed patient zzso zzso some of which were zzso with their zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as the in zzso previous results of the mouse zzso model with the three primary brain cancer zzso
