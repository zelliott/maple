zzso modification of zzso is a common means of regulating zzso structure and thus diverse nuclear zzso Using a zzso interaction liquid zzso separation method in combination with mass zzso analysis, the present study investigated the zzso in zzso zzso zzso status and the interplay between zzso zzso and zzso during in zzso differentiation of mouse zzso cells and how these modifications affect the zzso zzso zzso of the type of zzso used zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso we observed a strong increase in zzso and zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso An increase in zzso zzso however, to a clearly lesser extent, was also found when cells accumulated in the stationary zzso Since we show that zzso zzso is localized to zzso the increase in zzso zzso observed indicates an zzso of zzso and zzso silent regions during differentiation and during the zzso of control cells in the stationary phase, zzso When using the zzso zzso zzso or zzso A, we found that zzso zzso prevents zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso and that the zzso zzso zzso is therefore the most suitable zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso The results provide a model for how zzso active zzso might be converted to the zzso zzso silent zzso
