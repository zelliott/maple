In our previous study, zzso zzso showed zzso activity both native and zzso condition in mouse zzso The purpose of this study is to explore the presence of zzso zzso in zzso and to zzso the mechanism of its activity in zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained from zzso molecular weight cut off membrane zzso (10 zzso was found to have selective zzso activity zzso zzso on several tumor cell lines in zzso without having any zzso effect on normal cell lines with dose of 100 zzso Analysis of the growth zzso mechanism in zzso cells revealed nuclear fragmentation and zzso with appearance of the zzso zzso peak indicative of zzso Furthermore, the zzso fraction induced the zzso signal via generation of zzso oxygen species and decrease in the zzso ratio thereby inducing zzso zzso transition with zzso zzso of zzso finally leads to DNA zzso and the hallmark of zzso zzso analysis reflected the molecular masses of peptides in 10 zzso were in the range of 500 Da to zzso zzso The significant zzso activity of 10 zzso deserves further laboratory and in zzso zzso
