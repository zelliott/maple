In order to study the potential effects of zzso zzso gene zzso on zzso in leukemia cell line zzso and its possible molecular mechanisms, the zzso expression zzso zzso zzso containing full-length human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the vacant zzso were introduced into the leukemia cell line zzso respectively by zzso The zzso zzso and protein in cells were detected by zzso and Western zzso zzso of zzso V were tested by flow zzso and zzso gel zzso to verify whether zzso zzso could induce zzso of zzso zzso Expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were determined by zzso zzso after introducing zzso zzso into the zzso zzso The results showed that in exposure to zzso at zzso zzso for 48 hours, the zzso cells exhibited the zzso hallmarks of zzso the marked DNA zzso shown by gel zzso and the enhanced zzso rate marked by zzso zzso zzso showed an increase in zzso and zzso genes zzso a decrease in zzso and a relative constant expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso It is concluded that the introduction and expression of zzso zzso gene can lead to zzso of zzso cells by zzso the zzso gene expression and zzso the zzso and zzso genes zzso
