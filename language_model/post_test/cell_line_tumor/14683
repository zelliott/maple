zzso zzso have highly potent and effective zzso for the wild type of zzso reverse zzso To design new drug of zzso zzso reverse zzso the mechanism of drug resistance for four types of zzso was zzso zzso dynamics simulations suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are key zzso Different zzso of key zzso may have different interaction modes and lead to different drug zzso Then, zzso and zzso methods were employed to construct zzso quantitative zzso relationship zzso These models were evaluated by test set zzso These models can be used to make quantitative prediction of their zzso for lead compounds before resorting to in zzso and in zzso zzso
