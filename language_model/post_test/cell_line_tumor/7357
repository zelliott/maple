zzso membrane protein 1 zzso one of the zzso zzso by zzso virus is sufficient for the development of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso cellular zzso in zzso It has also been shown to increase the zzso activity in primary human zzso zzso cells by an unknown zzso We reported here that zzso could increase zzso activity in coordination with zzso zzso expression in zzso primary human zzso zzso cells or in a zzso zzso integrated zzso zzso cell line with zzso regulatory system, named zzso zzso by zzso analysis and reporter gene zzso zzso of zzso expression decreased zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso elements in the minimal core of zzso promoter could inhibit the zzso expression induced by zzso Moreover, blocking of zzso zzso could further decrease zzso zzso zzso It has been suggested that zzso can be used to aid zzso control zzso In addition, we also found that zzso of zzso including zzso and zzso zzso participated in zzso zzso Together, these findings suggested that zzso activated zzso via zzso
