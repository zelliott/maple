zzso patterns of gene expression result in zzso instability, altered patterns of gene expression and zzso zzso Specifically, zzso DNA zzso in gene promoter regions leads to gene zzso whereas global zzso events can result in zzso instability and zzso zzso Potential links exist between environmental agents and DNA zzso but the zzso effects of environmental zzso on the DNA zzso machinery are not understood within the context of breast cancer zzso 

We assessed zzso changes in zzso patterns using a unique zzso profiling technique called amplification of zzso sites zzso This method generates easily zzso fingerprints that represent the investigated cell zzso zzso profile, based on the differential zzso of DNA with zzso zzso restriction zzso 

We validated this approach by demonstrating both unique and zzso sites of zzso zzso in four breast zzso cell lines treated with the zzso analogue zzso zzso of treated with control samples revealed individual bands that exhibited zzso changes, and these bands were zzso and zzso and the precise zzso location individually zzso In most cases, these regions of zzso coincided with susceptible target regions previously associated with zzso zzso zzso and gene zzso Similarly, we observed that acute zzso exposure is associated with altered zzso patterns in these cell zzso 

These results reinforce the link between environmental zzso DNA zzso and breast cancer, and support a role for zzso as a zzso affordable screening method to identify environmentally induced DNA zzso changes that occur in zzso
