zzso zzso zzso is an aggressive zzso and resistant to all sorts of treatment due to its rapid growth and invasive zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso is a nuclear zzso modulating variety of biological properties, such as regulating of zzso zzso of cancer cell proliferation or differentiation of tumor zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the possibility for the therapeutic effect of zzso zzso against zzso zzso tumor in zzso Expressions of the zzso gene and protein were examined in 5 human zzso zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We next evaluated the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso Five cell lines showed higher level of the zzso gene and protein expression than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited cell proliferation by inducing zzso instead of differentiation in zzso zzso zzso zzso also down regulated the invasive potential of 5 cell zzso The zzso effect of proliferation or invasion was prominent in 3 cell lines, which exhibited higher expression level of the zzso gene or zzso Our results indicated that zzso zzso modify zzso potential of zzso zzso cell lines altering growth or invasive properties, suggesting that zzso could be potentially the novel molecular target for human zzso zzso zzso
