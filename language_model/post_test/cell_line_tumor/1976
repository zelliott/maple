Novel zzso zzso and therapeutic strategies are urgently required for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been reported in several human zzso The zzso underlying zzso expression and the clinical consequences of changes in expression are not zzso 

We used zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso expression and regulation of zzso in zzso melanoma cell lines and primary and zzso zzso 

zzso is subject to zzso regulation in zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso in the melanoma cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and expression is zzso by zzso In contrast, the zzso island is zzso and the gene expressed in cultured normal zzso In clinical cases of melanoma, zzso in the zzso zzso island occurs in both primary and zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso disease, particularly to the visceral sites and brain, is more common in primary zzso lacking zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso in zzso show limited zzso potential or more commonly zzso predominantly to zzso sites rather than zzso and brain zzso 

zzso of zzso expression in melanoma occurs via zzso changes in the zzso zzso zzso Confirmation of our results in larger clinical series would support the candidacy of zzso as a clinical zzso in melanoma, which could be applied in both primary and relapsed zzso zzso of zzso may have therapeutic potential in melanoma, particularly in patients with more aggressive disease zzso to zzso or the zzso
