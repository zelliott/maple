The zzso of many neurodegenerative disorders, including human zzso virus zzso associated zzso is exacerbated by an imbalance between zzso zzso zzso and their zzso tissue zzso of zzso zzso In the context of disease, zzso has emerged as an important zzso protein capable of regulating zzso We previously reported differential zzso expression in acute versus chronic zzso of zzso This study investigates possible mechanisms underlying zzso zzso in chronic zzso We used zzso zzso as a model zzso stimulus and measured zzso binding to zzso zzso cell death, zzso zzso zzso zzso stability and zzso regulation in activated zzso zzso remained localized to the cell body or was zzso into the cell zzso DNA fragmentation zzso and zzso zzso showed that prolonged zzso zzso of zzso induced significant zzso zzso In acute and chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were not significantly zzso zzso zzso stability was measured in zzso and zzso zzso cells by real-time zzso and zzso promoter zzso was studied using zzso reporter zzso in zzso zzso Our results indicated that zzso expression is regulated through multiple zzso zzso control and loss of zzso stabilization are, however, the most likely primary contributors to chronic zzso of zzso These data are important for unraveling the mechanisms underlying zzso responses during chronic zzso and have broader implications in other inflammatory diseases that involve zzso zzso
