zzso drug delivery offers an opportunity for the development of safer and more effective therapies for the treatment of zzso In this study, we sought to identify short, zzso zzso zzso that could serve as directive agents for specific drug delivery in zzso zzso By screening of human leukemia cells with a zzso zzso display zzso library, we isolated a zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso which bound to different leukemia cell lines and to zzso bone zzso zzso The motif was zzso through a zzso pathway, and we next identified the corresponding zzso as the zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we observed a potent zzso cell effect when the targeting motif was zzso in tandem to the zzso sequence zzso Finally, our results confirmed increased expression of zzso in representative human leukemia and zzso cell lines and in a panel of bone zzso specimens obtained from patients with acute zzso leukemia or acute zzso leukemia compared with normal bone zzso These results indicate that zzso could potentially be used as a target for zzso therapy in human zzso and zzso and that the zzso zzso is a promising drug candidate in this zzso
