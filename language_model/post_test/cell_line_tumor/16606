zzso has proven to be a powerful method that takes advantage of the presence of spontaneous zzso immune response in some cancer zzso In this study, zzso of normal zzso and two zzso cancer cell line zzso expression libraries with zzso from zzso cancer patients led to the isolation of 75 independent zzso designated zzso through zzso Of these, zzso showed zzso to be expressed strongly in normal zzso in zzso cancer cell lines zzso and in zzso cancer zzso zzso The expression of zzso in cancer cells is also induced by the zzso agent zzso zzso To test zzso we used the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to analyze zzso zzso against the 75 zzso that were initially isolated by zzso Four of the 75 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso reacted exclusively with zzso from cancer zzso However, zzso reacted with 1 of 20 zzso cancer zzso These data suggest that the zzso can be considered a novel CT zzso that is regulated by DNA zzso
