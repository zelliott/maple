zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso by increasing the nuclear zzso of zzso to activate downstream target zzso However, the mechanism of zzso recruitment to the zzso zzso promoter, a critical step for removing the zzso complex, is largely zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso protein 1 zzso and its highly related family member zzso were required for zzso zzso zzso zzso induced the interaction between zzso and zzso as well as their binding to zzso target zzso zzso the recruitment of zzso and zzso to zzso zzso promoters was mutually dependent on each zzso Furthermore, the depletion of zzso significantly inhibited zzso gene expression and zzso growth in zzso and in zzso Our results unravel two new components required for nuclear zzso function, and have important implications in developing new strategies for zzso zzso zzso
