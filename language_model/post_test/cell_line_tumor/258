zzso Parkinson's disease zzso is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by a loss of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Many cellular mechanisms are thought to be involved in the death of these specific zzso in zzso including zzso stress, changes of zzso calcium zzso and zzso zzso Since recent studies have revealed that also zzso zzso zzso stress in conjunction with abnormal protein degradation can contribute to the zzso zzso we investigated here the molecular mechanisms underlying the interplay between zzso and zzso and its relevance in the control of zzso cell death in zzso We observed that zzso induced changes in the zzso function, affecting zzso membrane potential and electron transport chain zzso Likewise, it was also evident the unfolded protein response zzso by an zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, stress stimuli caused the release of zzso from the zzso that consistently induced zzso zzso zzso with a rise of zzso zzso free zzso Besides, zzso release zzso prevented zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our findings show that zzso and zzso are in a close communication, establishing a dynamic zzso zzso that can play a prominent role in the zzso cell death induction under particular stressful circumstances of zzso zzso
