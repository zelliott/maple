zzso species are zzso zzso zzso that cause zzso disease zzso Although the mechanisms underlying zzso cell interactions are not well zzso zzso zzso of the zzso are known to mediate attachment and invasion in zzso We identified zzso zzso zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso that contains a zzso zzso domain zzso and has zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins are zzso proteins that function in zzso and signaling and are present in a wide range of organisms, from humans to zzso However, this is the first report of a zzso protein in zzso and in zzso zzso is predicted to be a type 1 membrane zzso with a zzso an zzso zzso domain, a zzso domain, and a zzso tail containing a zzso sorting zzso The predicted structure of zzso displays several characteristics of zzso zzso zzso including a long loop region zzso core associated with zzso zzso binding as well as predicted zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression during zzso zzso infection in zzso is zzso at 48 h zzso suggesting that it is zzso zzso The zzso mass of native zzso is greater than predicted, most likely due to zzso zzso is localized to the surface of the zzso region and to dense zzso of zzso and zzso Taken together, these findings, along with the known functions of zzso zzso zzso zzso and of zzso zzso strongly zzso a significant role for zzso in zzso cell zzso
