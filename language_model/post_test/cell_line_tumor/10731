The biological activities of garlic may be affected by different processing zzso This study, therefore, aimed to evaluate potential zzso effects of different type of processed garlic extracts on zzso tumor cells in zzso zzso mice and correlate the tumor growth rates with some garlic zzso In a zzso trial 60 zzso mice were injected with zzso tumor cells and divided into six groups of 10 zzso Group 1 mice received 200 zzso of zzso and groups 2-6 were injected zzso with fresh, zzso zzso leaves, and boiled garlic zzso respectively, at 20 zzso zzso Three weeks following tumor zzso the mean tumor size in garlic zzso groups was reduced with significant reductions observed in the fresh and zzso extract groups compared with the control group ( zzso The zzso capacity and the amounts of zzso zzso and zzso compounds in zzso processed garlic were evaluated and correlated with their zzso zzso There was a linear correlation between the amounts of zzso zzso or zzso components derived from fresh, zzso zzso leaves, and boiled garlic and cancer growth zzso In conclusion, garlic has zzso activity against zzso tumor cells, and processing such as heating reduces its effect zzso The zzso activities of different kinds of garlic are related to the level of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso fresh garlic has the highest content of zzso components and the greatest zzso zzso
