zzso of cell death and zzso of cell growth are the main targets of cancer zzso Here we evaluated the role of zzso on zzso of human zzso zzso cell lines, focusing on its zzso with cell zzso and zzso In this study, a zzso agent zzso or zzso induced the formation of zzso in three human zzso cell lines and zzso the expression of zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso by zzso or zzso 1 increased zzso zzso in zzso zzso Meanwhile, increased damage of the zzso membrane potential was also observed in zzso cells when zzso was zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso reduced clone formation and impaired cell growth of zzso cells when treated with zzso zzso of an zzso inhibitor zzso and chemotherapy significantly inhibited tumor growth in a mouse zzso tumor model, with greater extent of zzso and impaired proliferation of tumor zzso This study suggests that zzso is a potential novel target to improve therapy efficiency of conventional zzso towards zzso
