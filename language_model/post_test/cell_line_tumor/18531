Following the identification through virtual screening of zzso as moderately potent zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso inhibitor analogue program was zzso The first aims were to zzso potency and to evaluate the cellular mode of action of lead candidate zzso Here the synthetic chemistry, the zzso design approach, and the zzso relationships zzso that led to the discovery of zzso zzso zzso zzso many with very low zzso zzso against zzso are zzso Furthermore, X-ray crystal structures of four representative zzso from our chemical series in complex with zzso are zzso and these structures are used to zzso the observed zzso zzso Finally results are reported that show, using the most potent zzso inhibitor compound from the current series, that the observed zzso and zzso effects are consistent with cellular zzso and zzso zzso
