Metal directed zzso molecular zzso with interesting zzso have been widely used as models for zzso and in development of zzso Two novel zzso complexes with zzso zzso or zzso as auxiliary zzso were zzso and characterized by zzso analysis, zzso zzso zzso and zzso and single crystal X-ray zzso The spectral investigations and X-ray data show that zzso is zzso coordinated with zzso zzso zzso geometry of the zzso The in zzso binding and zzso studies using CT DNA by zzso zzso and zzso gel zzso techniques revealed that both complexes bind DNA via zzso The observed zzso of zzso for complexes zzso and zzso are zzso and zzso respectively, which suggest that zzso has strong binding affinity for CT DNA as compared to zzso The complexes were tested for zzso properties and found highly active at zzso concentration against zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso
