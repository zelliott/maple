In the present study we investigated whether zzso zzso cells can be zzso to evoke zzso or therapeutic zzso elimination of zzso zzso in two rat zzso Fisher 344 and zzso zzso rats were injected with two zzso zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso respectively, resulting in progressive tumor zzso zzso is zzso to the Fisher 344 and zzso to the zzso rats, while zzso cells are zzso to zzso rats and zzso to Fisher 344 zzso Both rat strains were zzso injected with their respective zzso tumor cells, which proved unable to grow zzso The zzso cells were either rejected immediately in zzso rats or within 25 days in Fisher rats, after limited tumor zzso Both rat strains were subsequently challenged with their respective zzso zzso tumor cells and once more 10 days later with a fivefold higher zzso zzso rats, even after zzso with five times the original dosage of zzso cells, remained tumor free for at least 360 zzso Similarly, Fisher rats, after initially rejecting zzso tumors, failed to develop zzso zzso To determine zzso immunity against established zzso tumors under more demanding therapeutic conditions, rats were first injected zzso with their respective zzso tumor and vaccinated once or repeatedly (at zzso zzso with a mixture of the zzso or zzso cells, with or without a zzso from the same zzso zzso which served as a therapeutic vaccine zzso The control group received either no treatment or zzso instead of zzso zzso In both strains of rats, we demonstrated that the zzso vaccinated groups were able to significantly reduce tumor growth, while complete rejection of tumors was noted in the zzso zzso zzso with zzso tumor cells alone failed to evoke zzso zzso We conclude that therapeutic zzso with a combination of zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso rejection of zzso zzso and offers a protective effect against challenge with zzso tumor zzso This zzso approach may prove useful as a zzso zzso therapy in future cancer treatment zzso or even as a zzso therapeutic tumor zzso
