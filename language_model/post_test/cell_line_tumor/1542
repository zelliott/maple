zzso resistance is a major obstacle to successful treatment of oral zzso cell zzso zzso Lately, we found a novel human gene named tongue cancer chemotherapy zzso zzso zzso in the tongue cancer zzso resistance cell line zzso established by zzso In this study, we focus on zzso zzso zzso and zzso characterization of zzso After molecular cloning and zzso of the gene zzso the zzso zzso a mouse zzso zzso against zzso was prepared, and the specialty of the zzso was confirmed by Western zzso The cell proliferation was evaluated by zzso zzso and DNA damage was determined by comet zzso the results indicated that this protein especially zzso the cell's resistance to zzso it was associated with its role of providing protection against DNA zzso We also found that zzso expression was increased in zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso but not in zzso zzso cell lines zzso compared with their parental counterparts by Western zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis showed zzso is mainly expression in zzso the zzso U test exhibited that zzso positive patients predicted the worst sensitive with zzso of zzso zzso All these findings suggest that zzso is a novel zzso protein which is mainly localized in the zzso and can mediate zzso resistance against DNA zzso the expression level of zzso in patients with zzso may be useful as an indicator of therapeutic efficacy of the sensitivity to zzso
