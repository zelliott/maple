zzso iron zzso has been reported in brain regions in some neurodegenerative zzso However, the mechanism for this is largely zzso zzso metal zzso 1 zzso is an important zzso zzso zzso The aim of the present study is to construct zzso zzso zzso human zzso with iron responsive element zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells in order to investigate the relationship between increased zzso expression and iron zzso The human zzso gene was obtained by zzso from zzso of human zzso zzso was successfully constructed and identified by zzso restriction zzso analyses and DNA sequencing, zzso It was able to efficiently zzso zzso cells, which was confirmed by zzso and Western zzso When incubated with 100 zzso zzso iron for zzso the zzso iron levels dramatically increased in zzso infected zzso cells compared to the solely zzso infected zzso Meanwhile, the levels of zzso free zzso and zzso zzso in these cells zzso This led to the zzso of zzso The zzso in zzso infected cells was shown with zzso zzso using zzso zzso Analysis of DNA extracted from these cells showed the typical zzso zzso indicating the formation of zzso and zzso These results suggested that increased zzso expression in zzso cells caused the increased zzso iron zzso This resulted in the increased zzso stress leading to ultimate cell zzso
