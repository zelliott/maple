zzso cells at zzso contain zzso in zzso form and are hypersensitive to zzso zzso Previous research had shown some chemicals that induce zzso zzso within zzso cells act as zzso Of these agents, zzso zzso which is an inhibitor of protein zzso 1 zzso and 2A zzso showed good zzso activity at zzso zzso zzso and 13 additional structural zzso zzso were tested for their zzso activity on zzso cells in zzso 

Twelve of the 14 zzso zzso were zzso in the zzso zzso Various zzso of the drugs were screened for toxicity and zzso effectiveness with zzso zzso zzso prostate zzso zzso More detailed zzso studies of the more potent agents were performed with zzso zzso colon zzso cells since they could be readily zzso The zzso of zzso phase zzso cells was measured after a zzso exposure to the more potent drugs and reductions of the surviving fraction after an acute dose of 2 zzso zzso served to estimate their relative zzso The increase in zzso of zzso 1 zzso and zzso 3 zzso induced by these drug zzso was measured by Western zzso of protein zzso zzso change in zzso zzso was zzso by electron zzso and the alkaline comet zzso (which measures DNA zzso zzso was employed to measure the radiation sensitivity of cellular zzso in the zzso zzso 

Of the 14 zzso zzso tested, zzso zzso and zzso at zzso of zzso zzso showed little or no zzso produced elevated levels of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso significant zzso at low radiation zzso The zzso in zzso cells treated with zzso became visibly zzso and its DNA was about zzso times more sensitive to zzso strand breakage relative to that of control zzso 

The results confirm the zzso earlier studies that showed an increase in zzso cell intrinsic zzso by exposure to agents that promote zzso zzso zzso was identified as the optimal zzso agent of this class of zzso zzso was correlated with zzso zzso and elevated zzso of zzso and zzso The DNA in zzso cells exhibited an enhanced sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso
