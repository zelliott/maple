zzso resistance zzso has been studied extensively because it is one of major problems in cancer zzso The zzso zzso is often due to zzso of zzso zzso that acting as an zzso drug zzso pump exports various zzso drugs out of zzso The major goal of our investigation is to establish whether bovine serum zzso zzso zzso which generates the products zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso is able to overcome zzso of human cancer zzso The zzso of the products was evaluated in both zzso zzso zzso and drug-resistant zzso zzso colon zzso zzso A zzso cell survival zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso cells were more sensitive than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protected cells against zzso mainly due to the formation of zzso However, zzso zzso still induced some zzso The zzso effect was totally inhibited in the presence of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso electron zzso investigations showed that zzso and zzso induced evident zzso zzso more pronounced in zzso than in zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity was checked by flow zzso studies, zzso cells with the probe zzso that displayed a zzso zzso status of the zzso in zzso zzso After treatment with zzso zzso in the presence of zzso the cells showed a marked increase in zzso membrane zzso higher in zzso zzso than in zzso zzso zzso Our findings suggest that toxic zzso products formed from zzso and zzso could be a powerful tool in the development of new zzso treatments, mainly against zzso tumor zzso
