zzso are the natural compounds isolated from plants, which are structurally similar to animal estrogen, zzso zzso a major zzso isolated from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso is known as a zzso however, the molecular mechanisms underlying its zzso effect are remained zzso In this study we investigated the zzso signaling triggered by zzso as compared to a famous zzso zzso in zzso human breast cancer zzso zzso scarcely binds to zzso alpha as compared to zzso and zzso Despite poor binding to zzso zzso zzso induced potent zzso effects, namely recovery of the population of cells in the zzso after serum zzso zzso of the zzso response element, and induction of zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso effect was severely zzso by treatment with zzso a specific zzso zzso zzso promoted zzso of zzso but did not affect zzso of zzso alpha at zzso It also increased cellular zzso of zzso a hallmark of zzso zzso zzso These data imply that zzso exerts its zzso effect mainly via the zzso and zzso rapid zzso zzso signaling zzso This property of zzso sets it aside from zzso where it exerts the zzso effects via both an zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso
