The arrangement of zzso in a tract can have a specific effect on the organization of functional zzso zzso Here we describe zzso bulb zzso zzso arranged in the lateral zzso zzso zzso differentiated projection zzso over the whole zzso bulb are similarly marked with transient expression of zzso zzso Their zzso are assembled together and project into the zzso superficial part of the zzso zzso the older zzso This special assembly of the zzso explains the zzso relationships between the zzso bulb and the lateral zzso tract zzso that have been described in previous studies and could possibly influence the subsequent selection of the zzso target areas by these zzso
