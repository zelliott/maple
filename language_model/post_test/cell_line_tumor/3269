To investigate whether the heat shock protein zzso 70 zzso zzso can enhance the sensitivity of zzso cancer cell zzso to zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso of zzso cells was blocked by the 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso while its effect on cell growth was evaluated by zzso zzso zzso zzso and colony forming ability zzso 

The zzso expressions in zzso zzso treated group were lower than the corresponding sense and nonsense treated groups zzso zzso zzso zzso the increased sensitivity of zzso to zzso C was found in zzso treated group, compared with the corresponding sense and nonsense treated groups zzso zzso zzso 

The sensitivity of zzso cancer cell zzso to zzso C was enhanced by the zzso of the zzso zzso
