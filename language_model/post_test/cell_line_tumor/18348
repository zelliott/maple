The neurotransmitter zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso from pancreatic zzso by zzso the membrane to enhance zzso zzso zzso To clarify the electrical events involved in this process, we measured zzso currents from a zzso zzso line zzso and mouse pancreatic zzso In zzso recordings, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activated a zzso zzso current zzso zzso 24 zzso reversal potential of approximately zzso zzso The zzso which we refer to as zzso was blocked by zzso a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso channel zzso The magnitude of the current decreased by zzso when zzso zzso was removed, but was not affected by changes in zzso zzso confirming that zzso is a zzso zzso To determine if zzso activates following release of zzso from an zzso store, we blocked zzso zzso receptors with zzso zzso still activated a current in the presence of zzso demonstrating the presence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso current in zzso zzso However, the zzso current was smaller and had a more positive reversal potential zzso 0 zzso than the current activated by zzso under control zzso This result indicates that zzso had blocked a component of zzso which likely activates following release of stored zzso zzso zzso calcium stores with zzso also activated a zzso zzso zzso current in zzso zzso The properties of this putative zzso current were similar to the component of zzso that was blocked by zzso being zzso and reversing near zzso zzso We conclude that zzso consists of zzso and zzso zzso both of which may contribute to the zzso action of zzso zzso on pancreatic zzso
