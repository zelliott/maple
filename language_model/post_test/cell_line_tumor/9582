zzso disease zzso an zzso zzso neurodegenerative disorder, is characterized by the presence of zzso zzso inclusions known as zzso bodies in several zzso including the zzso zzso a protein zzso and zzso an zzso zzso are two of the proteins that are known to be defective in zzso zzso interacts with zzso and promotes its zzso and zzso Here we show that zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and that they form zzso zzso when treated with zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and cause zzso of zzso These zzso are also zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrating their zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso is dependent on the functional zzso zzso zzso and zzso form zzso when expressed together or otherwise, suggesting that the two proteins are recruited to the zzso independent of each zzso Taken together, our results suggest that the zzso zzso of zzso possibly with the help of zzso may enhance the zzso of its zzso and facilitate their efficient degradation by zzso zzso in zzso or zzso may thus lead to increased levels of zzso and/or target zzso which may eventually affect the zzso processes of the zzso Thus, defects in protein degradation and clearance are likely to be the primary trigger in the zzso of zzso
