zzso zzso zzso zzso induce cell growth arrest and zzso in a wide variety of tumor zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of zzso A zzso one of the zzso zzso on proliferation and zzso of oral zzso cell zzso zzso Exposure of zzso cells zzso from human tongue zzso cell zzso to zzso resulted in cell growth zzso and zzso in a zzso manner as measured with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Western zzso showed that both total zzso and zzso zzso were induced by zzso treatment, whereas zzso level zzso zzso of zzso was zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression with zzso zzso could sufficiently block zzso zzso induced zzso of cell growth, but failed to block zzso zzso induced zzso of cell growth and zzso Moreover, induction of zzso by zzso treatment was also demonstrated by zzso C releasing and induction of zzso zzso the results suggested that zzso zzso was involved in zzso induced cell growth zzso and zzso of oral zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso could be potential zzso drugs for chemotherapy of oral zzso cell zzso
