The zzso zzso is a scaffold for protein zzso zzso and zzso molecules zzso for zzso and recycling of zzso zzso zzso binds to the zzso through well characterized zzso zzso These interactions are facilitated approximately zzso when zzso is anchored to the zzso leaflet of the plasma zzso Although the zzso region zzso 550 zzso is highly zzso charged and probably zzso zzso it could anchor zzso to the inner leaflet through zzso zzso of its zzso zzso and zzso binding of three short positively charged zzso zzso Loss of the site of zzso was found to affect neither zzso zzso zzso nor zzso zzso zzso peptides corresponding to zzso bound in zzso to zzso zzso zzso with high zzso a binding reversed by zzso in the presence of zzso In zzso zzso zzso is regulated by zzso zzso a function mapping to the N zzso of the protein harboring zzso zzso and zzso zzso of any two zzso eliminates membrane association of the zzso zzso the sensitivity to zzso and the ability of this scaffold to catalyze zzso zzso and zzso
