zzso is a member of zzso zzso inhibitor family with tumor suppressing activity for breast and prostate zzso acting at the level of tumor invasion and zzso However, there have been no published data regarding the role of zzso in human zzso zzso We evaluated zzso expression in 65 series of zzso cancer samples zzso zzso zzso zzso and 43 radical zzso and studied the regulatory mechanism of zzso gene zzso in zzso cancer zzso zzso expression was zzso detected in four zzso patients with zzso and 22 zzso patients with radical zzso whereas no expression was observed in normal transitional cells located at zzso area in zzso The zzso expression was significantly correlated with the development of muscle invasive zzso cancer zzso Using a zzso reporter system, zzso promoter activity was induced in the zzso zzso cancer cell lines as well as zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, treatment with the DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso A, led to zzso of zzso in zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso may contribute to zzso cancer development and that DNA zzso and zzso zzso may be important for regulating zzso gene zzso in zzso cancer zzso
