zzso zzso synthesis during reverse zzso zzso quantitative analysis of zzso zzso synthesis in zzso as well as in cells infected with zzso zzso We report a simple zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso By zzso the zzso sequence during reverse transcription, the opposite strands of target sequences can be simultaneously detected by zzso melting curve analysis and zzso transcripts are readily distinguished from zzso primed zzso We have zzso this technique to zzso the specificity of reverse zzso on a panel of 15 target zzso zzso reverse zzso occurred for all target sequences when reverse zzso was performed at zzso and accounted for zzso of the final zzso amplification zzso By raising the reaction temperature to zzso the specificity of reverse zzso could be increased without significant loss of zzso We have also demonstrated the utility of this technique for analysis of zzso and zzso zzso synthesis of influenza A virus in infected zzso Thus, this technique represents a powerful tool for analysis of zzso zzso zzso
