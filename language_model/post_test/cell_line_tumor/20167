The zzso agent zzso is widely used in the treatment of zzso zzso however, its mechanism of action is poorly zzso We have studied zzso zzso expression changes in the zzso zzso cancer cell zzso 

Cell viability and hormone zzso were used to select the optimal zzso concentration effectively zzso hormone zzso without affecting cell zzso zzso isolated from cultures treated for 48 and 72 h was subjected to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso results were validated by quantitative zzso zzso 

Altogether, 117 significantly zzso expressed genes were detected at 48 h and 72 h zzso zzso zzso in zzso samples relative to zzso Three significantly zzso genes involved in steroid hormone zzso zzso zzso and zzso and four significantly zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been zzso 

zzso changes might be involved in the adrenal action of zzso and in the zzso of hormone zzso
