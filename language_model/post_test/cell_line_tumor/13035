Suicide gene therapy using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been extensively tested for the treatment of zzso Our previous study showed that zzso wild type zzso zzso enhanced the zzso effect of zzso zzso However, the use of zzso is hindered by its low penetration to the brain and its toxicity when used at higher zzso In the present study, we used another zzso zzso zzso and examined the therapeutic efficacy of zzso combining with zzso in zzso zzso zzso We observed that zzso combined with zzso resulted in the zzso zzso effect in zzso zzso zzso significantly enhanced the sensitivity of zzso positive zzso cells to zzso in zzso Our in zzso experiment demonstrated that the effect of zzso and zzso combination therapy was better than that of zzso zzso The survival time of zzso rats treated with zzso in combination with zzso was also significantly prolonged than those treated with zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso can enhance the therapeutic efficacy of zzso both in zzso and in zzso These findings are considerably valuable with the respect of using less toxic zzso as zzso This novel strategy could provide benefit to zzso gene zzso
