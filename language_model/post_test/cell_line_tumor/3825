Cell migration is a highly complex, zzso biological phenomenon that involves precise zzso coordination of distinctive zzso including zzso zzso and contraction of the zzso Observations of individual tumor cell migration reveal that cells generally exhibit either zzso or zzso migration modes in native like zzso However, it has also been observed that some zzso cells are capable of zzso adapting to their environment by zzso their type of zzso Recent studies suggest in fact that changes in zzso and zzso properties of tumor cells can zzso control their transition from one type of migration to the zzso These changes may be caused by internal cell zzso mechanisms as well as mechanical and zzso properties of the zzso zzso In order to understand the complex transition between the two modes and the role played by internal cellular mechanics during migration, we have developed a novel zzso zzso cell model to simulate the zzso behavior of a zzso zzso zzso results from our study zzso demonstrate that the zzso properties of the cell may play an important role in the zzso transition during zzso Our study will therefore not only help in creating a new platform for simulating cellular processes but will also provide insights into the role of zzso mechanics in regulating various modes of migration during tumor invasion and zzso
