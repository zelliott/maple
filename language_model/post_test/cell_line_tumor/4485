The tumor zzso zzso domain family 1 zzso A zzso is known to play an important role in zzso zzso However, the molecular details about zzso protein regulation are zzso In this report, checkpoint zzso 1 zzso is identified as a novel zzso zzso that zzso zzso in zzso and under cellular zzso Using tandem mass zzso and zzso analysis, it was determined that zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso which has been shown to be zzso in a subset of human primary zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso 184 zzso of zzso was significantly diminished by a zzso zzso zzso Similarly, a zzso zzso zzso was unable to zzso zzso 184 whereas zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso substitution of zzso 184 with zzso acid, mimicking zzso abolished the ability of zzso to interact with zzso and induce zzso zzso zzso these data indicate that zzso of zzso by zzso is important for zzso regulation and provide valuable new insight into the regulatory mechanisms of zzso zzso 

This study reveals that zzso zzso of zzso at zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso regulation and highlights that zzso of this zzso zzso site in zzso zzso has disease zzso
