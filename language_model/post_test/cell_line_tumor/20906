The use of cultured cell lines as model systems for normal tissue is limited by the molecular zzso accompanying the zzso process, including changes in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso identification of cell lines with zzso expression profiles is of paramount importance in studies of normal gene zzso 

The zzso and zzso expression profiles of several breast cell lines of zzso or normal origin were measured using printed slide zzso zzso zzso zzso and real-time reverse zzso chain zzso 

We demonstrate that the zzso expression profiles of two breast cell lines are similar to that of normal breast zzso zzso zzso normal breast zzso and zzso a breast cancer cell line that retains zzso zzso allowing zzso differentiation to both zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, only zzso exhibits a zzso zzso expression zzso We identified a group of zzso that are highly expressed in normal breast tissue and zzso but are lost in all other zzso and zzso breast cell lines and observed a similar loss in zzso zzso cell lines compared with healthy zzso B zzso Moreover, like zzso zzso zzso these zzso are lost in a variety of zzso We show that the mechanism leading to the loss of these zzso in breast cancer cell lines has zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

We propose that, despite its zzso origin, zzso is an excellent molecular model for normal breast zzso providing a unique tool to study breast differentiation and the function of key zzso that are typically lost in zzso
