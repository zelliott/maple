The increasing use of zzso surgery makes it essential to identify zzso profiles responsible for the progression of in zzso to invasive zzso to facilitate the detection of zzso that are most likely to zzso or progress and, thus, to be able to offer patients tailored treatment zzso Our objective was to zzso and compare zzso profiles in zzso zzso in zzso zzso and invasive zzso zzso zzso We also aimed to identify markers in tumor and normal surrounding zzso that may be zzso of zzso recurrence in patients with zzso 

zzso parameters including zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso density zzso zzso and zzso expression were evaluated in zzso in zzso and invasive zzso The impact of the zzso profiles of zzso zzso and normal surrounding zzso on zzso recurrence was zzso 

A progressive increase in cell proliferation and a zzso decrease in steroid hormone zzso zzso was observed during the transition from in zzso to invasive zzso as also within each zzso as grade zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso dramatically decreased during the transition from in zzso to invasive zzso Finally, we found that a low zzso expression was indicative of zzso zzso 

Cell zzso hormonal and differentiation characteristics differed in zzso with respect to IDC, and the main variation in the transition between the two zzso zzso was the decrease in zzso expression and zzso
