zzso zzso has a role in regulating zzso zzso cell zzso zzso mechanisms, and zzso zzso Previously we reported zzso as a novel diagnostic marker for cervical zzso zzso with poor zzso This study further investigated the diagnostic role of zzso in zzso tumors especially zzso zzso We recruited 107 patients with zzso (41 tumors in the corpus and 66 tumors in zzso most of whom treated by total abdominal zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso tumors in 37% of zzso 10 of 41 corpus tumors and 30 of 66 tumors in the zzso zzso tumors were further examined zzso and zzso for zzso cell surface marker, zzso and zzso stem cell marker, zzso Most of these tumors were zzso negative and zzso positive, and the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso was more selective than zzso in reflecting zzso aggressiveness with high grade nuclear zzso This study confirmed our previous finding of zzso as a diagnostic marker of cervical zzso In addition, zzso zzso was detected in zzso of zzso zzso zzso These results suggested the existence of an aggressive and zzso zzso of zzso zzso
