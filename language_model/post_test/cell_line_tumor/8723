Cancer is one of the greatest health challenges facing the world today with zzso million new cases of cancer every zzso The zzso zzso ability and low zzso of zzso zzso cells zzso make them potential delivery candidates for suicide genes for zzso zzso However, unstable supply and short life span of adult zzso in zzso have limited this therapeutic zzso In this study, we aimed to evaluate if zzso of human fetal bone zzso zzso zzso cells by zzso virus 40 zzso could be a stable source of zzso for clinical application of suicide gene zzso 

zzso of zzso and zzso zzso virus zzso zzso fluorescent protein zzso did not cause significant change in the stem cell properties of zzso The zzso effect of zzso in the presence of the zzso zzso was demonstrated in zzso and in nude mice bearing human prostate cancer cells, zzso and zzso which had been zzso with zzso and zzso for imaging evaluation by an in zzso live imaging system zzso imaging system; zzso Life zzso zzso injection of low doses zzso zzso zzso of zzso was as effective as previously reported and did not cause zzso harmful side effects in multiple zzso Mixed zzso reaction showed that zzso did not induce significant proliferation of zzso isolated from healthy zzso 

Taken together, immortalized zzso represent a reliable and safe source of zzso for further clinical zzso zzso
