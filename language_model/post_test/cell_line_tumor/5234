To investigate the effects of zzso zzso solution and different CO2 pressures on expression of zzso molecules (including zzso and zzso of zzso zzso cells in zzso To provide experimental base for the safety question of zzso operation and the selection of better zzso medium for the patients with suspected zzso zzso 

zzso cancer cells zzso were put in zzso zzso 70 zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso CO2 at 37 degrees C, the control group was not given any administration, respectively for 1 zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were measured at 0, 12, 24, 48 and 72 hours by using flow zzso 

The expression of zzso and zzso increased significantly at 0 zzso h after the cells were exposed to zzso zzso 70 zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso CO2 for 1 hour ( zzso respectively, and returned to the control levels by 72 zzso With the increase of the CO2 pressure, the expression of the zzso and zzso increased ( zzso The expression of the zzso and zzso totally increased significantly compared with zzso 

Both high pressure CO2 zzso zzso and zzso zzso solution can increase the expression of zzso and zzso in zzso cancer cells, and may promote the capability of zzso of zzso cancer zzso Lower CO2 pressure does not change the expression of zzso and zzso in zzso cancer cells, therefore the low CO2 pressure zzso zzso is safer as zzso medium for the patients with suspected zzso zzso
