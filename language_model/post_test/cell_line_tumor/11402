zzso zzso as drug carriers, have a potential to improve drug therapeutic zzso However, the feasible design of the zzso containing zzso agents and the behavior of the delivery to tumor zzso and cells has not been adequately zzso In this study, we developed a novel zzso consisting of a zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso structure for zzso zzso (an zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso were transformed by zzso which could significantly promote drug release and enhance the cellular zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso study demonstrated that targeted zzso could accumulate and remain in the tumor zzso Moreover, zzso exhibited higher tumor growth suppression than zzso on zzso zzso tumor model via intravenous administration zzso zzso zzso Both in zzso and in zzso experiments suggested that the zzso zzso delivery system was promising for improvement of zzso efficacy in various zzso zzso zzso
