zzso is a zzso protein zzso originally identified in zzso zzso required to delay entry of cells with damaged or zzso DNA into zzso The requirement of zzso for both S and zzso checkpoints has been zzso while only few studies have connected zzso to the zzso zzso zzso We used a small interference zzso strategy to investigate the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso depletion in zzso human zzso cells inhibited cell proliferation and raised the percentage of cells with a zzso DNA content, which correlated with zzso of giant zzso cells zzso distinct from zzso cells, while no increased number of cells in zzso or zzso could be zzso zzso of zzso also caused zzso of cells in the last step of zzso and of zzso cells in zzso phase, which coincided with zzso of zzso and increased levels of zzso In addition, zzso zzso cells failed to arrest in zzso after zzso disruption by zzso and showed decreased protein levels of zzso and zzso These studies show that zzso cells lacking zzso undergo abnormal zzso and fail to activate the zzso checkpoint, suggesting a role of zzso in this zzso
