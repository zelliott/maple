zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is a zzso zzso protein that zzso exclusively in zzso zzso where it regulates zzso family zzso zzso activities through recruitment of zzso Although zzso are well known for their involvement in cancer, the function of zzso in zzso remains largely zzso In this study, we reported zzso of zzso in more than zzso of zzso cell zzso zzso specimens and in the majority of tested zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells by zzso interference led to remarkable zzso of cell zzso migration, zzso growth as well as zzso in nude zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso affected the sustaining of zzso zzso but not zzso zzso induced by zzso Besides, the zzso activity in zzso cells was remarkably impaired when zzso was knocked zzso zzso of zzso zzso but not its zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso zzso significantly enhanced zzso zzso and cell migration of zzso zzso These results provided new insights into the function of zzso in modulating zzso zzso by which zzso might contribute to zzso cell zzso
