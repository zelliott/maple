Human zzso and zzso are inherently zzso Their functionality is determined by the interplay between different cell types, their secondary architecture, vascular system and zzso of signaling molecules and zzso Here we propose a zzso zzso cell culture platform, in which adjacent lanes of gels and liquids are patterned by zzso to capture this tissue zzso We demonstrate zzso cell culture of zzso zzso under continuous zzso a zzso toxicity zzso and zzso with zzso zzso breast cancer cells are used to demonstrate invasion and zzso zzso The platform is incorporated in a zzso plate format that renders it fully compatible with automation and zzso screening zzso The extended zzso ease of handling and full zzso to standard equipment is an important step towards adoption of zzso technology for screening in an industrial zzso
