The zzso zzso is critical to the development and progression of prostate cancer and zzso zzso is a mainstay of therapy for this zzso We performed a zzso expression analysis of human prostate cancer during zzso zzso therapy to identify genes regulated by zzso and genes zzso expressed after the development of zzso Six hundred and zzso of zzso probe sets detected significant expression changes after 3 months of treatment with zzso and zzso This included 149 genes that were also zzso expressed 36 hours after zzso withdrawal in zzso zzso These genes reflect the zzso changes that occur in treated tumors and include potential direct targets of the zzso zzso zzso profiles of zzso zzso tumors demonstrated that many of the gene expression changes detected during therapy were no longer present suggesting a zzso of the zzso response zzso in the absence of zzso zzso zzso resistance was associated with differential expression of a unique set of genes that reflect potential mechanisms of zzso zzso an zzso of the zzso zzso and key zzso for steroid zzso suggest that resistant tumors have increased sensitivity to and zzso synthesis of zzso zzso The specific pathways of zzso provide opportunities for zzso of resistant tumors and targeted zzso
