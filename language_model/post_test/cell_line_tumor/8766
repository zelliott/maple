zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso commonly associated with outbreaks of food zzso It is also known as an opportunistic pathogen causing clinical infections such as zzso meningitis, pneumonia, and gas zzso zzso infections, mostly in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a plethora of toxins of which four are associated with the symptoms of food zzso Two of these, the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso are predicted to be structurally similar and are unique in that they require the combined action of three toxin proteins to induce cell zzso Despite their dominant role in disease, the molecular mechanism of their toxic function is still poorly zzso We report here that zzso zzso strain zzso zzso harbors not only genes zzso zzso but also two copies of the zzso zzso We identified zzso as the major zzso toxin responsible for inducing rapid cell zzso both in cultured cells and in an zzso mouse toxicity zzso zzso zzso and deletion of zzso genes resulted in significant reductions of zzso zzso zzso studies with Chinese zzso zzso cells zzso showed that pore formation by both zzso and zzso occurs through a zzso sequential binding of toxin components to the cell surface and to each zzso This begins with binding of zzso or zzso to the zzso zzso and is followed by the recruitment of zzso or zzso respectively, followed by the corresponding third zzso Lastly, toxin component zzso studies indicate that although zzso and zzso can be expressed simultaneously and are predicted to be structurally similar, they are incompatible and cannot complement each zzso
