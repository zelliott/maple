zzso is a zzso zzso regulator and zzso protein that promotes zzso trafficking at a variety of cellular sites, including zzso and the zzso zzso To better understand its role in zzso trafficking, we investigated its function in zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso of zzso leads to a dramatic change in zzso zzso by light zzso dependent on binding the zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, there was little effect of zzso on zzso trafficking of the zzso cargo zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso assembly from zzso zzso zzso upon zzso A zzso or zzso zzso Instead, electron zzso studies revealed that zzso cells contained a large number of zzso late zzso zzso hybrid zzso similar to those found in zzso storage zzso zzso with a zzso in zzso trafficking, zzso cells also exhibited zzso of free cholesterol and retention of the retrograde zzso cargo zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso maturation by treatment of control cells with zzso zzso or zzso led to a compact zzso zzso similar to that observed in zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso defects of zzso cells could be rescued by removal of zzso lipids from the media, suggesting that buildup of zzso zzso in immature zzso induced disturbances in retrograde zzso Taken together, these data reveal that zzso maturation and trafficking are highly sensitive to zzso zzso zzso assembly and suggests that zzso zzso zzso changes can be a consequence of altered trafficking at late zzso
