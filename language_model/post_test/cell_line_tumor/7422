Previous work in our laboratory has established that the fusion of zzso zzso to a truncated form of the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso O zzso enhances the zzso and zzso efficacy of the tumor zzso when delivered by zzso or by zzso zzso contains a zzso sequence at the zzso zzso These zzso which are found in zzso proteins with a short cellular zzso target proteins for degradation in the zzso zzso To investigate whether the enhanced zzso zzso by zzso is due to the zzso zzso we constructed new zzso zzso that expressed the zzso zzso zzso fused to zzso which either contained or had been deleted of this zzso We then compared the zzso efficacy of this set of zzso and found that zzso expressing the fusion protein zzso or zzso were effective at zzso established zzso zzso immortalized tumors in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso expressing zzso alone or zzso fused to zzso from which the zzso sequence had been genetically removed could only slow tumor zzso Because zzso T cell zzso are generated in the zzso pathway, we also investigated the ability of the vaccines to induce zzso zzso T cells in the zzso and to generate zzso zzso zzso A strong correlation was observed between zzso zzso induction and tumor zzso and the zzso efficacy of the zzso zzso These findings suggest a strategy for the zzso of tumor zzso zzso strategies that may be broadly zzso
