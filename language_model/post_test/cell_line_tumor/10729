Tea has many beneficial zzso We have previously reported that green tea and a zzso green tea zzso modulated the gene expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the normal zzso zzso In the present study, we examined the effects of oral administration of zzso tea on the zzso expression of zzso genes in the zzso The intake of zzso tea for 4 weeks reduced the zzso expression of zzso and zzso together with that of the zzso factor zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso When rat zzso zzso cells were incubated in the presence of zzso tea, the expression of these genes was zzso in accordance with the findings in zzso The reduced protein expression of zzso and zzso was also zzso We then zzso zzso tea by sequential extraction with three organic zzso to give three zzso and the residual fraction zzso zzso In addition to organic zzso zzso IV, which was devoid of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso had effects similar to those of zzso tea on zzso zzso zzso IV zzso the gene expression of zzso growth factor binding protein 1, as insulin zzso This activity was different from that of zzso The present findings suggest that drinking zzso tea may help to prevent diabetes and that zzso tea contains a component or components with zzso activity distinguishable from zzso Identification of such zzso may open the way to developing a new drug for zzso
