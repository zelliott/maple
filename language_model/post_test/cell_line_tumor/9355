Early and differential diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso requires sensitive and specific tissue and serum zzso On the other hand, proteins involved in zzso are extensively modulated on exposure to zzso zzso including ultraviolet zzso zzso zzso we generated zzso zzso by using zzso zzso cells of an zzso cell line, zzso aiming to explore proteins zzso expressed in tumors and zzso We obtained 18 zzso clones recognizing protein targets in zzso zzso cells, and clone zzso was chosen for characterization studies because of its strong zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were found to be abundantly expressed in all zzso cell lines except zzso which resembles normal zzso We also observed the zzso of zzso zzso by some of the zzso cell zzso Moreover, cellular proteins recognized by the zzso displayed a late zzso in zzso zzso zzso We concluded that zzso target proteins are modulated in liver zzso and zzso zzso We therefore propose the validation of our zzso in tissue and serum samples of zzso patients to assess its potential use for the early diagnosis of zzso and to understand the role of zzso zzso in liver zzso
