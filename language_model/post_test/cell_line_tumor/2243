Recent studies suggest that zzso metabolism is altered during type 2 zzso Increased levels of the zzso zzso are associated with insulin zzso However, a role for zzso in pancreatic beta cell function, or insulin production, and release remains to be zzso Our studies in zzso cells and mouse pancreatic zzso demonstrate that zzso stimulates an zzso rise in the zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the levels of zzso and zzso remain zzso The increase in zzso levels by zzso is due to zzso of zzso zzso 2 zzso Interestingly, rises in zzso correlate with increased zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso levels by treatment of zzso cells or primary zzso with the zzso zzso inhibitor reduces zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso alone results in decreased zzso whereas zzso of the zzso zzso zzso leads to a rise in zzso Treatment of mice with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso disposal due to decreased plasma insulin zzso Altogether, our data suggest that zzso activates zzso in pancreatic beta cells leading to a rise in zzso levels, which is important for zzso
