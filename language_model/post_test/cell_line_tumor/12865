The zzso zzso of breast cancer is characterized by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso breast zzso share similar gene expression profiles and DNA repair deficiencies with zzso breast zzso zzso cells exhibit sensitivity to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso therefore, we hypothesized that zzso cancer cells may also exhibit sensitivity to these zzso In this study, we report that zzso breast cancer cells are more sensitive to these drugs compared with zzso breast cancer zzso Moreover, combination treatments indicated that zzso zzso by the zzso inhibitor zzso or zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso in zzso cells but not in zzso cancer zzso zzso cells exhibited reduced repair of zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso suggesting that the synergistic effect of zzso and zzso or zzso reflected inefficient zzso zzso zzso zzso investigations revealed that in zzso cells, zzso reduced the levels of zzso with a concurrent increase in zzso and its downstream target zzso Thus, the sensitivity to combination treatment seemed to be zzso by sustained DNA damage and inefficient DNA repair triggering zzso zzso Our results suggest a novel therapeutic strategy to treat women with zzso breast cancer, an aggressive disease that presently lacks effective treatment zzso
