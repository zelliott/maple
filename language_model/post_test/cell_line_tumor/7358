For zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso we investigated the expression of a newly discovered zzso zzso which is isolated by the zzso zzso screening using zzso as a bait and expressed highly in zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed on 48 zzso zzso and 77 zzso zzso consisting of 70 zzso and 7 zzso zzso using the zzso of zzso We analyzed the expression of zzso and the correlation between the percentage of zzso of each and their zzso zzso zzso coding by zzso was specifically and zzso expressed in most of the zzso regions of the zzso Also, in the early stage of zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso and the percentage area of diffuse zzso increased as the degree of zzso zzso Although all normal zzso zzso and most zzso zzso zzso showed no zzso of zzso most zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed a focal or diffuse zzso ( zzso Furthermore, the percentage of diffuse zzso in zzso zzso was significantly higher than in zzso zzso ( zzso zzso is highly expressed in zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso is involved at the initial tumor formation and its diffuse expression is associated with zzso zzso This evidence suggests that zzso may act as an zzso zzso affecting the zzso zzso
