Abstract zzso plays an important role in normal physiology of blood vessel growth, but can contribute to the zzso of diseases, such as zzso A new zzso zzso zzso zzso composed of the fused zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso and human zzso zzso zzso zzso cells to investigate its influence on zzso and tumor zzso The mature zzso protein exhibited the characteristic features of zzso proteins zzso and zzso bond zzso and, when added to cultures of human zzso vein zzso cell, resulted in a zzso decrease in proliferation relative to zzso controls ( zzso The zzso was diminished by zzso in chick zzso treated with 10 mug zzso protein compared with zzso for zzso buffer zzso zzso ( zzso zzso of a zzso zzso V fusion protein construct into zzso 116 cells decreased zzso and inhibited tumor growth in zzso without affecting tumor cell zzso zzso 116 cells that expressed zzso protein displayed a much lower relative growth ratio of zzso ( zzso against the control tumor zzso From these results, we conclude that human zzso zzso zzso zzso V fusion protein is an effective inhibitor of zzso and zzso tumor zzso
