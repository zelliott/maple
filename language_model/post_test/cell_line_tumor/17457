The poor prognosis of zzso zzso zzso has been associated with recurrence and zzso Recently, we established a pair of zzso cell lines from a primary zzso and its matched zzso zzso zzso zzso A high density of zzso zzso with zzso human zzso was used to identify the zzso expressed genes between zzso and zzso Comparing with zzso eight zzso and six zzso genes were detected in zzso One interesting finding is the zzso of zzso zzso a zzso intermediate filament, which has been linked to a more aggressive status in various zzso The correlation of zzso of zzso and zzso zzso was studied by zzso using a tissue zzso with 200 primary zzso and 60 pairs of primary and matched zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso of zzso was significantly associated with zzso zzso ( zzso This finding strongly suggests that the zzso of zzso may play an important role in the zzso of zzso
