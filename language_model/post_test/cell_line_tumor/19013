zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso is a major cause of zzso cartilage zzso The zzso zzso hormone zzso has been detected in the zzso fluid of arthritis patients, where it is thought to play an zzso zzso Here, we examined whether zzso acts via zzso of zzso zzso and sought to zzso the zzso signal pathways underlying this zzso 

Human zzso cell line, zzso zzso was zzso with or without zzso and then treated with tumor necrosis zzso zzso The effect of zzso on zzso zzso expression and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso were determined by reverse zzso chain reaction and Western zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso signaling of zzso was investigated using the zzso of zzso and nuclear factor zzso zzso and plasmids zzso dominant negative zzso forms of inhibitor zzso zzso zzso and inhibitor zzso zzso zzso 

We found that zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso in zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was not suppressed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso or a zzso terminal zzso zzso inhibitor zzso but was inhibited by zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso regulates zzso zzso expression by decreasing zzso zzso zzso and subsequent zzso zzso in human zzso and may be an effective inhibitor of zzso collagen degradation, providing new potential opportunities for the development of zzso zzso
