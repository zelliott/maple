A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso composite bone substitute zzso was prepared using an in zzso zzso zzso The zzso structure, and zzso strength of the composite was zzso and the in zzso zzso in zzso solution and preliminary cell responses to the composite were zzso 

The composite comprised zzso and an zzso linkage zzso The zzso strength of the composite was in the range of zzso zzso varying with the amount of zzso in the MAC zzso from 10 zzso to 50 zzso Weight loss from the composite increased (from zzso zzso to zzso zzso with increasing zzso content (from 10 zzso to 40 zzso in the MAC after the composite was soaked in zzso solution for 12 zzso The pH of the soaking medium varied from zzso to zzso zzso cells with an zzso zzso were well zzso and spread on the composite zzso zzso and differentiation increased with time, indicating that the composite had no negative effects on zzso zzso 

The zzso composite had good zzso and has potential to be used as a bone zzso
