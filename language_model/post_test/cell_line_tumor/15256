Recent zzso in zzso and zzso have led to the acquisition of large quantitative data zzso However, the use of these data to reverse engineer zzso networks has remained a challenging zzso Many methods have been proposed to zzso zzso network zzso from different types of biological zzso Here, we focus on unraveling network zzso from steady state responses of zzso networks to successive experimental zzso 

We propose a zzso zzso which combines a deterministic network zzso method termed Modular Response Analysis zzso and a statistical model selection zzso called zzso zzso zzso to zzso functional interactions in cellular signaling pathways and gene regulatory zzso It can be used to identify interactions among individual molecules involved in a zzso zzso or reveal how different functional zzso of a biological network interact with each other to exchange zzso In cases where not all network components are known, our method reveals functional interactions which are not direct but zzso to the interaction routes through unknown zzso Using computer simulated zzso responses of signaling pathways and gene regulatory networks from the DREAM challenge, we demonstrate that the proposed method is robust against noise and zzso to large zzso We also show that our method can zzso network zzso using incomplete zzso zzso zzso we have used this zzso to explore the zzso regulated zzso transition zzso in certain breast cancer cells to understand the molecular mechanisms which cause these cells to become drug zzso The zzso successfully zzso many well characterized interactions of this zzso by analyzing zzso obtained zzso zzso Additionally, it identified some molecular interactions which promote drug resistance in breast cancer zzso 

The proposed zzso provides a zzso zzso and cost effective solution for zzso network zzso from biological zzso It can potentially be applied to explore novel pathways which play important roles in life threatening disease like zzso
