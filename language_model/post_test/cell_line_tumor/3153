zzso is a zzso truncated zzso family member with a dominant negative function, which is zzso in zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which is involved in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression is increased by zzso and its function is blunted in several zzso Because in most of the zzso zzso zzso is zzso whereas zzso expression down zzso we investigated whether zzso may influence zzso expression in this cell zzso We found that zzso zzso in zzso cancer cells reduces zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso by zzso increases zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso of zzso is able to reduce zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicated that zzso binds to zzso region of the zzso promoter, which is a different site than that for zzso thereby zzso promoter zzso Interestingly, also the zzso active zzso zzso zzso and zzso bound to this DNA sequence and, at zzso with zzso zzso zzso promoter activity to an extent similar to that of zzso In accordance with its effect on zzso protein levels, zzso increased zzso protein content and, as a consequence, zzso zzso zzso This effect of zzso resulted in increased zzso cancer cell proliferation and reduced zzso and was reverted by the zzso inhibitor zzso indicating the role of zzso zzso in this zzso Taken together, these results indicate a novel zzso regulated mechanism for zzso expression in zzso cancer cells, and that, also through this zzso zzso exerts its zzso zzso
