zzso transition factor zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that has been shown to be zzso and zzso in a variety of zzso such as zzso We have recently found that an zzso zzso zzso or zzso acid zzso zzso binding zzso zzso specifically targets zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso In this report, zzso dye zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso were evaluated in human cancer cell zzso in order to investigate the possibility of zzso zzso targeting using an optical imaging zzso The zzso binding affinity of zzso peptides was tested in zzso plates coated with a zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging studies were performed in zzso and Ramos bearing zzso zzso The binding affinities of zzso zzso or zzso zzso were determined to be zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso images show that zzso peptides bound mainly to the cell surface and that zzso binding was clearly inhibited by free zzso zzso zzso tumors were clearly zzso with each of the two fluorescent zzso Of the two, zzso displayed higher tumor zzso and zzso tissue ratios at 10 zzso to 24 h zzso in the zzso tumor zzso For the in zzso blocking study, zzso (4 zzso was zzso with cold zzso zzso zzso into the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased up to approximately zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso could potentially be used to detect zzso zzso in zzso However, additional modifications to this optical imaging agent are needed to further improve its zzso
