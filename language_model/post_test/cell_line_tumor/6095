zzso is one of the most zzso zzso the zzso vessels of which are likely to arise by zzso and zzso An alternative mechanism of tumor zzso is zzso termed zzso zzso by which highly aggressive tumor cells can form zzso structures themselves, by virtue of their high cellular zzso Evidence suggests that cancer stem cells acquire a zzso plastic zzso and show zzso zzso In this study, we report that zzso zzso cells zzso can form zzso mimicry in tumor zzso and express zzso zzso We isolated zzso from zzso human zzso zzso and demonstrated their zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso Through a limiting dilution zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso were zzso zzso zzso study revealed that these two zzso of zzso shared similar efficacy in tumor formation but showed distinct zzso zzso In comparison with zzso a highly zzso zzso zzso mimicking zzso zzso was found in zzso tumor zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso were capable of vascular smooth zzso cell zzso in zzso and in zzso In tumor zzso zzso zzso gene was detected in implanted zzso and exclusively dispersed within the tumor zzso Although the detailed action mechanisms required further investigation, this study demonstrated the zzso capacity of brain zzso and their cellular zzso The results of expression of zzso molecules and differentiation of zzso cells suggest that zzso may contribute to form zzso structures and provide a blood supply for zzso zzso
