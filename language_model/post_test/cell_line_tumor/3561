The development of zzso gastric zzso involves several zzso zzso The environmental factor plays an important role in gastric zzso while the zzso genetic makeup may influence the zzso to zzso In this study we investigated correlations of the zzso variations at zzso 72 and zzso zzso with the risk of zzso gastric zzso Forty-eight zzso gastric zzso cases zzso 96 chronic zzso zzso zzso 96 zzso zzso zzso and 96 zzso zzso controls were enrolled in this zzso The zzso zzso 72 zzso zzso carriers were found to be more susceptible to progress to zzso than to IM zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Patients carrying zzso zzso zzso A, which contains the zzso at zzso 31, the zzso at the 16th base of the second zzso and the zzso at the 70th base of the zzso 3 were more prone to develop zzso than to reach the IM or zzso stage zzso versus zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The combination of zzso zzso 72 variation with the zzso zzso further distinguished the risk of zzso from IM zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso and/or zzso zzso may influence the progression during gastric zzso
