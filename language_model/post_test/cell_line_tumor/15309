We report the synthesis and zzso of zzso zzso zzso complexes, which were used as potential zzso therapeutic agents for melanoma cell growth zzso The novel complexes, zzso 1 (where zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso 2 (where zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso 1 was reacted with zzso (where zzso zzso zzso to produce zzso 4; while zzso was reacted with compound 2 to produce zzso zzso All complexes were zzso by zzso analysis, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso where zzso In zzso cell toxicity studies (with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso via dark and light reaction conditions were carried out with sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of complexes 3 and zzso Such studies involved zzso human zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso melanoma zzso and zzso zzso human skin zzso zzso Both zzso zzso of complexes 3 and 4 were found to be more toxic to melanoma cells than to zzso zzso cells, and zzso led to zzso of the melanoma cells over zzso skin zzso The zzso property of the zzso zzso of complexes 3 and 4 was further enhanced when treated cells were exposed to light, while no such effect was observed on zzso skin zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies were also used to assess the stability of the zzso zzso of complexes 3 and 4 in zzso media at pH zzso This research illustrates the potential for using zzso zzso zzso complexes to fight skin zzso
