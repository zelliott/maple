zzso zzso of zzso zzso and other zzso constituents from zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso and the zzso salt export pump zzso zzso in zzso and zzso contribute to zzso diseases zzso progressive familial zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and our objective was to establish genetic zzso and zzso structures of zzso and zzso in healthy populations of different ethnic zzso All coding zzso 5 of 6 zzso zzso 50 to 300 base pairs of the zzso zzso regions, and zzso to zzso zzso pairs of the promoter regions of zzso and zzso were zzso in 159 and 196 DNA samples of zzso African-American, Japanese, and Korean zzso In total, 76 and 86 zzso were identified in zzso and zzso zzso among them, 14 and 28 zzso zzso and 8 and 10 zzso zzso of which 4 were predicted to have functional zzso Both genes showed substantial ethnic differences with respect to zzso number, frequency of common and zzso sites, and patterns of linkage zzso zzso genetic analysis suggested some selective pressure against changes in the zzso supporting the important zzso role of these zzso zzso zzso was greater in zzso than in zzso An zzso promoter zzso was associated with significant decrease of activity compared with wild zzso Our results contribute to a better understanding of the molecular basis and of ethnic differences in drug response, and provide a valuable tool for future research on the zzso of zzso liver zzso
