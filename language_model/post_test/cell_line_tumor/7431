zzso zzso B zzso or zzso is zzso in most human zzso and is proposed to provide a marker of melanoma zzso We have shown previously that zzso of zzso leads to increased human melanoma cell death in zzso and in zzso resulting in shrinkage of tumors grown in zzso zzso In the present work, we analyzed the effects of zzso zzso on 10 human melanoma cell lines derived from tumors at distinct stages of zzso Our observations suggest that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso most effectively in zzso melanoma zzso zzso analysis shows that zzso treatment leads to a reduction in the expression of the survival factor zzso and the DNA repair factor zzso zzso 3 that is more pronounced in cells derived from zzso than primary zzso zzso cell viability was observed to correlate with reduction in zzso zzso and reduction in zzso protein levels by small interfering zzso led to an increase in cell zzso Interestingly, reduction of zzso expression by zzso was accompanied by a strong induction of zzso expression and repression of the zzso zzso zzso These changes in gene expression correlated with increased zzso in tumors injected with zzso zzso in zzso Taken together, our observations suggest that zzso may provide a potential therapeutic target in high-grade zzso and identify candidate pathways that may be implicated in the regulation of cell survival and tumor progression associated with zzso zzso
