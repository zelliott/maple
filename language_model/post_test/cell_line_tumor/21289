Our recent study revealed that zzso population in breast cancer cell line was resistant to zzso and formed colonies in zzso more efficiently than zzso zzso The present study was conducted to examine whether zzso population in breast cancer cell line possesses higher zzso potential in zzso and presence of zzso cells in breast cancer affects zzso behavior of zzso 

zzso and zzso population was sorted from breast cancer cell line, injected into zzso mice, and the zzso tumor volume was zzso zzso expression was zzso examined in clinical samples from 74 cases with breast zzso and cases with zzso of tumor cells showing high level of zzso expression were zzso as zzso zzso 

The zzso tumor volume derived from zzso population was significantly larger than that from zzso zzso Fifty zzso of 74 cases of breast cancer were zzso A significant correlation was observed between zzso character and zzso rate zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that tumor size zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the tumor size zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression zzso zzso zzso were independent zzso zzso 

zzso play an important role in zzso of breast cancer, and presence of small population of cells with strong zzso expression would be sufficient to predict poor prognosis of zzso
