zzso zzso is a major zzso agent in the development of chronic zzso zzso zzso and gastric zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso strains harbor a type IV zzso system zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso the zzso protein into gastric zzso cells leading to zzso zzso followed by cell zzso and zzso Here we report that zzso zzso a well-known zzso zzso of protein zzso C zzso zzso a remarkably similar cellular zzso as compared to infection with zzso zzso zzso comprise a large family of zzso zzso which are important for multiple zzso processes of host zzso We therefore investigated the role of individual zzso members and the zzso pathways involved in zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso and pharmacological zzso we found that two zzso zzso and zzso were essential for both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we provide evidence that zzso activity is profoundly zzso during the course of infection using zzso zzso against zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed that at least two bacterial factors activate zzso in a zzso manner, one of which is zzso zzso zzso studies further demonstrated that zzso zzso is accumulated and recruited to dynamic zzso at the cell zzso Finally, we show that zzso specifically targets zzso zzso to stimulate the zzso zzso pathway, which is also crucial for zzso zzso Thus, zzso is another important zzso of zzso zzso zzso
