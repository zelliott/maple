zzso zzso zzso is an aggressive and zzso zzso arising from the zzso zzso cells and usually associated with long-term zzso zzso Recent studies suggest that tumors contain cancer stem cells zzso and their stem cell characteristics are thought to zzso zzso However, whether zzso cell has any stem cell characteristics is not zzso To understand the molecular basis of zzso we first performed serial transplantation of surgical samples into zzso mice and established new cell zzso Next, we performed marker analysis of the zzso cell lines and found that many of them contain SP cells and expressed several putative zzso markers such as zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, expression of zzso closely correlated with that of zzso in some zzso zzso and culture zzso revealed that SP and zzso cells proliferated by zzso cell zzso zzso In addition, zzso and zzso cells have higher potential to generate zzso colony than negative cells in the stem cell zzso Moreover, these zzso cells have clear tendency to generate larger tumors in mouse transplantation zzso Taken together, our data suggest that SP, zzso zzso and zzso are zzso markers of zzso and could be used as novel therapeutic zzso
