So far, zzso oxide zzso donors have been applied to various aspects of zzso zzso To selectively sensitize tumor cells and avoid unwanted side effects, we recently zzso a zzso zzso compound, zzso zzso zzso In this study, we first verified its superiority over its parent zzso zzso in terms of targeted zzso zzso and zzso activity with zzso cells zzso zzso cell line zzso with transformed zzso zzso in zzso zzso only released NO when zzso by induced zzso in zzso cells, which led to its more powerful zzso than that of zzso The results showed that zzso produced higher NO levels than zzso in zzso cells at equal zzso and hence induced optimal NO levels for zzso zzso However, in zzso cells, zzso showed less toxicity than zzso zzso it is demonstrated that zzso is a zzso zzso for targeting NO zzso as a zzso NO zzso and it is also expected to be a promising probe in numerous experimental settings and a potential therapeutic drug for zzso zzso
