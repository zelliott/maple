It is established that experimental zzso requires zzso zzso zzso expressed on and released from activated zzso zzso an inflammatory response in zzso cells and zzso including tissue factor zzso zzso has also been shown to activate zzso in zzso and promote zzso stability in zzso These zzso effects may be zzso at least in part, by zzso signaling on zzso and vascular zzso zzso We have previously demonstrated prolonged bleeding and zzso closure times in mice deficient for zzso or its zzso zzso In the present study, we hypothesized that zzso and zzso promote lung tumor formation in experimental zzso in zzso We created mice doubly deficient in zzso and zzso zzso zzso and found them to be both fertile and zzso zzso tumor cells seeded poorly in mice deficient in zzso or zzso as well as zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso We sought to determine whether zzso zzso versus zzso zzso contribute zzso to reduced experimental lung zzso as observed in zzso deficient zzso By bone zzso zzso we created mice deficient for zzso either in the blood compartment but not in the zzso or vice zzso We found that mice deficient in blood compartment zzso had fewer lung zzso compared to zzso mice and mice deficient in zzso zzso Our findings suggest an important contribution of the zzso zzso to experimental lung zzso Furthermore, the data points to a selective role for peripheral blood cell zzso in this zzso
