zzso zzso expression has been reported to play an important role in the tumor zzso However, the pattern and the role of zzso in pancreatic cancer remain largely zzso zzso we further zzso the role zzso played in pancreatic zzso We first evaluated the zzso expression in human pancreatic cancer zzso and pancreatic cancer zzso Then we forced expression and silenced zzso expression in pancreatic cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso respectively, using zzso zzso We characterized the stable cells in zzso and in zzso using a nude mouse zzso zzso In this study, we found that zzso expression was significantly higher in cancer specimens which positively correlated with the expression level of zzso zzso and zzso and poorer zzso Moreover, our results demonstrated that zzso positively regulated pancreatic cell growth in zzso and in zzso and helped cancer cells resist to tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso Furthermore, we disclosed that zzso of zzso zzso zzso toxin zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso viral zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso inhibited zzso in pancreatic cancer zzso zzso is zzso in pancreatic cancer and promotes the survival of pancreatic cancer zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso may be a potential target for pancreatic cancer zzso
