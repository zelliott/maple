This study was designed to determine the zzso zzso and zzso properties of crude zzso extract zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso using human breast cancer zzso cell line as a model zzso zzso cells were cultured in the presence of zzso at various zzso zzso zzso for 48 h and the percentage of cell viability was evaluated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso zzso of cell proliferation with zzso of zzso zzso We found that zzso effect of zzso was associated with zzso on breast cancer cell line by zzso of zzso changes and zzso DNA zzso In addition, zzso at various zzso and incubation times were also found to inhibit zzso zzso These investigations suggested that the zzso extract from the zzso of zzso zzso had strong zzso potent zzso and induction of zzso Thus, it indicates that this substance can show different activities and has potential for cancer zzso which were dose dependent as well as exposure time zzso
