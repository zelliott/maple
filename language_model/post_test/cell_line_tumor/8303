In this work, we have developed new zzso zzso for zzso cell lung cancer zzso by directing the zzso selection process against the living cells of zzso the most common zzso of zzso A panel of zzso DNA zzso zzso were generated and evaluated for zzso cell zzso The zzso bound to the zzso cells with zzso zzso in the zzso range and the binding of the selected zzso to the zzso cells were significantly stronger than the other zzso lung cells as well as other types of cancer zzso Moreover, the application of the zzso to the clinical tissue section samples showed the differentiation of zzso from normal lung tissue and other zzso of lung zzso The zzso are expected to be new molecular zzso for the investigation of the molecular bases of different zzso zzso and their biological zzso which is valuable for advancing zzso diagnosis and zzso
