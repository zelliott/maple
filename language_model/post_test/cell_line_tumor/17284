zzso zzso is a nuclear zzso expressed as a zzso form in zzso cell populations and zzso zzso zzso zzso may regulate pathways important in the process of differentiation as part of separate complexes zzso zzso zzso and regulating zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso express zzso in a differentiation related zzso tumors express lower levels of zzso than poorly differentiated zzso In benign zzso zzso is expressed in zzso cells but not in terminally differentiated zzso zzso Based on these zzso we hypothesized that reduction of zzso expression might be an important differentiation zzso We used zzso zzso and zzso zzso to study the effects of reduced zzso expression in the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso reduction induced zzso cells to differentiate into zzso cells with associated zzso of zzso Reduction of zzso and zzso differentiation were accompanied by a marked reduction in expression of zzso which complexes with zzso by a marked change in zzso status of zzso zzso and by further differential expression of genes in differentiation zzso Thus, reduction of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso differentiation and thus may be an element of a differentiation control zzso in both normal and zzso zzso
