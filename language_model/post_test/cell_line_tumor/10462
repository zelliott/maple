zzso breast cancer zzso patients have poor zzso and survival outcomes such that the development of new targeted therapies is in strong zzso zzso associated with high proliferation and aggressive tumor zzso such as zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso play important roles in zzso The molecular zzso zzso is required for the zzso maturation and stability of a variety of proteins in multiple zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso inhibitor may show therapeutic benefit in zzso by targeting multiple zzso 

The novel oral zzso inhibitor zzso was characterized in multiple in zzso and in zzso zzso to determine its zzso activity in zzso cell zzso In addition, the correlation of zzso degradation and zzso induction in host peripheral blood zzso zzso and zzso tumors was zzso 

zzso zzso degradation of multiple client zzso zzso block, zzso and zzso cell proliferation in zzso lines, subsequently leading to tumor growth zzso in mouse zzso zzso The correlation of zzso degradation and zzso induction between zzso and zzso tumors reveals a differential zzso of zzso activity between host and tumor zzso and suggests that zzso degradation in zzso may serve as a zzso zzso in future clinical zzso 

The novel oral zzso zzso zzso is a candidate for clinical development in zzso by zzso targeting multiple signaling zzso In addition, zzso degradation in zzso may serve as a zzso in clinical zzso
