A zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso mice with zzso cells, a human zzso zzso zzso cell line, was used to identify and characterize an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies showed that zzso zzso reacted with five out of eight zzso cell lines, but not with 10 zzso tumor cell lines or a normal liver cell zzso Using zzso examination, zzso zzso was detected on the cell zzso and in the zzso of human liver tumor zzso but was not found in most other tumors, or normal adult or fetal zzso except for a zzso positive reaction in zzso of the zzso zzso Western zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso bound to a 45 zzso protein in the human zzso cell line and tissue zzso zzso treatment and zzso zzso did not detect the zzso chain in zzso zzso This zzso protein represents a potentially useful target for diagnoses and zzso of human zzso
