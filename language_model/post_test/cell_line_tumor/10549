Cancer zzso resistance zzso zzso by zzso cassette (ABC) zzso presents a significant unresolved clinical zzso One strategy to resolve zzso is to develop compounds that selectively kill cells zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have previously reported zzso studies based around the lead compound zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we sought to extend this work on zzso zzso by establishing whether 1 showed zzso activity against a range of cell lines expressing zzso We further aimed to zzso and test zzso with varied substitution at the zzso and substitution around the zzso ring of zzso zzso to identify compounds with increased zzso zzso 1 demonstrated zzso against all zzso cell lines zzso This selectivity was reversed by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso variation at the zzso position of 1 yielded compounds of greater zzso Two of these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were selected for further testing and were found to retain the activity profile of zzso These compounds are the most active zzso identified to zzso
