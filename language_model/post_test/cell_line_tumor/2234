zzso zzso has been shown to suppress immune zzso One mechanism is to suppress zzso cell interaction by zzso the expression of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso vascular cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso on the tumor zzso which enables tumor cells to escape immune zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein mainly located in the zzso zzso has been shown to exert zzso activity and inhibit tumor zzso Here, we demonstrate that in addition to zzso zzso zzso also enhances the expression of both zzso and zzso on tumor zzso zzso This expression results in enhanced zzso cell interactions and increased zzso zzso into zzso zzso combining intramuscular zzso gene transfer with zzso zzso gene therapies significantly improves the zzso effects of zzso by markedly increasing the levels of zzso zzso This combined treatment increased the levels of zzso zzso to those achieved using four times the zzso zzso The combined therapy also resulted in lower levels of zzso molecules and higher levels of activated zzso in the tumor zzso than zzso zzso In conclusion, this study describes a new zzso mechanism of zzso that involves the zzso of tumor zzso zzso molecules and the enhanced zzso of zzso zzso Thus, zzso treatment can make tumor cells more vulnerable to zzso and improve the therapeutic efficacy of zzso
