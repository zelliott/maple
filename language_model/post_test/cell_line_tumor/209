The zzso and zzso sequence 1 zzso gene encodes a small protein that is highly zzso among zzso zzso expression is zzso in zzso neural zzso including the zzso adult zzso facial motor nerve and zzso retinal zzso zzso cells of the Japanese zzso It is also expressed in numerous zzso during embryonic development as well as in regions of the adult brain that exhibit high zzso zzso has also been reported as a marker for human zzso zzso and it is expressed in high-grade human zzso This study was directed toward understanding the function of zzso in a zzso melanoma cell zzso zzso zzso and protein were identified in zzso cells and in tumors formed from these zzso zzso of zzso protein expression with zzso increased zzso zzso cells expressed higher levels of the zzso proteins zzso and zzso and an increased interaction between zzso and zzso The in zzso cell growth rate of zzso cells was significantly reduced due to zzso cell cycle zzso This was consistent with a reduction in the zzso of zzso protein as well as lower levels of zzso and increased expression of zzso zzso expression of zzso the zzso for zzso growth factor, was also detected in the zzso cells, however zzso stimulation of zzso was zzso zzso depletion also led to increased zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso was zzso Moreover, zzso cells had reduced expression of zzso factors zzso and zzso and increased expression of zzso These data, coupled with reports on zzso expression in zzso and development, suggest that zzso functions as a zzso of differentiation in cells undergoing repair or zzso
