To develop a drug delivery system zzso it is critical to address challenging tasks such as the delivery of zzso and zzso compounds, cell zzso and the zzso fate of the drug delivery zzso zzso zzso zzso has been acknowledged as the human serum zzso of zzso abundant zzso such as cholesterol, zzso and zzso zzso B zzso zzso is the only protein contained in LDL, and possesses a binding zzso for the LDL zzso that can be zzso and zzso naturally by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could be an excellent delivery carrier for zzso or zzso zzso Here, we zzso zzso in zzso using full-length zzso through a zzso zzso exchange method, and addressed its potential as a zzso Our zzso exhibited good zzso when evaluated with zzso and cell zzso response zzso and was stable during storage in zzso saline at 4 zzso for several zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso iron oxide zzso zzso and the zzso drug zzso zzso zzso zzso used as an imaging zzso and zzso drug model, respectively, were incorporated into the zzso leading to the formation of zzso and zzso containing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso transform infrared zzso suggested that zzso has a similar composition to that of LDL, and successfully incorporated zzso or zzso zzso presented significant zzso contrast enhancement in zzso magnetic resonance imaging in zzso mice, suggesting its potential application as a medical imaging contrast zzso zzso could reduce the viability of the cancer cell line zzso Interestingly, we developed zzso high-resolution transmission electron zzso to observe both LDL and zzso in the liquid zzso In zzso our zzso zzso zzso has significant potential as a novel zzso for zzso and zzso materials, with good cell zzso properties and zzso
