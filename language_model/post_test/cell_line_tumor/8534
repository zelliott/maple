zzso zzso a zzso cancer in zzso is highly zzso and has high mortality zzso zzso resistance or the ability of cells to survive after detachment from zzso zzso is a necessary property of zzso zzso Here, we report differential protein expression of an zzso zzso cell line culture, under attachment conditions compared to zzso conditions, studied using zzso coupled with protein identification by zzso Our data reveal the deregulation of proteins involved in stress response, zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso protein was intensely zzso in detached zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis confirmed that only the zzso zzso was the most abundant transcript among zzso genes in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso expression by small interfering zzso in zzso cells resulted in significantly increased percentage of cell death in detached zzso Our findings provide the first evidence showing that zzso protein plays a crucial role in zzso resistance of zzso zzso zzso zzso might be a potential target in zzso zzso
