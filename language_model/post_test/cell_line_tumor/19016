We previously showed that introduction of a normal, zzso human zzso 8 reduced the zzso capacity of zzso rat liver cancer cell line, which had high zzso potential without affecting zzso suggesting the presence of one or more zzso zzso genes zzso on human zzso zzso We proceeded to define further the region harboring the zzso zzso zzso and to determine the random loss of human zzso 8 by zzso amplification of sequence tag site zzso zzso 

The national Center for Biotechnology Information zzso databases were used as references of the relative genetic distances of the zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA and zzso zzso DNA were used as negative and positive controls for zzso 8 amplification, zzso zzso DNA was isolated and zzso from cultured hybrid clones zzso and zzso zzso hybrid clones served as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso hybrid clones served as zzso suppressed zzso zzso products were separated by zzso through zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso hybrid clones zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso markers between zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso clones zzso and zzso lacked several markers in this zzso In attempts to refine the region retained in the zzso suppressed zzso more densely spaced zzso markers in the human zzso zzso were zzso We found that the zzso clones retained zzso region between zzso and zzso zzso where as the zzso clones lacked the zzso 

Our results suggest that a zzso zzso gene is located within the zzso between zzso and zzso on human zzso zzso
