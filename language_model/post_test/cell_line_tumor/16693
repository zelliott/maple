zzso of the breast, zzso zzso and zzso are the most prevalent zzso in women zzso zzso play a key role in tumor cell invasion and zzso by digesting the basement membrane and zzso zzso Strong clinical and experimental evidence demonstrates association of elevated levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with cancer zzso zzso and shortened patient zzso zzso activities are regulated by specific tissue zzso of zzso zzso Our main objective was to study the effect of a zzso mixture zzso on the activity of zzso zzso and zzso in human breast, zzso zzso and zzso cancer cell zzso Human breast zzso and zzso cervical zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cancer cell lines were cultured in their respective media and treated at zzso with zzso at 0, 50, 100, zzso 500 and 1000 zzso Analysis of zzso activity was carried out by zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso by reverse zzso Both breast and zzso cancer cell lines expressed zzso which was inhibited by zzso in a zzso zzso However, no bands corresponding to zzso were detected for zzso and zzso cell zzso On zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed one band corresponding to zzso zzso showed two bands, an intense band corresponding to zzso and a faint band corresponding to zzso zzso showed zzso zzso and zzso showed a band corresponding to zzso zzso inhibited their expression in all cell zzso The activity of zzso was zzso in all cancer cell lines in a zzso zzso Analysis revealed a positive correlation between zzso and zzso and a negative correlation between zzso and zzso These findings suggest the therapeutic potential of zzso in the treatment of female zzso
