The zzso zzso factor has been shown to zzso zzso of the universal cell cycle inhibitor zzso zzso In examining the mechanism of zzso repression, we have identified a zzso complex at the zzso promoter containing zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso 4 of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We demonstrated that while zzso and zzso can zzso the zzso promoter zzso zzso acts as a zzso dependent on the other two zzso All three factors collaborate for optimal zzso repression, which requires the zzso binding site at zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso led to increased zzso at the zzso promoter and full induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso and zzso associate with distinct zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso acids zzso are required for zzso and zzso zzso zzso of all three proteins resulted in forced zzso entry and zzso of checkpoint zzso even in the presence of chemotherapy zzso Since each protein has been linked to poor prognosis in breast cancer, our findings suggest that the zzso complex promotes cell cycle progression via direct zzso repression, thereby contributing to zzso and therapy zzso
