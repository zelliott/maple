In this study, we characterize the molecular and functional features of a novel protein called zzso zzso zzso expression was previously reported to be highest in highly zzso zzso and increased in a subset of zzso zzso patients, which statistically correlated with poor prognosis and residual zzso These observations implied that zzso might play a role in cellular proliferation and zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso protein is zzso primarily zzso associated and its expression as well as zzso are regulated throughout the cell zzso zzso is zzso regulated during zzso with increased expression levels and zzso zzso to zzso zzso indicating a functional role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso with this zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments resulted in defects in zzso zzso zzso alignment and zzso sister zzso zzso Finally, we have been able to show, using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso expression levels zzso influence the degree of zzso zzso zzso our findings show that zzso zzso zzso structure and that tight regulation of its expression levels and zzso zzso during zzso are crucial for proper zzso zzso and cell zzso
