zzso of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso exerts a major role in reducing the effectiveness of zzso therapy in zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso has been shown to be instrumental in the establishment of zzso resistance zzso in human tumor zzso The zzso zzso zzso exerts a pivotal role in maintaining the functional connection between zzso and zzso We investigated the role of zzso in a human zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso and compared it to its counterpart that zzso an zzso deletion zzso The results showed that zzso binds at zzso acid zzso zzso of the zzso domain of zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso occurs in the plasma membrane of zzso cells, where they also zzso with the zzso zzso located in zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso deletion zzso entirely restored drug zzso of zzso cells, consistent with zzso dislocation to zzso compartments and zzso of zzso zzso zzso at the plasma zzso Our study provides evidence that zzso exerts a key role in zzso of human zzso cells through a zzso connection that is instrumental for the zzso of zzso into plasma membrane zzso zzso We also show for the first time that zzso site is localized to zzso acid zzso zzso of the zzso Band zzso zzso zzso domain, thus proposing a specific target for future molecular therapy aimed at zzso zzso in zzso zzso
