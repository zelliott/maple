zzso zzso is a pathological zzso that is widespread in colon cancer, and usually accompanies the onset and progression of the zzso To date, the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso zzso remain largely zzso In this study, we identify zzso and zzso zzso in the gene zzso for zzso zzso 12 zzso in individuals with colon zzso zzso analyses demonstrate that each of the 8 zzso zzso identified zzso the normal function of the zzso zzso in initiating zzso type zzso protein zzso Two of these zzso zzso zzso were identified as acquired zzso zzso in a set of 30 zzso stable colon zzso Relative to background gene zzso rates, finding these zzso zzso zzso was statistically significant at P zzso zzso Six additional zzso zzso zzso were detected as zzso changes carried by patients with colon zzso however, no zzso zzso were detected among zzso controls zzso zzso zzso zzso in 3 of the 6 individuals harboring zzso zzso zzso zzso both a colon cancer and a second independent zzso cancer had zzso These findings suggest that genetic defects in the zzso zzso in part zzso zzso zzso in colon zzso and they contribute to the development of a subset of these zzso
