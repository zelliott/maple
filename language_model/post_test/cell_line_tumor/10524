zzso zzso binding domain protein 2 zzso has been shown to bind to and mediate repression of zzso tumor zzso genes in cancer cells, where zzso of zzso zzso and associated gene zzso is zzso We have investigated the role of zzso in breast cancer cell growth and tumor zzso gene zzso We show that stable short hairpin zzso zzso zzso of zzso leads to growth suppression of cultured human zzso zzso cancer lines, zzso zzso and zzso The peak zzso occurs only after zzso stable zzso zzso Once established, the growth zzso persists over time and leads to a markedly decreased propensity for aggressive breast cancer cell lines to form in zzso zzso tumors in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The growth effects of zzso zzso are accompanied by zzso of tumor zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequencing show zzso binding directly to the zzso zzso and zzso promoters of both zzso and zzso zzso the promoter zzso zzso zzso of these genes remained stable despite robust zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso protein resulted in restoration of growth and zzso of the zzso tumor zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso zzso from repressive zzso zzso and zzso modifications by removing zzso is sufficient to initiate and maintain tumor zzso gene zzso and suppress zzso cell zzso These results show a role for zzso in cancer progression and provide support for the prospect of targeting zzso zzso in aggressive breast zzso
