zzso express zzso which is crucial for the development of the zzso lineage and is zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso with the expression of zzso being zzso We tested here a direct repression of the zzso zzso promoter by zzso and its zzso We found that the extreme zzso and zzso region 1 are required for zzso In contrast, the motif in zzso region 2 zzso zzso as well as zzso acids zzso at the zzso are not zzso As these two later motifs mediate zzso binding to the zzso protein or to the zzso zzso zzso respectively, and are important for transformation by zzso in cooperation with other zzso the results suggest that the zzso zzso can still efficiently repress the zzso zzso The zzso binding zzso promoter had lower activity, but was also zzso by the same zzso zzso in human melanoma zzso The zzso protein is known to also exert an zzso activity, which is associated with its zzso repression function and the ability to induce zzso and is a potential zzso zzso Since recent data suggest that zzso may be a survival factor for melanoma cells, the zzso zzso described here might constitute a good targeting agent for zzso zzso
