Previous experiments have shown that zzso or zzso treatment suppresses growth of head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso To study the potential cooperative effect of both agents, two zzso cell lines were treated with zzso or zzso alone or in zzso In zzso studies consisted of intravenous tail vein injection of zzso zzso with zzso zzso into nude mice growing zzso zzso zzso Introduction of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso showed a significant zzso effect compared with treatment with either agent zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso occurred in zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso showed expression of zzso in the nucleus of the cell zzso zzso zzso zzso on DNA isolated from zzso zzso samples showed zzso amplification of zzso promoter zzso a binding site of zzso indicating an interaction between zzso and zzso zzso inhibited zzso in the zzso and nucleus, leading to reduced zzso activity, with no effect on zzso In zzso studies showed significant growth zzso of zzso tumors treated with a combination of zzso zzso and zzso The zzso effect of zzso was zzso through zzso of zzso and nuclear zzso resulting in zzso of zzso zzso zzso treatment led to cellular zzso indicating an effect zzso by zzso zzso The mechanisms of the two agents through different growth signaling pathways suggest potential for the clinical use of zzso doses of zzso in combination with zzso which will allow effective suppression of tumor growth while minimizing the toxic side effects of zzso
