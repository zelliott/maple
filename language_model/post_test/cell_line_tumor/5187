zzso zzso zzso is a zzso disease caused by zzso in the zzso zzso zzso is clinically characterized by pancreatic zzso skeletal abnormalities and bone zzso zzso The zzso abnormalities include zzso zzso zzso zzso and an increased risk of developing Acute zzso zzso zzso Although several studies have suggested that zzso as a protein plays a role in zzso zzso its impact on human zzso development and function remains to be zzso 

We observed that zzso zzso and protein are expressed in the human zzso leukemia zzso cell line and in human zzso zzso cells by quantitative zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso expression is zzso during zzso zzso Additionally, we observed that the differentiation and proliferation capacity of zzso bone zzso zzso zzso cells in a liquid differentiation system was reduced as compared to control zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso with the zzso zzso and in zzso binding studies reveal a direct interaction of zzso with zzso In zzso cells a zzso enrichment of zzso protein which zzso with the zzso organizing center zzso was zzso Also, we observed that zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso proteins could zzso with the zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso with the zzso zzso suggesting a role for zzso in the cell division process, which zzso to the decreased proliferation capacity of zzso bone zzso zzso zzso zzso cells in our culture system and also to the zzso in zzso zzso A role in zzso zzso has not been zzso since similar spatial and zzso zzso is observed when zzso zzso zzso proteins are zzso Thus, the increased risk of zzso zzso in zzso remains zzso
