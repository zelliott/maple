Acute phase proteins zzso are predominantly zzso in the liver and play an important role in restoring zzso In the present study, we set out to answer two questions using zzso zzso induced from pancreatic cells as a model for studying the acute phase zzso zzso do zzso zzso express acute phase proteins following culture with zzso and zzso zzso what is the molecular basis of the induction of acute phase proteins in zzso zzso zzso zzso was induced in zzso mouse embryonic zzso or the pancreatic cell line zzso zzso by culture with zzso We found that acute phase proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso were induced in both systems following culture with zzso The combined treatment of zzso and zzso M zzso enhanced the expression of the acute phase proteins in zzso cells and the mechanism of the zzso by the zzso is probably zzso by zzso of zzso and zzso In addition, zzso expression of either zzso or zzso in zzso cells induced zzso expression and culture with zzso M was sufficient to enhance the expression of zzso in zzso zzso cells from zzso to zzso The results of the present study indicate zzso zzso have the potential to be a useful model to study liver function in zzso
