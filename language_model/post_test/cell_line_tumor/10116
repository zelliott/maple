An elevated zzso activity contributes to zzso particularly by providing cancer cells with zzso protection and efficient clearance from irregular zzso Still, the underlying mechanisms are poorly zzso In this study, we report that in colon cancer patients, higher zzso activity was detected in zzso tissue compared with surrounding normal zzso and also that increased levels of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso could be zzso zzso tumors showed higher nuclear levels of nuclear factor zzso factor 2 zzso a zzso factor supposed to be involved in the control of zzso zzso protein zzso The induction or zzso of zzso led to stronger zzso and zzso expression in the human colon cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso as well as in zzso zzso along with higher zzso zzso The small interfering zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso and zzso expression and reduced zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso and zzso expression zzso protection from tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an effect preceded by an increased nuclear factor zzso zzso and higher expression of zzso zzso target zzso These findings point to an important role of zzso in the gain of zzso activity, thereby contributing to zzso zzso zzso may therefore serve as a potential target in zzso zzso
