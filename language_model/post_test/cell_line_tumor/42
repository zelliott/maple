The zzso zzso zzso expression is correlated with the degree of zzso in cell zzso zzso it has never been directed involved in breast cancer patients zzso The aim of this study was to determine whether zzso expression could be used as predictor of zzso and zzso 

In a cohort of patients with zzso zzso zzso studied zzso since 1996 and until 2007, zzso zzso was assessed by zzso zzso and flow zzso zzso and log rank tests were used to determine whether there was a statistical association between zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis was performed including zzso stage, zzso and zzso status to evaluate zzso as an independent zzso zzso 

Follow up was 95 months zzso zzso zzso We zzso zzso in a cohort of patients composed of 136 zzso we found zzso expression zzso by zzso was selectively associated with high grade patients zzso cases of the study zzso P zzso zzso zzso of 50 zzso patients zzso zzso and 23 of these zzso developed zzso zzso stage, zzso and zzso zzso were robustly correlated zzso regression, P zzso zzso P zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso zzso of the 50 patients zzso expressed both receptors zzso and zzso P zzso zzso We also found a statistically significant correlation between zzso zzso and increased mortality zzso zzso zzso and development of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our data suggest zzso zzso may be involved in the development of zzso in breast cancer patient and is associated with zzso cellular progression of the zzso Further studies are needed to understand zzso mechanism of action and in a near future zzso its potential use as risk factor for zzso development in high grade breast cancer zzso
