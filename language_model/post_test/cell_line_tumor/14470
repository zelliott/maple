zzso targeted agents for cancer therapy are recognized as being effective and are gaining in zzso However, the efficacy of the agents depends on the status of the targeted zzso such as the number of molecules zzso activity, and zzso zzso the use of companion zzso for investigating the status of the targeted zzso prior to therapy is highly zzso We developed a simple and cost-effective zzso zzso detection method called the zzso resonance energy zzso preferential zzso formation zzso zzso By using zzso labeled DNA and zzso measurement with zzso control, this method provides higher zzso easier zzso less risk for contamination, shorter zzso time zzso zzso and less cost compared with conventional zzso Here we report the evaluation of zzso on the detection of zzso zzso zzso in zzso 12 and 13 compared with the zzso clinical zzso zzso We found that zzso detected zzso zzso zzso from all cell line DNA zzso zzso
