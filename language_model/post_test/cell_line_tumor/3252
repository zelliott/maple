In an zzso system using a human zzso reporter constructed with the promoter zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso regions including zzso repeat separated by six zzso zzso and direct repeat separated by three zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso was detected without zzso of any nuclear receptors in zzso zzso zzso zzso of human zzso X zzso zzso enhanced the zzso zzso zzso reporter constructed with the promoter region zzso zzso to zzso zzso including both zzso and zzso motifs was, however, not zzso in zzso cells, even after zzso of zzso Although zzso of zzso X zzso alpha zzso had no clear effect for both zzso reporters, zzso of zzso zzso regulatory zzso zzso with zzso resulted in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso A truncated zzso reporter retaining the both motifs showed the zzso zzso by zzso of zzso and zzso while the zzso in zzso cells was not zzso These results support the idea that a nuclear zzso other than zzso may play a role in the zzso zzso together with zzso The present study also suggests the involvement of a novel zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
