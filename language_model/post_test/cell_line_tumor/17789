Recent studies exhibit that zzso zzso decreases zzso activity in breast and zzso zzso The effect of synthetic zzso zzso on zzso and expression was examined in three breast cancer cell zzso Most derivatives did not decrease cellular zzso zzso Two of the zzso even zzso zzso activity at the zzso zzso Only one zzso significantly decreased zzso in all three breast cancer cell lines and also suppressed zzso gene expression in one of the cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rule out the possibility that this compound directly zzso the zzso zzso A zzso mechanism in suppression of cellular zzso activity of this compound is zzso
