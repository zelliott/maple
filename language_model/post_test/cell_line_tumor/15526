Considering the similarities between the zzso programming involved in cancer progression and zzso cell zzso we tried to identify drugs that would be effective against zzso zzso We used the early zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso system to select human prostate cancer zzso cells expressing high levels of zzso Patients with zzso zzso zzso that does not respond to treatment with zzso have few therapeutic zzso The zzso zzso cells selected using the zzso system showed increased zzso and high resistance to zzso both in zzso and in zzso By using their gene expression data, expression zzso prediction for compound candidates identified an zzso drug, zzso as a conversion zzso from drug resistance to zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso decreased their resistance against treatment with zzso This indicated that zzso reversed the gene zzso including that of zzso factors, in the zzso zzso cells selected using the zzso zzso zzso zzso increased the efficacy of zzso for cancer zzso We propose a novel cell zzso approach, named drug efficacy zzso as a new model for identifying candidate zzso zzso
