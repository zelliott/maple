zzso peripheral nerve sheath tumors zzso are invasive peripheral nerve zzso that express both the zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso growth factor zzso The combined expression of these proteins has been implicated in tumor cell growth and zzso However, zzso zzso activity requires the presence of a zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and, in some cells, the zzso zzso zzso Here, we found that zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in zzso but their zzso did not correlate with increased cell zzso The zzso zzso cell line also expresses all of these zzso can convert zzso to active zzso and exhibits zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity or expression zzso the invasive behavior of these cells but not their zzso Interestingly, although a zzso zzso zzso contributes to zzso cell invasion and interacts with zzso and zzso in zzso cells, it is not required for zzso zzso These data indicate that an zzso zzso loop can promote zzso invasion through a zzso mechanism and suggest that zzso zzso and zzso are potential molecular targets to inhibit zzso zzso
