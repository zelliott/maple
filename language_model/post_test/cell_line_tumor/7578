zzso is one of the most lethal and prevalent zzso human brain tumors, with aggressive proliferation and highly invasive zzso There is still no effective cure for patients with zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso can cross the zzso barrier zzso and the zzso fluid barrier zzso making it a strong candidate for an effective drug for the treatment of brain tumors, including zzso In our previous study, we demonstrated that zzso effectively induced zzso cell death in zzso zzso poses the largest problem to cancer treatment and is the primary cause of death in cancer zzso Thus, in this study, we investigated the effect of zzso on the cell invasion process of zzso human zzso cells through brain zzso zzso cells zzso and its possible zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso expression in zzso and zzso of zzso to zzso Moreover, zzso effectively blocked zzso invasion through zzso zzso zzso Increased zzso of zzso and membrane zzso by zzso were suppressed by zzso in zzso Furthermore, we investigated the effect of zzso on the zzso transition zzso in zzso zzso zzso reduced the expression levels of zzso zzso and zzso which are zzso zzso but increased zzso an zzso zzso In conclusion, these results suggest that zzso zzso zzso by targeting the interaction between zzso and zzso regulating the zzso of zzso to zzso by zzso zzso and regulating the invasion of zzso through zzso by reducing membrane zzso and zzso processes of zzso zzso
