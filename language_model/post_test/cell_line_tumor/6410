zzso cells exhibit an altered metabolism characterized by elevated zzso zzso and zzso zzso which is supported by an increase in zzso transport and zzso We hypothesized that reducing or eliminating the expression of the most prominently expressed zzso zzso would decrease the amount of zzso available to breast cancer cells thereby decreasing their zzso capacity and zzso zzso the 12 zzso family zzso zzso expressed in mice, zzso was the most abundantly expressed at the zzso level in the mouse zzso tumors from zzso mice and cell lines zzso zzso zzso expression in mouse zzso tumor cell lines using zzso or zzso technology reduced zzso zzso zzso consumption, zzso zzso and zzso synthesis in zzso without altering the concentration of zzso as well as reduced growth on plastic and in soft zzso The growth of tumor cells with reduced zzso expression was impaired when transplanted into the zzso fat pad of zzso nude mice in zzso zzso of zzso in a cell line with low levels of zzso zzso increased zzso transport in zzso and enhanced growth in nude mice in zzso as compared to the control cells with very low levels of zzso studies demonstrate that zzso is the major zzso zzso in mouse zzso zzso models zzso zzso or zzso and that zzso of the level of zzso has an effect upon the growth of mouse zzso tumor cell lines in zzso
