The zzso zzso gene codes for a DNA zzso that contributes to zzso stability and has been identified as the gene responsible for zzso Recent studies have shown reduced zzso expression due to zzso DNA zzso in cancer zzso Furthermore, zzso expression is thought to affect sensitivity to DNA zzso I zzso in cancer zzso In this study, we examined the relationship between zzso DNA zzso of zzso and the sensitivity of cervical cancer cells to zzso zzso DNA was extracted from samples from 22 patients with primary cervical cancer and 6 human cervical zzso cell zzso zzso DNA zzso was analyzed by zzso zzso zzso expression in cultured cells before and after addition of zzso a zzso agent, was examined using zzso The sensitivity of cells to zzso drugs was determined using a collagen gel zzso embedded culture drug sensitivity test zzso zzso against zzso was zzso into a cervical zzso cell line with high zzso zzso Changes in drug sensitivity after zzso zzso were determined by zzso zzso DNA zzso and decreased expression of zzso were detected in zzso cases of primary cervical cancer and in two cervical zzso cell zzso These two cell lines showed high sensitivity to zzso a zzso I zzso but became resistant to zzso after treatment with zzso zzso of zzso against zzso increased the sensitivity of the cells to zzso zzso DNA zzso of zzso also increased the sensitivity of cervical cancer cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso of this gene may be a zzso for selection of drugs for the treatment of cervical zzso This is the first report to show a relationship between the zzso of the zzso gene and sensitivity to zzso in zzso zzso
