zzso zzso plays important roles in zzso and the zzso zzso increases risk for Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso peptides are biologically active and may be produced in the zzso It is unclear if zzso zzso is dependent on zzso or zzso status and this was addressed zzso zzso frontal cortex, zzso lobe and zzso samples were zzso into zzso that were soluble in zzso saline zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso for zzso fragmentation by Western zzso zzso zzso of zzso was detected as fragments and this was predominantly as a 25 zzso zzso in zzso zzso The concentration of zzso zzso fragments was two- to zzso higher in zzso compared to zzso zzso This difference was observed in all areas of the brain examined and was not related to zzso zzso zzso treatment generated zzso fragments that were very similar to those detected in brain, however, no zzso zzso differences in zzso to zzso zzso were zzso This indicates that zzso processing of zzso to form soluble fragments in the human brain is dependent on zzso zzso but not zzso zzso
