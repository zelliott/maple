zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an insidious zzso cancer with the propensity to recur and zzso to distant zzso zzso breast zzso zzso is a molecular zzso that constitutes zzso of breast zzso shares zzso similarities and zzso cell markers with zzso lacks expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso and, similar to zzso zzso predominantly to the lung and zzso Both zzso lack targeted therapies zzso to poor understanding of their molecular zzso 

Gene expression zzso zzso zzso western zzso zzso and in zzso analysis of massive cancer data sets were used to identify novel markers and potential therapeutic targets for zzso and zzso For the detection and comparison of gene signatures, we performed zzso analysis using a recently developed zzso zzso zzso tool for zzso and rank zzso 

In zzso and BBC we identified characteristic and overlapping zzso gene signatures that contained a large set of novel potential molecular zzso zzso was validated as a sensitive diagnostic marker for both zzso and its expression was linked to normal and zzso zzso zzso In zzso BBC, and melanoma zzso zzso expression strongly zzso with the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso In zzso and breast zzso zzso expression zzso correlated with zzso a cell identity marker and major regulator of the zzso breast zzso zzso significance of several zzso elements of the zzso signature zzso zzso zzso and zzso was validated on BBC cell zzso 

zzso expression in zzso and BBC appears to be a part of a highly coordinated zzso zzso characteristic for zzso with zzso zzso zzso between zzso and other zzso such as zzso zzso reveals potential molecular markers specific for these zzso that are likely linked to their cell zzso zzso as a novel diagnostic marker for zzso and BBC provides important molecular insight into their molecular zzso and cell zzso Given that zzso was recently described as a principal driver of zzso identification of zzso elements of the zzso signatures may help in better understanding of zzso zzso and development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic zzso
