zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso factors, is an essential process for cancer development and zzso zzso is identified as an zzso cell zzso zzso and implicated in blood vessel formation, however, its exact role in zzso particularly tumor zzso and its potential function of zzso downstream signaling are still zzso In present study, we evidenced that zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso significantly impaired zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso was required for the zzso of zzso zzso signaling cascade and zzso of zzso zzso downstream zzso zzso notably zzso zzso and zzso in response to tumor zzso Interestingly, specific zzso zzso zzso which bound a zzso zzso depending on zzso zzso bond, could abrogate zzso zzso zzso and tumor zzso whereas another zzso zzso zzso recognizing a linear zzso containing zzso did not have such zzso Further zzso analysis identified that zzso zzso bond within the fifth zzso zzso domain was zzso for zzso signaling and tube zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso which was enhanced by tumor zzso and suppressed by zzso but not zzso also relied on zzso and zzso Together, this study for the first time uncovered the zzso role of zzso and also zzso the key structural basis responsible for its signaling function and zzso These findings also suggested that zzso might serve as not just a cell zzso zzso but also a membrane signal zzso in zzso zzso
