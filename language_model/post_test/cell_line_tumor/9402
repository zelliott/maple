In this study, the effect of zzso on zzso replication was observed in a cell culture model, zzso zzso cell line, which supports human zzso zzso replication and zzso zzso of the study was to investigate effects of zzso zzso hairpin zzso targeting zzso B virus zzso on the viral replication in zzso zzso zzso We selected three target zzso zzso regions with different putative secondary structures to test whether the secondary structure of zzso may affect the zzso efficacy on the target zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso interfering zzso were designed targeting X zzso Core zzso and S zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso and zzso targeting zzso core and X region, respectively or a mock zzso targeting zzso zzso The culture media was collected throughout six days after zzso and analyzed by real-time zzso zzso DNA production was suppressed for 7 zzso The zzso DNA levels were decreased by 73, 72 and zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso designed for X, core and S regions, specifically and significantly suppressed zzso zzso zzso potentially may be used in treatment of zzso zzso
