To explore the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso on the biological characteristics of human cervical zzso zzso cell lines zzso in zzso and in zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting zzso were zzso and zzso into cervical cancer cells in zzso zzso of zzso in zzso after zzso was detected by real-time zzso The cell proliferation was evaluated by zzso zzso and colony formation zzso The cell zzso was analyzed by zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso on tumor growth was evaluated by tumor growth zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to document zzso changes and zzso zzso zzso was to detect the zzso zzso 

After the zzso of zzso zzso the expression of zzso decreased along with an obvious growth zzso compared with that of the control groups zzso zzso zzso Colony formation of both cell lines was markedly inhibited with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as compared with that in the negative group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso expression significantly enhanced the cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso rates of zzso zzso group, and negative control groups were zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso marker zzso decreased significantly zzso vs zzso in the zzso group compared with negative control zzso zzso dead tumor cells were seen in the zzso zzso cells along with a marked increase of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso effectively suppresses the growth of cervical zzso zzso cells both in zzso and in zzso through an induction of zzso
