zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso imaging technique which has recently been validated for the assessment of therapy response in patients with aggressive zzso zzso Our objective was to determine its value for the evaluation of zzso efficacy in zzso zzso mice injected with the zzso zzso B zzso cell zzso The high level of in zzso zzso zzso by zzso cells validated the model for further imaging zzso When injected zzso the zzso developed as zzso zzso mostly in liver and zzso thus mimicking the natural course of an aggressive human zzso zzso provided three-dimensional images of zzso extension including zzso zzso in good correlation with ex zzso zzso zzso When mice were zzso with an zzso cell zzso in zzso before zzso challenge, their significantly longer survival, compared to control mice, were associated with a lower zzso of zzso zzso by PET at different time zzso zzso of zzso growth and metabolism using the calculated zzso volumes and maximum standardized zzso values, respectively, also demonstrated delayed zzso development and lower activity in the vaccinated zzso Thus, zzso is a sensitive tool relevant for early detection and follow-up of internal zzso allowing discrimination between treated and zzso small animal zzso without invasive zzso
