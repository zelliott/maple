zzso zzso is potent inhibitor of zzso signaling zzso and has zzso activity in a variety of cancer including B cell zzso However, other molecular targets of zzso beyond the zzso zzso are not fully zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and primary zzso cells were treated with zzso as zzso zzso was measured using flow zzso for zzso of zzso phase cells zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Cell cycle was analyzed by zzso for DNA content of zzso and zzso zzso Changes in zzso and protein expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected by Western zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were knocked out using zzso zzso zzso expression was determined by zzso and protein levels by zzso and western zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to determine zzso binding to the zzso DNA binding zzso 

zzso we show that zzso activates zzso zzso zzso zzso and increases both the expression and zzso zzso of zzso protein in the B zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso zzso also activated zzso zzso and zzso zzso albeit at lower levels than zzso zzso zzso of the zzso signaling zzso failed to effect cell cycle arrest or zzso induced by zzso but zzso zzso induced zzso expression in these leukemia zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to zzso zzso of many zzso Treatment of zzso zzso and zzso cells with zzso lead to an increase of zzso zzso Growth Factor zzso at both the zzso and protein zzso zzso of zzso expression and zzso of zzso zzso significantly blocked zzso induced zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso reduced zzso induced zzso 

Taken together, our data demonstrates that zzso activates the zzso signaling zzso independent of zzso and cell cycle arrest, leading to increased zzso zzso
