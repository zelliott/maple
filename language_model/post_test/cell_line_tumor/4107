Based on previous zzso studies on zzso and zzso acid hybrid zzso we have zzso a series of aromatic zzso zzso zzso zzso and evaluated them for their in zzso growth zzso and zzso against a panel of 60 human tumor cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified as highly potent zzso compounds against zzso zzso and breast cancer cell lines with zzso values in low the zzso zzso The zzso analog zzso was the most active compound with zzso values of 20 zzso and 40 zzso against zzso zzso cancer cells and zzso breast cancer cells, zzso Two other zzso zzso (the zzso zzso and zzso (the zzso zzso exhibited zzso potency against zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso (the zzso zzso exhibited a zzso value of 40 zzso against zzso cancer cell line zzso These results suggest that aromatic zzso zzso zzso acid hybrids may have potential for development as clinical candidates to treat a variety of solid zzso
