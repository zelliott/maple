zzso studies have revealed that breast cancer consists of a complex biological process with zzso genetic variations, revealing the need for individualized cancer diagnostic testing and selection of zzso optimal zzso One of the bottlenecks in translation of zzso breakthroughs to the clinic is the lack of functional zzso zzso that have high clinical zzso zzso three-dimensional zzso growth zzso are considered to be the zzso for zzso testing, and leads identified with these zzso have high probability of clinical zzso The Cancer zzso System zzso allows for the simultaneous, zzso and real time evaluation of multitudes of zzso breast cancer cell growth zzso We employed a Test Cancer zzso that contains zzso zzso zzso targeting zzso genes to identify zzso zzso of breast cancer cell zzso We compared the effect of these zzso on colony growth of the hormone zzso positive zzso and Human zzso Growth Factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso positive zzso cells on the Test Cancer zzso Our results confirmed zzso zzso of zzso and zzso colony formation by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both cell lines were also suppressed by zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, we have observed responses to zzso that are unique to this zzso zzso For example, zzso zzso zzso suppressed colony growth in both cell types while zzso zzso zzso zzso caused opposite zzso These results further validate the importance of the zzso as a tool for the identification of clinically relevant breast cancer zzso
