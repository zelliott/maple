zzso stress plays an important role in the pathological processes of various neurodegenerative zzso zzso K, a zzso isolated from the zzso of zzso zzso possesses potent zzso zzso In this study, we investigate the zzso effects of zzso K on hydrogen zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso for 24 h induced cell death measured with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed that the reduced cell viability by zzso was due to zzso In addition, zzso increased the expression of zzso zzso zzso of zzso which could be reversed by zzso with zzso zzso zzso with zzso K attenuated zzso cell death in a zzso zzso zzso effect of zzso K was abolished by zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso had no effect on zzso zzso protection against zzso zzso Western zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso K increased both zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso K by zzso of zzso and zzso signal pathways protects zzso cells from zzso zzso
