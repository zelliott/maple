zzso zzso a zzso adhesive zzso has been shown to zzso tumor zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our studies suggested that the balance between zzso and tissue zzso of zzso zzso is a key zzso in tumor cell zzso We now report that zzso zzso zzso expression in both human breast and prostate cancer cell zzso The effect of zzso on zzso expression was examined in human breast zzso cell lines zzso and human prostate cancer cell lines zzso and zzso treated with zzso zzso zzso expression was also examined in zzso zzso zzso breast cancer cell line zzso Northern and western zzso analysis revealed zzso zzso and zzso protein expression increased with increasing zzso of zzso This effect was inhibited by zzso against the type I repeat domain of zzso further suggesting that zzso mediates zzso zzso zzso of zzso induced zzso levels increased tumor cell zzso We conclude that zzso is involved in influencing the critical balance between zzso and their zzso maintaining the controlled degradation of the zzso zzso needed to support zzso and our results may provide an explanation for the divergent activities reported for zzso in tumor zzso
