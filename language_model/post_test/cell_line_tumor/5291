We report a novel strategy to engineer and express stable and soluble human zzso zzso fusion zzso The procedure is based on the use of a central skeleton of zzso a small and very soluble zzso linked zzso protein that is very resistant to zzso zzso and to pH zzso Using a human zzso zzso zzso specific for the zzso marker domain B of zzso zzso 2, and an zzso able to neutralize tumor necrosis zzso we expressed various biologically active zzso fusion zzso The results demonstrate the possibility to generate zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and dual specificity zzso zzso Furthermore, compared with similar fusion proteins in which zzso was not used, the use of zzso improved properties of zzso and zzso Indeed, in the reported cases it was possible to vacuum dry and zzso the proteins without any zzso or loss in protein and biological zzso
