This paper presents a novel microchip with zzso zzso zzso membrane for the study of zzso drug effect of zzso acid zzso on human zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer cells in zzso with zzso zzso The zzso experiments with zzso M zzso acid zzso were explored for the study of zzso drug effects on zzso cancer zzso The zzso was monitored in the time domain at zzso zzso After addition of zzso M zzso to the cell zzso the zzso magnitude decreased with time from the value with zzso cell layer and returned to the initial base line after around zzso The zzso experiments testified that this zzso decrease was due to the cell zzso change induced by zzso
