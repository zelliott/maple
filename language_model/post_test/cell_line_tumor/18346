The results presented here demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in the human breast cancer cell line zzso Two approaches were used to alter the activity of zzso in the zzso In the first approach, stable zzso expressing an zzso zzso were zzso In the stable zzso expression of zzso zzso resulted in a decrease in the expression of zzso alpha zzso In the second approach, zzso cells were zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso of zzso increased the amount of zzso zzso To determine whether the effects of zzso on the expression of zzso alpha were due to changes in transcription, deletion zzso of the zzso alpha promoter were zzso This experimental approach demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso alpha gene expression by increasing zzso of the gene through elements located upstream of promoter zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso further demonstrated that the zzso increase in zzso alpha gene zzso was not dependent on the ability of zzso to bind to DNA but on its ability to interact with other zzso
