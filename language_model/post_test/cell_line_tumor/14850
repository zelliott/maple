zzso zzso cells zzso display inherent zzso properties that can be exploited for targeted delivery of therapeutic genes to invasive zzso in the central nervous zzso zzso transplantation efficiency will be essential for developing relevant zzso brain tumor zzso To date, the real-world issue of handling and zzso zzso in the context of the zzso zzso cavity has not been zzso Stem cell transplantation using zzso devices is a promising approach to counteract poor zzso graft survival and integration in various types of neurological zzso Here, we report the development of a zzso zzso that is based on zzso zzso zzso from zzso skin cultures zzso zzso enables the expansion of embedded zzso in zzso while retaining their zzso differentiation zzso When implanted in zzso zzso models, zzso were able to migrate out of the zzso to targeted zzso growing in the zzso hemisphere, and this was more efficient than the delivery of zzso by zzso injection of cell zzso zzso application of a zzso implant into a tumor zzso cavity led to a marked zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso consistency of the zzso implants allowed simple handling during the surgical procedure of zzso and zzso application and ensured continuous contact with the surrounding brain zzso Here, we demonstrate zzso of a zzso transplantation of zzso zzso The zzso zzso as a delivery system for zzso has the potential to increase transplantation efficiency by reducing zzso stress and providing mechanical support, especially when administered to the surgical zzso cavity after brain tumor zzso
