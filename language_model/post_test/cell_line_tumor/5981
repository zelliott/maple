zzso zzso is an zzso agent that has yielded significant benefits and is a current standard agent in the treatment of zzso zzso However, its survival benefit remains zzso Recently, a synergistic zzso effect between zzso and zzso zzso was reported in zzso zzso zzso The Japan Clinical Oncology Group zzso brain tumor study group has recently began a zzso phase II study to evaluate the clinical effectiveness of combination therapy with zzso and zzso in zzso However, it is not sufficient just to evaluate the mechanisms and establish an experimental basis for rational clinical therapy with zzso and zzso The precise mechanisms governing the direct effects of zzso and a combination of zzso and zzso in zzso are not yet fully zzso To gain insight into the mechanisms of zzso involving zzso and combination therapy with zzso and zzso and further to identify new zzso that could be used clinically to predict the response to such therapy and new target zzso for therapies related to zzso zzso zzso we evaluated the gene expression profiles of human zzso zzso cell lines employing a zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso We present a list of the most highly zzso and zzso genes which may be involved in zzso a response to zzso and synergistic effect between zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Although the present study has several limitations, our reported candidate genes could represent not only potential molecular markers but also chemotherapy targets for improving the treatment outcome by devising strategies that are able to circumvent primary drug resistance in zzso zzso
