To explore the cooperative effects of zzso zzso zzso of cell zzso molecules and zzso on the expression of zzso and zzso in zzso cells and their zzso to tumor zzso 

After treatment of zzso cells with zzso and/or zzso and induction with zzso the protein and zzso changes of zzso and zzso in zzso cells were examined by flow zzso and zzso zzso The zzso rates of zzso cells to tumor cells were measured by cell zzso zzso 

In comparison with zzso inducing group, zzso and zzso could significantly decrease the protein and zzso levels of zzso and zzso in zzso cells, and zzso had most significant zzso effect on zzso expression (from zzso to zzso zzso Meanwhile, zzso alone could inhibit the expression of zzso vs zzso zzso but not zzso zzso vs zzso and the two kinds of zzso zzso Compared with zzso inducing group, the rate of zzso was markedly decreased in zzso zzso and zzso zzso treated zzso zzso and zzso zzso worked better than zzso zzso alone except for zzso group ( zzso However, the decrease of zzso was not significant in zzso zzso and zzso zzso treated groups except for zzso group zzso 

These data demonstrate that zzso in combination with zzso in zzso can significantly reduce the zzso between zzso cells and zzso or zzso cancer cells, which is stronger than zzso or zzso zzso This study provides some useful zzso for gene therapy of zzso
