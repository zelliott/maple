There is a growing need for fast, highly sensitive and quantitative technologies to detect and profile zzso cells in biological zzso Technologies in current clinical use are often time zzso expensive, or require considerable sample zzso Here, we report a diagnostic magnetic resonance zzso sensor that combines a zzso zzso probe with targeted magnetic zzso for detection and molecular profiling of cancer zzso The sensor measures the zzso relaxation rate of water molecules in biological samples in which target cells of interest are labeled with magnetic zzso We achieved remarkable sensitivity improvements over our prior zzso prototypes by zzso new zzso with higher zzso zzso and by zzso zzso zzso We detected as few as 2 cancer cells in zzso sample volumes of zzso zzso zzso of tumors and zzso the expression of several cellular markers in zzso zzso
