The zzso repair zzso zzso zzso repairs DNA damage located in the transcribed strand of an active zzso To gain insight into the zzso mechanism between zzso and repair, we have set up an in zzso system in which we isolate an zzso zzso pol zzso which is stalled in front of a zzso zzso This immobilized zzso pol zzso is used as zzso to zzso recruit zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso repair factors in an zzso zzso This zzso pol zzso complex allows the zzso removal of the zzso only in the presence of zzso while the latter does not promote dual incision in an zzso zzso zzso repair zzso In parallel to the dual zzso the repair factors also allow the partial release of zzso pol zzso In this zzso zzso zzso the zzso pol zzso can effectively act as a loading point for all the repair factors required to eliminate a zzso zzso
