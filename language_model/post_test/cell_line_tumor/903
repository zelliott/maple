To detect the zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso and clarify whether zzso expressed in zzso cell lines, and zzso from human peripheral blood can zzso the zzso effect of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso 

Forty specimens zzso from 40 patients with zzso zzso were zzso stained by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso marker zzso Then zzso analysis and positive cell counting were zzso In 27 of 40 zzso zzso activity analysis was zzso by zzso The zzso level were also measured by zzso in 4 zzso cancer cell lines, zzso zzso A, zzso zzso and 2 zzso cell lines, zzso zzso After estimated the drug sensitivities of each zzso zzso cell both to zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso isolated from human blood were incubated in the medium containing zzso or zzso for 24 hours, zzso Then the zzso was collected and zzso serially diluted with the zzso in which the zzso cells, or zzso were also cultivated for 24 h without zzso zzso Using the serially diluted zzso zzso zzso were also carried out on 4 zzso zzso cell zzso Each experiment was repeated six times and the means of zzso value zzso standard errors zzso zzso zzso were zzso Finally, zzso or zzso cells were cultured in medium containing 400 zzso zzso of zzso for 24 hours, then the zzso were collected and the amount of generated zzso was measured by zzso 

zzso activities was significantly increased zzso zzso g zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso g zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso compared with adjacent normal zzso zzso zzso g zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso g zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In zzso analysis, it was confirmed that most cells expressed zzso cells were the zzso cells, especially zzso which surrounding cancer zzso or along the invasive margin of zzso The distribution patterns of zzso zzso cells are similar to that of the zzso zzso The number of zzso positive cells was correlated with the number of zzso in the zzso zzso r zzso zzso The zzso protein were detected at the levels of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso however, not detected in other 3 zzso zzso zzso The values of zzso of zzso on the 4 zzso zzso cell lines were zzso approximately zzso times higher than those of zzso (all P zzso zzso It was showed that no zzso effect for zzso on the growth rates of zzso zzso and zzso zzso After incubated with zzso or zzso zzso expressed a significant enhanced zzso effect zzso zzso zzso while almost no change is observed to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso conclusion was also demonstrated in using the zzso instead of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso were detected in the medium containing 400 zzso zzso of zzso treated with zzso and zzso cells, zzso 

zzso cannot be converted into zzso in zzso zzso cells in zzso because no zzso is expressed in those zzso After being incubated with zzso cell, zzso zzso or human zzso the zzso effect of zzso is significantly increased due to the zzso by zzso expressed in above zzso
