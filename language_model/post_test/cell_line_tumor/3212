zzso A zzso directly injected into mice, zzso T zzso liver zzso However, it remains unclear whether zzso injection can activate innate immune cells, including natural killer zzso cells and natural killer T zzso cells, both of which exist abundantly in the zzso Here we report that zzso injection zzso zzso zzso production from liver zzso cells as early as 2 hours after injection and zzso zzso zzso of liver zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso required other types of immune cells and critically depended on zzso Because a zzso low dose of zzso was capable of fully zzso both zzso cells and zzso cells, we next addressed the possibility of zzso injection displaying an zzso effect in the liver without liver zzso A zzso zzso zzso injection zzso the zzso of liver zzso cells against zzso colon cancer cells and suppressed zzso zzso of zzso cells in a zzso zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, a zzso low dose of zzso might serve as an zzso that can zzso activate the innate immune cells to induce an zzso effect against zzso liver zzso
