This study aims to zzso the independent role of zzso in the zzso of insulin resistance zzso 

zzso derived from zzso zzso cell line and harboring the same nuclear DNA but different zzso zzso were zzso zzso B4 (the major zzso zzso in Chinese zzso zzso zzso (the major zzso zzso in Chinese zzso and zzso zzso (the zzso zzso in Japanese zzso were cultured in a medium containing 25 zzso zzso and zzso with 0 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We compared the insulin zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso and zzso zzso stress zzso and zzso zzso and their responses to the zzso zzso zzso 

Upon insulin treatment, the zzso of zzso zzso to the cell membrane in zzso zzso and zzso cells increased significantly, whereas the changes in B4 cells were not or less zzso On the contrary, the ratio of zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso was significantly greater in zzso B4 cells than in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The levels of zzso and zzso Red, which are indicative of the zzso stress, were significantly higher in the B4 cells in zzso conditions and after insulin zzso Following treatment with the zzso zzso zzso B4 cells showed significantly reduced zzso zzso of zzso and increased zzso zzso to the cell zzso suggesting that zzso may divert insulin signaling from zzso to zzso zzso 

zzso play an independent role in the zzso of zzso possibly through altered production of zzso zzso
