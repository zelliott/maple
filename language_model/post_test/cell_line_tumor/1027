A putative protein zzso C zzso zzso domain in beta zzso zzso suggests a potential interaction between zzso and zzso In this study, we investigated whether and how zzso interacts with zzso zzso peptides inhibited zzso zzso in a zzso manner in zzso in zzso condition, suggesting a direct interaction between zzso and zzso zzso involving deletion of the zzso sequence indicated that the putative zzso zzso domain zzso zzso is critical for zzso zzso zzso of zzso peptides to cultured zzso cells reduced the activated forms of zzso and zzso It also inhibited zzso zzso membrane zzso of zzso and zzso without altering their expression levels, indicating that zzso of zzso zzso is inhibited by treatment of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso peptides inhibit zzso zzso via direct zzso which may play a role in zzso of zzso
