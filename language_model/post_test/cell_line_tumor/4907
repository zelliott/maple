We report on the capabilities of zzso zzso zzso scattering zzso using gold zzso to obtain detailed chemical information with high spatial resolution from within single cancer cells, living or zzso zzso gold zzso 60 zzso in size, were introduced into live human zzso cells by zzso by adding them to the growth zzso Rapid zzso mapping of cells indicated that not only could rich zzso zzso be obtained from intrinsic cellular constituents both in the zzso and nucleus and but also the distribution of zzso molecules introduced into the cells, in this case, zzso zzso could be zzso suggesting that the zzso distribution of zzso agents could potentially be measured by this zzso We show that the zzso signal intensity from the cellular components increases and more spectral detail is acquired from dried cells when compared with hydrated cells in zzso The data also show spectral zzso mainly in intensity but also in peak position, which are dependent upon the intensity of the zzso light and are probably due to diffusion of molecules on the surface of the gold zzso A detailed understanding of the origins of these effects is still not complete, but the ability to acquire very sensitive zzso inside living cancer cells indicates the potential of this technique as a useful tool in zzso
