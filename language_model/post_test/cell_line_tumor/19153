To construct the delivery zzso system of zzso gene with zzso zzso and study its effect on inducing zzso of human melanoma cells zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso containing zzso gene were prepared by an zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA gel zzso zzso and zzso were used to identify zzso gene stability and to decide the best zzso ratio as well as the model effect in the progress of zzso Human melanoma cells zzso are zzso transformed by zzso containing zzso gene and zzso was measured by zzso zzso at various time zzso 

zzso studies revealed that the particles were zzso in shape with smooth zzso The mean particle diameter ranged from zzso zzso The ratio of the zzso to zzso DNA zzso zzso was zzso The zzso gene in zzso zzso could be protected from zzso degradation and could be used as the model in the process of zzso The zzso with zzso gene could induce zzso of zzso cells in zzso manner in zzso at 48 h after zzso 

The zzso zzso and zzso gene could be combined to be a safe gene delivery zzso system, which could induce zzso in human melanoma cells zzso
