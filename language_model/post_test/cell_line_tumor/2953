We recently established that zzso A, a zzso zzso extracted from zzso zzso zzso is an active zzso zzso The molecular mechanisms by which zzso A exerts its zzso activity are currently zzso In this study, we show that zzso A zzso zzso phase arrest and zzso in human zzso zzso zzso zzso Following treatment of zzso cells with zzso A, cell zzso proteins such as zzso A, zzso and zzso were zzso while zzso and zzso zzso were zzso Additionally, we observed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso The expression ratio of zzso was increased in the treated cells, where zzso was also zzso We also found that the expression of zzso a zzso of zzso and zzso was not affected in zzso zzso zzso zzso our findings demonstrate that zzso A zzso cell cycle arrest and triggers zzso via a zzso manner in zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso A shows promise as a preventive and/or therapeutic agent against human zzso
