zzso zzso factor 3 zzso is a tumor zzso gene that is expressed in gastric and other zzso including pancreatic zzso However, the precise function of zzso in pancreatic cancer has not been fully zzso In this study, we aimed to determine the effect of decreased zzso expression in pancreatic zzso 

This study included 36 patients with primary pancreatic cancer, who had undergone zzso All patients were treated with zzso zzso after the zzso The pancreatic cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used for zzso analysis of zzso and zzso resistance protein zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was achieved by zzso zzso of the cells, and small interfering zzso zzso against zzso was used to knock down zzso zzso Cell growth in the presence of zzso was assessed using the zzso zzso 

Patients with zzso and zzso pancreatic cancer had a median survival of zzso and zzso days, zzso zzso zzso expression reduced the expression of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso cells, whereas zzso zzso increased the expressions of these genes in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression decreased zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

Loss of zzso expression contributes to zzso resistance by inducing zzso zzso thereby resulting in poor patient zzso
