We describe the discovery of a novel series of zzso zzso derivatives which zzso zzso arrest in Colo 205 zzso Eight zzso derivatives were screened for their activity in zzso against 60 human cancer cell lines in the National Cancer Institute zzso zzso drug zzso The relationships between structure and in zzso zzso activity are zzso The zzso relationship zzso study of zzso derivatives clarified that the zzso of zzso zzso was essential for significant zzso zzso Very strong growth zzso of zzso zzso was observed against one colon cancer line zzso zzso four melanoma lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso and two breast cancer lines zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso below zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso also exhibited particular selectivity against one colon cancer line zzso zzso four melanoma lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso and two breast cancer lines zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso In the same cancer zzso the selectivity of zzso between these seven most sensitive lines and the least sensitive line ranged from zzso to zzso With the exception of melanoma lines, zzso zzso zzso possessed stronger activity than zzso against almost all tested cancer zzso Very strong growth zzso of zzso was observed against one leukemia line zzso one zzso line zzso one zzso cancer line zzso and one breast cancer line zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
