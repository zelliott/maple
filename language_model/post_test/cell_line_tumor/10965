To investigate the mechanism of the different biological impacts of zzso an engineered deletion zzso lacking the last 40 zzso zzso zzso 

Human zzso cells of the line zzso were zzso with zzso or zzso zzso type zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso containing zzso human genes and zzso was zzso to examine the different gene expression between zzso and paired control zzso zzso A series of methods, including immobilized pH zzso two-dimensional zzso gel zzso zzso silver zzso and zzso zzso analysis software were used to analyze the differential zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso differential zzso were identified with zzso mass zzso based on zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso and database zzso 

165 zzso candidate genes showing zzso expression under zzso induction were identified, of which 144 were zzso while 21 were zzso Compared with zzso group, there were 135 zzso 13 differently protein spots in zzso group by zzso Of them, 7 significantly different protein spots were identified using mass zzso and computer matching with protein zzso Most of the differently expressed genes and proteins were involved in transcription, zzso and tumor zzso genes or zzso cell zzso signal zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso affects cell genes and proteins involved in various zzso especially in regulation of liver zzso
