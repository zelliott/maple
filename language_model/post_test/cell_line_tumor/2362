There is significant need to identify novel prostate cancer drug targets because current hormone therapies eventually fail, leading to a drug-resistant and fatal disease termed zzso prostate zzso To functionally identify genes that, when zzso decrease prostate cancer cell proliferation or induce cell death in combination with zzso we employed an zzso zzso short hairpin zzso zzso screen in zzso human prostate cancer zzso We identified and validated four candidate genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso that impaired growth when silenced in zzso zzso positive prostate cancer cells and enhanced the zzso effects of zzso zzso of zzso with a zzso inhibitor also induced zzso when combined with zzso consistent with recent evidence for zzso and zzso zzso zzso in prostate cancer zzso Recovery of zzso targeting a known prostate cancer zzso zzso the utility of zzso library screening in prostate cancer as a broad strategy to identify new candidate drug zzso
