zzso synthesis is a fundamental cell process and zzso - particularly through the zzso zzso that display zzso zzso the main zzso of this zzso zzso zzso is a very complex process involving zzso zzso as many zzso steps to produce functional zzso It is now well demonstrated that zzso production is enhanced in cancer cells and that zzso zzso plays a crucial role in tumor zzso However, at present there is an important lack of data to determine whether the entire process of zzso zzso and zzso assembly is modified during tumor progression and what could be the potential impact on the zzso of zzso control that is observed in cancer zzso In breast cancer cells displaying enhanced zzso both in zzso and in zzso we have analyzed the major steps of zzso zzso and the zzso capacity of the resulting zzso We show that increased zzso was associated with modifications of zzso zzso and profound quantitative and qualitative zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells with enhanced tumor zzso displayed increased synthesis of zzso zzso with zzso of an alternative zzso synthetic zzso containing a zzso precursor and enhanced zzso zzso of zzso sites located in the zzso zzso While the global zzso activity was not zzso zzso translation, notably that of zzso zzso was less efficient and the control of zzso zzso was zzso reduced in cells with increased zzso These results suggest that acquisition of enhanced tumor zzso can be associated with profound qualitative zzso in zzso control, leading to reduced quality control of translation in cancer zzso
