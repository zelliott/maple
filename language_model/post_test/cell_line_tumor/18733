To establish a mice model of zzso B by using zzso mice, and to transfer zzso zzso T zzso zzso induced from zzso zzso mice zzso by a zzso expression zzso containing zzso complete zzso zzso 

zzso DNA was obtained from zzso zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified by restriction zzso zzso and zzso into human zzso cell line zzso with zzso zzso was used to detect the expression of zzso in culture zzso and zzso to determine the existence of zzso zzso zzso zzso mice were zzso with zzso or zzso by intramuscular zzso zzso was used to detect the expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso was used to measure zzso or specific proliferation ability and specific killing activity of zzso zzso zzso from zzso mice were transferred into zzso mice zzso per zzso Forty-eight hours later, the level of serum protein and zzso was detected with zzso method, liver and kidney were zzso and stained by HE to observe the pathological zzso 

By zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso I and zzso III, the zzso zzso was verified to contain a single copy of zzso zzso which was inserted in the positive zzso zzso cells zzso with the zzso could zzso express zzso zzso and zzso After zzso by zzso for 4 weeks, zzso was detected in the serum of zzso zzso The potential of zzso zzso for both zzso and specific proliferation and the specific killing activity against target cells were zzso The transgenic mice in model group had no significant changes in the level of serum protein but had an obvious increase of zzso and zzso The liver had obvious pathological changes, while the kidney had no evident zzso 

A zzso expression zzso zzso containing zzso complete zzso is constructed zzso zzso cells zzso with the zzso can express zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cellular immune response can be induced in mice zzso by zzso A mice model of acute zzso with zzso has been zzso
