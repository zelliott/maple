We have established a method for using a zzso array platform in combination with zzso zzso primer zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso signal amplification zzso to identify DNA copy number abnormalities zzso in cancer cell lines and cancer cells procured with zzso zzso To determine the sensitivity and specificity for detecting zzso gain and loss, zzso curve analysis was performed on zzso signal ratios generated from zzso and zzso amplified female and male DNA using a zzso zzso zzso A zzso value of zzso and zzso average signal ratio for zzso genes versus zzso genes provided a sensitivity and specificity of 50 and zzso respectively, for zzso amplified DNA and a sensitivity and specificity of 50 and zzso respectively, for zzso amplified zzso We used this approach to identify DNA copy number abnormalities in the zzso cancer cell line zzso which has previously been shown to have zzso zzso zzso profiling of zzso was also zzso Two amplified and zzso genes located on zzso zzso and zzso were zzso these were validated with quantitative real-time zzso zzso the same approach was used to identify zzso and gene expression zzso in 11 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso data revealed amplification and zzso of zzso and zzso and deletion and zzso of zzso and zzso in more than 50% of the tissue zzso These results show the feasibility of using the zzso array platform to identify changes in DNA and zzso copy number simultaneously in zzso tumor zzso
