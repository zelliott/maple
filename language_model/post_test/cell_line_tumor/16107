Human zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso and replicates in T zzso The zzso major immediate early gene zzso is expressed at the zzso infection zzso Human zzso major immediate early promoter zzso zzso is commercially available for the expression of various zzso zzso Here we identified the zzso zzso promoter zzso and compared its activity with that of zzso zzso in various cell zzso 

The zzso zzso and some zzso zzso zzso were amplified by zzso from zzso strain zzso These fragments and zzso zzso were zzso into the zzso zzso reporter zzso and subjected to zzso reporter zzso In addition, to investigate whether the zzso zzso could be used as the promoter for expression of foreign genes in a zzso zzso virus, we inserted zzso zzso expression zzso into the zzso virus zzso 

zzso zzso showed strong activity in T cells compared with zzso zzso and the presence of zzso 1 of the zzso gene increased its zzso The zzso site, which lies within the zzso zzso was critical for this zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso drove zzso gene expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These data suggest that zzso zzso functions more strongly than zzso zzso in various zzso zzso
