zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso the conversion of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We report here, the zzso synthesis of an analogue of zzso called zzso which we show is a competitive inhibitor of zzso zzso failed to inhibit zzso zzso 1 activity, thereby demonstrating specificity for zzso zzso treatment of zzso zzso cells with zzso also induced a reduction in zzso zzso In addition, zzso inhibited DNA synthesis and prevented zzso zzso of zzso in zzso breast cancer zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso functions as a zzso protein and is involved in promoting zzso zzso into membrane zzso in response to zzso in zzso breast cancer zzso
