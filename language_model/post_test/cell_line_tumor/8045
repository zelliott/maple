In addition to genetic changes, the occurrence of zzso zzso is associated with zzso of both genetic and zzso events that promote the development and progression of human zzso Previously, we reported a set of candidate genes that comprise part of the emerging zzso zzso In the present study, we first tested 23 candidate genes for promoter zzso in a small number of primary colon tumor zzso and zzso Based on these results, we then examined the zzso frequency of zzso M zzso zzso in a larger number of tissue and stool DNA samples collected from colon cancer patients and zzso We found that zzso was frequently zzso in primary colon cancer zzso zzso zzso but not in normal zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was also detected in stool DNA from zzso cancer patients zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of other zzso markers in stool DNA improved sensitivity with little effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in cell lines, and zzso cells with low zzso expression were resistant to growth zzso by zzso zzso Our data provide a zzso rationale for zzso of zzso in colon cancer progression and highlight a new therapeutic target in this zzso Moreover, detection and zzso of zzso promoter zzso in zzso DNA is a highly specific diagnostic zzso for zzso
