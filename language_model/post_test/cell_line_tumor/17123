zzso zzso fragments at the zzso of basement membrane collagen IV, zzso and zzso have been implicated as negative regulators of zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso of collagen zzso suppressing zzso cell zzso migration in zzso and tumor growth in mouse zzso zzso can bind zinc through zzso and zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso deleted zzso of human zzso zzso effectively inhibited the proliferation of human zzso vein zzso cells zzso Also, tube formation in zzso was comparably inhibited either by zzso or zzso The zzso and zzso activities of zzso and zzso were confirmed by an in zzso zzso using chick zzso membrane zzso and mouse models, zzso Treatment of 30 zzso of zzso inhibited the zzso formation in zzso by zzso In addition, zzso exhibited more potent zzso activity than zzso zzso in in zzso mouse zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso deletion zzso would be a strong candidate of zzso agent against spontaneous tumor development and zzso
