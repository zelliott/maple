zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso which is considered to be the major zzso factor of this zzso We screened for a zzso of zzso expression by using random gene disruption in a zzso strain zzso Three independent zzso colonies that had zzso insertions within a gene that has high zzso to zzso were zzso zzso of these observations was achieved through disruption of zzso in strain zzso with an zzso zzso which also led to higher zzso activity, increased zzso of zzso and higher zzso against zzso cells, compared to the parental zzso The direct binding of zzso within the zzso promoter region was shown by a zzso DNA probe zzso zzso and the amount of zzso zzso into the culture zzso by zzso cells was increased by adding zzso or zzso to the medium as a carbon zzso Furthermore, we examined zzso zzso sequences and the zzso activity of 50 strains isolated from clinical infections and 7 strains isolated from dental zzso Of the 50 strains isolated from infections, 13 showed high zzso production, 11 of these 13 strains had one or more point zzso and/or an zzso zzso in zzso and almost all zzso were associated with a marked decline in zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso in zzso is required for the overproduction of zzso which is associated with an increase in zzso of zzso zzso
