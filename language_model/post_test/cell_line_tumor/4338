zzso zzso that zzso target zzso receptors have been increasingly used for cancer therapy, but tumors often acquire intrinsic zzso resistance after prolonged and costly zzso zzso we armed the zzso with zzso and observed that it is more potent than the first generation of zzso for controlling zzso zzso This strategy controls zzso resistance by zzso suppressed innate and zzso immunity in the tumor zzso zzso zzso therapy primarily and directly targets zzso zzso cells, which reactivate zzso by increasing zzso zzso within the tumor zzso Additionally, blocking zzso which is induced by zzso treatment, overcomes zzso resistance and completely zzso established zzso This study establishes a next-generation zzso zzso that targets and zzso established zzso zzso
