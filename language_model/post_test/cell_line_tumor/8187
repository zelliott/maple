Many cancer cells display a zzso zzso zzso zzso by which they exhibit high rates of zzso loss or gain at each cell zzso Over the years, a number of different mechanisms, including zzso zzso zzso zzso failure, and zzso zzso orientation, have been proposed as causes of zzso However, a comprehensive theory of how zzso is zzso is still zzso We used zzso zzso cancer cells as a model system to investigate the possible cellular zzso underlying zzso We found that zzso cells frequently assembled zzso zzso in early zzso However, zzso zzso cells were very rare, and zzso experiments showed that almost all zzso cells divided in a bipolar zzso Moreover, zzso analysis showed high zzso of zzso attached lagging zzso in bipolar zzso zzso cells, and higher zzso of zzso attachments in zzso zzso bipolar zzso Finally, we found that zzso zzso zzso typically possessed zzso at all zzso zzso and that a significant fraction of bipolar zzso zzso zzso cells possessed more than one zzso at a single zzso zzso Taken together, our data suggest a model by which zzso zzso attachments can easily be established in zzso zzso Most of these zzso zzso cells would then zzso before zzso zzso and the residual zzso attachments would produce zzso zzso due to zzso lagging zzso We propose this zzso pole zzso mechanism as a major contributor to zzso instability in cancer zzso
