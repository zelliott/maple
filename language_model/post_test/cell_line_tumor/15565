The alkaline zzso zzso is a widely used single cell gel zzso technique for the zzso of DNA strand breaks, zzso and zzso sites induced by a series of physical and chemical zzso DNA migration in an electric field, supposed zzso to strand zzso is a proposed zzso of zzso zzso are zzso from geometric and zzso zzso by image analysis of zzso DNA, often reported parameters being tail DNA and tail zzso Although a variety of statistical approaches have been used in the literature, most of these do not take into account the distribution patterns of comet zzso In order to investigate a methodology for statistically demonstrating a comet effect, two different experiments, a zzso study and a trend analysis, were undertaken on a zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso stressed after induction of zzso with zzso zzso This treatment results in significant zzso of DNA damage, producing values ranging from 0 to zzso tail DNA in the same zzso The comparison of distribution zzso for stressed and zzso samples shows that none of the application conditions are verified, either for zzso tests (which require normal zzso or zzso tests (which assume essentially similar zzso zzso statistics zzso and 75th zzso were consequently extracted from repeated experiments and found suitable for comparing stress conditions in an zzso and in a trend zzso the 75th zzso is theoretically more sensitive but tends to more rapidly zzso at extensive stress zzso We conclude that a trend analysis of median comet metrics from repeated experiments at different stress levels is certainly an efficient way to statistically demonstrate a zzso zzso Whether the considered comet zzso is tail DNA or tail moment had no influence on the conclusions of our experiments, which were carried up to stress levels leading to a median zzso tail zzso
