zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be a potent zzso zzso and growth inhibitor in a variety of cancer zzso Our previous studies showed the important role of zzso zzso zzso stress and zzso oxygen species zzso generation in the zzso induced by zzso However, the relationship of zzso stress with zzso stress is still zzso The objective of the present study was to investigate the interplay between the two stress responses induced by zzso in zzso human gastric cancer zzso In response to zzso zzso changes typical of zzso induction of zzso protein 78 zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso protein zzso factor zzso and zzso of zzso were zzso And the zzso zzso inhibited induction of both zzso and zzso by zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, knocking down zzso by zzso interference decreased zzso generation, increased zzso level and induced zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells, whereas zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression were not zzso The results imply that zzso zzso zzso stress response through zzso production, while zzso zzso the zzso state of zzso cells treated with zzso
