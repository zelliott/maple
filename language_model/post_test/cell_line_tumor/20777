zzso growth zzso zzso has been shown to induce zzso cell death in normal and transformed zzso We recently identified tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso as an important zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso In this study, we have further explored the mechanism by which zzso zzso TRAIL zzso The zzso region of the TRAIL gene was isolated and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso region of the TRAIL gene revealed a region zzso zzso zzso to zzso responsible for TRAIL induction following treatment with zzso Within this region, we have identified an zzso zzso zzso site indispensable for zzso induction of zzso zzso of this zzso site is zzso by a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso of the TRAIL zzso Furthermore, with zzso interference targeting zzso zzso zzso we could abolish TRAIL expression and, zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Our results reveal a new zzso site within the TRAIL promoter functionally involved in zzso TRAIL expression and zzso in zzso and thus provide evidence for the underlying mechanism by which zzso might regulate cell death in liver zzso
