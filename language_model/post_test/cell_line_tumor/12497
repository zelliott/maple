In order to develop a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for pulmonary delivery, the feasibility of zzso of zzso in zzso its stability and zzso capability was zzso Various combinations of zzso zzso with cholesterol were used to prepare the zzso The in zzso deposition data of the zzso zzso were examined using an zzso cascade zzso zzso composed of zzso 60 and zzso 60 in combination with 40 zzso of cholesterol exhibited high zzso efficacy and stability and also had fine particle fraction and zzso efficiency of about zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration of the zzso zzso against some pulmonary pathogens were lower than free zzso Using the zzso zzso in human lung zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso showed significantly lower zzso in comparison to the free zzso These results indicate that zzso can be used as a carrier for pulmonary delivery of zzso via zzso
