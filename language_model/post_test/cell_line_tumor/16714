zzso reporter plasmids zzso zzso zzso have been zzso to characterize the zzso effects of the environmental contaminant zzso zzso and other zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso zzso Following zzso zzso the zzso and its zzso partner zzso nuclear zzso zzso regulate zzso by binding zzso response elements zzso in regulatory regions of zzso zzso Upon sequencing of our zzso reporters, we unexpectedly identified a zzso core motif within the multiple cloning site zzso of the zzso zzso zzso backbone in a subset of our zzso zzso the objective of this study was to determine if the zzso inadvertently influences reporter zzso zzso zzso analysis we determined that the zzso did significantly alter the zzso effect induced by zzso Since many chemicals have been shown to interact with the zzso and influence zzso through the zzso the presence of the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso may inappropriately influence promoter and zzso zzso As such, zzso of regulatory elements into zzso reporters should be designed to avoid retaining the zzso core motif zzso and currently zzso zzso reporters should be evaluated for the presence of the zzso
