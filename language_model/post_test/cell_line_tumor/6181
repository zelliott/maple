zzso zzso are short zzso zzso regulatory zzso that can zzso gene expression and are zzso expressed in many diseases including zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso inhibit the translation and facilitate the degradation of their targeted zzso zzso zzso making them attractive candidates for use in cancer zzso However, the potential clinical utility of zzso in cancer therapy rests heavily upon our ability to understand and accurately predict the consequences of fluctuations in levels of zzso within the context of complex tumor zzso To evaluate the zzso power of current models, levels of zzso and their targeted zzso were measured in laser captured zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso cells zzso and compared with levels present in zzso surface zzso cells zzso We found that the predicted inverse correlation between changes in levels of zzso and levels of their zzso targets held for only zzso of predicted target zzso We demonstrate that this low inverse correlation between changes in levels of zzso and their target zzso in zzso is not merely an artifact of inaccurate zzso target predictions but the likely consequence of indirect cellular processes that zzso the regulatory effects of zzso in zzso Our findings underscore the complexities of zzso regulation in zzso and the necessity of understanding the basis of these complexities in cancer cells before the therapeutic potential of zzso can be fully zzso
