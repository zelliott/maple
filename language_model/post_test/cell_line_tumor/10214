The zzso promoter of human zzso zzso zzso can direct zzso of adjacent unique zzso sequences generating zzso zzso which can zzso zzso of zzso zzso As zzso elements constitute zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso is potentially zzso but the extent to which this occurs is largely zzso Using a zzso screen we have isolated novel zzso transcripts that are unique to breast cancer cell lines, primary zzso and colon cancer zzso zzso of the zzso zzso transcripts can be induced in zzso breast zzso cells by the zzso drug zzso These findings indicate that loss of zzso zzso in cancer cells is linked to the expression of zzso transcripts which may therefore constitute a useful set of markers of zzso
