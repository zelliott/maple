zzso is a major structural element of zzso tissue basement zzso In the zzso of cultured zzso cells, zzso is arranged into intricate zzso Here we tested a hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso contraction is necessary for the proper assembly of a zzso zzso by cultured zzso zzso zzso To do so, the cells were treated with zzso a zzso II light chain zzso zzso or zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso both of which block zzso zzso Under these conditions, zzso shows an zzso zzso in dense patches at the cell zzso Since ROCK activity is regulated by the small zzso zzso this suggests that members of the zzso family of zzso may also be important for zzso zzso assembly by zzso zzso We confirmed this hypothesis since zzso cells expressing zzso proteins that inhibit zzso zzso and zzso assemble the same zzso zzso protein zzso as zzso zzso We have also evaluated the organization of the zzso receptors zzso and zzso zzso and zzso proteins in zzso and zzso cells or in cells in which zzso zzso and zzso activity were zzso In all instances, zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso precisely with zzso in the zzso of the zzso In zzso our results provide evidence that zzso zzso zzso contraction and the activity of zzso zzso are necessary for the proper organization of a zzso zzso and zzso of zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso
