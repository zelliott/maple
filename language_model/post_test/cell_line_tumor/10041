zzso is a human zzso of zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso controls the cell growth through zzso degradation of other zzso whereas its significance in the prognosis of zzso cancer zzso is not yet fully zzso 

This study comprised 202 patients who underwent surgery for zzso as well as 22 cell lines derived from human gastrointestinal zzso The correlation of gene expression with clinical parameters in patients was zzso The biological significance was evaluated by zzso experiments in seven zzso cancer cell zzso 

A total of 20 cancer cell lines zzso expressed the zzso zzso The assessment in surgical specimens indicated that the gene expression was significantly higher in the zzso region than in the marginal zzso zzso Patients with high zzso expression were statistically susceptible to a recurrence of the disease, and showed poorer overall survival than those with low zzso The assessment of zzso zzso in five cell lines showed that small interfering zzso zzso zzso resulted in a statistically significant reduction in cell zzso 

These data strongly suggest the usefulness of zzso as a marker for predicting the prognosis of zzso patients, showing a basis for the development of effective treatments for zzso
