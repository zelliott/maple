zzso zzso zzso are small, about 100 zzso long, zzso III transcripts contained in the vault particles of zzso zzso Presumably due to their enigmatic function, they have received little attention compared with most other zzso zzso zzso zzso Their poor sequence conservation makes zzso search a complex and tedious task even within zzso Here we report on a systematic and comprehensive analysis of this rapidly evolving class of zzso in zzso providing a comprehensive collection of zzso predicted zzso zzso We find that all previously described zzso are located at a zzso zzso locus linked to the zzso gene zzso an association that is zzso throughout zzso zzso expansions to small zzso gene clusters are frequently observed in this zzso A second zzso locus is zzso zzso across zzso zzso The zzso at the two zzso zzso exhibit substantial differences in their promoter structures, explaining their differential expression patterns in several human cancer cell zzso In zzso expression of several zzso zzso zzso most but not all located at the zzso zzso zzso zzso was verified by reverse zzso chain zzso
