One mechanism by which zzso zzso hypersensitivity to zzso target of zzso zzso zzso is controlled is by the differential expression of zzso D1 and zzso zzso of zzso processes has been demonstrated to be crucial in governing expression of these zzso in response to zzso Our previous data suggested that zzso D1 and zzso expression might additionally be zzso regulated in an zzso manner at the level of zzso Under conditions of relatively zzso zzso activity, treatment of cells with zzso resulted in zzso of zzso D1 and zzso nascent transcription, whereas in cells containing active zzso exposure zzso zzso zzso analysis identified zzso zzso responsive elements containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to these promoters correlated with zzso of zzso whereas zzso occupancy was associated with promoter zzso zzso zzso of zzso or a zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso D1 and zzso promoter activity in zzso zzso cells following zzso zzso zzso zzso protein degradation was found to be markedly reduced in active zzso cells compared with cells harboring zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso expression or zzso zzso zzso zzso activity zzso the zzso effects on zzso D1 and zzso promoter zzso Our findings support a role for the zzso regulation of zzso activity in zzso the differential zzso D1 and zzso zzso responses to zzso
