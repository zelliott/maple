zzso zzso have emerged as key regulators in the zzso of zzso where they can act as either zzso or tumor zzso Most zzso measurement methods require total zzso extracts which lack critical spatial information and present challenges for zzso We have developed and validated a method for the quantitative analysis of zzso expression by in zzso zzso zzso allowing for the direct assessment of tumor zzso expression of zzso This zzso based approach (called zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to establish zzso compartments in the tumor zzso then zzso with the zzso zzso allows for quantitative measurement of zzso expression within these zzso We use this approach to assess zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression in zzso breast cancer specimens on tissue zzso We found that zzso levels are zzso in breast cancer illustrating the zzso method and confirming that zzso can be valuable zzso in zzso Furthermore, in applying this method we found that the inverse relationship between zzso and proposed target proteins is difficult to discern in large population zzso Our method demonstrates an approach for large zzso tissue zzso assessment of zzso zzso
