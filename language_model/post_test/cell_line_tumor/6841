zzso and zzso zzso represent a promising alternative to conventional zzso for zzso zzso Focusing on zzso we developed two zzso zzso particulate systems presenting zzso zzso associated with plasma zzso or with cell zzso zzso cell zzso were prepared for zzso onto zzso zzso zzso zzso formulated using a zzso zzso zzso was followed by zzso Western zzso and zzso laser scanning zzso Only a panel zzso of the proteins isolated from both cell zzso zzso onto zzso zzso zzso The integrity of the zzso after loading was zzso as shown by identification of plasma membrane and zzso zzso Finally, one of the major potential advantages of those particulate systems resides in the fact they not only serve as zzso zzso zzso presenting zzso zzso to zzso presenting cells, but also as potential reservoirs for controlled delivery of active zzso zzso
