The zzso DNA zzso depletion status of zzso cell lines is typically assessed by zzso or zzso chain reaction zzso experiments, in which the failure to zzso zzso or amplify zzso using zzso zzso suggests thorough zzso zzso zzso Here, we report the use of an zzso zzso zzso technique for the additional confirmation of zzso zzso Total zzso DNA from a zzso human zzso cell line treated with zzso zzso was amplified using zzso designed to zzso either zzso or a previously described nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso product was used to generate zzso zzso zzso zzso clones were zzso and all arose from zzso zzso These data allowed us to determine with zzso confidence that the zzso zzso cell line contains less than one copy of zzso per 10 zzso Unlike previous zzso or zzso analyses of zzso zzso this zzso zzso technique does not rely on interpretation of a negative result, and may prove useful as an adjunct for the determination of zzso status or zzso copy zzso
