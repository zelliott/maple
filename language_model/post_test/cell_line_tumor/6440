Cancer stem cells have been isolated from various types of cancer including leukemia and solid zzso However, the methods for zzso gastric cancer zzso cells zzso have not been well zzso As a consequence, the biological behavior and the significance of these cells to cancer progression remains to be zzso In this study, we isolated and characterized zzso from a gastric cancer cell line zzso and found their enhanced capabilities of invasion in zzso and zzso in zzso We further studied the expression of molecules related to zzso and invasion in zzso and found there were decreased zzso but increased zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso in these zzso Our results suggest that decreased zzso and increased zzso may be associated with the capacity of zzso to zzso
