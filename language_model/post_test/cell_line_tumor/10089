To investigate the cholesterol metabolism and zzso expression of the relevant genes in cholesterol synthesis of the cultured zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso model of zzso was constructed by adding zzso acid to the growing zzso zzso These cells were collected at day 3 and 6, zzso zzso with the culture solution without zzso acid added served as the zzso The contents of zzso zzso zzso and total cholesterol zzso were detected by the analysis zzso The expression of zzso element binding zzso zzso and its target gene zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were measured by zzso 

zzso zzso was observed at day 3 and became more intense at day zzso The contents of zzso zzso and zzso were increased and the expression of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso in a zzso manner in the model zzso Compared with the control group, the content of zzso zzso was higher at both day 3 and 6 zzso zzso zzso while the content of zzso zzso was significantly increased only at day 6; The expression of zzso and zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso at both day 3 and 6 zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso was increased only at day 6 zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is probably due to the zzso expression of the relevant genes in the cholesterol synthesis of the zzso zzso
