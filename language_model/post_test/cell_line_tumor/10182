zzso differences between human and fish zzso zzso zzso binding by environmental chemicals have been zzso To study zzso zzso in a fish cellular context, we zzso zzso the zzso fish zzso cell line with a rainbow trout zzso zzso zzso and the zzso reporter gene driven by an zzso response element zzso This new cell model, called zzso (for zzso responded to zzso zzso in a both zzso and zzso manner, as well as to environmental zzso zzso from different chemical zzso natural and synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The comparison with other in zzso models, zzso human reporter cell lines zzso zzso and zzso induction in primary cultures of rainbow trout zzso showed an overall higher sensitivity of the human cells for a majority of zzso except for zzso derivatives which were active at similar or lower zzso in fish cells, suggesting zzso for these zzso zzso analyses suggest that the fish cell line is closer to the trout zzso than to the human cell context, and could serve as a relevant zzso tool to study zzso zzso in fish zzso cellular zzso
