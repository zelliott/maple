This study was designed to examine the zzso zzso effect of zzso zzso on zzso zzso production in zzso lung zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso inhibited both tumor necrosis factor zzso and zzso zzso production, zzso zzso and promoter activity in zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso inhibited zzso of nuclear factor zzso without zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso However, the effect of zzso was insensitive to zzso a zzso zzso and to zzso zzso by zzso Furthermore, only zzso inhibited DNA binding of zzso to the zzso promoter zzso These findings indicated that zzso had a zzso zzso effect on zzso production via a mechanism that differs from that of zzso
