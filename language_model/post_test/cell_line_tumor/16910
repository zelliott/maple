zzso zzso acid zzso has been widely investigated for treatments of many zzso including prostate zzso zzso silenced in zzso zzso zzso prostate cancer cells, plays a role in zzso prostate cancer cell growth zzso In this study we intended to zzso the mechanisms that are involved in the proliferation zzso of zzso prostate cancer cells triggered by zzso We discovered that zzso was able to induce the growth arrest and to increase zzso expression in zzso prostate cancer zzso Both zzso and zzso participated in the repression of zzso expression through an zzso mechanism involving DNA and zzso zzso zzso Specifically, zzso recruited zzso to zzso promoter to form a repression zzso Moreover, zzso could zzso zzso through decreasing zzso and zzso expressions and reducing their interactions with the zzso zzso zzso the zzso level of the zzso promoter was reduced upon the treatment of zzso zzso from this study implicated a novel effect of zzso in zzso of the growth of zzso resistant human prostate cancer cells through zzso of zzso expression as a result of zzso zzso
