zzso gene delivery to cancer cells is considered as a promising strategy for cancer zzso zzso several targeting zzso have been studied for cancer gene therapy, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We have focused on zzso zzso which is derived from the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is known as a zzso for zzso one of the major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly expressed in various cancer cells and plays a role in zzso In this study, we prepared zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for gene delivery tool to zzso zzso cancer cells, and assessed the characterization of zzso zzso We confirmed the zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso by zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso zzso were zzso We also assessed the gene zzso efficiency of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cancer cells or zzso less expressing cancer zzso As a result, zzso zzso gene zzso efficiency was increased by zzso in zzso zzso cancer cells compared to zzso less expressing cancer zzso These results suggested that zzso zzso were successfully prepared from a point of view of the modification of zzso zzso to zzso and the particle size of zzso which presented zzso zzso Furthermore, our results suggest that zzso zzso can be a useful targeted gene delivery vehicle for zzso zzso cancer zzso
