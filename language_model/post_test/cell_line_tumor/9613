The zzso zzso transient zzso potential, zzso type 1 zzso is a zzso zzso channel activated by noxious stimuli zzso zzso Several reports have shown zzso of zzso activity and expression by zzso growth zzso Here, we study the long-term effects on zzso expression zzso by zzso growth factor zzso zzso and insulin in a zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso We show that, after 72 zzso of 10 zzso zzso or insulin exposure, the zzso protein level was zzso zzso and zzso zzso By blocking zzso zzso or zzso protein zzso zzso zzso we concluded that the increase in total zzso protein content induced by zzso was controlled by zzso zzso whereas insulin seemed to regulate zzso protein expression via both zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso C zzso blocked the effects of both zzso and zzso Furthermore, the zzso causing a 50% zzso increase zzso after insulin and zzso treatments were significantly lowered compared with zzso zzso We conclude that zzso and insulin enhance zzso protein expression and activity, and impaired pain sensation might result from distorted zzso regulation in the peripheral nervous zzso
