The crucial role of the zzso in cell division has identified zzso as a target for the development of zzso for zzso in particular, zzso is a target for zzso agents that act by interfering with the dynamic stability of zzso A molecular modeling study was carried out to accurately represent the complex structure and the binding mode of a new class of zzso zzso zzso that bind at the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso along with zzso zzso zzso score analysis fitted these zzso into the zzso site and revealed detailed zzso information useful for inhibitor zzso zzso analysis of the results was in good agreement with the in zzso zzso activity of these derivatives zzso from 3 zzso to 100 zzso such that calculated and measured free energies of binding correlate with an zzso of zzso zzso error zzso zzso zzso zzso This correlation suggests that the activity of unknown compounds may be zzso
