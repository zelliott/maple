zzso stabilization of the zzso DNA structure derived from the zzso zzso of the zzso DNA is an attractive strategy for the zzso of the zzso zzso The agents that can zzso a DNA sequence into a zzso structure are therefore potential zzso zzso zzso we present the first report of the interactions of two novel zzso zzso and zzso based on zzso base skeleton with the zzso DNA zzso These zzso base molecules stabilize the zzso derived from a human zzso zzso Evidence of their strong interaction with the zzso has been obtained from CD zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These zzso also possess significantly higher affinity toward the zzso over the duplex zzso The above results obtained are in excellent agreement with the biological activity, measured in zzso using a modified zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso are selectively more zzso toward the zzso cells than the corresponding zzso zzso zzso studies suggested that the zzso scaffold might allow these zzso to occupy not only the zzso planes but also the grooves of the zzso
