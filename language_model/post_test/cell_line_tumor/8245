In the past 10 years, zzso and zzso analyses have provided valuable data on global gene expression and cell functional zzso However, when zzso analyses revealed partial correlations between zzso expression levels and protein abundance thus suggesting that zzso regulations may be in part responsible for this zzso In the present work, we report the development of a functional, zzso and quantitative method to measure zzso regulations that we named zzso This method enables zzso quantitative measure of zzso regulations zzso by selected zzso regions and zzso small zzso or zzso and zzso comparison of these regulatory processes in zzso relevant systems zzso cancer versus primary zzso zzso We applied zzso to the study of liver cancer, and we demonstrate for the first time the differential regulatory mechanisms controlling gene expression at a zzso level in normal and zzso zzso zzso As an example, translation efficiency zzso by zzso zzso growth factor zzso region was increased zzso in liver cancer cells compared with normal zzso whereas stability of an zzso containing a portion of zzso D1 zzso region was increased more than zzso in zzso cells compared with normal zzso zzso we believe that the method presented zzso may become an important tool in fundamental and medical zzso This approach is convenient and easy to perform, accessible to any investigator, and should be adaptable to a large number of cell type, functional and chemical screens, as well as zzso scale zzso Finally zzso may represent a helpful tool to reconcile zzso and zzso zzso
