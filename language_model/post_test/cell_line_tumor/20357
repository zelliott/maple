zzso neurodegenerative diseases are associated with zzso in gene expression in affected zzso One of the mechanisms that could account for this is altered zzso zzso of zzso factors, which has been observed in human zzso brains of each of the major neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease zzso The specific mechanisms are yet to be zzso however a potential mechanism involves zzso in nuclear zzso In this study, we examined the zzso trafficking of select zzso factors in response to a zzso zzso injury, zzso zzso zzso a well-established model of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso we found that zzso selectively impaired nuclear import through an zzso mechanism without affecting nuclear export or nuclear zzso Interestingly, impaired nuclear import was selective as zzso zzso factor zzso factor 2) nuclear zzso remained intact in zzso zzso Thus, zzso stress specifically impacts the zzso zzso of some but not all zzso factors, which is consistent with observations in zzso zzso zzso Our data further zzso a role for altered zzso dependent trafficking in the differential effects of zzso on zzso factor zzso zzso disruption of zzso nuclear transport may contribute to selective declines in zzso responses of aging or diseased zzso zzso
