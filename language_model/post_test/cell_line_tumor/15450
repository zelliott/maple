zzso factor 1 zzso is a master regulator for zzso In this study, we identified novel zzso target genes using a zzso promoter zzso array and a DNA zzso zzso was found to regulate human zzso zzso A zzso family genes zzso a zzso of zzso zzso clustered on zzso zzso All zzso genes were zzso by zzso of zzso into human zzso stem cells, while zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso however, revealed that zzso bound directly to the promoters of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso capture zzso revealed that the coordinated expression of the genes was based on changes in zzso zzso structure triggered by zzso which enables the formation of long-range zzso at least between zzso and zzso gene zzso In zzso zzso of the zzso group and subsequent zzso zzso are thought to be zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso Here, we demonstrated that, in zzso cells, the zzso and zzso gene products catalyze zzso zzso in a coordinated fashion with zzso II to produce zzso or zzso from their zzso Thus, zzso and zzso gene products are new members of zzso working as zzso zzso
