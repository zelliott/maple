zzso cancer zzso is a leading cause of death among zzso It is currently estimated that inflammatory responses are linked to zzso of all deaths from cancer zzso zzso is dominated by complications arising from zzso to the bone where the tumor cells interact with the bone zzso zzso the balance between bone formation and zzso However, the molecular nature of this interaction is not completely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso damage and zzso Previous studies from our laboratory showed that zzso is implicated in zzso demonstrating that zzso zzso zzso bone zzso cancer cells zzso invasion and migration and decreases tumor growth and zzso in zzso The aim of this work was to analyze the impact of zzso modulated zzso cells on zzso proliferation in zzso and on bone zzso in zzso Using a zzso system of zzso cells with primary mice zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso pharmacological induction zzso zzso zzso the diminution of zzso proliferation induced by zzso cells and decreased the expression of zzso factors in zzso No changes were detected in the expression of genes involved in zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso provoked an zzso status and activated zzso signaling in zzso The percentage of active zzso positive for zzso increased in zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso Nuclear zzso expression was detected in tumors generated by in zzso bone injection of zzso stable zzso zzso zzso cells in the zzso of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso has the potential to modify the bone zzso zzso on zzso bone zzso
