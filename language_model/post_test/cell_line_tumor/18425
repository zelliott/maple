zzso with zzso zzso factor function reverses multiple aspects of the transformed zzso of mouse or human tumor zzso However, the unknown number of individual zzso factors expressed in any cellular context and the similar DNA binding zzso of zzso family members zzso the identification of those that mediate zzso By utilizing quantitative zzso zzso for 25 mouse zzso factors, we analyzed the expression of essentially the entire zzso family in normal zzso zzso zzso cell lines, and zzso zzso In normal zzso zzso 24 zzso factors were zzso Even zzso derived cell lines expressed zzso zzso zzso The most abundant zzso factor zzso measured in normal zzso tissue were zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis of zzso tissue identified which zzso factors were predominantly expressed in the zzso or zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso factor expression in normal zzso tissue and zzso tumors identified significantly elevated expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso tumors and confirmed previously reported zzso in expression of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of 13 zzso target zzso implicated in various aspects of tumor zzso was also zzso zzso expression of particular zzso target genes was significantly correlated with particular zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso suggesting specific in zzso regulatory zzso Together, this comprehensive analysis revealed unexpectedly diverse zzso family gene zzso characterized novel zzso factor changes in zzso tumors, and implicated specific zzso factors in the regulation of multiple genes involved in zzso tumor zzso
