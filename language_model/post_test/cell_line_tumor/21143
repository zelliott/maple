We present a mathematical model to study the effects of zzso zzso on cell proliferation in breast zzso The model illustrates the zzso behavior of cells as a function of zzso and zzso receptors numbers, and the growth factor zzso This mathematical model comprises kinetic equations describing the cell surface binding of zzso growth factor to zzso and zzso zzso coupled to a model for the dependence of cell proliferation rate on growth factor receptors zzso The simulation results from this model zzso zzso a growth advantage associated with excess zzso zzso zzso that zzso is an insufficient zzso to predict the proliferation response of cancer cells to zzso growth zzso and zzso the zzso zzso expression level in zzso cells plays a key role in zzso the proliferation response to zzso zzso This mathematical model also zzso the interaction and roles of other model parameters in determining cell proliferation rate of zzso zzso
