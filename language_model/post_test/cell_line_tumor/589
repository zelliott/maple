zzso of differentiation 2 zzso is a natural inhibitor of the basic zzso zzso zzso Although zzso is well known to prevent differentiation and promote zzso progression and zzso the molecular events that regulate zzso activity remain to be zzso Here, we identified that zzso zzso protein 2 zzso is a novel functional zzso of zzso Moreover, we demonstrated that zzso can directly interact with all members of the Id family zzso via an zzso zzso structure zzso in Id zzso zzso zzso the zzso effect of Id proteins on basic zzso protein zzso transcription, which was zzso by the deletion zzso of zzso that disrupted their interaction with zzso We also showed a competitive nature between zzso and zzso for binding zzso zzso zzso prevents the formation of the zzso zzso thus releasing zzso to DNA and restoring its zzso zzso zzso expression was remarkably zzso during zzso zzso differentiation of zzso cells, during which the expression of zzso was opposite to zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells markedly reduces the zzso and zzso promoting functions of zzso Altogether, these results indicate that zzso is an important zzso of the zzso activity of zzso in zzso zzso
