Cellular cholesterol levels are controlled by zzso zzso zzso zzso sensing zzso which include zzso and zzso With cholesterol zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso regulatory element binding proteins zzso key zzso factors for cholesterol and fatty acid zzso zzso by zzso with zzso complexes to promote their zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso are additional zzso zzso zzso of zzso from cells grown with zzso zzso led to zzso zzso of zzso and their target zzso Moreover, zzso zzso and zzso were physically associated with zzso zzso bound cholesterol with specificity and strong zzso and responded to zzso cholesterol changes with altered zzso mobility, suggesting that zzso themselves may be regulated by zzso Together, our results define zzso as novel zzso proteins that are directly involved in regulating the zzso zzso We speculate that zzso promote stability of the zzso complex and may contribute to the highly cooperative control of this zzso
