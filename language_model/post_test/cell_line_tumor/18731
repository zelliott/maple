zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso artery has been accepted as an effective treatment for zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso vessel zzso and collateral circulation formation are the main factors of zzso growth and recurrence and zzso after zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso plays an important role in tumor zzso This study was to explore the zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso expression in cultured zzso cells and to observe the zzso effect of zzso infusion of zzso zzso mixed with zzso on rat liver zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and sense zzso were added to the media of zzso cultured zzso zzso Forty-eight hours later, zzso zzso of zzso were detected by zzso zzso cell line zzso cells were cultured in the zzso zzso hours later, growth of zzso cells was analyzed by zzso zzso Thirty zzso cell implanted rat liver tumor models were divided into 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso group, zzso zzso zzso zzso mixed with zzso zzso zzso zzso group, zzso and zzso zzso normal saline zzso group, zzso were infused into the zzso zzso Volumes of tumors were measured by zzso before and 7 d after the zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso was detected by zzso zzso density zzso and zzso expression were observed by zzso 

zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso The tumor growth rate was significantly lower in zzso group than that in LP and control groups zzso zzso and zzso respectively, zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso were expressed highest in LP group and lowest in zzso zzso The zzso positive rates showed no significant difference among zzso control and zzso groups zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso in zzso group zzso was significantly less than that in control group zzso and LP group zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso can inhibit zzso expression of zzso zzso It may be an zzso therapy agent for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mixed with zzso zzso liver cancer is better in zzso liver cancer growth, zzso expression and zzso density than zzso zzso
