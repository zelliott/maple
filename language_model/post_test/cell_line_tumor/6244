We developed a new instrumental method by which human melanoma cells zzso are zzso via radiation pressures exerted by zzso zzso waves produced by high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The method enables zzso zzso zzso within the cell zzso due to zzso and can be zzso in the delivery of drugs and gene products in cellular zzso In this method, cells are seeded on the zzso that employs zzso for high spatial resolution and zzso zzso are driven by zzso zzso signals and the resulting radiation pressures induce zzso in the targeted zzso The zzso degree and the effective lateral resolution of zzso are determined by performing fluorescent zzso and analysis of zzso zzso quantum dots passively transported into the zzso Models representing the zzso ultrasound radiation pressure, the zzso cell membrane zzso and the zzso transport through the wound are developed to determine the zzso wound size and enhanced cellular zzso of zzso zzso calculations show that the effective wound size and cellular zzso of zzso increase zzso with increasing ultrasound pressure zzso at applied radiation pressures of zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso initial effective wound zzso are zzso zzso and 650 zzso respectively, and the zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the threshold pressure required to induce zzso in zzso cells is zzso zzso
