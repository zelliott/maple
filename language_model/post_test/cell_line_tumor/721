Over the past few years, the zzso agent zzso has become the zzso therapy for patients with glioblastoma, the most common brain zzso Recently, large-scale cancer zzso sequencing efforts have identified a zzso zzso and zzso zzso mismatch repair gene zzso in zzso zzso zzso particularly those growing more rapidly during zzso zzso This study aimed to clarify the timing and role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso sequence and zzso instability zzso status were determined in matched zzso and zzso zzso identified by The Cancer Genome zzso zzso as having zzso zzso zzso zzso lines were derived in zzso through selective growth under zzso and the zzso gene was zzso in resistant zzso The role of zzso zzso in zzso resistance was explored using zzso short hairpin zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were confirmed in zzso zzso zzso but absent in matched zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso displayed a signature bias toward zzso transitions and was not associated with zzso In zzso modeling through exposure of an zzso zzso zzso line to zzso resulted in resistant zzso one clone showed an zzso zzso zzso that had been independently noted in two treated zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso line zzso increased resistance to zzso zzso and zzso restored zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso are selected in zzso during zzso therapy both in zzso and in zzso and are zzso associated with zzso zzso
