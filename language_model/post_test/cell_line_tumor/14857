zzso originally designated zzso factor 2 zzso is frequently found to be highly expressed in various types of human cancer cell lines in zzso and human cancer zzso in zzso We proposed that zzso was a key factor during the process of proliferation and invasion in cancer zzso We investigated the effect of zzso on the function of human zzso cell line zzso such as zzso zzso invasion and the associated signal zzso 

A human zzso zzso DNA template was adopted to induce short hairpin zzso zzso zzso interference zzso to block zzso gene expression in the cell line zzso zzso cells were divided into three groups: cells zzso with zzso zzso saline as control group (the zzso group), cells zzso with zzso as negative control group (the NC zzso and cells zzso with zzso as experimental group (the zzso zzso Then, zzso efficiency of cell was observed under fluorescent zzso The expressions of zzso and the related genes in cells were detected by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction and Western zzso Cell viability was determined using the zzso zzso zzso zzso quantitative zzso zzso The invasion and migration capability of cells were tested by zzso plates with or without zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the changes of cell cycle and zzso were analyzed by flow zzso 

The zzso efficiency of zzso to zzso cells was about zzso - zzso When compared with the NC group, the levels of zzso and protein of zzso in the zzso group decreased by zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso the earlier zzso value increased by zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The percentage of S phase zzso cells decreased by zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso however, that of zzso - zzso phase cells increased by zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The capability of migration and invasion reduced by zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso The cell proliferation in the zzso group decreased by 59% and zzso at 48 and 120 hours after zzso zzso The zzso expressions of transforming growth zzso and vascular zzso growth factor decreased by zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso A tendency of lower focal zzso zzso zzso was shown in zzso cells but without any statistically significant zzso Otherwise the expression of zzso in those cells had markedly decreased by zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso against zzso can effectively zzso zzso gene zzso zzso increases the zzso and invasion of cancer zzso zzso might be involved in and served as a tumor promoter gene in the zzso of zzso
