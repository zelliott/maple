zzso mice transplanted with subcutaneous tumors zzso or zzso are widely used as a model of zzso activity for the discovery and development of zzso drug zzso Despite their widespread use, there is a widely held view that these models provide minimal zzso value for discerning clinically active versus inactive zzso To improve the zzso nature of these models, we have carried out a retrospective population zzso zzso analysis of relevant zzso efficacy data for eight agents zzso targeted and zzso with known clinical zzso 

zzso modeling was carried out to first characterize the relationship between drug concentration and zzso activity for each agent in zzso zzso or zzso zzso Next, simulations of tumor growth zzso zzso in zzso at clinically relevant doses and schedules were carried out by replacing the zzso zzso which were used to build the zzso model with human zzso obtained from literature to account for species differences in zzso 

A significant correlation zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso was observed between simulated zzso zzso driven by human zzso and clinical response but not when zzso observed at maximum tolerated doses in mice was correlated with clinical response zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

On the basis of these zzso agents that led to greater than zzso zzso in zzso models, at clinically relevant zzso are more likely to lead to responses in the zzso A proposed strategy for the use of zzso subcutaneous models for compound selection in zzso drug discovery is zzso
