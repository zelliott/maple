zzso has been suggested to play an important role in regulating DNA damage response in zzso and recently, the human zzso zzso zzso has been identified, which shares significant zzso to the zzso checkpoint protein zzso In this study, we investigated whether zzso played a key role in cellular sensitivity to zzso zzso drugs by suppressing its expression using zzso interference in zzso zzso zzso Using colony formation zzso we found that suppression of zzso zzso hypersensitivity to a range of zzso agents, especially DNA zzso such as zzso and zzso This effect was associated with reduced zzso of spontaneous and drug-induced zzso elevated zzso of zzso zzso and markedly increased zzso aberrations in response to DNA zzso In addition, there was also a significant decrease in zzso sister zzso exchange rate, a marker for zzso zzso zzso repair in zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso may be a key factor in regulating cellular response to DNA damage in cancer zzso Our findings reveal a novel strategy for cancer therapy, in which cancer cells are zzso to zzso zzso drugs through zzso of the zzso zzso
