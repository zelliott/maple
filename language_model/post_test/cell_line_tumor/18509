zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso interfere with the dynamics of zzso and have shown significant cell killing activity in a variety of tumor cells through induction of zzso The mechanism by which zzso zzso induce zzso is not entirely zzso In this study, we found that zzso inhibit zzso zzso zzso without affecting zzso arrest in human breast cancer zzso cells and human zzso tumor zzso cells, suggesting that zzso zzso zzso may occur via a zzso independent of cell cycle zzso Further analyses indicated that zzso zzso cause significant degradation of zzso which in turn results in nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, in zzso zzso zzso show that the activity of zzso zzso zzso was activated by zzso zzso and was not affected by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso which is insensitive to zzso zzso and degradation, resulted in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and reduced sensitivity of tumor cells to zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso signaling zzso may contribute to the mediation of zzso zzso zzso in human tumor zzso
