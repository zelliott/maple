Our previous research data showed that type II zzso protein zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso signal zzso through blocking the zzso of zzso caused by zzso Since zzso also mediates other zzso signal zzso zzso this study was designed to investigate whether zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signal zzso zzso human breast cancer cells were infected with zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso to increase the expression of zzso and treated with zzso to activate the zzso Western zzso was applied to detect the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso method was used to detect the zzso of Ras zzso zzso was used to analyze the binding between zzso and zzso zzso zzso was used to detect the zzso of zzso zzso The results showed that zzso treatment increased the zzso of zzso the binding between zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso but decreased the zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso activity through infection with zzso and stimulation with zzso efficiently reversed the above changes caused by zzso The results suggest that zzso also zzso zzso zzso signal zzso and further confirmed that zzso can block the zzso of zzso
