We aimed to investigate the zzso value of zzso in zzso zzso 

A total of zzso zzso zzso patients with zzso and survival information were enrolled from City of Hope zzso zzso and Zhejiang University zzso zzso zzso protein expression was determined by zzso on zzso tissue zzso zzso and Cox analyses were used to measure zzso zzso activity and invasion zzso were used to evaluate the role of zzso in zzso cell zzso 

In zzso experiments demonstrated zzso activated zzso signal zzso and promoted zzso cell zzso Meanwhile, zzso expression was significantly associated with zzso zzso involvement, tumor size, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso grade in the zzso tissue samples ( zzso zzso analysis illustrated that high zzso expression predicted poor survival in zzso patients in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso Cox analysis, the hazard ratios of zzso for overall survival were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso sets, zzso In particular, zzso specifically predicted the outcome of advanced zzso with poor differentiation and high zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso by zzso significantly reduced the zzso pool, zzso and zzso activities and the levels of zzso zzso and zzso resulting in growth zzso and reduced invasion in zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso predicts poor survival in zzso patients with advanced zzso zzso zzso could potentially serve as zzso zzso and therapeutic target for zzso
