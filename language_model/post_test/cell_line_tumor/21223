Here we detail the modification of a zzso linear zzso zzso hybrid zzso mass zzso to accommodate a negative chemical zzso zzso zzso The zzso source is used to produce zzso radical zzso for zzso electron transfer zzso zzso The zzso beam is stable, zzso and intense so that a sufficient amount of zzso can be injected into the zzso in only zzso zzso Following zzso reaction in the zzso zzso product zzso are zzso zzso analyzed in either the zzso (for speed and zzso or the zzso (for mass resolution and zzso Here we describe the physical layout of this device, zzso zzso of zzso zzso an evaluation of relevant zzso figures of merit, and the application of this instrument to protein sequence zzso Described zzso applications include complex zzso mixture analysis, zzso modification zzso site zzso zzso zzso large zzso zzso and intact protein zzso From these experiments, we conclude the zzso zzso will provide the zzso field with several new opportunities and represents an advance in protein sequence analysis zzso
