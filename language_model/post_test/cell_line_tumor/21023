In recent years the zzso properties of zzso compounds have been noticed, but the underlying mechanisms are not well zzso In the present work, we found that zzso zzso zzso blocked cell cycle progression permanently at zzso phase in a zzso and zzso manner in zzso zzso This was further evidenced by the growth regulatory signals during the zzso zzso After the treatment with zzso the level of zzso of zzso tumor zzso protein zzso and the expressions of zzso zzso zzso E and zzso A were reduced, while the expression of a zzso zzso inhibitor zzso was increased zzso In the meantime, neither zzso nor zzso level was observed to zzso Interestingly, the levels of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso were highly zzso After zzso zzso with a lower concentration of zzso inhibitor zzso the level of zzso zzso was zzso indicating a release of cell cycle zzso Taken together, we suggested that zzso proliferation zzso was caused by zzso cell cycle arrest, which resulted from the decreased level of zzso zzso in its active zzso form via a highly activated zzso signal in zzso zzso The results presented here provided new insight into the development of zzso compounds as potential zzso zzso
