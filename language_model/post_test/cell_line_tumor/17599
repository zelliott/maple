The goal of this study was to determine whether zzso zzso of zzso presenting cells zzso enhances the zzso zzso function of tumor draining zzso zzso zzso T zzso in an adoptive zzso zzso 

zzso 205 zzso were culture activated both in the presence and absence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso in zzso and therapeutic efficacy in zzso were zzso 

zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso cell surface zzso markers that promoted generation of T cells that demonstrated an increase in zzso zzso zzso and a statistically significant reduction in the number of pulmonary tumors zzso zzso after adoptive zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso in zzso results in the generation of T cells with enhanced zzso function against established pulmonary tumors in zzso 

These findings have direct implications in the development of effective T zzso zzso of zzso conditions in human zzso
