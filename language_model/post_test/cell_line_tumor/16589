Multiple myeloma is characterized by the zzso of tumor plasma cells in the bone zzso Despite therapeutic improvements brought by zzso zzso such as zzso myeloma remains an incurable zzso In a variety of human zzso human zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso effectively inhibit tumor zzso but their impact on myeloma is zzso We assessed the in zzso and in zzso effects of zzso on multiple zzso 

The effects of zzso zzso zzso on zzso activity, proliferation and viability of myeloma cell lines and plasma cells from patients were assessed by measuring zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso expression with zzso or flow zzso The in zzso effect was assessed in zzso mice injected with zzso expressing human myeloma cell lines and treated with zzso at a dose of 75 zzso zzso progression was evaluated using a zzso zzso 

zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso activity, impaired proliferation and triggered zzso of the myeloma cell lines and fresh plasma zzso It activated the zzso unfolded protein response zzso by inducing zzso zzso and zzso zzso Cell death triggered by zzso treatment correlated with decreased zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso enhanced the zzso activity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and delayed tumor growth in a myeloma mouse zzso 

These results suggest that zzso used at a pharmacological zzso alone or in zzso may be useful in the treatment of zzso Our data provide a zzso basis for clinical trials using zzso in patients with zzso
