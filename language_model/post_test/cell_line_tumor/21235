zzso oxide zzso plays important zzso roles in the zzso to regulate zzso blood flow, and zzso In solid tumors, NO is generally acknowledged to mediate zzso responses to several growth zzso This contrasts with conflicting evidence that NO can acutely increase tumor zzso through local zzso or diminish zzso by preferential relaxation of peripheral vascular beds outside the zzso Because zzso 1 zzso is an important zzso zzso of NO in vascular cells, we examined whether, in addition to zzso tumor zzso zzso can acutely regulate tumor blood zzso We assessed this activity of zzso in the context of zzso responses to NO as a zzso and zzso as a zzso zzso oxide treatment of wild type and zzso zzso mice decreased zzso of a zzso melanoma, whereas zzso zzso increased tumor zzso Acute zzso responses were also independent of the level of zzso zzso in a melanoma zzso but recovery of zzso zzso was modulated by zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of truncated zzso lacking part of its zzso binding domain lacked this modulating zzso These data indicate that zzso primarily regulates long-term vascular responses in tumors, in part, because the tumor zzso has a limited capacity to acutely respond to zzso zzso
