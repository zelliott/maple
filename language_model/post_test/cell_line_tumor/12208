zzso cancer is difficult to treat because of its rapid zzso and more effective therapeutic approaches are zzso The zzso is a nuclear zzso zzso member that is expressed in many zzso zzso expression is a feature of zzso cancer cell lines, and in the present investigation, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso could induce loss of invasion but could not induce growth reduction or zzso at low zzso zzso 10 zzso A high concentration of zzso zzso zzso inhibited cell growth and induced zzso but these effects did not explain our result at the low zzso zzso change, decreased expression of the cell signaling zzso and zzso of cancer cell invasion were observed in the low zzso This suggested that zzso zzso inhibited zzso cancer cell invasion as well as cell zzso most likely due to zzso in the zzso pathway, and this was independent of zzso These results suggested that zzso plays an important role in cancer cell invasion and that it might be a novel target for therapy of zzso zzso
