The unfolded protein response zzso is generally activated in solid tumors and results in tumor cell zzso and drug zzso However, zzso zzso zzso are largely zzso In the present study, we identified zzso a cancer zzso as an zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The expression of the major zzso target, zzso was found to be positively associated with zzso in human zzso zzso By zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso also induced zzso nuclear zzso and binding to the zzso promoter where zzso zzso zzso stress response element 1 zzso zzso is the most efficient target of the three zzso thus increasing zzso of zzso Furthermore, by inducing zzso zzso inhibited zzso cell zzso and decreased cell zzso zzso thus decreasing the survival rate of zzso nude zzso Together, these results reveal pivotal roles for zzso in modulating the zzso in zzso and raise the possibility that zzso is a target that promotes zzso cell zzso and increases the sensitivity of tumors to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso provides an opportunity to enhance the efficacy of existing agents and represents a novel target for zzso zzso
