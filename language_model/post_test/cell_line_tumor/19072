zzso is a ubiquitous zzso cassette zzso protein that is important in pharmacology and may play a role in stem cell biology and clinical drug zzso To study the zzso regulating zzso zzso we used zzso to investigate the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and other zzso regulatory proteins associated with the zzso zzso Following selection for drug resistance and the subsequent zzso of zzso an increase in zzso zzso zzso but a decrease in class I zzso associated with the zzso promoter was zzso zzso zzso zzso including an increase in zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso were observed accompanying development of the resistance zzso These changes mirrored those in some cell lines treated with a zzso zzso zzso A repressive zzso mark, zzso zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso was found in zzso parental cells and cells that did not respond to zzso zzso with zzso zzso Interestingly, although all five studied cell lines showed global zzso zzso and zzso zzso upon zzso zzso only those cells with removal of the repressive mark, and recruitment of zzso zzso II and a zzso zzso factor zzso from the zzso promoter, showed increased zzso zzso In the remaining cell lines, zzso binding in association with the repressive zzso zzso mark apparently zzso the effect of zzso zzso on zzso zzso These studies begin to address the differential effect of zzso zzso widely observed in gene expression zzso
