zzso growth factor 1 zzso is a potent zzso and zzso factor that acts on zzso operated zzso channels zzso zzso are zzso into zzso channels zzso zzso channels zzso zzso channels zzso zzso channels zzso and zzso channels zzso Aside from regulating membrane zzso zzso influence zzso A zzso zzso in neuroendocrine tumor zzso zzso It is not known, whether zzso play a role in the zzso regulation of zzso zzso in zzso zzso We therefore studied the effects of IGF-1 on individual zzso zzso and characterized their role in zzso zzso regulation of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Using specific zzso of zzso zzso we identified the functional expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso channels in primary as well as permanent models of zzso The zzso zzso zzso increase in zzso cells was mainly due to the zzso of zzso channel zzso The effects on zzso zzso observed in zzso zzso recordings and zzso imaging, were partially blocked by the specific zzso channel blocker zzso and zzso zzso against the zzso zzso of this zzso IGF-1 zzso induced zzso zzso The effect of IGF-1 was reduced by both, zzso of zzso channel activity and a reduction of zzso channel expression using zzso zzso Since zzso channels exist in zzso cells and couple to both, IGF-1 zzso signaling as well as zzso zzso pharmacological interference with zzso channels may represent a new therapeutic option by blocking zzso signaling thereby zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso
