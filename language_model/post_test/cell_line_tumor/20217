Despite the recent introduction of targeted zzso the zzso of successful therapeutic options for advanced zzso cancer remains a limiting factor in patient zzso The efficacy of zzso surgical interventions can only be extended through earlier detection of zzso zzso which is dependent on both the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic zzso 

We propose a zzso imaging platform based on zzso zzso zzso doped with zzso B and zzso zzso zzso detection of these zzso is the basis for background zzso and signal amplification, thus providing zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso tails on the external face of the zzso with zzso peptides guarantees their zzso to and zzso at target zzso resulting in specific zzso even of zzso zzso 

The results reported here demonstrate that our rationally designed modular zzso have the ability to produce a breakthrough in the detection of zzso for subsequent translation to clinics in the immediate zzso
