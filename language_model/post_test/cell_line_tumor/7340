In the present work, we show that zzso A, a drug that is currently used for the treatment of patients with zzso disease of the bone as well as with several forms of cancer, is a strong zzso of the tumor zzso zzso protein in human zzso zzso The time course of zzso zzso by zzso A was similar to the known zzso compound zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso A induced zzso zzso of zzso at zzso zzso However, in contrast to zzso zzso A failed to activate zzso target genes including the cell cycle inhibitor zzso gene as well as the zzso genes zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and blocked the induction of the above genes by zzso Using zzso zzso in zzso cells, we showed that zzso A inhibited the zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso promoters by zzso and zzso Using zzso zzso zzso and a novel zzso interaction zzso based on zzso in zzso we established that zzso enhanced the formation of zzso complexes in solution and the subsequent recruitment of both factors to the zzso zzso zzso A also enhanced the recruitment of zzso to the zzso zzso promoter but totally blocked the recruitment of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso of zzso binding to the promoters of several zzso target zzso such as the zzso gene as well as certain zzso zzso by zzso A, prevents the zzso induction of these genes by zzso and propose a mechanism that could account for some of the tumor suppressing and zzso effects of zzso zzso
