zzso or zzso zzso zzso United zzso is an orally active, selective zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso We evaluated the zzso activity of zzso in human zzso cell zzso zzso 

Six established human zzso lines and surgical specimens from 10 patients with zzso were zzso zzso expression was detected by Western zzso and/or zzso The zzso of vascular zzso growth factor and zzso in the zzso were measured by zzso zzso zzso Cell cycle progression and the zzso ratio were evaluated by flow zzso In zzso zzso was measured using human zzso vascular zzso cells by zzso network formation zzso In zzso zzso cells injected zzso into zzso nude mice were treated with various doses of zzso zzso The effect of zzso on tumor zzso zzso was evaluated by zzso using zzso zzso 

zzso growth factor zzso was activated in all zzso lines and over expressed in 7 of 10 zzso specimens zzso compared with adjacent normal zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso to 10 zzso for 48 hours resulted in the zzso of cells in the zzso phase and a zzso to 50% decrease in cellular proliferation compared with zzso controls zzso zzso The tumor zzso study confirmed that zzso zzso to 100 zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso tumor growth compared with controls within 3 weeks after treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor and zzso production was significantly decreased in zzso treated zzso cells compared with zzso controls zzso zzso Treatment of human zzso vascular zzso cells with zzso zzso treated with zzso for 11 days resulted in an approximate zzso decrease in zzso formation compared with zzso controls zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso treatment resulted in a significant decrease in zzso positive zzso compared with controls in zzso zzso 

These results suggest that the zzso activity of zzso appears to derive not only from direct zzso of cell zzso but also from the zzso of tumor zzso in zzso
