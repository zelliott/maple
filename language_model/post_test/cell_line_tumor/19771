The zzso of zzso diseases such as zzso breast, zzso and zzso cancer is lower in Asian populations compared to Western zzso High consumption of soybean products that are rich in zzso predominantly zzso is zzso to be responsible for the lower zzso of zzso disease, although the mechanism through which this effect might be zzso is zzso In this study, zzso analysis was used to identify the changes in gene expression zzso by treatment of the human zzso cancer cell line, Ishikawa, with zzso at both zzso achievable and zzso zzso zzso treatment at 5 zzso concentration induced multiple changes in gene expression including some implicated in zzso In contrast, treatment with a zzso concentration of zzso predominantly activated stress response genes and showed very limited overlap with the genes regulated at lower zzso Of the genes regulated by zzso zzso were also regulated by zzso suggesting that zzso exerts its response via the zzso zzso These results indicate that at zzso zzso zzso is able to elicit zzso effects on a variety of pathways believed to be involved in zzso zzso zzso of zzso such as those used in many previous studies, elicit changes in gene expression that are unlikely to occur in zzso
