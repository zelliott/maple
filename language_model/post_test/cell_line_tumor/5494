Ran is considered to be a promising target for zzso zzso because its protein is exclusively expressed in tumor zzso though its zzso can be expressed in most normal zzso In our study, we obtained four candidate zzso zzso designated zzso zzso zzso and zzso derived from the Ran zzso with the highest predicted affinity with zzso indicated by affinity prediction plots and molecular dynamics zzso However, in zzso affinity zzso of these zzso showed only a moderate affinity with zzso Thus, we designed altered zzso zzso zzso derived from Ran zzso zzso with preferred primary and auxiliary zzso zzso anchor zzso zzso Of the eight tested zzso the zzso analog had the strongest zzso and zzso rate to zzso Additionally, we investigated the zzso activities induced by Ran zzso peptides and the zzso in human zzso and in zzso transgenic zzso zzso zzso was superior to other zzso and zzso peptides in zzso zzso zzso immune responses both in zzso and in zzso In zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso expressed broadly in many tumors, was identified and designated zzso An zzso of zzso zzso zzso was further designed and verified in zzso and in zzso and found to elicit a stronger zzso zzso response, indicating a potential zzso application in the zzso
