In this paper, we present novel zzso for zzso isolated from the marine sponge zzso zzso We found that zzso showed strong zzso activity in zzso zzso as well as in a zzso zzso cell zzso A zzso synthetic analogue of zzso did not show the same activity in the zzso cell zzso indicating that zzso is important for cellular zzso zzso was also able to inhibit the zzso of the inflammatory zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso This combination of zzso and zzso activities could indicate that zzso has an zzso effect and may therefore be an interesting product to prevent development of zzso
