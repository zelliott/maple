zzso zzso zzso zzso is a master regulator of cellular adaptation to oxygen deprivation and activates zzso of genes involved in tumor zzso zzso invasion and zzso all of which are implicated in cancer zzso Several zzso of zzso mediate zzso interaction, which is essential for the formation of the active zzso with zzso zzso specific zzso of zzso might lead to the identification of more selective zzso zzso and zzso contain two zzso zzso zzso A and B, both of which appear to be important for zzso zzso In an attempt to identify small zzso zzso of the zzso domain of zzso we expressed proteins containing zzso acids zzso of zzso and zzso acids zzso of zzso fused to a His or zzso tag, zzso zzso proteins retained functional activity as indicated by in zzso zzso experiments and zzso of zzso expression in a zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso domain was sufficient to abrogate hypoxic induction of zzso zzso zzso supporting its potential role as drug zzso An zzso based on the interaction between zzso and zzso was developed and used to screen libraries of synthetic zzso zzso zzso specifically inhibited zzso interaction between zzso and zzso but not the interaction zzso by unrelated zzso However, zzso zzso was devoid of activity in zzso zzso Our results provide zzso that the zzso domain of zzso is a valid target for development of small zzso zzso
