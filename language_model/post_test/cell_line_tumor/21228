It is well known that invasion is a seminal event in the progression of oral and other head and neck zzso zzso We have previously demonstrated tumor necrosis factor zzso and its dependent zzso are zzso in saliva during oral zzso zzso events stimulate nuclear factor zzso and many zzso genes are associated with cancer zzso 

In the present study, we examined zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso cell line that models zzso zzso zzso We zzso zzso cells with both zzso and zzso zzso zzso known stimulants of zzso We then zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso reporter zzso quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We discovered that the zzso promoter was significantly zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso reporter gene zzso Further, we uncovered that functional zzso promoter zzso was accompanied by significant increases in zzso gene zzso as judged by quantitative real-time zzso chain zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein was zzso by zzso and zzso on a fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, we searched our zzso zzso database for increases in zzso and discovered it was the third most significant protein in zzso of oral cavity cancer patients over normal zzso 

We conclude the milieu zzso zzso has the capacity to provide stimulation of events related to early invasion of oral cavity cancer, as judged by its ability to stimulate zzso
