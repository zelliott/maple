Several materials have been used as drug delivery systems to maintain a high concentration of zzso drugs at localized zzso The feasibility of using zzso calcium zzso cement zzso as a new material, which can release the drug as well as fill a zzso zzso zzso was zzso The mechanical strength of zzso of zzso zzso was not lower than that of zzso zzso Culture medium incubated with zzso zzso from 1 to 7 days suppressed the proliferation of zzso zzso rat breast cancer zzso In rabbits with zzso zzso in their zzso zzso examinations showed diffuse zzso changes in the zzso space, but neither fracture nor skin necrosis zzso zzso zzso markedly inhibited the proliferation of zzso 180 cells in the mouse zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso may be useful in the local treatment of zzso bone and soft tissue zzso
