We hypothesized that airway zzso cells, the primary site of human zzso zzso infection, provide a link between the innate and specific immune response to zzso via production of human zzso zzso a potent in zzso zzso and zzso of immature zzso zzso zzso of primary cultures of human zzso cells with several zzso zzso induced expression of zzso zzso and zzso indicating that zzso production was independent of viral zzso usage or mechanisms of viral zzso zzso zzso of zzso was dependent upon viral replication and could be zzso by zzso of cells with synthetic zzso but was not dependent upon zzso production of zzso Studies with stable zzso cell lines expressing zzso promoter zzso as well as inhibitor studies in primary cells, both demonstrated that induction of zzso involves zzso of the zzso factor, zzso Other zzso factors must also be activated by zzso infection, however, as expression of zzso zzso was also induced and there is no putative zzso recognition sequence in the promoter of this zzso zzso showed no direct zzso activity against zzso In zzso infection of normal human subjects with zzso induced expression of zzso for zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso correlated with viral zzso and with increased levels of zzso protein in zzso zzso This represents the first demonstration that zzso infection zzso zzso expression of zzso both in zzso and in zzso and supports the concept that zzso may play a role in host defense to zzso zzso
