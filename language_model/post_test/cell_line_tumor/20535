zzso of a zzso analogue of zzso a potent zzso zzso whose receptors are zzso on tumor cells, with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso by using a zzso zzso zzso 3-5 readily underwent zzso and DNA zzso whereas zzso 6 was zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and molecular dynamics calculations showed that zzso formation does not zzso the overall zzso zzso Only 6 exhibited zzso activity in human tumor cells zzso zzso 63 zzso 2 zzso in zzso cells and zzso zzso 26 zzso 3 zzso in zzso zzso with active participation of zzso receptors in cellular zzso Similar zzso activity was found in a normal cell line zzso zzso 45 zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso which can be attributed to a similar level of expression of zzso zzso zzso These studies provide new insights into the effect of zzso zzso zzso on the activity of zzso zzso drugs, and demonstrate the potential of such hybrid compounds to target tumor cells zzso
