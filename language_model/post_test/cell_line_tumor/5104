zzso zzso are zzso resistant to many conventional treatments, such as radiation and chemotherapy, for reasons that are poorly zzso Here we propose and test a model that explains drug resistance or sensitivity in terms of zzso zzso 

The growth and sensitivity to zzso of zzso cells, which are zzso and enriched with mature stage III and IV zzso and zzso cells, which have only immature stage I and II zzso were compared using zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso number, and cellular structures in different cell lines in response to various treatments were examined by electron zzso The relative numbers of zzso of different stages were compared after treatment with zzso The relationship between drug zzso function and zzso zzso toxicity was assessed by treating cells with the zzso analog zzso and by assessing zzso formation and cell growth zzso All statistical tests were zzso 

zzso zzso zzso produced by damaged zzso resulted in pronounced cell growth zzso in zzso cells compared with zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity to zzso of zzso cells was zzso higher than that of zzso cells zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso difference zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso After treatment with zzso zzso zzso for 72 hours, the number of stage zzso zzso in surviving zzso cells was zzso that of zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by treatment with the zzso inhibitor zzso dramatically increased zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso principally suppressed zzso zzso cell growth via an zzso of zzso zzso structures, possibly by zzso zzso membrane zzso 

zzso dynamics (including their zzso density, status, and structural zzso regulate the drug resistance of melanoma zzso zzso of zzso functions may be an effective way to enhance the therapeutic activity of zzso drugs against zzso
