Cell surface expression of the zzso zzso zzso is determined by the relative rates of its zzso and zzso Changes in the cellular zzso iron pool zzso affect many cellular mechanisms including those that regulate zzso zzso In this study, we analyzed zzso expression and zzso modifications in response to changes in cellular iron in zzso zzso cells zzso Iron zzso by zzso zzso altered zzso protein levels by decreasing the stability of zzso zzso Increased zzso and zzso of this zzso protein following zzso treatment were also zzso Cellular iron depletion elevated protein levels of the early zzso marker zzso Moreover, zzso zzso studies showed increased zzso of zzso into the zzso compartment in zzso cells compared to zzso Together, these findings suggest that cellular iron depletion regulates zzso expression through reducing zzso stability as well as an increasing in zzso
