zzso zzso and its zzso form, zzso are the most abundant steroid hormones in the zzso blood zzso zzso may have beneficial effects in various zzso conditions such as cardiovascular diseases or deterioration of the sense of zzso However to date, the cellular mechanism underlying zzso action remains elusive and may involve zzso channel zzso In this study, we have characterized the effect of zzso on zzso zzso calcium channels zzso which are involved in several cardiovascular and zzso zzso 

Using the zzso zzso technique, we demonstrate that zzso zzso the three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expressed in zzso cell line, as well as native zzso in pulmonary artery smooth muscle zzso This effect of zzso is both concentration zzso between 2 and zzso and zzso and results in a significant shift of the zzso zzso zzso toward zzso zzso zzso zzso reduces window zzso and zzso membrane potential zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso is not dependent on the zzso of nuclear zzso or zzso receptors and implicates a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso inhibited zzso contraction of pulmonary artery rings and their effect was not zzso 

Altogether, the present data demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso by a zzso protein dependent zzso zzso zzso in zzso activity could thus account for its therapeutic action and/or zzso zzso
