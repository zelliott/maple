A novel zzso zzso containing 13 zzso acid zzso with an zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso belongs to zzso zzso zzso As the smallest zzso of zzso framework 14, zzso could inhibit zzso zzso zzso and suppress zzso To zzso zzso relationship, we determine the solution structure by zzso and find that zzso comprises a short zzso zzso region and zzso zzso An analog zzso of Ala substitution for zzso in position 7 is zzso Interestingly, zzso exhibits higher activity than zzso as long-lasting zzso in the zzso pain model in zzso Additionally, zzso zzso reveals that the two peptides have low toxicity to human zzso The studies suggest that positively charged zzso may not be involved in the blocking zzso However, due to the Ala zzso zzso zzso patch expansion strengthens the binding zzso A hypothesis is given that in zzso zzso zzso zzso rather than charged zzso play a key role during target zzso
