DNA repair defects can zzso to cancer development and zzso We previously showed that the breast and zzso cancer zzso gene product zzso through zzso zzso expression of the zzso gene zzso zzso the zzso zzso repair protein p zzso Both zzso and zzso are zzso target genes containing zzso response zzso To further explore the role of zzso and zzso in repair of zzso we eliminated wild type zzso from zzso zzso cells and found that zzso zzso zzso zzso repair was markedly impaired following zzso damage whereas repair of 6-4 zzso zzso zzso occurred zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells also enhanced zzso zzso In zzso breast cancer cells, harboring zzso zzso and zzso zzso repair of zzso was markedly zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso using zzso zzso into zzso alone had little effect on repair of zzso whereas the combination of zzso and zzso resulted in efficient repair of zzso Thus there appears to be a cooperative effect between zzso and zzso that may involve induction of repair zzso zzso of zzso cell death by zzso with altered zzso selectivity towards repair pathways and/or zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso
