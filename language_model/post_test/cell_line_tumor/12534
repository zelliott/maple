zzso of the resting membrane potential and the zzso of zzso are important in regulating zzso zzso The zzso channel zzso zzso and zzso play a key role in stabilizing zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso the genes zzso zzso and zzso cause a zzso form of zzso and zzso of these channels have been identified as novel zzso and zzso Despite the observations that regulation of these zzso has profound effects on zzso function, almost nothing is known about the mechanisms responsible for controlling appropriate expression zzso Here we identify two mechanisms responsible for regulating zzso and zzso zzso zzso We show that the zzso factor zzso activates expression of both zzso and zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso zzso element zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of both of these zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso regulation of zzso genes is mirrored by the correlated changes in zzso density and zzso of native sensory zzso We propose that these mechanisms are important in the control of zzso of zzso and may have implications in seizure activity and zzso
