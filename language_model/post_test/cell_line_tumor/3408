To compare the efficacy of various zzso strategies of loading zzso cells zzso with zzso cell zzso and characterize the zzso responses zzso 

zzso were either fused with major zzso complex zzso zzso cells zzso or zzso with zzso tumor cells zzso total tumor zzso acid zzso zzso or tumor zzso zzso These zzso preparations were then assessed for their zzso zzso profile, and capacity to stimulate zzso peripheral blood zzso cells zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities of various zzso cell populations were characterized and zzso 

The various zzso preparations exhibited similar zzso and zzso profiles irrespective of the method of loading zzso zzso However, the fusion, zzso and zzso induced superior tumor zzso activities in zzso compared with zzso or DC and tumor zzso zzso induced the greatest expansion of zzso zzso as detected by zzso blue exclusion and zzso incorporation zzso zzso zzso analyses also revealed the highest relative percentages of T helper cells zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso and natural killer zzso T cells zzso in the zzso group among all the groups zzso indicating that zzso induced expansion of zzso bearing multiple T and zzso cell zzso Interestingly, isolated zzso T cells demonstrated significantly higher tumor zzso compared with zzso isolated from the same groups and was also zzso 

zzso tumor cells may be an optimal source of zzso zzso for zzso of zzso The study also demonstrates for the first time that both zzso and zzso T cells are expanded and zzso by mature, zzso zzso
