There have been disparate findings about the role of zzso in the survival of mouse T cells and human tumor cell zzso The role of cellular zzso in human T cell zzso and function needs to be clarified zzso To study this role, we have zzso long transcript zzso zzso in primary T cells, including zzso zzso T zzso We found that zzso zzso protects human T cells from zzso cell death and enhances their zzso capacity but suppresses the ability of these cells to produce the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in response to zzso or zzso zzso The multiple effects of zzso indicate that this protein may influence T cell responses to zzso zzso
