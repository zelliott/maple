In response to DNA damage, cell survival can be enhanced by zzso of DNA repair mechanisms and of checkpoints that delay cell cycle progression to allow more time for DNA zzso zzso both responses with drugs might cause cancer cells to undergo cell division in the presence of lethal amounts of zzso zzso However, we show that interfering with DNA repair via zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso reduces the ability of checkpoint zzso to abrogate zzso arrest and their zzso zzso zzso exposed to the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso cells, and zzso end zzso cells all enter prolonged zzso arrest after exposure to zzso radiation doses as low as 2 zzso The checkpoint zzso zzso becomes rapidly and zzso zzso whereas zzso shows sustained zzso that parallels the prolonged zzso of cells in zzso zzso in zzso cells, DNA repair zzso elicits zzso strong checkpoint signaling that causes essentially irreversible zzso arrest and strongly reduces the ability of checkpoint zzso zzso to overcome zzso arrest and zzso zzso zzso levels of proteins controlling DNA repair have been documented in cancer zzso zzso these results have relevance to the development of zzso zzso and zzso checkpoint zzso as experimental therapeutic approaches to enhance the selective killing of tumor cells by zzso or zzso zzso zzso
