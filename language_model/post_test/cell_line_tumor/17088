To secure iron from zzso zzso use two zzso one dependent on zzso zzso zzso 1) and the other, of greater capacity but lower zzso independent of zzso zzso To clarify further similarities and differences of the two zzso we have suppressed zzso 1 by zzso in human zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso bearing full-length zzso 1 zzso or its first 100 bases in zzso zzso zzso of zzso 1 does not lead to down regulation of zzso 2, a recently described second zzso zzso of as yet uncertain zzso Both pathways depend on zzso of the compartments in which iron release from zzso takes zzso zzso of zzso is a feature of both zzso but is substantially more efficient in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso occurs only in the zzso route, in the first example of a specific zzso zzso of zzso zzso of cellular iron zzso to release of the synergistic zzso (without which iron is not bound by zzso is particularly evident in the zzso zzso Although the relative importance of the two pathways in normal and zzso zzso iron metabolism remains to be determined, the zzso route is a substantial accessory for iron zzso to the zzso zzso zzso
