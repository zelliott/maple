An increase in serum tumor necrosis zzso zzso levels is closely related to the zzso of major zzso However, the underlying molecular mechanism between this increase and impairment of brain function remains zzso To better understand zzso zzso 1 signaling in the brain, we analyzed the brain distribution and function of tumor necrosis factor zzso protein 1 zzso Here we show that zzso is broadly expressed in zzso in the mouse brain, including regions that are implicated in the zzso of major zzso We demonstrate that small interfering zzso zzso of zzso in a zzso cell line decreases zzso zzso of zzso followed by a reduction of the zzso factor zzso resulting in a zzso of zzso and affects the adhesive properties of the zzso In addition, in cultured zzso zzso reduced expression of zzso by zzso zzso influences the zzso of zzso zzso We also report a significant association between several single zzso zzso in the zzso gene and major zzso Our findings indicate that zzso mediates zzso zzso 1 signaling to zzso zzso expression and to regulate cell zzso and synaptic zzso which may contribute to the zzso of major zzso
