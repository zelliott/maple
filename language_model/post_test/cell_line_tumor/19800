zzso of protein zzso in the end stage of Alzheimer's disease brain has not been zzso The purpose of the present study was to explore the possible mechanism for protein zzso in leading to zzso zzso zzso We found that incubation of zzso with zzso a specific zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso induced an increased zzso level of zzso at both zzso and zzso sites in a zzso and zzso manner, and the zzso of zzso was positively correlated with the zzso of zzso zzso When the cells were zzso incubated with zzso a temporary zzso of zzso with a sustained and almost equally graded zzso zzso at some zzso sites was zzso In either case, the activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso was not zzso It is suggested that only zzso zzso of zzso in early stage of zzso disease may result in a sustained zzso zzso at multiple sites, zzso a new mechanism to zzso zzso zzso
