zzso zzso factor zzso 3 plays a role in determining cell fate and generates a variety of alternatively spliced zzso in stress zzso We have reported previously that zzso zzso zzso which lacks the zzso zzso region, is induced in response to various stress zzso However, its biological function has not been zzso By using cells treated with tumor necrosis zzso and zzso D or cells zzso zzso we showed that zzso zzso cells to zzso cell death in response to tumor necrosis zzso at least in part through suppressing nuclear factor zzso zzso of zzso genes such as zzso and zzso zzso interacts with a zzso zzso complex containing zzso and zzso at zzso sites of the zzso promoter region of the zzso gene in zzso and zzso the recruitment of zzso Our study revealed that zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso at least in part, by zzso positive zzso zzso and provides insight into the mechanism by which zzso regulates cell fate through alternative zzso in stress zzso
