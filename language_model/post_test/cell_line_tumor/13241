The zzso precursor protein zzso can be zzso by zzso in neural cells to produce the soluble zzso zzso zzso which is zzso We have shown previously that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso triggers zzso shedding from neural zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins is required for the zzso zzso processing of zzso leading to zzso zzso Indeed, the zzso of zzso by zzso blocked the zzso shedding of zzso We also show that zzso stimulation triggered the zzso of zzso Thus, zzso zzso to the plasma membrane to interact with zzso Using specific pharmacological zzso we established the order in which several zzso trigger the zzso release of zzso Thus, a zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso act upstream of zzso whereas a zzso activity is triggered zzso For the first time, this work identifies zzso as major partners in the regulated zzso processing of zzso
