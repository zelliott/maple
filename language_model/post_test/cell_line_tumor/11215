There is growing interest in the development of zzso zzso zzso because of their higher tumor zzso versus that of the corresponding zzso This report presents the synthesis of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its biological evaluation in the zzso tumor zzso The binding affinity of zzso for zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso was determined in zzso rat pancreatic cancer cells, using zzso as the zzso zzso was prepared by using zzso and zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso imaging were performed in nude mice bearing zzso zzso zzso was obtained in zzso labeling yield with favorable zzso Compared with those of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed significantly increased zzso binding affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed significantly increased tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso 1 h zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso 4 h zzso Although the level of zzso of zzso in zzso was significantly increased zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso 1 h zzso this high zzso was inhibited by the injection of zzso before the administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 h zzso while tumor zzso decreased only zzso zzso with zzso data, in zzso zzso zzso imaging showed that the tumors were clearly zzso while the background signal was much weaker except for that of the zzso and zzso The new zzso zzso with a higher binding affinity and good stability was designed and zzso The higher tumor zzso of zzso suggests that zzso zzso might have an advantage for the zzso of zzso zzso These data merit the translation of zzso to a clinical zzso
