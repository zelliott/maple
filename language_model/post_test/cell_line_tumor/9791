We investigated the effects of combined treatment with zzso and zzso on proliferation and zzso as well as the underlying zzso in human breast cancer zzso zzso The zzso cells, which have been shown to zzso zzso were resistant to zzso zzso exhibited a small zzso zzso effect, with an zzso of 90 zzso Interestingly, combined treatment with zzso significantly decreased the zzso Cellular proliferation was significantly inhibited in cells exposed to zzso at its zzso and zzso zzso 10, 50 and 100 zzso compared with proliferation in cells exposed to zzso zzso This zzso in turn led to zzso as evidenced by an increased number of zzso cells and the zzso of zzso To investigate the mechanism by which the combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso The level of zzso was unchanged by zzso alone but was drastically reduced in cells treated with zzso plus zzso Moreover, compared with zzso alone, zzso in combination with zzso at zzso zzso zzso exerted a zzso effect via the zzso of zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso acts zzso with zzso zzso cell growth and inducing zzso via the zzso of zzso expression and zzso zzso
