Recently, a unique family of membrane zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso was identified, which may be responsible for zzso zzso zzso actions of zzso in a variety of target zzso In this study, the zzso and zzso zzso from zzso were shown to be rapidly and specifically activated by the zzso steroid zzso of this species, zzso zzso The zzso zzso and a previously zzso zzso zzso were zzso expressed in nuclear zzso zzso zzso breast cancer cells, zzso zzso and surface zzso of the receptors were verified by flow zzso zzso surface zzso and Western zzso Plasma membrane proteins from zzso or zzso cells showed high affinity zzso zzso 7 zzso zzso zzso 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso sites specific for zzso whereas negligible specific zzso binding was observed in zzso zzso zzso treatment caused significant zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso within 5 zzso in cells zzso with either of the receptors as measured by western zzso and flow zzso The rank order of the zzso of several zzso in zzso zzso via zzso and zzso was the same zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso in zzso zzso was also the most potent zzso among the zzso tested, of zzso zzso activity in cells zzso with either of the zzso This zzso significantly decreased zzso levels in both zzso and zzso cells in a zzso and zzso zzso In addition, signaling of the zzso zzso was blocked by zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso while sensitivity to zzso or zzso toxin was not shown with zzso zzso possibly indicating that this zzso activates a different zzso zzso G zzso The results of this study suggest that zzso zzso and zzso signal similarly upon zzso binding resulting in rapid zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso
