To study the expression of zzso zzso zzso channels in zzso cancer and its role in regulating proliferation of zzso cancer zzso 

Western zzso and zzso were used to examine the expression of zzso channels in 13 normal zzso specimens and 25 zzso cancer zzso and zzso interference zzso zzso zzso zzso and inhibitor of zzso channel were used to explore the role of zzso channels in regulation of proliferation of zzso cancer cells zzso 

The expression rate and level of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were higher than in normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The expression rate and level of zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were higher than in normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso channels known to suppress the function of the channels, caused a both zzso and zzso decrease in cell number of zzso zzso Western zzso analysis revealed that the zzso level in whole zzso of the cells zzso with zzso small interference zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso of that found in the cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso incorporation in zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso was also reduced, zzso inhibited zzso cell zzso compared with the cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The expression of zzso channels may be closely related to the proliferation of zzso cancer, and down regulation of its expression may suppress its zzso
