Traditional strategies for the identification of zzso cancer targets often fall short of their zzso For example, zzso panning of zzso libraries to isolate a diverse panel of zzso directed against targets on cancer cells often identifies all zzso and/or abundant zzso zzso not simply zzso or zzso zzso Here we describe the use of stringent negative selection in combination with positive panning to increase tumor specificity and clinical relevance of selected zzso zzso from cancer zzso mice showed strong binding to zzso cancer cell lines but also zzso strongly with human blood zzso zzso blood cell binding was considerably decreased after stringent zzso with human red blood cells zzso and white blood cells zzso yet cancer cell specificity was zzso In order to select for a higher percentage of clinically relevant zzso for potential therapeutic use, stringent negative selection by zzso zzso was employed in zzso panning of a zzso zzso displayed zzso library on the prostate cancer cell line, zzso zzso zzso were found to bind to target zzso implicated in zzso and cancer cell migration and/or invasion, and included zzso zzso and the zzso complexes zzso zzso zzso and zzso Compared with traditional cell zzso this method considerably increased the selectivity of zzso to zzso zzso
