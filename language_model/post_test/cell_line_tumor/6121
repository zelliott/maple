zzso was recently found to be zzso in a variety of zzso and is considered a potential target for cancer therapy, but the functional role or mechanism of action of zzso in colon cancer is not fully zzso In the present study, we knocked down the gene expression of zzso in colon cancer cells using zzso zzso zzso This step resulted in significant zzso of cancer cell growth, migration and invasion in zzso and tumor growth and liver zzso in zzso Moreover, zzso downstream target proteins were identified by zzso analysis in colon cancer zzso cells with deletion of zzso zzso of zzso led to zzso of zzso 1 and zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso all potential therapeutic targets in zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that zzso plays an important role in colon zzso and zzso and the comprehensive and comparative analyses of proteins associated with zzso could contribute to understanding the downstream signal cascade of zzso leading to zzso and zzso
