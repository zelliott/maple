zzso zzso zzso is regarded as the key zzso in zzso zzso in human prostate zzso cells, and its abnormal expression has been implicated in zzso of the zzso Evidence also supports a broad role for the zzso gene in suppressing zzso zzso We investigated whether zzso regulates zzso expression and explore the potential mechanisms responsible for its effect on prostate cancer zzso 

zzso zzso treatments and transient zzso of zzso were used to investigate zzso regulation of zzso and may effects were assessed using zzso and transient gene expression zzso 

In zzso zzso activity zzso and zzso zzso showed that zzso treatment induced zzso expression while reducing zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso and reporter zzso revealed that transient zzso of a zzso expression zzso into zzso zzso cells decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso activity, blocked the decrease in zzso gene expression resulting from zzso treatment in zzso zzso Two putative zzso response elements were identified within the zzso zzso however, zzso of these putative zzso response elements did not abolish the effect of zzso zzso it decreased zzso zzso A similar result was obtained for the effect of these zzso on the promoter activity of the zzso gene after transient zzso of zzso 

Together these results suggest that zzso zzso of zzso gene expression in human prostate zzso cells may not occur through the putative consensus zzso response elements found within the zzso zzso
