zzso zzso plays a key role in zzso C virus zzso zzso but understanding exactly how it functions in the viral zzso has been zzso zzso is a zzso virus with a zzso zzso zzso to which zzso binds in a zzso fashion at two sites near the zzso zzso Recent studies show that zzso recruits zzso to the zzso zzso stabilizing it and slowing its zzso in infected zzso This led us to investigate zzso pathways that mediate degradation of the viral zzso We found zzso zzso is zzso primarily by the zzso zzso zzso zzso in infected zzso zzso lost its stabilizing effect when cells were depleted of zzso using an zzso strategy, providing strong evidence that zzso acts to protect the viral zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso depletion did not rescue replication of a viral zzso defective in zzso zzso indicating that there is much more to zzso actions than prevention of zzso zzso Here, we consider the role of zzso in the viral zzso and explore the possibility that it might function directly in viral zzso zzso
