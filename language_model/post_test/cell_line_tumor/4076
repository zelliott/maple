zzso zzso zzso zzso is a rare tumor that is caused by zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso has been recently approved to treat adult patients with zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate changes in signaling pathways induced by zzso treatment in zzso zzso models, using the zzso protein array method zzso 

The human zzso cell line was used to assess in zzso and in zzso activity of zzso zzso extracts from zzso cells or zzso zzso mice, treated by increasing zzso of zzso for different periods of time, were zzso with a set of 12 zzso representing major signaling zzso using zzso zzso were validated using two distinct protein detection zzso Western zzso and zzso 

zzso displays zzso and zzso activities and zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso pathways were the two major signaling pathways inhibited by zzso Interestingly, zzso levels of zzso were significantly increased by zzso zzso results were obtained in both the in zzso and in zzso approaches, as well as for the protein detection zzso However, some discrepancies were observed between zzso and Western zzso possibly due to lack of specificity of the primary zzso zzso 

Overall, our results confirmed the interest of zzso for screening global changes induced in signaling pathways by zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified as the main pathways involved in zzso response in zzso zzso Our results also suggest alternative routes for controlling the disease, and provide a rationale for the development of therapeutic combinations based on the comprehensive identification of molecular events induced by zzso
