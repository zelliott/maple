Human zzso cells have been used as models for studying zzso drug transport through zzso zzso However, these models allow the transport of zzso drugs through zzso gap zzso This study aimed at investigating the differentiation patterns of zzso zzso cells under different culture conditions and establishing the appropriate model of in zzso zzso drug zzso zzso zzso was estimated by measuring the zzso electrical resistance zzso across zzso cell zzso The zzso expression levels of zzso in zzso clone 1 zzso and breast cancer resistance protein zzso and those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are zzso zzso proteins related to zzso ability of zzso differentiated from zzso protein expression levels were considered as the differentiation zzso The highest zzso values were obtained in the zzso cells cultured in the zzso modified zzso medium zzso zzso zzso mixed medium zzso ; zzso Sumitomo zzso zzso zzso Osaka, zzso By comparing the zzso values and the differentiation signals, the authors identified at least five zzso zzso zzso The differentiation pattern of zzso cultured in zzso resembled the zzso differentiation signal zzso in zzso In conclusion, the zzso models of zzso zzso cells cultured in zzso might be appropriate for evaluating drug transport across the zzso zzso
