We evaluated the pharmacological profiles of zzso zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso as a zzso Y zzso zzso zzso zzso This compound showed a highly selective in zzso affinity for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso relative to other zzso zzso zzso like zzso or zzso Its binding to zzso was found to be fully zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso in human embryonic kidney zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed sufficient oral availability and brain zzso of this compound accompanied with clear dose zzso We attempted to assess the selectivity of zzso and, zzso to zzso the zzso role of zzso in the following feeding experiments in normal zzso An zzso injection of zzso and zzso zzso zzso induced acute and robust feeding responses in zzso rats, and prior administration of zzso at the doses from 25 to 100 zzso clearly inhibited these responses by approximately 55 and zzso zzso This compound also showed zzso but transient suppression in natural feeding models of both overnight zzso zzso and spontaneous daily zzso zzso did not zzso food intake induced by the topical injection of zzso zzso or zzso acid zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso In addition, we confirmed the zzso activity profile of zzso by zzso zzso Taken together, we propose not only that our compound potentially expresses specific blockade of central zzso signals but also that zzso zzso would certainly contribute to zzso regulation of food intake in normal rats, as suggested from its zzso
