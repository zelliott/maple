zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso was considered to be an important factor in cancer cell zzso This study was aimed to examine the expression of zzso in zzso cancer and determine the functions and the possible mechanisms of zzso in the progression of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso expression in normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tumors, and 3 zzso cancer cell lines was zzso zzso analysis was used to detect the protein expression of zzso and zzso in normal and zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso zzso on cell proliferation and invasion was zzso 

zzso zzso zzso 4 was highly expressed in zzso zzso tumors and zzso cancer cell lines, and the different expression of zzso was observed between the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and without zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, The zzso expression was correlated with zzso expression in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso could obviously reduce proliferation and invasion of zzso cancer cell and inhibit zzso target genes and zzso markers such as zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso 4 plays a critical role in the zzso of human zzso cancer possibly through modulating the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 is a potential therapeutic target for treatment of zzso zzso
