The zzso is a zzso zzso protein complex composed of zzso zzso and zzso associated with protein trafficking within zzso Recently, a zzso point zzso within the zzso zzso zzso was linked to the manifestation of Parkinson's disease zzso Here, we investigated details underlying the molecular mechanism by which the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso function, including examination of zzso zzso zzso and its capacity to sort zzso We show that expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso redistributes zzso zzso to a zzso zzso zzso and that these zzso are enlarged in both model cell lines and zzso isolated from a zzso zzso zzso zzso is correctly folded and binds zzso and zzso with the same affinity as zzso zzso While zzso point zzso zzso zzso interacts with the zzso zzso zzso zzso a known zzso zzso we find that its expression zzso the trafficking of zzso D, a zzso zzso and zzso responsible for degradation of zzso a zzso agent of zzso In zzso we find that the expression of zzso zzso leads to zzso zzso and trafficking defects that may partly explain its action in zzso
