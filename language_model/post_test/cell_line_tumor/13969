In this report we present a zzso of 162 proteins (including zzso and zzso identified in a zzso of zzso map of breast cancer zzso This work represents the prosecution of previous studies describing the protein complement of breast cancer cells of the line zzso which has been well characterized for several zzso providing to be a useful model for the study of breast zzso candidate zzso In particular, 110 spots were identified ex zzso by zzso or validated following previous gel matching identification zzso 30 were identified by zzso zzso and the remaining by gel matching with maps available from our former zzso As a consequence of the expanded number of zzso we have updated our previous zzso extending the number of protein groups from 4 to zzso In order to facilitate comparative zzso studies of different kinds of breast zzso in this report we provide the whole complement of proteins so far identified and grouped into the new zzso A consistent number of them were not described before in other zzso maps of breast cancer cells or zzso and therefore they represent a valuable contribution for breast cancer protein databases and for future application in basic and clinical zzso
