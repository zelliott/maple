The zzso specific zzso protein zzso is zzso expressed in several zzso zzso zzso However, little is known about the functional consequences of zzso zzso Here, we investigated the function of zzso in human zzso melanoma zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso treatment reduced migration of the melanoma cell line zzso However, in melanoma patients, no correlation existed between zzso expression and tumor zzso This implied that additional factors such as zzso of zzso may influence its function in tumor zzso To investigate this further, zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso protein zzso were expressed in the zzso negative melanoma cell line zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso is zzso in zzso cells while zzso is zzso Although both zzso and zzso were targeted to, and promote the formation of, zzso zzso sites, zzso zzso to either zzso or isolated zzso zzso molecules was neither influenced by expression of zzso nor by expression of zzso when compared with zzso expressing control zzso In contrast, zzso but not zzso migration of melanoma cells towards either zzso or isolated zzso zzso molecules was similarly zzso if either zzso or zzso were expressed in zzso zzso Interestingly, only cells expressing the zzso zzso protein showed enhanced invasion into zzso In line with these findings the in zzso zzso capacity of mouse zzso melanoma cells zzso with expression and zzso of zzso These data show that an increase in melanoma cell zzso requires not only expression but also zzso of zzso
