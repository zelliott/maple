Acute zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso disease with diverse biological features in which disease progression at the level of zzso cells has a major impact on the resistance to chemotherapy and zzso The zzso blast cells in these elderly patients are often zzso by several zzso zzso that predict the poor treatment outcome, including high stem cell marker zzso zzso minimally or zzso features, high zzso zzso high zzso ratio, zzso zzso and more frequent internal tandem zzso zzso and zzso of class III zzso zzso zzso for key zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for stem cell zzso and zzso zzso for zzso Testing the new and more specific zzso therapeutic approaches in zzso zzso cells can provide the basis for a more effective combined zzso regimen and may consequently improve the treatment outcome in elderly zzso zzso zzso the present study was performed to evaluate whether stem cell zzso zzso can enhance the efficacy of the two main zzso drugs used in zzso therapy: zzso and zzso at low doses in zzso zzso zzso cells, in an attempt to identify a novel effective regimen with tolerable zzso for elderly zzso zzso The effect of zzso on each of the two zzso zzso zzso and necrosis was investigated in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells expressing zzso to determine its enhancing zzso zzso has significantly enhanced the low dose zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso respectively, zzso It has also exerted its significant enhancement activity on the low dose zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells in the presence of zzso zzso zzso has significantly enhanced the low dose zzso and zzso zzso reduction in zzso zzso zzso cells from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso respectively, zzso The addition of zzso has not altered the low dose zzso and zzso zzso reduction in zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso has also significantly enhanced the low dose zzso and zzso zzso reduction in zzso zzso zzso cells in the presence of zzso zzso The unique potent enhancing activity of zzso on low dose zzso zzso and necrosis in extremely resistant zzso cells suggest a novel promising role for the treatment of elderly zzso zzso Further studies are warranted to evaluate a similar enhancing effect for zzso in blast cells from elderly zzso patients in primary cultures before its introduction in a pilot clinical zzso In conclusion, the combination of zzso and the low dose zzso provides a promising solution for the dilemma of therapy in elderly zzso zzso
