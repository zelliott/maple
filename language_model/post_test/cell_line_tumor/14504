The zzso of the zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso is one of the key mechanisms underlying the development of resistance to tamoxifen in breast cancer zzso As zzso zzso the most active zzso present in green tea, has been shown to zzso zzso we studied the effects of zzso zzso zzso treatment on growth and invasion in a breast zzso cell line resistant to tamoxifen zzso zzso breast zzso cell line resistant to zzso zzso and parental zzso A zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression and protein level occurred after 50 zzso zzso treatment of zzso zzso zzso molecules on the plasma membrane surface of zzso cells significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was higher in zzso than in zzso and it was reduced by zzso zzso zzso zzso regulated zzso and zzso zzso were also zzso by zzso treatment and in zzso cell growth and invasion zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are implicated in cell invasion and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso able to activate zzso were significantly reduced after 50 zzso zzso zzso In keeping with this, zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso and zzso which zzso zzso increased after zzso zzso Altogether, the present data demonstrated that zzso could zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso could stop zzso cell growth and in zzso invasion through zzso of zzso and other molecules implicated in aggressive biological zzso The present data support the hypothesis that zzso is an interesting zzso to be investigated in zzso breast zzso
