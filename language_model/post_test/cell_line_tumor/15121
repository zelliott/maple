The detection of zzso zzso such as DNA and zzso plays a significant role in genetic engineering, zzso and zzso Traditional zzso acid zzso are mainly zzso which are potential zzso or groove zzso that show high preference only for zzso zzso We zzso present two versatile fluorescent zzso for zzso acid detection and zzso The zzso zzso derivatives zzso are induced by zzso to zzso thereby showing a novel phenomenon of zzso zzso zzso This kind of zzso property enables the zzso and zzso of zzso acids in zzso solution and zzso gels, zzso The zzso zzso can penetrate cells with a compromised plasma membrane easily but cannot enter live cells with an intact zzso thus making them useful for the differentiation between dead and live zzso On account of the high binding affinity to DNA, zzso can selectively label the zzso and zzso in fixed cells, which provides a simple and fast method for the observation of cell zzso zzso to their zzso zzso the dye molecules zzso in zzso regions and exert appreciable quantum efficiency as well as superior zzso
