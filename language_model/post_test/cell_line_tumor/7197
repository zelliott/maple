Giant cell tumor zzso offers a unique model for the zzso cell interaction in human bone zzso Evidence has been presented that zzso zzso cells zzso promote zzso size and activity of the giant zzso Although zzso are considered the zzso component of zzso little is known about their genetic basis and, to date, a zzso gene expression pattern has not been zzso zzso stem cells zzso have been identified as the origin of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Using state of the art array technology, expression profiling was applied to enriched zzso cell populations from five different zzso and two primary zzso as zzso Of the 29 zzso expressed genes found, 25 showed an increased zzso zzso zzso expression was verified by real-time zzso chain reaction analysis of 10 selected zzso supporting the zzso of zzso zzso as a tool to identify zzso genes in zzso Increased expression of two zzso zzso and zzso was substantiated at the protein level, utilizing zzso evaluation of zzso sections and zzso zzso Increased zzso of zzso zzso was also zzso
