zzso and zzso proteins are zzso zzso molecules whose interaction zzso zzso guidance and zzso precursor cell zzso During development zzso zzso proteins mediate zzso signals on cells expressing zzso zzso Because similar molecular mechanisms may be zzso in zzso cell invasion and zzso migration, we studied the expression of zzso and its zzso zzso zzso as well as their functional role in migration in zzso zzso zzso and zzso of human specimens revealed that zzso was distinctly expressed by zzso zzso but at only very low levels in zzso zzso and zzso zzso also was mainly restricted to zzso in the normal brain, whereas zzso tumor cells in zzso as well as zzso cell lines zzso zzso at zzso and protein zzso zzso human zzso in a concentration of zzso zzso was repulsive for zzso cell lines in a modified zzso chamber zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cell lines neutralized the repulsive effect of zzso demonstrating that zzso served as the major zzso zzso Our findings suggest that a zzso effect zzso by interaction of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cell guidance in the zzso
