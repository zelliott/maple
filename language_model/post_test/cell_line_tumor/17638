zzso of tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso to zzso and mature membrane zzso zzso zzso on the cell surface is required for zzso of zzso It has been reported that following binding to cell surface zzso zzso zzso zzso and extensive degradation in zzso The purpose of this study was to zzso the fate of zzso following binding to zzso zzso cell surface zzso at 4 degrees zzso Following 37 degrees C zzso zzso release, zzso and degradation were characterized under varying zzso More than zzso of the total zzso bound to cells was released as intact functional zzso zzso was zzso zzso of zzso cells with dominant negative zzso zzso zzso resulted in delayed zzso and release of zzso from zzso zzso agents that induce zzso of cell surface receptors zzso zzso and interfere with zzso function zzso zzso resulted in enhanced binding of zzso to cell surface zzso zzso of zzso of zzso with a zzso inhibitor prevented binding and zzso of zzso zzso of cell surface zzso followed by Western zzso confirmed the presence of mature zzso on the cell surface and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso In conclusion, these studies demonstrate that zzso is released from cells primarily as an intact functional zzso following binding to zzso on the cell zzso
