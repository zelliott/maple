zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and the zzso of zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso are both involved in prostate cancer and zzso In the present study, we demonstrated that the growth zzso effect of zzso is directly related to targeting zzso gene expression in zzso zzso zzso predicted three potential target sites zzso zzso and zzso of zzso in the 3' zzso region zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso reporter zzso were used to detect the effects of zzso zzso or zzso inhibitor on the zzso gene expression in zzso zzso The results indicated that zzso could inhibit zzso expression by directly targeting the zzso and zzso sites in the 3' zzso of the zzso zzso We then used zzso zzso reporter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso flow zzso and zzso zzso zzso to examine whether zzso zzso of zzso expression also affects the zzso zzso events, including zzso activity and zzso gene zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso We demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso was accompanied by zzso of zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso of cell zzso enhanced zzso and cell cycle arrest, and that loss function of zzso via zzso can zzso zzso accompanied by an increase of zzso activity and zzso zzso thereby enhancing cell zzso Altogether, these findings suggest that zzso may be novel therapeutic candidate for prostate zzso
