zzso zzso 17 zzso encodes a member of the zzso zzso zzso family of zzso factors involved in the regulation of embryonic development and in the determination of the cell zzso Recently, it was considered as a tumor zzso gene to inhibit zzso zzso signaling zzso in several zzso However, the function of zzso in zzso cancer was zzso zzso we investigated the zzso changes and the function of zzso in zzso zzso 

The zzso status of the promoter region of zzso was detected using zzso zzso in 63 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 normal zzso zzso and two zzso cancer cell zzso zzso zzso was used to assess zzso expression of zzso before and after zzso treatment in zzso cancer cell zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were detected by zzso in zzso and adjacent zzso zzso reporter zzso colony formation, zzso and Western zzso were employed to analyze the effect of zzso on zzso cancer cell proliferation and the function of zzso in the zzso signal zzso 

Loss of zzso expression was correlated to the promoter region zzso in zzso cancer cell zzso zzso of zzso was found in zzso cell line after zzso zzso In primary zzso cancer, zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso But no zzso was found in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was associated zzso with zzso expression in the zzso or nucleus significantly in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Colony formation was inhibited by zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso suppressed the zzso signaling zzso and the zzso domain was essential for this zzso 

zzso was frequently zzso in human zzso Loss of zzso expression was induced by promoter region zzso zzso inhibited zzso cancer zzso zzso of zzso activated the zzso signaling zzso in human zzso zzso
