Certain zzso viruses exploit activated Ras signaling in order to replicate in cancer zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is known to suppress the effectiveness of the zzso zzso zzso response, which may contribute to zzso viral zzso Here, we identified 10 human cancer cell lines (out of zzso with increased sensitivity to the zzso effects of zzso after treatment with the zzso inhibitor zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso zzso their reduced sensitivity to zzso To determine how zzso suppresses the zzso response in these cells, we used DNA zzso to compare zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, moderately resistant zzso cells, and zzso cells treated with zzso We found that 267 genes were induced by zzso in zzso cells, while only 98 genes were induced in zzso cells at the same time zzso Furthermore, the expression of a distinct subset of zzso zzso zzso that included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was restored or increased in zzso cells when the cells were zzso with zzso and zzso zzso analysis of the biological processes represented by these genes revealed increased representation of genes involved in the zzso response, regulation of zzso cell differentiation and zzso Furthermore, introduction of zzso active Ras into zzso sensitive zzso cells reduced their zzso sensitivity and ability to activate zzso zzso This work demonstrates for the first time that activated zzso in human cancer cells zzso zzso of a specific subset of zzso zzso
