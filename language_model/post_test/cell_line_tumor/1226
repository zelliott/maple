zzso zzso B is a downstream target of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and plays a critical role in promotion of cell zzso The function of zzso zzso zzso is required by many zzso factors to either activate or repress gene zzso Here, we show that induction of zzso enhances the zzso stability of zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, repression of zzso by zzso zzso zzso degradation through the zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso activity of the zzso In addition, zzso interacts with the zzso and the activity of zzso is required to maintain the zzso level of zzso Our study provides a new insight into the molecular mechanisms by which the critical concentration of zzso protein is regulated and suggests a role for zzso in control of various cellular activities through the zzso zzso zzso
