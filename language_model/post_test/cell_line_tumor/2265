Breast cancer is a disease in which cancer cells form in the zzso of the zzso The present study aimed to explore the effect of the zzso compound zzso on the growth and zzso of human breast cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso 25, 50, 100, 200 zzso of zzso were applied to cultured zzso human breast cancer cells for defined lengths of zzso At 50 to 200 zzso doses, zzso significantly inhibited the proliferation of zzso cells assessed by zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso manners ( zzso The compound also increased zzso after 48 h of exposure ( zzso Furthermore, following zzso treatment zzso expression decreased significantly while zzso expression increased significantly ( zzso In brief, zzso zzso cell growth and zzso zzso in zzso human breast cancer zzso The mechanisms behind these effects may stem from the zzso of zzso protein expression and zzso of zzso zzso
