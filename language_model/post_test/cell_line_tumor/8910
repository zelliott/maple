Human steroid zzso zzso plays an important role in regulating the formation of biologically active zzso and may be a promising target for treating zzso zzso The molecular mechanism of zzso gene zzso however, is still not zzso Growth factors are known to increase zzso activity but the changes in zzso expression have not been completely zzso To determine whether zzso growth factor zzso can induce zzso gene zzso the effects of zzso on zzso expression were studied in zzso human prostate cancer zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis showed that zzso treatment significantly increased the expression of zzso zzso and protein in zzso and zzso zzso To understand the signaling zzso by which zzso zzso zzso gene zzso the effects of specific zzso and zzso zzso were zzso When the cells were treated with zzso and zzso zzso such as zzso zzso or zzso inhibitor IV, zzso expression induced by zzso was significantly zzso Moreover, we found that zzso zzso such as zzso zzso Bay zzso or Nemo binding domain zzso binding zzso also strongly prevented zzso from inducing zzso gene zzso We assessed whether zzso activates zzso promoter activity using transient zzso with a zzso zzso zzso significantly zzso zzso reporter zzso Furthermore, zzso induced expression of zzso zzso zzso 1 and 3, whereas it reduced zzso zzso zzso gene zzso causing enhanced zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, these results strongly suggest that zzso zzso zzso expression via a zzso signaling zzso in zzso cells and may induce zzso production and zzso zzso
