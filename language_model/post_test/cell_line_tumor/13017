RB plays an essential role in DNA zzso growth arrest and regulates the expression of several factors essential for DNA repair zzso However, how RB coordinates DNA damage response through zzso regulation of genes involved in growth arrest remains largely zzso We examined whether RB can mediate the response to DNA damage through zzso of zzso a zinc zzso zzso zzso that can zzso the expression of zzso a DNA damage response zzso to induce cell cycle arrest in response to DNA zzso We found that the zzso promoter contains an authentic zzso sequence that specifically binds zzso but not zzso or zzso together with zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso to form a repression complex that suppresses zzso zzso Furthermore, loss of zzso zzso repression led to an increase in zzso transcript levels, zzso with increased sensitivity to ultraviolet zzso and zzso zzso DNA zzso Taken together, these results suggest that the zzso zzso interacting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complex plays a critical role in zzso zzso repression, and loss of this repression may contribute to cellular sensitivity of DNA damage, ultimately leading to zzso
