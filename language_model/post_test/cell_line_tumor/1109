zzso zzso DNA segments zzso have been shown to form discrete zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of the number of such zzso in zzso cell nucleus with estimated number of simultaneously active replication zzso zzso suggests that each replication focus contains a cluster of about 10 to 20 closely associated zzso That implied the cluster of zzso activated zzso as the primary unit of zzso DNA zzso It still remains unclear whether such zzso of zzso does mean zzso of the zzso in a zzso location zzso zzso model 1), or it arises from transient zzso of the zzso from different DNA zzso at the functioning replication machinery zzso zzso model zzso In this study we used conventional zzso zzso of the zzso treated zzso preparations to investigate replication zzso at the optical resolution zzso Human zzso cells were labeled with zzso for different time zzso We synchronized the cell culture with zzso to be able to measure an average increase in DNA content during labeling period using DNA zzso Under these conditions, zzso appear as multiple small zzso zzso zzso Further studies revealed that most of such zzso of replication represent optical zzso spots, which are standard in size and different in zzso The number of the zzso and variation of their brightness mostly depend on the extent of zzso zzso zzso zzso control of the synchronized cells peak movement allowed us to measure mean DNA content of the zzso In case of most effective zzso treatment, a zzso contains about 40 zzso of labeled DNA, and the general number of the zzso approaches the number of zzso that are simultaneously active in a given moment of zzso zzso of the effect of zzso treatment on overall number of observed zzso suggests that replication zzso in early and mid zzso cells do not represent stable structures, but rather arise from functional zzso of comparatively distant replicating regions, thus supporting model zzso
