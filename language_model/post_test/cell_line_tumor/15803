A new zzso platinum compound zzso zzso zzso has been zzso and zzso The activity of the compound against three human zzso cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso its cell zzso and level of binding with DNA have been zzso zzso is found to be less active than zzso against parent zzso cell line but more active than zzso against the zzso and zzso resistant cell lines indicated by the lower resistance zzso The results indicate that at the level of its activity zzso has been better able to overcome mechanisms of resistance operating in zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso has higher cellular zzso of platinum than zzso in the zzso and zzso resistant cell lines but lower than zzso in the parents zzso cell zzso zzso binds with DNA forming mainly zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that cause local zzso of DNA zzso In contrast, zzso is expected to bind with DNA to form mainly zzso long-range zzso zzso that would induce more of a global change in DNA zzso
