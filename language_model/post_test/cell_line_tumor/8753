zzso DNA binding protein 2 zzso binds zzso promoters and suppresses zzso in zzso through recruitment of a zzso modification zzso zzso We show here a new mechanism of action for zzso suppression of gene expression indirectly through zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso in breast zzso cell line zzso results in induced expression and zzso of zzso while depletion of zzso in a human breast cancer cell lines zzso and zzso results in suppression of zzso zzso of zzso by zzso is associated with zzso of several of its target genes while depletion of zzso leads to induction of zzso target zzso zzso of zzso by locked zzso acid zzso zzso zzso leads to zzso of these target genes in zzso zzso cells supporting that zzso is zzso in part the effects of zzso on gene zzso We demonstrate that zzso binds the promoter of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cells and that it activates an in zzso zzso zzso promoter driving a zzso zzso reporter in a transient zzso zzso The zzso of zzso is associated with reduced zzso of the zzso Taken together these results describe a novel cascade for gene regulation by DNA zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso by zzso that is associated with loss of zzso triggers repression of downstream zzso
