We previously zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso that strongly inhibited the growth of tumor zzso We identified its molecular target, investigated its effects on cellular signaling zzso and examined its zzso efficacy and toxicity in zzso 

We used zzso analysis of zzso zzso from 39 human cancer cell lines and identified zzso zzso zzso as a molecular target for zzso zzso was zzso from zzso cell zzso and its activity was measured by assessing the incorporation of zzso into zzso We used the crystal structure of the zzso complex to model the binding of zzso to zzso (where zzso is a known zzso zzso zzso downstream activity was analyzed by zzso zzso activity of zzso was examined against zzso zzso and zzso zzso in nude zzso zzso of zzso a zzso protein zzso and a major signaling component downstream of zzso was assessed in zzso by zzso 

zzso was identified as a molecular target for zzso by zzso zzso We confirmed that zzso directly inhibited zzso activity more efficiently than the zzso inhibitor zzso At zzso of 1 zzso zzso and zzso reduced zzso activity to zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso respectively, of the zzso control zzso zzso modeling of the zzso complex indicated that zzso could bind to the zzso pocket of zzso zzso inhibited zzso of signaling components downstream from zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso a decrease in zzso D1 zzso zzso administered orally to mice had strong zzso activity against human cancer zzso without toxic effects in critical zzso zzso zzso was reduced in zzso tumors after oral administration of zzso 

zzso is a new zzso inhibitor with strong zzso activity against human cancer zzso without toxic effects in critical zzso zzso merits further investigation as an zzso zzso
