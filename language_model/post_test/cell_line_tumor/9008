zzso radiation zzso is one of the most common zzso encountered by humans and zzso the formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso To prevent the zzso of deleterious zzso these zzso must be efficiently zzso primarily by zzso zzso zzso We have previously demonstrated that the zzso family of nuclear receptors are crucial zzso of the DNA repair function of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso Here we explore the role of the zzso protein in the DNA repair process zzso Using zzso zzso we have demonstrated a zzso induced recruitment to distinct nuclear zzso where they zzso with known DNA repair zzso We reveal that the zzso domain of the zzso is required for this zzso and identify a role for zzso and zzso zzso in this zzso zzso disruption of the functional integrity of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso by deleting the terminal zzso 12 effectively blocks zzso of the zzso with DNA repair zzso Restored zzso of the zzso zzso with DNA repair proteins in the presence of a zzso zzso zzso suggests that impaired zzso accessibility zzso the zzso zzso Finally zzso zzso facilitated a more efficient clearance of zzso induced zzso and zzso zzso Taken together these data uncover a novel role for the zzso nuclear receptors as direct zzso of zzso zzso zzso
