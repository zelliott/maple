zzso one of the zzso zzso is involved in the formation of cell membrane processes such as zzso and zzso and acts as a zzso zzso Its zzso expression zzso with development and progression of several human zzso However, the expression of zzso and its role in lung cancer are currently zzso In this study, we performed zzso small interfering zzso zzso in two lung cancer cell lines and examined the effects on zzso zzso in cancer cells by using zzso zzso wound healing, and chamber zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced the zzso migration, and invasion of lung cancer cells in zzso To address the possible mechanisms, we evaluated the expression of zzso molecules zzso and zzso by Western zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction zzso The results demonstrated that zzso of zzso reduced zzso and increased zzso at the protein level but had no effects on their zzso levels, suggesting zzso regulation of these two zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso restored zzso expression of zzso and decreased zzso zzso in lung cancer zzso In addition, zzso expression was zzso evaluated on 135 normal and 183 lung cancer zzso The expression of zzso was significantly higher in cancer samples than paired zzso normal lung zzso In normal zzso zzso zzso was mainly localized on the zzso zzso while in lung zzso and zzso zzso zzso was primarily distributed in zzso Among lung cancer zzso expression of zzso was higher in the invasive front of primary zzso and the highest in zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso expression correlated significantly with zzso zzso and advanced zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso may play a crucial role in governing the biological behavior of lung zzso
