The zzso zzso zzso yields the zzso fusion zzso which contributes to the development of Ewing Family zzso zzso Previous studies have shown the ability of zzso zzso protein to silence zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that the introduction of zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso of zzso at zzso and depletion of zzso protein by small interfering zzso zzso in zzso cells facilitated it in response to DNA zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso by zzso suppressed its zzso activity and enhanced zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso study shows that zzso region of zzso associated with zzso zzso 1 zzso to forms a complex with zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso or zzso protein restored the expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso also significantly inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso A zzso promoted zzso interaction and recruitment of zzso zzso to promoter regions of its target genes zzso and zzso consequently inducing zzso and stabilizing the zzso of zzso at zzso together with the zzso of zzso and zzso which were impaired in zzso cells after the zzso of zzso zzso Our data indicate zzso might zzso zzso to inhibit its zzso function and protein stability via the recruitment of zzso These results might zzso a novel molecular mechanism about the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso
