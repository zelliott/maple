The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy of iron zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at the same zzso dose in a mouse zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso dose equivalent to 60 zzso at zzso zzso was delivered to a zzso mouse zzso zzso flank zzso zzso via zzso or locally delivered zzso zzso zzso was generated with zzso zzso zzso magnetic zzso Following zzso delivery, the zzso was exposed to an alternating magnetic field zzso The zzso zzso treatment was delivered by a zzso zzso surface zzso Time required for the zzso to reach three times the treatment volume was used as the primary study zzso Acute pathological effects of the treatments were determined using conventional zzso zzso 

zzso delivered zzso resulted in a modest improvement in treatment efficacy as compared to zzso zzso zzso when prescribed to the same zzso zzso zzso treated with zzso also demonstrated reduced zzso normal tissue zzso 

Our results demonstrate similar zzso treatment efficacy when zzso heating is delivered by locally delivered zzso and zzso zzso at the same measured zzso zzso However, zzso treatments did not result in the same type or level of zzso damage seen with the zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso is capable of improving the therapeutic ratio for locally delivered zzso zzso These results further indicate that this improvement is due to improved heat zzso in the zzso
