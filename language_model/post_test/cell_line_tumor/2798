Besides functioning as the plasma zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after a zzso zzso In the present study, we further investigated zzso zzso zzso By using both zzso libraries and a library of zzso zzso a zzso preference for a zzso zzso in zzso was determined, suggesting that zzso might have a dual specificity and that, in addition to zzso other zzso zzso might zzso Previous studies revealed that zzso is involved in the zzso of the nervous system, as it zzso in zzso maturation and enhances nerve zzso We investigated whether zzso zzso activity is involved in these zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso inactive zzso had a similar effect in the expression of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso in zzso zzso excluding the involvement of zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso However, zzso was able to cleave zzso zzso zzso zzso probably contributing to the increased zzso levels reported in zzso zzso To assess the involvement of zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso outgrowth of cells cultivated with zzso zzso or zzso was zzso zzso grown with zzso displayed decreased zzso zzso thereby suggesting that zzso zzso activity is important for its function as a zzso zzso By showing that zzso is able to cleave zzso and that its zzso activity affects zzso growth, the present study shows that zzso has natural zzso in the nervous system, establishing further its relevance in zzso
