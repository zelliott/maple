zzso degradation is the most zzso pathological change during zzso zzso Furthermore, accumulating evidence suggests that an excess of zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role in the breakdown of zzso Here, the effects of zzso on the expression of zzso in zzso SW zzso zzso cells were zzso In addition, the in zzso effects of zzso on an experimental rat model of zzso induced by anterior cruciate ligament zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with or without zzso and zzso and zzso signaling zzso zzso then were zzso with zzso In rats, experimental zzso was induced by zzso These rats then received zzso injections of vehicle, signaling zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were verified by western zzso In addition, levels of zzso zzso were detected using quantitative real-time zzso In zzso zzso treatment with zzso reduced the number of cartilage zzso zzso In addition, treatment with zzso was associated with lower levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in both zzso zzso zzso cells and in the rat zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso effect of zzso on zzso was greater than that exhibited by other signaling zzso zzso Overall, these data suggest that zzso has therapeutic potential for the treatment of zzso
