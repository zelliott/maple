Cellular and tissue imaging in the zzso zzso zzso between 700 and 900 zzso is advantageous for in zzso imaging because of the low zzso of biological molecules in this zzso This unit presents protocols for small animal imaging using zzso and zzso lifetime imaging zzso Included is an overview of zzso zzso imaging of cells and small animals using zzso organic zzso zzso and zzso imaging zzso The development, advantages, and application of zzso fluorescent zzso that have been used for in zzso imaging are also zzso The use of zzso agents in conjunction with visible zzso and considerations in selecting imaging agents are zzso We conclude with practical considerations for the use of these zzso in cell and small animal imaging zzso
