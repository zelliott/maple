It has been well established that tumor necrosis factor related zzso zzso zzso effectively zzso zzso in tumor zzso However, tumor resistance to zzso especially of zzso tumor cells, has become a major problem in the potential use of TRAIL in clinical zzso Among many factors that contribute to TRAIL resistance, zzso of zzso is commonly seen in many kinds of tumors, particularly in zzso In this study, we developed a zzso system that encodes zzso human TRAIL zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso of zzso zzso zzso The efficiency of zzso zzso infecting different zzso cell lines was assessed by flow zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction and Western zzso zzso were carried out to evaluate the expression of TRAIL and zzso in zzso cells after zzso We also examined the growth zzso effect of zzso zzso on zzso cell proliferation by zzso zzso Counting zzso zzso and its effect on bystander cells by flow zzso zzso The results showed that zzso cells were effectively infected by zzso zzso and that TRAIL was zzso expressed and zzso expression was zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso of this study demonstrated that zzso induced zzso in bystander cells as well as infected zzso cells and inhibited the growth of zzso zzso
