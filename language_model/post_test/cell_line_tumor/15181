The cancer invasion front zzso a zzso area due to the frequent presence of zzso zzso reaction, represents a cancer site where many hallmarks of cancer zzso zzso It is now strongly suggested that the zzso zzso holds crucial information for determining tumor development and zzso Despite extensive research on zzso cell interactions at zzso the exact zzso molecular network that is zzso into the zzso of the zzso and cancer zzso remains partially zzso Here, we interrogated the signaling pathways and the molecular functional signatures across the zzso of a zzso zzso model system of zzso cancer zzso We discovered a group of bone zzso protein zzso zzso that coordinates major biological programs in zzso including cell zzso invasion, migration and differentiation zzso Using a mathematical model of cancer cell zzso coupled to in zzso cell migration zzso we demonstrated that the prominent zzso zzso zzso zzso may trigger zzso of cancer cell zzso Our data collectively demonstrate that the zzso zzso deploy a zzso signature, based on zzso zzso in order to regulate the zzso fates of cancer cell zzso invading the adjacent zzso
