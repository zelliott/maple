zzso binding peptides zzso zzso may serve as tools to explore protein zzso and disrupt zzso zzso The quality of the protein scaffold, by which the binding zzso is constrained and zzso is of crucial zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso is our most recent development in the zzso zzso scaffold zzso zzso A naturally uses three surfaces to interact with its zzso zzso zzso zzso insertions at all three zzso zzso zzso in the zzso scaffold can be expressed in zzso zzso and human cells, and displayed as a fusion to truncated zzso on zzso zzso that bind to zzso can show improved binding in protein zzso when presented by the zzso zzso zzso zzso libraries have been screened for zzso to the zzso domain of zzso and to a zzso derived from zzso specific to zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso allows specific interaction with zzso in human zzso Together, our results show that zzso zzso zzso including zzso can be used for a variety of applications in cellular and molecular zzso We will henceforth refer to zzso zzso engineered proteins as zzso
