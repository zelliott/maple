The zzso domain of zzso proteins was regarded as indispensable for zzso induction and for mutual regulation of family zzso We recently described zzso a zzso zzso product of the zzso zzso which lacks zzso but encloses zzso zzso and a zzso zzso It remained however zzso how zzso may trigger zzso efficient zzso zzso was zzso in an zzso zzso under zzso zzso The construct resulted in significant zzso induction in melanoma and zzso cell lines with up to 50% zzso cells as well as decreased cell proliferation and zzso zzso of zzso membrane potential, and zzso c release clearly indicated zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso were activated as shown by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso appeared as an essential and initial zzso zzso was critically dependent on either zzso or zzso and zzso was zzso in zzso double knockout conditions as well by zzso of zzso or zzso A direct interaction with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso was however not seen by zzso Thus besides zzso zzso there exists an additional way for mutual regulation of zzso zzso which is independent of the zzso This zzso appears to play a supplementary role also for other zzso family members, and its unraveling may help to overcome therapy resistance in zzso
