We used a combination of fluorescence, circular zzso zzso and zzso zzso in conjunction with size exclusion zzso to help zzso the relative zzso zzso and zzso activities of a series of zzso and zzso model zzso peptides zzso in terms of their structural zzso When compared with zzso zzso zzso peptides had greater activity against zzso bacteria, two zzso cancer cell lines, and zzso zzso zzso which they were capable of killing without causing zzso In contrast, incorporation of zzso did not have a consistent effect on zzso activity against zzso zzso In zzso zzso structures with high zzso content were adopted by both zzso and zzso zzso In solution, zzso generally adopted zzso structures unless their sequences comprised more zzso zzso acids or until zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso peptides resisted ordering induced by either zzso The roles of the angle zzso by positively charged zzso acids and the positioning of the zzso zzso were also zzso zzso positioning of zzso zzso in zzso sequences is required to enable the zzso to resist ordering and maintain optimal zzso activity, whereas varying the angle zzso by positively charged zzso acids can zzso zzso potential albeit with a modest reduction in zzso Maintaining zzso flexibility improves zzso potency and selectivity toward zzso zzso and zzso cells while enabling the targeting of zzso zzso
