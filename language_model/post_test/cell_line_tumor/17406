The alignment of full-length human zzso sequences to the finished sequence of the human zzso provides a unique opportunity to study the distribution of genes throughout the zzso By analyzing the distances between zzso zzso we identified a class of zzso transcribed gene pairs, representing more than zzso of the genes in the zzso whose zzso start sites are separated by less than 1000 base zzso Although this zzso arrangement has been previously described in humans and other species, the prevalence of zzso gene pairs in the human zzso is striking, and the mechanisms of regulation of all but a few zzso genes are zzso Our work shows that the transcripts of many zzso pairs are zzso but some are zzso Further, we show that many of the promoter segments between two zzso genes initiate zzso in both directions and contain shared elements that regulate both zzso We also show that the zzso arrangement is often zzso among mouse zzso These findings demonstrate that a zzso arrangement provides a unique mechanism of regulation for a significant number of zzso zzso
