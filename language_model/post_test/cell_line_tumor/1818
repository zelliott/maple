To investigate the correlation of zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso to cervical cancer progression and prognosis by examining zzso expression levels in different cervical zzso and cell zzso 

zzso cervical tissue samples zzso were collected for zzso zzso while fresh cervical tissue samples zzso and human cervical cell lines were collected for protein and zzso detection by quantitative real-time zzso and western zzso zzso zzso between zzso expression levels to cancer zzso features and prognosis were statistically zzso 

Both zzso zzso and protein expression gradually increased from normal to zzso zzso zzso and cervical cancer zzso ( zzso Furthermore, zzso expression level was zzso to tumor stage ( zzso zzso grades ( zzso zzso zzso ( zzso vascular invasion ( zzso zzso invasive depth ( zzso tumor size ( zzso and zzso infection ( zzso In zzso zzso zzso and protein were expressed strongly both in zzso and zzso but little was seen in zzso and zzso ( zzso More importantly, zzso of zzso zzso significantly poorer survival in cervical zzso zzso rank zzso although it was not an independent predictor for prognosis according to zzso analysis zzso 

These results suggest that higher zzso expression is closely associated with cervical cancer zzso aggressive behaviors and poorer zzso indicating that zzso may function as a novel tumor marker, a prospective zzso indicator and a potential therapeutic target for cervical zzso
