Regulators of zzso in acute zzso leukemia zzso have been extensively studied and are considered excellent therapeutic zzso zzso zzso with zzso recruitment domain zzso an zzso protein originally found to be involved in zzso of cardiac cells, was recently demonstrated to be zzso in several solid zzso To assess its importance in zzso we zzso ARC expression in zzso newly diagnosed zzso patients using a validated robust zzso protein array and correlated ARC levels with clinical zzso ARC was zzso expressed in samples from patients with zzso ARC level was not associated with zzso groups or with zzso zzso zzso However, patients with low or medium ARC protein levels had significantly better outcomes than those with high ARC zzso longer overall survival zzso zzso or zzso vs zzso weeks, P zzso zzso and longer zzso duration zzso zzso or zzso vs zzso weeks, P zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that ARC was a statistically significant independent predictor of survival in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of ARC promoted zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest that ARC expression levels are highly zzso in zzso and that ARC is a potential therapeutic target in zzso
