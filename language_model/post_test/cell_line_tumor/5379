The objective of this paper was to study the change of zzso and zzso in the zzso of zzso cells induced by zzso 

The proliferation zzso rates of zzso cells after various treatments were examined by zzso zzso zzso rate was determined with zzso zzso zzso double zzso by flow zzso The expression and distribution change of the zzso zzso zzso were detected by zzso zzso The changes of zzso zzso and zzso proteins were detected by Western zzso 

The zzso of leukemia cell line zzso are inhibited by zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso can inhibit the proliferation of the zzso cell, and the zzso was dependent on both dose and zzso The zzso of 72 hours was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rate detected by zzso zzso was zzso to the concentration of the zzso After the zzso zzso test, the zzso was located in the cell nucleus and zzso showing deep brown, when adding zzso to zzso zzso Western zzso test showed that the zzso proteins expression was zzso to the concentration of zzso and was also dose zzso The levels of zzso in negative control group, 1/2 zzso of 72 hours group and zzso of 72 hours group were zzso 8 zzso zzso 2, zzso 2 zzso zzso 3 and zzso 6 zzso zzso 5 respectively, and the levels of zzso proteins were zzso 4 zzso zzso 9, zzso 8 zzso zzso 9 and zzso 1 zzso zzso 9 zzso The difference was statistically significant when compared with the negative control group zzso zzso zzso 

zzso can significantly induce zzso cells zzso and its mechanism may be related to the zzso of zzso
