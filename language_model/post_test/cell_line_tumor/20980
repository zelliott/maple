zzso zzso which include the natural product zzso represent a promising class of zzso agents that target zzso zzso Two synthetic zzso zzso compounds zzso and zzso have been characterized with regard to their zzso activities versus human cancer cells, as well as the mode, zzso and specificity with which they bind to the zzso zzso zzso structural motif formed in the presence of zzso zzso by human zzso zzso Both compounds exhibit zzso activities versus human zzso zzso zzso and oral zzso zzso cells, with associated zzso values ranging from zzso to zzso The compounds bind solely to the zzso zzso acid form, but not to the duplex or triplex zzso zzso to the zzso is associated with a zzso of two zzso molecules per DNA zzso with one zzso zzso binding to each end of the host zzso via a zzso zzso zzso mode of zzso For both compounds, zzso binding is primarily zzso driven, while also being associated with a negative change in heat zzso These zzso properties reflect contributions from favorable zzso zzso in the loop zzso zzso of the zzso but not from changes in net zzso The zzso and mode of binding revealed by our studies have profound implications with regard to the number of zzso molecules that can potentially bind the zzso region of human zzso zzso
