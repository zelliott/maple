zzso zzso T cells orchestrate the zzso immune responses against zzso We have previously shown that zzso T cells recognize zzso class zzso myeloma cells indirectly by collaborating with zzso zzso zzso here, zzso that this critical step may be dependent on zzso of zzso zzso by cancer zzso This was investigated using zzso zzso mice, in which zzso T cells mediate rejection of zzso zzso myeloma zzso We analyzed the immune response against myeloma cell zzso which either zzso or retain zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results reveal that zzso T cells helped by zzso are capable of detecting zzso tumor zzso from zzso class zzso cancer zzso However, Id zzso was required for successful myeloma zzso zzso zzso resulted in stronger zzso of zzso zzso zzso T cells in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by at least some cancer cells within a tumor was shown to facilitate zzso Treatment by local injection of zzso zzso zzso successfully enhanced immunity against zzso myeloma zzso zzso the data indicate that zzso concentration within the tumor zzso zzso must reach a certain threshold to allow successful cancer zzso by zzso T zzso
