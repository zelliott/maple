zzso technology has become highly valuable for identifying complex global changes in gene expression zzso Standard techniques measure changes in total cellular zzso zzso zzso The assumption that changes in gene expression as measured by these techniques are directly and well correlated with changes in rates of new gene synthesis form the basis of attempts to connect coordinated changes in gene expression with shared zzso regulatory zzso Yet systematic attempts at this approach remain difficult to demonstrate zzso One reason for this difficulty may result from the intricate convergence of both zzso and zzso turnover events which, together, directly influence zzso zzso zzso Recent technical advances have led to the successful zzso and application of nuclear zzso procedures directly to zzso This development has allowed a zzso comparison between new gene synthesis in the nucleus and measured changes in total cellular zzso zzso zzso from these studies have begun to challenge the strict interpretation of changes in gene expression measured by conventional zzso as being closely correlated with changes in zzso zzso rate, but rather they tend to support the significant expansion of the role played by changes in zzso stability regulation to standard analyses of gene zzso Gene expression profiles obtained from both zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso across a time course of one hour following the zzso of human zzso T cells with zzso plus zzso revealed that regulation of zzso stability may account for as much as 50% of all zzso of changes in total cellular zzso zzso in this zzso zzso regulation was zzso by the absence of corresponding regulation of nuclear gene zzso activity for groups of genes strongly regulated at the whole cell level and which were also resistant to zzso by zzso D zzso zzso patterns across the time course were observed for both transcribed and zzso zzso It is proposed that the regulation of zzso stability in response to external stimuli contributes significantly to observed changes in gene expression as measured by high zzso zzso
