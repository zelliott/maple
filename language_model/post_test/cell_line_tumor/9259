zzso zzso is the major zzso on the envelope of avian influenza virus zzso Therefore we constructed two zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso with the zzso domain zzso derived from zzso and zzso expressing zzso zzso with the zzso derived from zzso envelope protein zzso After infection, zzso with either zzso was expressed and anchored on the plasma membrane of zzso cells, as revealed by zzso zzso zzso electron zzso demonstrated that both zzso and zzso displayed zzso on the viral zzso However, analyses of zzso viruses revealed that significantly more zzso was incorporated into zzso than into zzso In comparison with zzso zzso significantly improved the gene delivery and zzso expression in zzso cells, as determined by quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction and flow zzso zzso zzso significantly higher zzso zzso zzso in mouse models than zzso and the negative zzso These data collectively confirmed that the zzso zzso in comparison with zzso zzso resulted in more efficient zzso incorporation into zzso more efficient zzso delivery and zzso and elevated zzso This is the first report demonstrating the potential of zzso zzso as an avian influenza vaccine and that the choice of zzso tremendously affects zzso properties and vaccine zzso
