The study was aimed to detect expression rate of zzso gene in zzso cell and to explore the relationship between its expression and clinical zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression were analyzed by using reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso The results zzso zzso the zzso gene expression was detected in zzso cell zzso By treatment with zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cell gradually decreased along with time delay and almost could not be detected at the zzso zzso zzso the positive and negative rate of zzso zzso expression was zzso and zzso respectively, while in all 36 cases of de zzso and zzso zzso patients, the zzso fusion gene expression was zzso In 22 cases at zzso stage, the zzso fusion gene expression was negative, and the positive and negative rate of zzso zzso expression was zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso expression positive rates in the de zzso group, zzso group and zzso fusion gene zzso positive group were obviously higher than those in zzso period group zzso zzso zzso and were significantly lower than those in acute leukemia group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whether the zzso zzso expression was positive or negative in 36 cases of de zzso and zzso zzso patients, all the 36 cases could obtain complete zzso 4 zzso patients with positive expression of zzso zzso had zzso and serious infection (one patient zzso The clinical symptom showed slight skin or zzso zzso fever and zzso in the patients with negative expression of zzso zzso When 2 zzso patients with positive expression of zzso zzso had been treated with zzso induction differentiation sign in their peripheral blood and bone zzso figures was not zzso It is concluded that the zzso gene positive expression rate is lower in acute zzso leukemia than that in any other types of leukemia and is related to clinical zzso
