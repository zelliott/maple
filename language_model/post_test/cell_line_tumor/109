As part of our effort to understand the mechanism underlying zzso zzso zzso E zzso zzso zzso effects, we investigated the signaling zzso by which zzso suppresses zzso zzso zzso expression in prostate cancer zzso zzso and, to a greater extent, its truncated zzso zzso zzso zzso repression of zzso in prostate cancer cells but not in normal prostate zzso zzso a finding that underscores the differential zzso of normal versus zzso cells to the zzso effect of these zzso This zzso repression was attributable to the ability of zzso and zzso to facilitate the zzso degradation of the zzso factor zzso This zzso link was zzso by the finding that zzso zzso or zzso expression of zzso protected cells against drug-induced zzso zzso Furthermore, evidence suggests that the zzso of zzso by zzso and zzso resulted from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso as a consequence of increased zzso activity of protein zzso 2A zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with the zzso zzso zzso zzso drug-induced zzso repression, whereas zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity or zzso of zzso activity by zzso acid protected zzso from zzso and zzso zzso From a zzso perspective, the ability of zzso and zzso to activate zzso activity underscores their broad spectrum of effects on multiple signaling mechanisms, including those zzso by zzso zzso protein zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso and zzso This zzso effect in conjunction with low toxicity suggests the zzso potential for developing zzso into potent zzso agents for cancer zzso
