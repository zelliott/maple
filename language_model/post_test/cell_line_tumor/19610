Recent findings have established zzso as an important zzso regulator in zzso pathways leading from DNA damage to release of zzso zzso c and subsequent zzso of zzso zzso Yet, the molecular map connecting the embarking stimuli of zzso stress with zzso zzso remains to be zzso Here, we address the question of potential zzso regulators by examining zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso human colon zzso zzso zzso was observed only in zzso cells and was preceded by zzso zzso zzso although no direct interaction between zzso and zzso was observed in the cell system used, our data clearly demonstrate that a functional connection between these two proteins is essential for initiation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso include zzso complex proteins zzso and zzso Surprisingly, the presence of a complex encompassing at least zzso zzso and zzso was verified in both zzso and zzso cells, also in the absence of zzso zzso Thus, our results confirm the participation of zzso and zzso in zzso complex formation but question their role as sole zzso of zzso zzso This assumption was further supported by zzso zzso targeting zzso or zzso In conclusion, our findings support the hypothesis of zzso as an upstream regulator of zzso activity and provide data concerning zzso processing zzso As suppression of zzso expression in zzso cells also affects the level of the zzso zzso possibilities of a zzso interaction between these proteins are zzso
