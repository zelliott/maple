In zzso zzso zzso achievement of complete zzso with zzso chemotherapy remains a challenging issue, as most patients who respond remain zzso whereas those zzso have few options of being rescued with salvage zzso The mechanisms underlying zzso zzso and how it can be zzso remain zzso We previously reported the frequent zzso of the zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso by concurrent promoter zzso and zzso occurs frequently in primary zzso samples and zzso cell zzso zzso patients with zzso with zzso zzso presented lower complete zzso rate zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso and shorter overall survival zzso zzso zzso than those with zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso repression may mediate tumor zzso zzso by combining in zzso and in zzso studies of human zzso grown in zzso zzso mice and of zzso zzso zzso zzso generated in zzso and zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso is dictated by zzso gene dosage and is zzso on zzso zzso by genetic manipulation or after treatment with zzso zzso We suggest that the combination of zzso zzso and high-dose chemotherapy may overcome zzso achieve durable zzso and improve survival of patients with zzso
