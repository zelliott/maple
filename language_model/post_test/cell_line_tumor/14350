It is known that by binding to the zzso death domain zzso protein and/or zzso and zzso at the level of the zzso signaling complex zzso cellular zzso zzso protein zzso can prevent zzso triggered by zzso zzso We investigated whether the zzso zzso zzso zzso long zzso and zzso short zzso play a role in zzso zzso Our results showed that low zzso zzso triggered zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso human zzso leukemia cell line, and induced the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso decreased the expression of zzso by a zzso and zzso zzso To explore the distinct functions of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso we zzso the cells with expression zzso carrying zzso and zzso in the sense orientation or zzso in the zzso orientation zzso zzso and zzso were more efficiently activated in the zzso strain treated with zzso zzso which revealed that zzso regulates zzso zzso by interacting with these zzso Furthermore, our data showed that increased expression of zzso or zzso reduced zzso at zzso zzso zzso suggesting that both zzso of zzso prevent zzso zzso These results revealed that zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso
