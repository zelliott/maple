zzso regulates a variety of cellular functions, including cellular stress responses and energy zzso zzso activity is zzso regulated by zzso zzso in Breast Cancer 1) through direct zzso However, how the zzso interaction is regulated remains zzso We found that the zzso interaction increases following DNA damage and zzso zzso The zzso zzso interaction requires the zzso zzso of zzso at zzso zzso which creates a second binding site for zzso Finally, we showed that the zzso zzso interaction is important for cell fate determination following zzso zzso These results revealed a novel mechanism of zzso regulation during zzso zzso
