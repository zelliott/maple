zzso is one of the initial repair processes after vascular zzso zzso zzso adherence of zzso to vascular zzso at the site of zzso Because the role of zzso in this process is not fully zzso we studied the role of zzso in vascular injury with a flow chamber model and a rat model of carotid artery zzso 

We established a rat zzso zzso cell zzso culture system from the zzso of adult male zzso When rat zzso were suspended in a flow chamber, rolling and zzso to zzso zzso zzso were zzso Cell rolling and zzso were greatly reduced by addition of zzso zzso zzso zzso We then induced balloon injury in the left carotid arteries of zzso zzso expression was enhanced in zzso cells at zzso small vessels 7 days after zzso zzso with balloon injury were injected zzso with zzso zzso for 8 zzso zzso cell zzso was reduced by zzso zzso treatment at the zzso at 7 days after zzso This reduction was associated with zzso of zzso zzso in the rats treated with the zzso 

These data suggest that zzso regulates zzso inflammation through zzso zzso and contributes to the process of zzso zzso after balloon zzso
