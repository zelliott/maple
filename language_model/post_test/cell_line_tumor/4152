The bone zzso zzso provides important signals for the survival and proliferation of zzso and zzso zzso In multiple zzso plasma cells are surrounded by zzso cells including zzso These zzso cells protect multiple myeloma cells from zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso a soluble zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso and has been implicated in the prevention of cell death induced by TRAIL in zzso zzso Previously, we have designed death zzso TRAIL zzso that induce zzso exclusively via one of its death zzso Here, we have studied in detail the interaction between zzso human zzso zzso and zzso We show that a zzso zzso zzso zzso displays a significantly decreased affinity to zzso Furthermore, this zzso zzso shows a much higher activity when compared with zzso zzso and retains its effectiveness in inducing cell death in multiple myeloma cell lines, in the presence of zzso zzso by zzso zzso We also demonstrate that zzso cells are largely insensitive to high zzso of this zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso is a potential therapy for multiple myeloma due to its high effectiveness and diminished binding to zzso
