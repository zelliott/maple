zzso of plant products containing the zzso zzso zzso has been linked to lower zzso of colon cancer, suggesting that zzso has cancer zzso zzso Supporting this suggestion at the cellular level, zzso occurs in human colon cancer cells exposed to zzso However, the mechanism is zzso prompting this investigation to further clarify the molecular effects of zzso zzso zzso were incubated with zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso In zzso and zzso manners, zzso induced DNA damage, resulting later in the appearance of cellular features characteristic of zzso To identify a potential zzso gene that could be responsive to the DNA damage in zzso cells, growth arrest and DNA zzso gene 153 zzso was zzso zzso increased zzso zzso (and also zzso zzso which was prevented by zzso D and also by a broad protein zzso C zzso but not by selective zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression was at the level of transcription, but apparently without depending on upstream zzso In determining the involvement of zzso oxygen species in zzso the effect of zzso on zzso the antioxidants zzso zzso and zzso zzso but neither zzso nor zzso also blunted or prevented zzso of zzso zzso expression caused by zzso Most zzso when zzso was tested, it inhibited the DNA damage and zzso caused by zzso Because expression of zzso protein was detected before the appearance of zzso features, this observation raises the possibility that zzso protein might be important for zzso zzso
