zzso proliferation and differentiation of zzso cells is the base for production of appropriate numbers of zzso and zzso during zzso development in order to establish normal brain zzso We have used zzso zzso zzso zzso cells as an in zzso model for early differentiation to study participation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso receptors in the proliferation of neural zzso cells and their differentiation to zzso We have previously shown that functional zzso zzso receptors zzso already expressed in embryonic cells mediate zzso in zzso free calcium concentration zzso via calcium influx through zzso channels whereas zzso stores contribute to zzso and zzso calcium zzso in differentiated cells zzso et zzso Cell zzso 43 zzso zzso In the present study, we have demonstrated that nicotine provoked zzso of proliferation in embryonic cells as determined by zzso zzso However, in neural zzso cells nicotine zzso proliferation which was reversed in the presence of zzso of calcium zzso from zzso stores, indicating that liberation of zzso calcium contributed to this proliferation zzso zzso induced proliferation stimulation in zzso cells by zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso receptors and zzso calcium stores, whereas zzso coupled zzso zzso activity zzso zzso zzso
