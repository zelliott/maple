The zzso zzso protein is implicated in zzso regulation of at least five cellular zzso zzso of zzso and truncated promoter zzso has defined a discrete element zzso control element zzso within the promoters of each of these genes as being necessary for zzso zzso zzso In the present report we demonstrate that two zzso identified within the zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter are essential to promote zzso zzso that abolished each zzso markedly decreased zzso zzso zzso of zzso and truncated promoter zzso demonstrated that zzso regulates zzso expression by different mechanisms depending on the phase of the cell zzso The regulation of zzso expression by zzso required both the zzso and the zzso zzso expression occurred when both zzso and zzso were zzso Moreover, zzso were required for zzso association with the zzso This regulatory mechanism alters zzso activity and thereafter changes PC availability and cell zzso This is the first report demonstrating not only that surrounding zzso binding sites alter regulation zzso by zzso but also that the expression of a gene involved in PC zzso shares a common regulatory zzso with genes responsible for cell growth and zzso
