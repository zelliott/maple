The present studies were designed to determine whether the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso to kill zzso and zzso zzso In a zzso fashion zzso zzso was enhanced in multiple genetically disparate primary human zzso zzso by the zzso inhibitor sodium zzso zzso Drug exposure reduced zzso of zzso zzso and of zzso Similar data to that with zzso were also obtained using the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso and zzso also zzso to kill zzso and zzso cell zzso Treatment with zzso and zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso down of death zzso zzso expression protected zzso cells from the drug zzso as did zzso of zzso zzso and dominant negative zzso zzso zzso down of zzso zzso the effect of zzso in combination with zzso zzso zzso our data demonstrate that the combination of zzso and zzso zzso kills through zzso of the zzso pathway, and could represent a useful approach to treat zzso zzso
