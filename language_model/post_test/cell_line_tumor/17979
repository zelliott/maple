Two of the three components of anthrax zzso protective zzso zzso and lethal factor zzso together known as lethal toxin zzso reportedly show zzso activity in melanoma in zzso and in zzso The growth zzso activity of zzso in culture was determined in nine human cancer cell lines, including melanoma, zzso and zzso cells, as well as in human zzso vein zzso cells zzso The contribution of the two known PA zzso zzso zzso and zzso to the sensitivity of the cells was zzso The efficacy of zzso was evaluated in zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso melanoma tumor zzso zzso zzso to zzso in zzso was observed in the zzso and zzso zzso cells and zzso as well as melanoma zzso zzso and zzso protein expression studies suggested that a certain threshold of the PA zzso protein level must be met for sensitivity to zzso to be zzso However, although the zzso zzso cells expressed the highest levels of zzso proteins and achieved the lowest zzso in zzso zzso zzso we observed no correlation between either the zzso or zzso protein levels and sensitivity to zzso in zzso In zzso zzso was an active zzso agent when administered zzso to mice bearing the human zzso or zzso tumor zzso The tumor growth delays were zzso days with a lower dose regimen and zzso days with a higher dose regimen for the two tumor zzso These in zzso data suggest that zzso may have broad therapeutic indications in cancer and the in zzso studies demonstrate that zzso has systemic efficacy in zzso as well as zzso The therapeutic potential of zzso needs to be further investigated in zzso tumor models expressing the zzso and/or zzso zzso
