zzso zzso zzso zzso is a relatively zzso zzso zzso biological targets are under investigation to develop new therapeutic zzso One of these targets, namely the zzso zzso pathway, has been shown to be a regulator of the side population zzso zzso in different zzso The SP zzso is due to drug zzso abilities providing drug-resistant zzso The presence of a SP fraction in zzso was recently observed in our zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the zzso zzso in the regulation of the SP zzso in zzso Treatment of overnight zzso cells with zzso increased zzso of downstream target zzso zzso and zzso and SP fraction in zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso reduced the zzso of downstream target zzso zzso and zzso and decreased the SP zzso zzso resistance zzso by drug zzso was tested by treating the cells with zzso zzso increased zzso zzso and this effect was zzso by zzso C, a specific zzso zzso although not to the same extent, indicating that zzso drug zzso zzso to zzso The involvement of zzso in drug zzso was confirmed by determination of zzso decrease of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso decrease in drug zzso was associated with a significant decrease of zzso present at the cell surface in zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso zzso is playing an important role in regulating the SP zzso in zzso cells and zzso of this activity may contribute to a more efficient cancer zzso
