The application of zzso zzso silicon zzso zzso thin films for zzso cell imaging is reported for the first zzso Different strong local fields ensured by various molecules concentrated in various cell compartments can lead to the creation of preferential electronic conditions for zzso zzso of zzso charge carriers via a given electronic zzso Thus, highly contrasted zzso zzso cell imaging under one zzso zzso becomes zzso The described zzso zzso approach has good zzso with zzso optical zzso and allows rapid and efficient cell imaging and cell line zzso
