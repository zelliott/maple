zzso zzso zzso is one of the most common zzso causes of death zzso Due to very poor zzso new therapeutic approaches are zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suppresses the growth of various tumors, but its effect on zzso remains zzso We therefore studied the zzso potency of zzso in human zzso zzso 

zzso induced a zzso and zzso growth zzso of the human zzso cell lines zzso and zzso zzso induced both zzso and zzso zzso Changes in zzso membrane potential and zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso and nuclear degradation, were zzso Moreover, zzso induced cell cycle arrest at the zzso checkpoint and decreased the zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso Finally, zzso suppressed the expression of zzso zzso and zzso further rendering zzso cells prone to zzso 

Our data demonstrate that the zzso of zzso by zzso induced growth zzso zzso and cell cycle arrest in human zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso appears to be a promising novel approach for future treatment strategies of zzso
