zzso zzso zzso the most abundant known zzso protein in zzso cells, associates with the zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso To learn more about the role of the zzso interaction, we analyzed zzso trafficking and function in zzso zzso cells that were zzso zzso either with full length zzso or with zzso lacking 34 or 37 zzso acids on the zzso zzso zzso or zzso All three proteins were transported to zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso displayed a zzso zzso zzso pattern, while zzso zzso at zzso zzso was more zzso zzso of zzso decreased gap junction communication as zzso by dye transfer, while expression of zzso or zzso increased the amount of dye transfer seen in these zzso We found that zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso in these cells, while zzso did zzso We also found that zzso was much more soluble in zzso zzso zzso than the other zzso zzso In addition, zzso migrated to a fraction of lighter buoyant density on zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso and zzso As zzso is an zzso zzso this suggested that the differences in zzso zzso might be due to a difference between the interaction of gap junctions and the zzso zzso in the zzso and in the other zzso zzso zzso To examine this possibility, the zzso zzso cells were stained with zzso labeled zzso and demonstrated that there was a notable loss of zzso stress fibers in the zzso zzso These findings suggest that association with zzso alters the plasma membrane zzso of zzso by removing it from a zzso raft compartment and rendering it zzso presumably by promoting an interaction with the zzso zzso they also suggest that zzso has a complex binding interaction with zzso that involves either an extended zzso terminal domain or two distinct binding zzso
