To investigate the effects of zzso zzso on zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso 

zzso were incubated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and then were exposed to 50 zzso zzso to induce zzso in zzso cell to establish the zzso model in zzso Cell viability was test by zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein levels were investigated by Western zzso 

After exposure to zzso the cell viability decreased significantly, and the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso 3, zzso C, zzso 8 was up regulated while the zzso protein zzso was down zzso However, the treatment of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly restored these zzso 

zzso has the protective effect against zzso induced by in zzso cells via inhibit the zzso induced by zzso
