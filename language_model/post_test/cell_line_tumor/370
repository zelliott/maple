zzso stress and generation of zzso zzso are hallmarks of zzso Because chronic inflammation is implicated in several zzso conditions in humans, including zzso of the zzso zzso compounds may be useful zzso agents against colon zzso zzso such as zzso have diverse zzso activities, which include zzso cancer zzso a cholesterol-lowering effect, enhanced insulin sensitivity, and increased life zzso We previously showed that zzso zzso a structural analogue of zzso is present in zzso and that zzso inhibited expression of certain zzso genes in the colon and suppressed zzso zzso zzso formation in zzso Here, we examined molecular mechanisms of the action of zzso in colon zzso zzso reduced cell zzso zzso the expression of zzso and zzso zzso and increased the level of zzso zzso zzso A combination of zzso zzso necrosis zzso zzso and bacterial zzso zzso induced zzso genes such as zzso zzso oxide zzso and zzso which was significantly suppressed by treatment with zzso We further identified upstream signaling pathways contributing to the zzso activity of zzso by investigating multiple signaling zzso including nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of transcription, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso induction of the zzso zzso factor 2 zzso was markedly inhibited by zzso among the different zzso of signaling zzso By zzso the expression of the zzso alpha zzso there was significant reduction in zzso induction of zzso zzso oxide zzso and zzso Our data suggest that the zzso zzso protein zzso cascade is a key signal zzso zzso for zzso the zzso action of zzso in cultured zzso colon cancer zzso
