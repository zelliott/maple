A series of new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and their corresponding zzso complexes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been zzso in order to evaluate the effect of terminal zzso in zzso zzso on coordination zzso and biological zzso The new zzso and their corresponding complexes were characterized by zzso and various spectral zzso The molecular structure of the complexes zzso were characterized by single crystal X-ray zzso studies which revealed that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are coordinated to zzso as zzso zzso zzso by forming six and five member rings zzso the zzso zzso coordinated to zzso as zzso zzso zzso The interactions of the new complexes with calf zzso DNA zzso have been evaluated by zzso and zzso zzso zzso competitive studies which revealed that complexes zzso could interact with zzso through zzso Further, the interactions of the complexes with bovine serum zzso zzso were also investigated using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso methods, which showed that the new complexes could bind strongly with zzso zzso studies showed that all the complexes have a strong zzso activity against zzso zzso radical and zzso acid zzso salt zzso zzso zzso In addition, in zzso zzso of the complexes against human lung cancer zzso cell line was zzso which showed that 4 has higher zzso activity than the rest of the complexes and zzso
