To investigate the possible existence of an zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso family zzso 

zzso and zzso expression and zzso induction were analyzed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso breast cancer cell lines exposed to zzso alone or in combination with either zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In addition to zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso and zzso expression in zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was also observed in three of five and two of three breast cancer patients undergoing zzso treatment, zzso Despite zzso zzso however, zzso only marginally increased the rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso We therefore investigated whether a combination of zzso and zzso might increase zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso cells decreased both zzso and zzso zzso resulting in a 21 zzso zzso net zzso zzso the combination of zzso followed by zzso resulted in a significantly stronger induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso that was not observed with the reverse treatment sequence zzso followed by zzso Similar results were obtained with the zzso zzso zzso indeed, exposure of zzso cells to zzso followed by zzso resulted in a striking zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as assessed by zzso zzso 

zzso our findings suggest that combined targeting of zzso and zzso may represent a novel, rational approach to more effective breast cancer zzso
