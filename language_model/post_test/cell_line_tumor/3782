zzso zzso zzso have an alternatively activated zzso zzso zzso and promote cancer cell zzso zzso and zzso Nuclear zzso zzso is one of the master regulators of zzso zzso Here, we investigated the effect of zzso of zzso activity by small interfering zzso zzso on the zzso response of zzso located in the tumor zzso in zzso We used mouse zzso zzso cultured in zzso medium from zzso cancer cells as an in zzso zzso model zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso resulted in a significant decrease in the zzso of zzso zzso (a T helper 2 zzso zzso and a significant increase of T helper 1 zzso zzso production zzso tumor necrosis zzso and zzso Furthermore, vascular zzso growth factor production and zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso were suppressed by zzso of zzso expression with zzso zzso zzso In addition, there was a reduction of zzso zzso expression and increase in zzso oxide zzso The zzso zzso profiles of zzso cultured in zzso medium from either zzso or zzso cancer cells were also converted from zzso to classically activated zzso zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso activity in zzso zzso alters their zzso toward zzso
