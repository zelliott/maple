zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso was originally reported as a tumor zzso gene in breast zzso The purpose of the present study was to examine zzso expression and evaluate its zzso significance in zzso zzso We examined zzso expression zzso in 41 cases with zzso zzso DNA zzso status at the zzso promoter region was determined by the zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso expression was observed in 27 zzso of 41 zzso zzso but not in normal zzso zzso zzso zzso of the tumor cells varied in zzso and density among zzso Positive zzso was correlated significantly with the presence of zzso differentiation zzso vs absence zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso P zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso of zzso protein was also significantly associated with zzso differentiation zzso positive vs nuclear negative zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso P zzso zzso An inverse correlation between their zzso and zzso status was observed zzso zzso zzso Three of the four cell lines established from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its protein zzso In a zzso cell line, zzso expression was induced by treatment with zzso a DNA zzso zzso There was no significant correlation between zzso expression and any zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso induced by DNA zzso at the promoter region may contribute to zzso differentiation of tumor cells in zzso zzso
