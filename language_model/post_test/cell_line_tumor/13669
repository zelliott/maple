zzso of viral zzso in synthetic zzso is a promising strategy for overcoming hurdles associated with viral gene zzso For enhanced gene expression at a specific site, gene transfer by using zzso represents a versatile zzso In this study, zzso virus zzso 2 containing the green fluorescent protein gene zzso were loaded into zzso zzso zzso zzso with and without incorporation of zzso zzso zzso of zzso created pH responsive zzso in a zzso range of zzso containing the damaged zzso and activated zzso The fraction of zzso used controlled the degree of zzso water zzso and subsequent degradation of the zzso and release rate of zzso The swelling ratio of the zzso zzso increased zzso with environment zzso As pH declined from zzso to zzso zzso zzso swelling ratio and degradation rate increased zzso and zzso zzso As a result, release and zzso efficiency of the zzso from zzso zzso in human zzso zzso cells increased significantly compared to a zzso zzso zzso rate can be controlled by the zzso zzso concentration and is sensitive to localized decreases in pH consistent with zzso This is relevant to zzso parameters for wound care and zzso medicine zzso
