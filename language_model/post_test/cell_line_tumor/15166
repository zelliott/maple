Our recent study demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso may not only serve as a zzso zzso in zzso cells, but may also function as a regulator of zzso migration after zzso In this report, we showed that zzso expression increased in cultured rat zzso zzso cells that underwent long-term serially zzso The stable zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells resulted in growth arrest and zzso zzso however the stable zzso of zzso resulted in zzso zzso In correlation with cell zzso zzso levels increased at sites of zzso contact in zzso cells zzso zzso and decreased in zzso cells with stable zzso zzso total zzso expression levels remained unchanged in these zzso In addition, levels of zzso a potent zzso zzso zzso increased, while zzso D1 levels decreased in zzso cells zzso zzso Our additional studies showed that zzso zzso contacts were implicated in zzso cell growth arrest and impairment of cell migration, as evidenced by the zzso of zzso on cell growth and zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso these observations suggest a novel mechanism of growth regulation by zzso that involves zzso zzso zzso zzso
