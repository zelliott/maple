zzso expression of the delivered target gene is critical for successful gene zzso Recently, zzso control region I zzso I) originating from the zzso zzso zzso was shown to be a critical element for long-term gene expression in the liver of zzso zzso II is another zzso control region of zzso 

zzso I, zzso II and zzso zzso plasmids zzso factor IX were prepared and zzso transferred into the liver of normal and zzso B zzso Factor IX zzso zzso activity and formation of zzso against the expressed gene product were zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso plasmids all induced long-term gene expression in both normal and zzso B zzso zzso factor IX expression in the zzso B mice remained above zzso for zzso zzso against human factor IX were detected at a low level in the serum, although they had no effect on the levels and zzso activity of the expressed factor zzso 

We have shown in mouse models that zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was able to induce and maintain the expression and zzso activity of human factor IX for a long period of time at a potentially therapeutic zzso With an appropriate delivery system, this type of zzso zzso could be clinically useful for the zzso expression of therapeutic genes including human factor zzso
