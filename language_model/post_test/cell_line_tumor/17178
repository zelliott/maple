To investigate the hypothesis that sequential zzso C and zzso acid zzso zzso therapy zzso interact zzso in both the zzso zzso cancer cell line and its zzso zzso zzso and to assess the theoretical basis of this interaction by measuring the relative zzso density of the respective cell lines, on the basis that the zzso are the zzso site where zzso is zzso to the active zzso zzso zzso 

Cell survival was zzso in zzso cell line and the zzso zzso after treating them with sequential zzso zzso and zzso C, and with the sequence of treatments zzso Cell survival was estimated using the zzso zzso The relative zzso density of the two cell lines was estimated using flow zzso to measure zzso zzso 

The effect of sequential zzso C followed by zzso zzso enhanced the effect of zzso in both cell zzso In zzso this effect was marginally zzso When zzso zzso was administered before zzso C, the combined effect was zzso zzso zzso was zzso 10 times greater in zzso than zzso suggesting a significantly higher zzso density in the former than the zzso 

zzso C appears to enhance zzso zzso when administered zzso This appears to be particularly so in zzso This phenomenon may have clinical significance in zzso superficial zzso zzso
