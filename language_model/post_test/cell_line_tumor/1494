zzso zzso zzso zzso based on zzso zzso acid zzso modified zzso zzso zzso were prepared for delivery of the zzso drug zzso zzso zzso with different degrees of substitution zzso of zzso were initially zzso and zzso Based on zzso zzso formed zzso with size ranging from 87 to 174 zzso The critical zzso concentration zzso decreased on increasing the zzso of zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso showed an zzso zzso zzso and deformation zzso The zzso zzso zzso exhibited a sustained drug release manner, which could be accelerated by an zzso zzso but delayed by a higher zzso of zzso zzso efficacy results showed that zzso could suppress both sensitive and resistant zzso cells effectively in a zzso and zzso zzso The enhanced cellular zzso and greater retention of zzso in drug-resistant cells, as evidenced by zzso zzso and flow zzso contributed to a superior efficacy of zzso over free zzso These results suggest the potential of zzso zzso as carriers for the zzso drug zzso for effective cancer therapy against drug-resistant zzso
