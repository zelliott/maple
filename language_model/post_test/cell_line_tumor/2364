This study presents a new zzso imaging approach that includes zzso zzso zzso intensity, zzso and spectral imaging to improve the zzso evaluation of new zzso in zzso Here we use this approach to assess in zzso the therapeutic efficacy of the novel chemotherapy zzso zzso during and after zzso zzso is comprised of zzso zzso assembled in a zzso particle targeted to zzso tumor cells, causing tumor cell death at over zzso lower dose compared to the zzso drug, while sparing the zzso Whereas our initial zzso studies on zzso used tumor zzso rates as a measure of therapeutic zzso here we show that zzso imaging deployed during and after treatment can supplement traditional modes of tumor monitoring to further characterize the particle in zzso of treated zzso Specifically, we show here that tumor cell zzso zzso by zzso can be monitored in zzso during treatment using high frequency ultrasound imaging, while in zzso zzso imaging of excised tumors shows that zzso indeed penetrated tumor tissue and can be detected at the zzso level, including in the nucleus, via zzso zzso In addition, zzso spectral imaging of the same tumor tissue enables quantitative discrimination of zzso zzso from zzso in zzso In contrast to standard approaches of zzso assessment, this new method provides zzso information that may shorten the time required for initial evaluation of in zzso zzso thus potentially reducing the time and cost for translating new drug molecules into the zzso
