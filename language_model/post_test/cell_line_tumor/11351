Most current diagnostic tests for tuberculosis do not reveal the species or strain of pathogen causing pulmonary infection, which can lead to inappropriate treatment regimens and the spread of zzso Here, we report an zzso for zzso strain assignment based on genetically zzso zzso zzso We developed a zzso probe, zzso that detects zzso activity in native protein gels, allowing the rapid detection of zzso in zzso zzso This zzso revealed that zzso strains have distinct zzso fingerprints that can be used to judge both the species and zzso Our results demonstrate the potential of zzso zzso for rapid pathogen discrimination for infectious zzso
