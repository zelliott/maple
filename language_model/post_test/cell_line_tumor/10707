zzso and transport of bovine liver zzso to zzso in human zzso are zzso by two zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso which recognizes a zzso sequence present on the zzso The latter zzso was zzso extracted from bovine liver zzso and zzso zzso analysis revealed that this zzso zzso was zzso VI zzso Several approaches were used to confirm this zzso First, the binding of bovine zzso to the zzso zzso from bovine liver zzso and zzso zzso human zzso protein was confirmed using zzso zzso Second, western zzso analysis using zzso raised against zzso zzso as well as commercial zzso against zzso confirmed that the zzso and zzso were indeed the same zzso Third, double zzso experiments in human zzso confirmed a complete zzso of the bovine zzso and the zzso zzso on the plasma zzso Lastly, two cell lines were zzso zzso with a zzso containing the zzso for human zzso In both zzso cell lines, an increase in cell surface zzso and in zzso zzso zzso of bovine zzso was zzso These results indicate that zzso is a novel zzso that mediates the zzso of the bovine zzso
