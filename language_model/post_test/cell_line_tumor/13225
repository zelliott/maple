The possibility of zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso was investigated in 8 human zzso cell lines and primary zzso cells from 15 leukemia zzso The study demonstrated that zzso induced zzso and reduced proliferation in both cell lines and primary zzso cells, particularly in zzso origin cells, indicating that zzso has zzso zzso activity, especially for cells of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso are currently used to prevent zzso disease in zzso stem cell transplantation patients and to treat patients with severe zzso zzso It contains zzso against zzso expressed on various zzso cells, we hypothesized that it zzso cell death not only in healthy cells but also in zzso zzso zzso 

In this study, several human zzso cell lines and primary zzso cells from 15 patients with leukemia were used to investigate the ability of zzso zzso to induce zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso induced cell zzso in primary zzso cells and in cell lines in a zzso manner, and induced zzso in different populations through a variety of zzso Cell proliferation was significantly reduced in the presence of zzso zzso it arrested cells in the zzso phase by cell cycle zzso Treatment with zzso zzso plus complement increased zzso of the zzso zzso complement zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso 

These data show that zzso zzso has zzso zzso activity, especially for cells of zzso origin, as it induced cell death through a variety of zzso This study provides an experimental basis for the application of zzso zzso in zzso zzso stem cell transplantation and in patients with zzso zzso
