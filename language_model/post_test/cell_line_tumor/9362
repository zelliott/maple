In zzso many zzso viruses replicate as zzso zzso called zzso and efficiently segregate to daughter cells by zzso attaching to zzso zzso To understand the mechanism governing the zzso we analyzed the detailed zzso zzso of zzso virus zzso zzso and a viral protein zzso a bridging zzso between viral zzso and cellular zzso In the cells that were infected with a zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso localized to zzso zzso dots, which coincided with the zzso of zzso zzso as revealed by zzso in zzso zzso zzso A significant number of zzso dots were found to zzso zzso on sister zzso of zzso zzso Such symmetrical zzso of zzso dots was observed in prematurely condensed zzso zzso as well, zzso with the presence of closely spaced double dots of zzso in zzso zzso The zzso double dots were occasionally interconnected by the FISH signals of zzso zzso exhibiting a zzso zzso Thus, we propose that the zzso of zzso molecules onto sister zzso during cellular DNA replication zzso the zzso segregation of zzso replicating viral zzso
