zzso resistance is one of the major causes limiting the efficacy of zzso agents to control zzso zzso zzso we investigated that the effect and mechanism of zzso zzso in the human zzso zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso The human zzso zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso was isolated by zzso selection in increasing zzso of zzso The zzso method was carried out to measure the cell viability when cells were exposed to zzso with or without zzso and the zzso and resistance index zzso of zzso was then zzso zzso zzso and western zzso were used to detect the zzso and protein expression of zzso resistance 1 zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso and breast cancer resistance protein zzso zzso zzso zzso was adopted to determine zzso zzso and cell zzso zzso The resulting cell line zzso was zzso resistant to zzso the zzso of zzso to zzso cells was enhanced by zzso in a zzso zzso Further, it was found that the expression of zzso and zzso was similar in different treated zzso In contrast, the expression of zzso was markedly increased in zzso cells, which was zzso decreased by zzso In agreement with the results, zzso activity was also reversed by zzso In conclusion, zzso possesses a reversal effect on drug resistance in zzso cells through zzso of zzso and has the potential to be an adjunct to chemotherapy for zzso zzso
