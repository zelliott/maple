zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that has recently been shown to induce cell death in various human cancer zzso However, whether zzso plays a functional role in zzso zzso zzso has not been determined to zzso The present study investigated the zzso efficacy of zzso and its molecular mechanisms of action in zzso zzso zzso efficiently inhibited proliferation and invasion of 3 zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso and activated a extensive zzso process that is accompanied by zzso of zzso and zzso and decreased zzso membrane zzso Meanwhile, the protein expression level of the zzso zzso zzso zzso related protein 6 zzso and zzso was zzso which showed that the zzso signaling was involved in zzso zzso of zzso zzso In a nude mouse zzso zzso model, the zzso effect of zzso was associated with the zzso of zzso zzso The present study demonstrated that zzso can effectively inhibit proliferation and invasion, and induce zzso of zzso cells in zzso and inhibit tumor growth in zzso probably via the zzso of zzso zzso suggesting zzso as a potential candidate for the chemotherapy of zzso
