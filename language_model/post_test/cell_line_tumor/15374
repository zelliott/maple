zzso factors are frequently altered in zzso through zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso a fusion protein generated by the zzso zzso in acute zzso zzso is a zzso factor implicated in both gene repression and zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso domain, is critical for zzso making it important to identify zzso factors that zzso the zzso zzso and contribute to zzso Here we show that, in human zzso cells, zzso resides in and functions through a stable zzso zzso factor complex zzso that contains several zzso zzso zzso These zzso components stabilize the complex through zzso zzso provide multiple zzso zzso for diverse target zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulate gene zzso and contribute to zzso Within the zzso complex, zzso zzso is required for a specific interaction between the zzso zzso domain and a novel zzso zzso motif in E zzso zzso analysis of the zzso complex reveals a unique interaction pattern in which an zzso zzso makes direct contact with side chains of two zzso zzso as a zzso providing a novel model of how zzso zzso factors create a new zzso interface through zzso zzso disruption of this interaction by point zzso abrogates zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso These results reveal new mechanisms of action of zzso and provide a potential therapeutic target in zzso acute zzso zzso
