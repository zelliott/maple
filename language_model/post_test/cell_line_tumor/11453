In our previous study, we demonstrated that the zzso zzso cancer cell 2) gene is a zzso zzso that interacts with zzso zzso zzso is associated with poor zzso and overall survival in breast zzso In this study, we aimed to investigate the role of zzso in tumor suppression in breast zzso In clinical breast cancer samples, we found that zzso expression was significantly zzso in cancer zzso compared with paired normal breast zzso By zzso or zzso zzso in breast cancer cells, we found that zzso could inhibit cell growth and zzso in zzso An in zzso zzso showed that zzso not only dramatically inhibited breast cancer cell zzso formation and growth but also inhibited breast cancer cell zzso in a lung zzso zzso Moreover, we demonstrated that zzso inhibited breast cancer zzso via regulation of the zzso zzso Thus, our study provided evidence that zzso functions as a novel tumor zzso in breast cancer and may be a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer zzso
