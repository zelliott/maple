zzso zzso compounds contribute to aging, Alzheimer's disease zzso and other neurodegenerative zzso Among these compounds, zzso zzso can yield advanced zzso end products zzso which are crucial in zzso zzso However, the molecular and zzso mechanisms of zzso zzso are not completely zzso In the present study, zzso cells were treated with zzso to induce cell zzso zzso Fluorescence zzso zzso zzso and zzso laser zzso of flight mass zzso were employed to determine the changes in protein levels in these cells compared with zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that 49 proteins were zzso expressed in zzso zzso cells, of which 16 were zzso and 33 were zzso Among them, eight proteins were identified zzso The significant changes in protein levels of zzso zzso zzso light chain and protein zzso 2 were noteworthy given their functional roles in zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggest that multiple pathways are potentially involved in zzso zzso zzso
