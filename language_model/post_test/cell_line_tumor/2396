zzso recurrence frequently occurs after zzso but the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso cancer cells remain largely zzso Here we develop a sophisticated strategy to track the zzso fate of the cells, which exist in zzso regions at the time of zzso Although the zzso zzso cells are originally zzso factor 1 zzso they acquire zzso activity after surviving radiation, which triggers their zzso towards zzso blood zzso zzso zzso suppress the zzso and decrease the zzso of zzso zzso zzso For the first time, our data unveil the zzso cellular dynamics during zzso zzso recurrence and provide a rational basis for targeting zzso after radiation zzso
