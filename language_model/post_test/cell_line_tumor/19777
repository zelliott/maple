There is an increasing medical need to detect and zzso zzso early and aggressive forms of prostate zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso library screens can be developed to zzso target prostate cancer with zzso for optical zzso Toward this goal, we used in zzso zzso display and a newly described zzso zzso to select for zzso that zzso and bind human zzso prostate zzso zzso in severe combined immune zzso zzso One resulting zzso clone zzso displaying the zzso sequence zzso was zzso labeled with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and was evaluated both in zzso and in zzso for its ability to bind and target zzso prostate zzso The zzso labeled zzso clone zzso had a zzso ratio of approximately 30 in zzso In addition, prostate tumors zzso were readily zzso by zzso zzso These results show proof of principle that zzso zzso fluorescent zzso can be rapidly developed for use in the early detection of zzso by optical zzso
