zzso are the most common zzso brain tumors in zzso These tumors are highly zzso and patients harboring these zzso are frequently diagnosed with distant zzso In this study, the authors investigated the role of zzso a member of the zzso family of small zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

Three established zzso cell lines were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso depletion of zzso protein was accomplished by transient zzso of small interfering zzso Cell invasion through zzso zzso zzso was zzso using a zzso migration zzso zzso activated protein zzso zzso was determined using zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso pathways was achieved by specific small zzso zzso zzso of zzso and its expression levels were determined by zzso analysis using a zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso assessed by zzso plasma membrane zzso 

Small interfering zzso depletion of zzso strongly inhibited zzso cell zzso Although depletion of zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso cells, and of zzso cells to a lesser extent, it zzso the proliferation of zzso zzso zzso of zzso also inhibited the zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of either zzso diminished invasion and zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso protein was zzso in all zzso tumors zzso and indicated that zzso was zzso in 6 of 25 zzso 

The zzso data show that zzso is necessary for the invasive behavior of zzso cells in zzso and plays a variable role in zzso cell zzso In addition, these results indicate that zzso stimulates zzso invasion by zzso the zzso and zzso zzso The authors suggest that zzso and signaling elements controlled by this zzso zzso may serve as novel targets for therapeutic intervention in zzso zzso
