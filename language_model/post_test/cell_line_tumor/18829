zzso zzso in the zzso gene zzso cause a rare zzso bone zzso characterized by skeletal zzso zzso is a key zzso regulator of zzso zzso Here we link these two pathways by zzso via gel shift and transient zzso zzso that zzso binding to the zzso zzso promoter contributes to differential zzso expression in two zzso cell zzso Additionally, an zzso binding motif in the zzso zzso zzso promoter appears to be functional in zzso cells, but does not account for zzso expression of zzso The regulation of zzso expression by zzso suggests a potential role for the zzso gene in zzso regulation of zzso differentiation and zzso Furthermore, the juxtaposition of zzso zzso and zzso binding sites in the zzso zzso promoter bears an intriguing resemblance to the promoter for zzso another zzso gene with a zzso zzso of bone zzso
