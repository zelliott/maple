Blood vessel formation requires zzso cell interactions with the zzso zzso through cell surface zzso and signaling events that control zzso cell zzso migration, and zzso zzso zzso zzso is present in all basement zzso of blood vessels in fetal and adult zzso but despite its importance in vessel formation, its role in zzso cell zzso and migration remains zzso We examined zzso and migration of zzso human zzso zzso cells on zzso with an emphasis on the zzso signaling events, as compared with those on zzso and zzso We found that zzso was less potent in zzso cell zzso than zzso zzso and zzso and zzso cell zzso through zzso zzso Despite its weak zzso activity, zzso was as potent as zzso in promoting cell zzso zzso adhering to zzso displayed streaks of thin zzso filaments and formed zzso at the leading edge of the cells, as observed with cells adhering to zzso while cells on zzso showed thick zzso stress fibers and large focal zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated that zzso but not zzso or zzso was zzso activated on zzso and zzso when compared with zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso of zzso suppressed cell zzso zzso formation, and migration on zzso but not on zzso These results, taken together, indicate that zzso is activated during zzso cell zzso to zzso and is pivotal for zzso zzso cell spreading and migration on zzso
