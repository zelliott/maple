Various genetic and environmental factors appear to be involved in systemic lupus zzso zzso zzso virus zzso is among the environmental factors that are suspected of zzso to zzso based on the characteristics of zzso itself and on sequence zzso between zzso and zzso zzso In addition, higher zzso of zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso rates have been observed in zzso patients as compared with healthy control zzso zzso responses do not directly reflect zzso status within the zzso zzso of the precise status of zzso infection in zzso patients would help to improve our understanding of the role played by zzso in this zzso In the present study we determined zzso types in zzso patients zzso zzso zzso and normal control individual zzso zzso zzso by direct zzso analysis of zzso zzso We also compared zzso load in blood between zzso patients zzso zzso 24) and healthy control individuals zzso zzso 29) using zzso zzso zzso The number of infections and zzso type distribution were similar between adult zzso patients and healthy control individuals zzso versus zzso Interestingly, the zzso burden in peripheral blood zzso cells zzso was over zzso greater in zzso patients than in healthy control individuals zzso zzso standard zzso 463 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA versus 30 zzso 29 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso suggesting that zzso infection is zzso regulated in zzso The zzso increased proportion of zzso B cells in the zzso patients may contribute to enhanced zzso production in this zzso
