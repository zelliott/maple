zzso of zzso is currently done based on matching one or more measurable parameters such as zzso a and zzso which could result in insufficient process zzso Currently, there is a lack of zzso zzso studies in cell culture zzso which could help delineate measurable cellular attributes for improved zzso In this study, we scaled-down from a typical zzso zzso zzso to a novel zzso zzso zzso based on matching oxygen transfer rate, which resulted in cell growth and zzso discrepancies using zzso zzso Performing DNA zzso on zzso samples from both systems, we identified zzso zzso expressed zzso presumably because of zzso zzso and mixing differences with zzso Evaluating these transcripts for zzso cellular functions such as zzso stress response and DNA damage response, we chose 18 zzso genes based on their degree of difference and zzso which we further verified by quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction zzso Tracking the differential expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso we were able to correlate zzso damage and poor zzso as possible causes for zzso changes such as prolonged culture in zzso Additionally, to verify our zzso gene findings, we performed follow-up improved zzso studies based on gene analysis and measured zzso zzso As a result, zzso zzso profiles and cell growth profiles showed better convergence between the improved zzso conditions and the model zzso zzso Our results broadly show that based on the knowledge from zzso changes of zzso gene profiles, it is possible to improve zzso zzso for more comparable zzso
