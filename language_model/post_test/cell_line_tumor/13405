zzso zzso zzso zzso transition zzso which zzso invasion and zzso and is linked to cancer stem cells zzso Whether zzso generates zzso de zzso enhances migration of existing zzso or both is zzso We examined patient tissue of pancreatic zzso zzso zzso along with zzso of breast, zzso zzso prostate and zzso For in zzso studies, five established zzso cell lines classified as less zzso and highly aggressive zzso cells zzso were examined by single and double zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso and zzso were zzso pointing to a putative zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso cells exhibited high zzso expression of the zzso zzso protein but low or absent expression of the zzso marker zzso with the opposite result in zzso zzso zzso triggered altering of cell zzso from an zzso to a zzso zzso which was more pronounced in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was reduced and expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso While zzso caused migration in all cell lines, zzso along with the percentage of zzso polarized and zzso cells was significantly higher in zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso occurs in zzso and several other tumor zzso However although zzso zzso signaling occurs in all tumor cell zzso only the zzso cells acquire high migratory potential and thus may be responsible for invasion and zzso
