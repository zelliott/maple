zzso melanoma, an aggressive and increasingly common cancer, is characterized by a zzso high rate zzso of zzso in zzso a key component of the zzso protein zzso zzso signaling zzso How signaling events downstream from zzso affect the underlying program of gene expression is poorly zzso We show that the zzso zzso domain zzso factor is highly expressed in melanoma cell lines but not in zzso or zzso and that zzso of zzso in zzso results in increased zzso zzso of zzso is strongly zzso by Ras and zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso promoter is zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression is inhibited by zzso zzso zzso of zzso Moreover, silent interfering zzso depletion of zzso in melanoma cells expressing activated zzso leads to decreased zzso The results suggest that the high levels of zzso expression observed in zzso link zzso signaling to increased zzso
