zzso is a protein complex that plays an essential role in pairing zzso sister zzso during cell zzso The zzso zzso complex consists of four core components including structure maintenance of zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso research suggests that zzso traps the sister zzso by a zzso zzso zzso bound to the zzso protein that closes the zzso zzso the single zzso model proposes that two sister zzso are trapped in a single ring that is composed of one zzso each of the 4 zzso However, evidence also exists for alternative zzso The zzso model suggests that each sister zzso is trapped individually by two rings that are joined through the shared zzso zzso We report here the determination of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso complex by quantitative mass zzso Using zzso isotope zzso we show that the zzso core complex contains zzso of the 4 core zzso suggesting that each zzso ring is closed by one zzso zzso Furthermore, we applied this strategy to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that quantitative mass zzso is a powerful tool for measuring zzso of zzso protein core zzso
