Recently, we have demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso cell responses can be rapidly induced in advanced melanoma patients by vaccination with zzso zzso zzso zzso Most patients showed a T cell zzso against a melanoma zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso which has been previously found to be presented by zzso zzso To analyze the functional and specificity profile of this in zzso T cell response in detail, zzso zzso T cell clones were established from zzso blood samples of two zzso zzso These T cell clones recognized not only zzso zzso cells but also zzso cells loaded with a zzso zzso zzso demonstrating that these T cells were directed against a naturally processed zzso zzso The isolated zzso zzso cells showed a typical zzso zzso profile upon zzso From the first patient several zzso T cell clones recognizing the zzso zzso used for vaccination in the context of zzso were zzso whereas we have isolated from the second patient zzso T cell clones which were restricted by zzso zzso a panel of truncated peptides revealed that the zzso T cell clones recognized different core zzso within the original zzso used for zzso zzso a zzso T cell clone was zzso by zzso cells loaded with zzso or zzso tumor cells and even directly recognized zzso class zzso and zzso tumor zzso Moreover, these T cells exhibited zzso activity involving zzso zzso zzso These findings support that zzso zzso zzso cells might play an important functional role in zzso zzso
