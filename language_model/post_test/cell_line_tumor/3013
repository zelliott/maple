The efficacy of zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cell lung cancer zzso has been linked to zzso zzso in the zzso zzso So far these zzso have been extensively characterized in established cell zzso The aim of this study was to determine the effects of zzso zzso on downstream signaling in human tumor zzso 

We have looked for zzso of the zzso gene in specimens of 67 patients with zzso and correlated these with zzso zzso and the activity of its three main downstream signaling zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso 

We show that the zzso of zzso zzso 922 and zzso but not zzso are primarily affected by the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was significantly higher in patients with zzso zzso but we found no difference in zzso or zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso not only increase zzso activity, but also alter responses of downstream signaling zzso in human zzso and that these finding differ from results obtained in cell zzso
