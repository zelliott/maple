zzso zzso zzso imaging is an attractive technique for studying diseases at the molecular level in zzso zzso zzso are often used as targets for in zzso imaging of zzso The efficiency of a zzso fluorescent probe can be enhanced by attaching one or more zzso zzso zzso This study was designed to evaluate the use of previously developed zzso zzso zzso for in zzso and in zzso optical imaging of zzso 

Cellular zzso of the zzso zzso was investigated in zzso cultures of zzso zzso zzso zzso The prostate tumors were established as subcutaneous zzso using zzso cells in nude zzso The zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso The zzso muscle, and major zzso were collected for ex zzso optical zzso 

The tumor cell zzso of the probe containing two zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher than the zzso of both the probe with one zzso zzso zzso and the probe without zzso zzso zzso Similarly, in in zzso experiments, zzso demonstrated higher maximum zzso intensity and longer residence lifetime in tumors than zzso or zzso The ex zzso zzso analysis revealed that tumor zzso of zzso and zzso was zzso and twofold higher than that of zzso at zzso zzso zzso 

Both zzso and zzso zzso zzso exhibited good zzso properties in prostate cancer cell cultures and live zzso The zzso probe showed the highest zzso with good retention characteristics in zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso is likely zzso by zzso zzso The zzso mechanism is being explored further for developing zzso zzso for in zzso zzso
