To investigate the gene zzso effect by the zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its effect on cell proliferation and cycle distribution in zzso 

Two zzso zzso were constructed and zzso into zzso zzso zzso were performed using zzso zzso The zzso effectiveness was calculated basing on the rate of zzso cell of zzso at 6 h after zzso Total zzso zzso was extracted from these cells using the zzso zzso and zzso reverse zzso zzso chain reaction was performed to detect the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso were zzso proteins were zzso and western zzso was employed to detect the expression levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Cell proliferation was assessed by zzso zzso zzso and the zzso rate was zzso Soft zzso colony formation zzso was performed basing on colonies greater than 60 zzso in diameter at zzso zzso The effect on cell cycle distribution and zzso was assessed by flow zzso All experiments were performed in zzso 

Green zzso was observed in zzso cell zzso with zzso zzso and the zzso effectiveness was about zzso Forty-eight hours zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso cells was zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ) in zzso zzso negative and blank group zzso zzso expression of zzso was zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso negative and blank group zzso zzso expression of zzso was zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the four groups zzso zzso expression of zzso was zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the four groups zzso The protein level of zzso was zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso negative and blank group zzso The protein level of zzso in the four groups was zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The protein level of zzso in the four groups was zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The protein level of zzso in the four groups was zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso plasmids significantly suppressed the growth of zzso cells when compared with the negative or blank group at 48 h after zzso zzso vs zzso vs zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso 60 h after zzso zzso vs zzso vs zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso and 72 h after zzso zzso vs zzso vs zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso Numbers of colonies in negative, zzso zzso and zzso groups were 42 zzso 4, 45 zzso 5, 8 zzso 2, and 10 zzso 3, respectively zzso zzso zzso There were more than zzso times colonies in the blank and negative control groups as there were in the zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the colonies in blank and negative control groups were also larger than those in the zzso and zzso zzso The percentage of cells in the zzso and zzso groups was significantly higher in zzso phase, but lower in S and zzso phase when compared with the negative and control zzso Moreover, cell zzso rates in the zzso and zzso groups were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which were significantly higher than those in negative zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and blank groups zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso No significant difference was found between zzso and zzso groups in cell cycle distribution and zzso 

zzso short hairpin zzso can block the zzso zzso signaling zzso and inhibit cell growth, increase zzso and induce cell cycle arrest in the zzso colon cancer zzso zzso
