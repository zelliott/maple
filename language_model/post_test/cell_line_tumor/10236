We have demonstrated that zinc exposure zzso zzso in human prostate cancer cells zzso and benign zzso cells zzso but not in normal prostate cells zzso However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of zinc on prostate cancer cell growth and zinc zzso remain zzso To explore the zinc effect on gene expression profiles in normal zzso and zzso prostate cells zzso we conducted a time course study of zzso treatment with zzso zzso zzso data were evaluated and zzso using zzso approach for the primary and secondary data zzso Final analyses were focused on the genes zzso highly sensitive to zzso zzso associated with zinc zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zinc carriers zzso and zinc exporters zzso zzso relevant to several zzso zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso were further validated by zzso zzso zzso showed that zinc effect on zzso expression patterns was zzso specific, and zinc appeared to have mainly zzso effects on thousands of genes zzso in zzso zzso in zzso with a threshold of zzso while fewer genes were zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso The patterns of zinc effect on functional zzso zzso expression provided evidence for the cell zzso zinc zzso and zzso zzso in prostate zzso In zzso cells, zinc significantly zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso previously as zzso zzso zzso and now a zzso molecular structure of zzso was zzso zzso of genes involved in zzso pathways indicated that certain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were highly regulated by zinc with zzso zzso This work provided an extensive database on zzso prostate cancer zzso The strategy of data analysis was devoted to finding genes highly sensitive to zzso and the genes associated with zinc zzso and zzso zzso The results indicate that zinc regulation of gene expression is zzso specific, and zzso genes play important roles in prostate zzso
