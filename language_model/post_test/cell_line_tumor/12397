It is commonly believed that high-quality zzso zzso with strong zzso can only be prepared under the protection of an zzso gas such as nitrogen or zzso Here, we report the preparation of highly zzso zzso zzso in air and compare their zzso properties with zzso zzso made in zzso We find that both zzso zzso zzso made in air and in nitrogen exhibit strong zzso as well as zzso zzso at room zzso However, differences do exist between the particles made in air and those made in zzso In particular, the particles prepared in air display a faster growth rate, grow to larger sizes, and display stronger electron zzso relative to the particles prepared in zzso X-ray zzso zzso analysis indicates that the oxygen content in the zzso zzso in air is higher that that in particles zzso in zzso likely resulting in a higher availability of excess free zzso zzso zzso reveal that the particles made in air appear slightly more toxic, possibly due to the excess of free zzso
