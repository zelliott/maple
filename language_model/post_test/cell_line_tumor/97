zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is well known to be associated with cell zzso zzso and migration in various types of zzso In the present study, we focused on the role of zzso in human prostate zzso zzso analysis revealed either no or rare expression of zzso in normal zzso zzso and prostate cancer cells at hormone zzso status, whereas the expression was significantly increased in viable cancer cells following zzso hormonal zzso zzso expression was much higher in the zzso independent prostate cancer cell lines zzso and zzso rather than the zzso zzso but the level in zzso was zzso in response to long-term culture under zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso reduced zzso production of zzso oxygen species through zzso zzso zzso 2 and induced zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso induced zzso to a similar zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells in nude mice demonstrated the reduction of tumor size by localized injection of zzso zzso in the presence of zzso Moreover, the mouse model and zzso membrane zzso demonstrated significant zzso of vascular zzso growth factor and tumor zzso by zzso of zzso In conclusion, zzso might participate in the process of zzso to zzso conversion, and be a new target zzso for hormone resistant prostate cancer zzso
