Since zzso agents that interfere with zzso function are in widespread use and have a broad spectrum of activity against both zzso zzso and solid tumors, there is an urgent need to develop novel zzso zzso with broader activities and avoiding drug zzso 

In this study, we describe the characterization of select lead compounds from a novel class of zzso zzso zzso Three lead compounds, zzso zzso and zzso exhibit potent zzso activity against cell lines derived from human pancreatic zzso human breast zzso and human zzso zzso zzso The three compounds were also tested for zzso against a panel of clinically relevant drug resistant cancer cell lines that either zzso the drug resistance pumps zzso zzso and zzso or have altered zzso II zzso zzso and zzso retained zzso activities against all of the resistant cell lines zzso however, zzso exhibited decreased zzso in the cell line zzso zzso indicating that zzso is a zzso of that zzso We show that zzso zzso activity is due to cell cycle arrest at the zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso binds specifically to the zzso site of zzso and that it zzso zzso zzso in zzso in a zzso zzso The in zzso zzso activities of zzso were assessed using the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso formation and zzso zzso vessels using zzso zzso zzso also increases zzso of vascular zzso cells in a zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso demonstrates potent in zzso efficacy as a novel zzso zzso and zzso agent and notably is more potent in zzso zzso than the benchmark compound zzso zzso These results identify zzso as a potent zzso zzso and support the investigation of its in zzso efficacy and zzso properties as the zzso of a new class of zzso zzso
