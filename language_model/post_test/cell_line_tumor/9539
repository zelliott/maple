Previous studies indicate that specific extracts and the pure zzso zzso zzso obtained from black zzso inhibit growth of human breast cancer zzso Our aim is to identify zzso in gene expression induced by treatment with a zzso extract zzso of black zzso 

We treated zzso human breast cancer cells with the zzso extract at 40 zzso and collected zzso at 6 and 24 zzso we confirmed the zzso results with real-time zzso for 18 zzso 

At 6 h after treatment there was significant increase in expression of zzso stress zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and Phase 1 zzso genes and, at 24 zzso decrease in expression of cell cycle zzso and zzso zzso 

Since the zzso extract activated genes that enhance zzso and zzso cell cycle zzso it may be useful in the prevention and therapy of breast zzso
