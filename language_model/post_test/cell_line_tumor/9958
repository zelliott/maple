Selective zzso of zzso interactions important for cellular processes could lead to the development of new therapies against zzso In the area of cancer, zzso of the proteins human double minute 2 zzso and its zzso zzso has been linked to tumor zzso Both zzso and zzso bind to zzso and prevent cell cycle arrest or zzso in damaged zzso zzso a strategy to simultaneously prevent the binding of both zzso and zzso to zzso is an essential feature of zzso to restore zzso activity in a number of different zzso zzso of zzso interactions with synthetic molecules is an emerging area of research that requires new zzso tailored to mimic the types of zzso between zzso Our strategy to create zzso of zzso interactions is to develop a zzso scaffold that may be used as a starting point to identify important molecular components necessary for zzso In this study, we report an zzso zzso scaffold that supports numerous zzso in a compact atomic zzso zzso were constructed by a series of reductive zzso between zzso acid derivatives followed by zzso at the resulting secondary zzso An zzso zzso was able to equally inhibit the association of both zzso and zzso with zzso Our results demonstrate some of the challenges associated with targeting multiple zzso interactions involved in overlapping cellular zzso
