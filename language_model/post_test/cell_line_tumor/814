zzso A, C and C2 are alternatively spliced products of the zzso zzso zzso A and C are expressed in differentiated zzso cells, whereas zzso C2 is expressed in germ zzso We have analyzed a segment of the first zzso of the zzso gene for zzso regulatory zzso We identified a zzso zzso that increased promoter activity in zzso zzso cells but zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso I zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso revealed two binding zzso zzso region A zzso and zzso The zzso nuclear zzso was bound to zzso only in zzso cell extracts and this motif had an zzso effect on promoter zzso The zzso X zzso zzso zzso bound near zzso with extracts from zzso A- or zzso cells, and this site enhanced promoter zzso We have, thus, identified two novel binding sites for zzso factors in a region likely to function as an important regulatory element for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
