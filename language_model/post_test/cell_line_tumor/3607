Recent researches found that an abundant production of zzso protein well zzso with tumor cell zzso This study was to investigate zzso effect of zzso on production of zzso 1 zzso and on zzso and invasion of breast cancer cell line zzso 

zzso cells were incubated with zzso expression of zzso was detected by zzso adhesive ability of zzso cells to artificial basement membrane zzso was measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed to detect the zzso changes of zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

Compared with control cells, the tumor cells zzso by zzso showed lower expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and less zzso to the zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso suppressed zzso zzso 

The expression of zzso zzso to zzso and invasion of zzso cells, zzso may weaken zzso and type IV zzso activity of zzso cells by zzso zzso
