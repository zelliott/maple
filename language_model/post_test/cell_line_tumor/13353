zzso promoter region zzso of upstream zzso factors may be responsible for zzso entire zzso gene zzso In this study, we explored whether zzso factor coding zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso is silenced by promoter zzso in lung cancer, and examined its potential zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that four of six lung cancer cell lines exhibited no or weak zzso zzso zzso of zzso was correlated to zzso promoter region zzso status, as determined by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Restoration of zzso expression was induced by treatment with zzso drug zzso zzso in lung cancer cell zzso zzso of zzso was common in human primary lung cancer zzso of 110 tumors, zzso but no zzso was found in normal lung zzso zzso of zzso suppressed lung cancer cell proliferation and blocked cells in zzso zzso zzso activity and downstream genes expression were inhibited by zzso of zzso and increased by depletion of zzso In conclusion, zzso is frequently zzso in lung cancer, and expression of zzso is regulated by promoter region zzso zzso may serve as a tumor zzso in lung cancer and zzso lung cancer cell proliferation by suppressing zzso zzso
