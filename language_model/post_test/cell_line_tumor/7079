An alternatively spliced form of the zzso 2 zzso gene lacking zzso 5 zzso was found in human brains with sporadic Alzheimer's zzso zzso was induced by hypoxic stress in human zzso zzso cells, indicating that hypoxic stress affects the zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso Here, we identified the critical zzso element zzso 2) on the zzso zzso responsible for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso 5 under hypoxic stress zzso The element was composed of 23 zzso in zzso 5 and zzso structural analyses showed a zzso structure in this zzso Treatment with an zzso zzso directed toward the zzso element caused an increase in zzso 5 zzso These results indicate that the zzso 2 identified in this study is a novel regulatory element for zzso 5 zzso under stress conditions and that zzso factors could specifically bind to the element to skip zzso 5 of zzso
