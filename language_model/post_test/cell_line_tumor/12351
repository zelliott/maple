zzso cell death is vital for a number of zzso zzso zzso cells are rapidly engulfed by zzso zzso zzso which in turn acquire an zzso zzso known as alternative zzso or the zzso Here we show that interaction of zzso cells with zzso zzso cell death pathways in the zzso Protection of human zzso required zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso and zzso zzso and correlated with zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso neither zzso nor binding of zzso debris to the zzso was necessary to induce zzso Surprisingly, zzso cells released zzso zzso mainly derived from zzso zzso 2, as a survival zzso This points to an active role of zzso cells in preventing cell destruction in their neighborhood, with implications for innate immunity and zzso
