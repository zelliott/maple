The development of zzso agents with low risk of adverse effects has been needed to treat zzso a chronic inflammatory zzso A zzso mixture of extracts from two natural zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was developed as a novel zzso agent zzso with zzso zzso The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of the zzso mixture on the release of inflammatory zzso and its zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso bone loss zzso in a rat zzso 

zzso was assessed by zzso zzso using human zzso zzso zzso and human zzso ligament zzso zzso Human acute zzso leukemia cell line and zzso cells were cultured to zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso analysis were performed to evaluate the efficacy of the zzso mixture to inhibit the destruction of zzso bone and zzso tissue in a rat zzso 

The zzso mixture is zzso at zzso exceeding zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on the results from zzso zzso it can be determined that the zzso ranges of the zzso mixture to be used in all subsequent in zzso and in zzso zzso The zzso mixture reduced the release of zzso and zzso from human zzso cells and zzso cells in a zzso manner zzso zzso The administration of the zzso mixture significantly reduced the zzso bone loss in a rat model zzso zzso In groups treated with the zzso mixture, zzso zzso zzso was detected along the zzso bone crest zzso but not around the zzso zzso zzso while in the group with zzso zzso pronounced expression of zzso around the ABC, zzso zzso and zzso zzso tissue was zzso 

The zzso mixture showed a potential zzso effect in the treatment of zzso However, the present findings are obtained in zzso and in a rat model, so further clinical study is needed for its clinical zzso
