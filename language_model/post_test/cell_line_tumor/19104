Human colon zzso cells zzso differing in zzso status were exposed to zzso zzso or zzso zzso and their gene expression responses compared by complementary DNA zzso zzso Exposure of cells to zzso for up to 24 h resulted in gene expression profiles more distinguishable by duration of exposure than by zzso status, although a subset of genes were identified that had significantly different expression in zzso zzso zzso cells relative to zzso zzso zzso zzso genes were zzso in zzso cells but not in zzso cells and, consistent with this, reduced viability and zzso activity were also zzso zzso zzso modulated cell cycle and zzso genes in both cell lines and, in agreement with this, both cell lines accumulated in S zzso In zzso cells, zzso arrest was also zzso which was associated with zzso of zzso Regardless of zzso status, exposure to zzso for up to 48 h had subtle effects on gene zzso and had no influence on cell viability or cell zzso Interestingly, DNA zzso formation after zzso but not zzso exposure was zzso dependent with zzso lower levels detected in zzso zzso Other cell lines were investigated for zzso zzso formation and in these the effect of zzso zzso was also to reduce zzso zzso Taken together, these results give further insight into the role of zzso in the response of human cells to zzso and zzso and suggest that loss of this zzso zzso can influence the zzso zzso of zzso
