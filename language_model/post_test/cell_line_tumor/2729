zzso processes are essential for the generation and dynamics of zzso zzso zzso In particular, zzso of the key zzso protein zzso precisely controls the period and phase of zzso zzso However, the mechanisms underlying that control are poorly zzso Here, we identified in a zzso zzso genetic screen zzso zzso 2 zzso as a zzso zzso and novel component of the zzso zzso zzso When zzso zzso are silenced by zzso or when zzso activity is inhibited zzso zzso rhythms are zzso zzso binds to zzso in zzso zzso zzso specifically at zzso zzso in zzso and supports normal nuclear zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso sites decreases zzso stability and copies zzso zzso regarding zzso zzso We propose a new concept of how zzso zzso and stabilization can set the clock speed in opposite directions, dependent on the phase of zzso
