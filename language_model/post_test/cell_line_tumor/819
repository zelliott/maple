We report the characterization of the nuclear zzso signal zzso of the short stature zzso gene zzso zzso within the zzso gene cause zzso zzso zzso and Langer zzso zzso zzso as well as idiopathic short stature zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso has also been implicated in Turner zzso zzso has been shown to be a zzso zzso zzso that zzso to the zzso The zzso protein contains a central zzso that together with its zzso domain regulates the zzso of its target sequences within the zzso The sequences for its nuclear zzso have not been identified zzso Experimental characterization of zzso by deletion mapping identified a zzso type basic zzso zzso in the recognition zzso of the zzso Fusion of this stretch of five zzso acids to a zzso reporter protein resulted in its nuclear zzso zzso analysis of a zzso zzso zzso zzso affecting the identified zzso in two families with zzso and zzso showed that the zzso zzso protein is unable to enter the zzso zzso we can demonstrate that zzso of the identified signal adjacent to the zzso site can restore its nuclear zzso These results establish impairment of nuclear zzso as a zzso basis for zzso zzso
