zzso zzso zzso optical zzso have been able to provide a zzso assessment of zzso activity for a number of different zzso and types of zzso Here we describe a dual zzso zzso probe featuring one zzso zzso that is activated by zzso activity and a second zzso that is zzso resistant and serves as an internal zzso The probe was prepared by attaching zzso directly to an zzso an zzso functional zzso iron oxide zzso zzso carrier, in a zzso resistant zzso zzso was attached to a zzso sensitive zzso zzso zzso also attached to zzso In zzso and in zzso the ratio of the zzso to zzso zzso was increased by zzso reflecting the increase in zzso zzso by zzso in the vicinity of the zzso In zzso and in zzso the absolute values of the zzso and zzso zzso reflected zzso size and the distance of zzso from the surface, while the ratio of zzso to zzso zzso obtained was constant and independent of zzso size and zzso The dual zzso probe, and related dual wavelength imaging method, represents a novel approach for imaging zzso activity in zzso
