To investigate the zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso on gastric zzso 

zzso cells were cultured in different zzso of serum zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso ratio of the cells was measured by zzso zzso zzso was observed by zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Each concentration of serum zzso zzso zzso zzso could inhibit cells zzso Among them, both high and medium concentration could inhibit zzso Moreover, high concentration could induce cells zzso 

zzso zzso zzso serum has zzso effect on zzso cells and the effect may be related to cell zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso
