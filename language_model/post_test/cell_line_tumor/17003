In the present study zzso zzso were zzso zzso and characterized by zzso studies zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These compounds were evaluated for zzso against a panel of human cancer cell lines zzso for liver zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for human breast zzso The cells were zzso with these zzso derivatives at varying zzso and cell viability was measured by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso as positive zzso zzso zzso activities were observed in zzso for some members of the series, and compounds zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are active zzso agents against different cancer cell lines with zzso values in the range of zzso zzso The obtained data suggested that better zzso activity was linked with introduction of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso ring zzso Outcomes of zzso also reveal that incorporation of zzso group in zzso zzso contributes positively for zzso action of zzso zzso experiments showed a good correlation between their calculated interaction energies with the zzso and the observed zzso values of all these zzso
