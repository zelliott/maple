In this paper, we investigated interactions of the zzso zzso sugar chain zzso derived from brown algae zzso zzso zzso with zzso beta protein zzso We observed that zzso inhibited the toxicity induced by zzso in both primarily cortical cells and the zzso cell zzso We also observed that zzso inhibited the zzso induced by zzso in zzso by reducing the elevated level of zzso calcium concentration zzso and suppressing the generation of zzso oxygen zzso Surface zzso resonance analysis demonstrated that zzso had affinity for both zzso zzso and zzso incubated zzso Furthermore, zzso blocked the zzso formation of zzso which may be responsible for its zzso zzso Thus, our results indicate that zzso might be a potentially therapeutic compound for Alzheimer's zzso
