This study aimed too evaluate the proliferation and zzso of human zzso cancer cell lines zzso and zzso after exposure to a simulated zzso carbon dioxide zzso zzso environment at different pressures and lengths of exposure zzso 

The effects of the simulated zzso CO2 zzso environment at different CO2 pressures zzso zzso and exposure times zzso zzso on tumor cell growth and zzso were assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso index zzso zzso or zzso V and zzso zzso flow zzso zzso cultured in a standard environment were used as the control zzso 

In this study, zzso cell growth tended to slow down with the increase in CO2 pressure and exposure zzso A significantly lower zzso was observed at 72 h of culture after exposure to both 8 and 16 zzso of pressure, as compared with the control and 0 zzso pressure group zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso cells tended to decline after zzso zzso lower zzso was observed in the group with exposure to 16 zzso for 4 h over a zzso period, as compared with the control groups exposed to 0 zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of cell growth was associated with an increase in the proportion of cells at stage zzso The zzso index and the percentage of zzso cells tended to increase with an increase in pressure and a prolonged time of zzso 

The results suggest inhibited cell proliferation and increased cell zzso of human zzso cancer cells were positively related to CO2 pressure and exposure zzso
