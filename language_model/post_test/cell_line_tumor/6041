zzso zzso is a zzso zzso inhibitor recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration, which is indicated for the treatment of drug-resistant chronic zzso leukemia zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso cassette (ABC) drug zzso which actively pump these drugs out of cells utilizing zzso as an energy source, has been linked to the development of drug resistance in zzso zzso We report here the synthesis and characterization of a fluorescent zzso of zzso to study its interaction with two major ABC zzso zzso zzso and zzso in in zzso and ex zzso zzso A fluorescent zzso of zzso zzso FL zzso inhibited the zzso zzso activity in zzso cells and was also zzso by zzso and zzso cells in both cultured cells and rat brain zzso expressing zzso and zzso In addition, zzso was found to be transported by zzso polarized zzso cells in a zzso transport zzso zzso with these results, both zzso and zzso FL zzso were less effective at zzso the zzso of zzso (a zzso of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso cells due to their reduced zzso zzso Taken together, these data provide evidence that zzso FL zzso is transported by zzso and zzso and zzso is transported by zzso Further, we propose that zzso FL zzso can potentially be used as a probe for functional analysis of zzso and zzso in cancer cells and in other zzso zzso
