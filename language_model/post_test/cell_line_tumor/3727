zzso zzso are characterized as zzso of vascular zzso growth factor zzso In the current study, the authors assessed the expression of zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor receptors zzso as well as zzso cell zzso in pancreatic zzso cell lines and tissue zzso 

Human pancreatic zzso cell lines zzso and zzso zzso normal human pancreatic zzso zzso cells zzso and human zzso vein zzso cells zzso were zzso Human pancreatic zzso tissue specimens were also zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso were determined by real-time zzso chain reaction analysis and zzso Cell proliferation was examined using a zzso incorporation zzso 

Both zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso cells, zzso cells, and zzso but were expressed minimally in zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed 30 times more zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso levels in zzso cells were zzso times higher than in zzso cells but were similar to zzso levels in zzso zzso levels in zzso cells were similar to zzso levels in zzso cells but lower than zzso levels in zzso zzso of all three zzso was observed only in zzso However, zzso zzso was detected in all cell types except for zzso zzso zzso levels were much higher than zzso zzso levels in zzso and human pancreatic zzso tissue zzso whereas zzso were not detected in either of these two zzso In response to zzso zzso incorporation in zzso cells increased significantly (by zzso P zzso zzso A zzso zzso against human zzso significantly blocked zzso cell proliferation in zzso zzso 

The pancreatic zzso cell line zzso and zzso tissue specimens expressed high levels of zzso and zzso but not zzso and zzso zzso significantly increased zzso but not zzso zzso cell zzso These data suggested that zzso may be involved in the zzso of pancreatic zzso
