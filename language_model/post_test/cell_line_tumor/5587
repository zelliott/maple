Heat shock proteins zzso are primarily known as molecular zzso that are induced by cell stress and prevent protein zzso and facilitate zzso Recent evidence suggests that exposure of cells to microbial pathogens can also induce zzso which then zzso both innate and zzso immune zzso Paradoxically, zzso zzso has been found to decrease expression of zzso We sought to investigate this phenomenon further and to examine the role of different zzso zzso strains and recognized zzso factors in cell culture and in the mouse zzso zzso of zzso zzso with two gastric zzso cell lines reduced expression of zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso Down zzso of zzso was not dependent on the presence of the zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso island zzso zzso zzso mice infected with a human zzso zzso strain also demonstrated reduced expression of zzso zzso and heat shock factor 1 zzso a zzso zzso of zzso In contrast, the bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Since zzso are thought to function as danger signals during microbial infection, zzso zzso zzso of zzso may be a mechanism of immune evasion that promotes chronic zzso
