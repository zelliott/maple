zzso zzso are the most common benign tumors of the zzso We previously identified zzso zzso as a zzso and zzso factor in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A major role of zzso zzso in the zzso effect was zzso Here we investigated, in zzso and zzso cells, the respective contribution of ETA and zzso in the zzso effect of zzso In zzso cells, binding experiments show that ETA is almost exclusively expressed and stimulates zzso C zzso activity and zzso zzso and zzso In zzso cells, zzso is expressed at about the same level as zzso and the two receptors are differently coupled to zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulates zzso activity zzso less than zzso but is as potent as zzso to increase zzso zzso and induce zzso However, the ability of ETA to activate zzso is observed after zzso zzso Although ETA and zzso zzso partially reduce zzso zzso zzso activity, they are without effect on zzso zzso zzso and zzso Only the simultaneous use of ETA and zzso zzso reduces zzso zzso zzso These unconventional properties of zzso may reveal the existence of functional zzso zzso Finally, treatment of zzso cells with zzso but not zzso small interfering zzso reduces the zzso effect of zzso All the data obtained in zzso cells strengthen the relation between zzso zzso which decreases the ETA to zzso ratio, and the ability of zzso cells to highly zzso and resist zzso
