zzso zzso factor zzso is a master gene regulating differentiation of zzso and a lineage survival zzso zzso zzso function in zzso zzso However, high expression of zzso also has an zzso zzso To clarify the therapeutic implication of zzso as a molecular target for human melanoma, we evaluated the role of zzso in cell proliferation in a panel of human melanoma cell lines which express different levels of zzso We found that both zzso depletion and forced expression of zzso significantly inhibited zzso suggesting that zzso zzso is regulated at an appropriate level for melanoma cell zzso and could be a molecular target for zzso However, half of the melanoma cell lines in this study were relatively resistant to zzso zzso indicating other treatment strategies are required for zzso Our zzso analysis indicated that regulation of several cell zzso molecules may be independent of zzso and dependent on zzso Thus to enhance the zzso effect of zzso zzso we combined zzso zzso depletion with zzso zzso another known molecular target for zzso Indeed, simultaneous depletion of both zzso and zzso significantly inhibited melanoma growth even for the melanoma cell lines resistant to zzso zzso These results suggest zzso may be an important molecular target for human melanoma and simultaneous zzso of zzso and zzso signaling may be an attractive strategy for melanoma zzso
