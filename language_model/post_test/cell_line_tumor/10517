Liver cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed zzso and the leading cause of death in human zzso zzso a zzso has been shown to induce zzso in many human cancer cells, but the effects of zzso on the migration and invasion of human liver cancer cells are not zzso zzso we found that zzso is effective in the suppression of migration and invasion in zzso human zzso cells by using the zzso cell migration zzso and invasion zzso The gelatin zzso zzso indicated that zzso inhibited the activity of zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso Western zzso analysis indicated that zzso decreased the levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso A, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibited the zzso binding activity in zzso cells by zzso mobility shift zzso We also found that zzso decreased the zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells by in zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, this is the first study to demonstrate that zzso might be a novel zzso agent for the treatment of zzso through zzso migration and zzso
