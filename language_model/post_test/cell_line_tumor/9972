To examine relationships between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at the zzso level in three different human zzso cell zzso zzso 

zzso mice bearing zzso zzso and zzso zzso were injected with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging was used to determine spatial distribution of zzso and zzso content in serial zzso zzso zzso levels were grouped in 10 concentration zzso Images were zzso and at each concentration range the proportion of area stained for zzso and zzso was determined in zzso zzso per zzso zzso 

The spatial distribution of zzso in zzso hypoxic and zzso zzso areas is zzso by pronounced zzso In all three zzso lines zzso concentration decreased with increasing zzso hypoxic fraction and increased with increasing zzso area at the zzso zzso A weak albeit significant positive correlation between zzso concentration and zzso hypoxic fraction was found only in zzso zzso concentration consistently decreased with increasing zzso area in all three zzso zzso 

Both zzso consumption and supply may contribute to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso may be governed by clearance zzso The extent of zzso zzso cannot be predicted from the zzso concentration indicating that both parameters need to be measured zzso
