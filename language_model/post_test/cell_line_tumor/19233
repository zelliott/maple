zzso zzso zzso an zzso in folate and homocysteine zzso influences many cellular processes including zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and maintenance of homocysteine at nontoxic zzso zzso zzso of zzso is common in many populations and zzso risk for several complex traits including vascular disease, birth zzso and zzso We recently demonstrated that zzso can be zzso by zzso an important zzso of cell survival that is activated by zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso coupled with the reports that homocysteine can induce zzso stress, prompted us to examine the possible regulation of zzso by zzso zzso We found that several well characterized stress zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as homocysteine could increase zzso zzso and protein in zzso zzso The induction of zzso was also observed after zzso of zzso zzso zzso and was inhibited by a zzso zzso of zzso Because zzso triggers zzso zzso we examined the possible involvement of zzso in zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and two zzso of zzso zzso and sodium zzso increased zzso zzso whereas a reported inhibitor of zzso zzso and a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso We conclude that zzso stress increases zzso expression and that zzso and zzso mediate this zzso These findings provide a novel mechanism by which the zzso can regulate zzso and zzso to an important role for zzso in cell zzso
