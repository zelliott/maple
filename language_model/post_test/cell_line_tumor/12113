zzso is a manifestation of acquired defects in regulatory circuits that direct normal cell proliferation and zzso Most of these circuits operate through cell autonomous zzso whereas others potentially involve the neighboring zzso We report that the zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in several acquired tumor cell capabilities by zzso the availability of soluble transforming growth zzso an zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and thus the establishment of a key zzso signaling zzso zzso of zzso in human zzso zzso cell lines zzso critical features associated with cancer cells, including growth zzso tumor zzso and tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer cells fail to form in zzso tumors in the absence of zzso confirming the essential function of this zzso in zzso These data show that zzso shedding is a crucial step in zzso zzso zzso and endorse prospective therapeutic strategies targeting zzso in human zzso
