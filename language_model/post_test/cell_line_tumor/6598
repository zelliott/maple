Human artificial zzso zzso behave as independent zzso and are potentially useful as a way to achieve safe, long-term expression of a zzso In this study, we sought to zzso the potential of HAC zzso carrying the human zzso zzso for gene therapy of zzso diabetes zzso zzso using zzso as a host for the zzso To facilitate the production of mature insulin in zzso and to safely regulate the level of zzso zzso we introduced zzso sites into the zzso coding region and zzso the heat shock protein 70 zzso zzso We used zzso zzso to introduce the gene zzso onto zzso a HAC zzso whose structure is completely zzso present in human zzso zzso zzso We observed long-term expression and stable retention of the zzso without zzso zzso of the HAC zzso As expected, the zzso promoter allowed us to regulate gene expression with temperature, and the production and zzso of zzso of mature insulin were made possible by the zzso sites we had introduced into zzso This study can be an initial step on the application of HAC zzso on the gene delivery to zzso which might provide a direction for future treatment for zzso
