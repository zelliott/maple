zzso cancer is one of the direct causes of zzso zzso High level of zzso is one of the major obstacles of clinical zzso In recent years, cancer stem cells have been widely identified and indicated as the origin of zzso in zzso of solid zzso zzso zzso suggest that cancer stem cells reside in the cells capable of forming zzso zzso However, in pancreatic cancer, zzso cells have not been characterized zzso zzso the goal of our present study was to zzso the zzso pancreatic cancer stem cells and develop an in zzso continuous colony formation system, which will greatly facilitate the study of pancreatic cancer stem zzso 

zzso cancer cell line zzso was submitted to zzso zzso to generate zzso Based on the zzso colonies were classified and analyzed for their capacities of secondary colony formation, long-term survival in zzso tumor formation in zzso and drug zzso zzso and quantitative zzso were performed to detect the expression level of cancer stem cells associated cell surface zzso regulatory genes and zzso in distinct types of zzso Three types of colonies with distinct zzso were identified and termed as zzso zzso and zzso in which only zzso generated descendant colonies of all three types in further zzso Compared to zzso and zzso zzso possessed higher capacities of long-term survival, tumor zzso and zzso The preferential expression of cancer stem cells related marker zzso regulatory genes zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso were also zzso 

Our results indicate that the pancreatic zzso cells with high level of zzso were enriched in zzso derived from zzso cell zzso Generation of zzso can serve as a novel model for studying cancer stem cells, and attribute to developing new zzso zzso
