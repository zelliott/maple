A major focus of cancer research is to identify compounds that sensitize resistant cancer cells to radiation zzso Lung cancer cells, in particular, have high rates of zzso that lead to treatment zzso We have previously shown that the zzso induced in the context of decreased zzso zzso zzso to prostate and lung cancer zzso zzso supplementation has zzso effects in cell zzso In addition, the zzso of zinc in response to zzso stress has been associated with increased zzso in zzso and breast cancer zzso 

In this study, we hypothesized that the zinc zzso zzso zzso lung cancer cells by inducing zzso cell zzso To test this hypothesis, we used a combination of in zzso and in zzso approaches, including zzso zzso to test for zzso zzso analyses of zzso and zzso and a zzso mouse model of tumor zzso 

We found that zzso reduced zzso survival in treated cells compared with zzso cells zzso versus zzso surviving zzso p zzso zzso The increased zzso fraction of zzso cells was accompanied by increased zzso zzso treatment also reduced zzso zzso In an zzso zzso mouse model, the tumor growth of zzso zzso mice was slower than zzso zzso mice zzso days versus 22 days to reach a zzso zzso tumor zzso 

zzso treatment zzso lung cancer cells to radiation, both in zzso and in zzso This data suggest that zzso could potentially treat zzso advanced lung cancer by amplifying the effects of zzso
