zzso in zzso have been reported to associate with Parkinson's disease zzso This study investigates the contribution of genetic zzso in zzso to Taiwanese zzso zzso zzso fragments from 65 early onset zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso The identified zzso were validated in a cohort of zzso zzso zzso zzso and ethnically matched controls zzso zzso zzso A novel zzso zzso located at the zzso seventh zzso domain of zzso zzso was identified in an early onset zzso patient, which was absent in zzso normal zzso Additionally, a reported zzso zzso was found in two zzso patients and four zzso The clinical features and zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso image of the patients carrying zzso and zzso were similar to that of idiopathic zzso One normal control with zzso showed an zzso reduction of zzso zzso zzso in the right zzso Under zzso stress or zzso zzso zzso cells carrying either zzso or zzso showed increased zzso 3 activity compared with the zzso The rates of zzso for zzso and zzso proteins were more or less reduced in zzso chase zzso In zzso modeling of zzso exhibited a more stable feature than zzso and zzso is zzso mainly in the zzso space, which is coherent with the prediction of prohibiting zzso and membrane zzso We therefore zzso that rare zzso of zzso may contribute to zzso zzso in zzso The role played by zzso zzso in zzso remains to be zzso
