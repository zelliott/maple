To study the effect of red oil A5 on pancreatic cancer cells and its possible zzso 

Effect of different zzso of red oil A5 on proliferation of three pancreatic cancer cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso was measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso effects of zzso zzso red oil A5 on proliferation of three pancreatic cancer cell lines, were also measured by zzso zzso zzso and zzso effects of zzso zzso red oil A5 on cell zzso The cells were counted by zzso zzso zzso analysis of cellular DNA content in the control and red oil A5 treated zzso zzso and zzso cells, were stained with zzso zzso zzso zzso of red oil zzso pancreatic cancer cell zzso was zzso Western zzso of the zzso c protein in zzso zzso and zzso cells treated 24 hours with zzso zzso red oil A5 was zzso zzso in zzso fraction and in zzso fraction were zzso zzso extracted from each sample were zzso on zzso gels and then were transferred to zzso zzso zzso c was identified using a zzso zzso c zzso Western zzso of the zzso protein in zzso zzso and zzso cells treated with zzso zzso red oil A5 for 24 hours was carried zzso zzso in whole cellular zzso were zzso on zzso gels and then transferred to zzso zzso zzso was identified using a specific zzso Western zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso and zzso cells treated with zzso zzso red oil A5 for 24 hours was zzso zzso in whole cellular zzso were separated by zzso on zzso gels and then transferred to zzso zzso zzso was identified by using a zzso zzso 

Red oil A5 caused zzso and zzso zzso of pancreatic cancer cell zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso showed an increase of the zzso cell zzso The DNA fragmentation induced by red oil A5 in these three cell lines was confirmed by the zzso zzso Furthermore, Western zzso analysis indicated that zzso c was released from zzso to zzso during zzso and zzso was activated following red oil A5 treatment which was measured by zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

These findings show that red oil A5 has potent zzso effects on human pancreatic cancer cells with induction of zzso in zzso
