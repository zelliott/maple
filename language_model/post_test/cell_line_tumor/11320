The effects of the zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso were investigated using two zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso cell zzso The combined zzso treatment significantly inhibited zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso in two of the three cell zzso zzso of the responsive cell lines revealed that zzso decreased the zzso of zzso signatures that are associated with the cell cycle, DNA replication and cell zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso was identified as the main zzso of the in zzso and in zzso zzso activity of zzso Combined treatment compared with single agents significantly suppressed cell growth zzso zzso induced severe zzso dysfunction and zzso cell death (up to zzso zzso in a synergistic zzso Furthermore, in zzso zzso studies demonstrated a significant reduction in tumor burden ( zzso an increased survival time zzso vs 45 days, zzso an increased zzso zzso to zzso zzso and necrosis zzso to zzso zzso in zzso animals compared with mice receiving single zzso These data provide a rationale for clinical trials using zzso zzso
