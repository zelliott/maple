Natural products represent a rich zzso of potential small zzso zzso exhibiting zzso and zzso zzso An example is the zzso zzso zzso which is found in plants such as zzso zzso zzso Studies have shown that zzso is able to trigger zzso in different zzso cell lines, and can also lead to cell cycle arrest at zzso zzso A particularly interesting feature of zzso is the fact that it is a fluorescent zzso and its zzso and distribution in cells can be studied by flow zzso and zzso zzso To test the relationships between zzso zzso distribution and cellular effect in melanoma cells, zzso mouse and zzso human melanoma cells were treated with different zzso of zzso and zzso in cell cycle zzso DNA zzso cell zzso and cell death zzso 

Cell proliferation was measured by zzso B zzso cell death by flow zzso zzso zzso and distribution by laser scanning zzso zzso and flow zzso cell cycle progression by flow zzso and DNA zzso zzso and zzso effects by zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

In these melanoma cell lines, zzso at low doses zzso zzso is concentrated in zzso and promotes zzso zzso In contrast, higher doses (over 50 zzso result in zzso and nuclear zzso zzso and zzso zzso DNA synthesis is not markedly affected by low doses of zzso but 100 zzso is strongly zzso Even at 100 zzso zzso zzso cell growth with relatively little induction of zzso 

zzso displays zzso effects in these zzso cell lines, which are correlated with the concentration and zzso distribution of this zzso These results help explain some of the conflicting information in the literature regarding the effects of zzso and suggest that its use in clinical development may be more as a zzso agent than a zzso zzso
