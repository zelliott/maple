In this study, we showed that zzso treatment resulted in zzso of zzso zzso checkpoint, which was associated with the induction of zzso arrest and the resistance of cancer cells to zzso zzso Further investigation revealed that zzso of zzso significantly zzso zzso arrest and zzso zzso cells to zzso via zzso of Bad and in turn the loss of zzso membrane zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso arrest may serve as a mechanism for zzso resistance and zzso represents a potential target for the reversal of this zzso Our findings should be helpful for clinical application of zzso
