zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso in zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso regulate cell division, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the last step in the zzso of zzso zzso an essential zzso of zzso oxide zzso and has been implicated in neurological diseases but not yet in zzso In this study, we present compelling evidence that native zzso and zzso physically zzso and we defined the individual zzso acid zzso involved in both zzso using in zzso zzso zzso zzso The resulting zzso is a surprisingly compact structure, featuring two energetically and structurally equivalent binding modes both in zzso and in zzso zzso The novel interaction between zzso and zzso proteins was confirmed under zzso conditions by zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso we showed that zzso zzso interfering zzso zzso of zzso expression significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso cells, thus demonstrating the biological relevance of the zzso zzso Finally, in a cohort of 88 human zzso tumors, we found that high zzso zzso expression correlated significantly with poor survival prognosis using a zzso analysis zzso test, zzso zzso zzso suggesting an zzso role for zzso in zzso zzso In conclusion, we showed that zzso binds zzso and thus propose a new concept in which two zzso zzso pathways zzso via the interaction of two zzso We identified zzso as a novel regulator of zzso zzso activity and, based on clinical evidence, present a model in which zzso drives zzso zzso progression in zzso
