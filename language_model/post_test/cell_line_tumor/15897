As one of the most common zzso colon cancer is initiated by abnormal zzso of the zzso zzso Although the treatment options have increased for some patients, overall progress has been zzso Thus, there is a great need to develop new zzso We have found that zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits zzso zzso zzso is used as a calcium channel blocker to treat zzso and zzso conditions in Chinese zzso Here, we investigate the molecular basis underlying zzso zzso zzso We compare zzso with six chemotherapy drugs in eight cancer lines and find that zzso exhibits comparable zzso activities with zzso zzso zzso and zzso and better than that of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso in most of the tested cancer zzso zzso exhibits synergistic zzso activity with zzso and reduces migration and invasion capabilities of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso tumor growth of colon zzso zzso treatment leads to a decrease in zzso protein level in zzso tumors, which is confirmed by zzso zzso zzso factor and zzso reporter zzso It is noteworthy that zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso deleted are less sensitive to zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso tumor zzso Thus, our findings strongly suggest that the zzso effect of zzso in colon cancer may be at least in part zzso by targeting zzso zzso zzso zzso may be used alone or in combination as an effective zzso zzso
