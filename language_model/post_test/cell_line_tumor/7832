We have analyzed the role of zzso zzso in zzso acid zzso zzso transcription, which is zzso by the zzso regulator zzso zzso induction of the zzso genes can be prevented by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso specifically affects the zzso of zzso zzso zzso but not that of their zzso regulators, the zzso nor of zzso zzso nor of actively transcribed zzso zzso zzso treatment zzso the recruitment to the zzso gene zzso of a complex composed of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as the accessory zzso components zzso and zzso We show that zzso of zzso zzso prevents such zzso We conclude that zzso zzso genes are selectively sensitive to the zzso of zzso zzso and that zzso zzso is required for the assembly of a zzso complex on the regulatory region of the zzso zzso
