zzso a zzso protein zzso zzso is a candidate tumor zzso gene because its expression was blocked in rat and human zzso transformed cells, and its restoration reverted their zzso zzso In addition, loss of zzso zzso has been described in zzso lung and colon primary zzso We now show that zzso is drastically reduced in several cell lines originating from human zzso pancreatic zzso compared with normal pancreatic zzso We also show that the infection of zzso and zzso cells with a zzso zzso carrying zzso zzso (the rat zzso of zzso zzso their zzso zzso zzso analysis of the infected cells demonstrated that restoration of zzso activity zzso their cell cycle and leads to zzso Finally, the growth of zzso zzso tumors was blocked by the zzso injection of a zzso zzso virus carrying zzso The data suggest that restoration of zzso expression could be a useful tool for the gene therapy of human pancreatic zzso
