zzso growth factor zzso and its zzso zzso are associated with increased aggressiveness of tumors and poor zzso outcome of patients with zzso Here, we report the development and characterization of therapeutic zzso zzso and their potential for zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging to assess zzso expression in zzso Two zzso designated zzso and zzso were identified, zzso and zzso fused to an zzso zzso unit zzso to obtain serum zzso zzso The resulting zzso formats were zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 78 hours), administered to nude mice bearing zzso zzso zzso zzso and their zzso was zzso In addition, their therapeutic effect was evaluated in the same animal model at doses of 10, 30, or 100 zzso per zzso The zzso showed similar zzso with selective tumor zzso For example, zzso showed decreased blood levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at 1, 2, 3, and 7 days after injection, whereas tumor zzso levels remained relatively stable at these time zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in normal zzso was lower than in zzso except for zzso In a therapy study, all zzso mice showed tumor growth delay compared with the control saline zzso In the zzso group, four of six mice were cured after treatment with zzso and 73 days zzso and three of six mice when treated with zzso These results provide evidence that zzso zzso and zzso have potential for therapy and PET imaging of zzso zzso
