zzso zzso zzso leukemia viral zzso zzso 2, zzso gene amplification and zzso has been reported in several types of zzso The purpose of this study was to zzso determine the frequency of zzso amplification (in comparison to other zzso in tumors from patients with zzso zzso zzso characterize structural details of an zzso zzso in the zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and zzso test whether growth of the zzso cell line is sensitive to the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso San Francisco, zzso 

First, we determined the frequency, by Southern zzso techniques, of amplification of zzso and 13 other zzso in a panel of 25 zzso zzso zzso Then, in a second panel of 10 tumor zzso expression levels of the zzso gene and of several other genes that flank zzso on zzso 17 were determined by zzso zzso Next we characterized the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso cell line zzso using zzso methods and a zzso protein assisted restriction zzso mapping zzso Finally, an in zzso growth zzso zzso was used to measure the sensitivity of zzso and zzso cells to treatment with zzso zzso zzso to zzso 

zzso was the most frequently amplified zzso among 25 zzso zzso tumors tested zzso than zzso amplification in 3 of 25 zzso tumors zzso The zzso cell line contains a zzso amplification of the zzso zzso and highly expresses its zzso zzso zzso zzso from genes that flank zzso including zzso a protein linked to zzso in zzso cancer, also showed high levels of zzso In zzso cells, the zzso zzso was localized to a zzso zzso region of zzso zzso Southern blots from the zzso protein assisted restriction zzso zzso mapping experiments in zzso showed a strong band of 210 zzso in size, demonstrating that the main zzso was a tandem zzso In the in zzso growth zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso and zzso cells growth by zzso and zzso respectively, at a zzso concentration of 20 zzso 

zzso is the most frequently amplified zzso in zzso zzso among the genes that we zzso In the zzso zzso zzso cell line, the zzso zzso is zzso onto zzso 14, is amplified zzso at the zzso acid level, and is highly zzso at the zzso zzso acid zzso Finally, the growth of this cell line was inhibited by incubation with zzso These results demonstrate that a substantial number of zzso zzso have amplified copies of the zzso zzso and that they may be responsive to zzso targeted therapies such as zzso
