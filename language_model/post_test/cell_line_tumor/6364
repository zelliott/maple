zzso zzso are highly lethal tumors resistant to current zzso The standard treatment zzso for these tumors, surgical zzso followed by radiation therapy and concurrent zzso has demonstrated activity, but development of resistance and disease progression is zzso Although zzso Ras zzso are uncommon in zzso Ras has been found to be zzso activated through the action of upstream signaling zzso suggesting that zzso zzso may show activity against these zzso We now report the in zzso and zzso in zzso results of combination therapy using radiation, zzso and zzso zzso an oral zzso zzso zzso in a zzso model of zzso We examined the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of downstream signaling of zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso alone or in combination with radiation and zzso had limited tumor cell zzso in zzso although it did demonstrate significant zzso in tumor cell zzso In zzso zzso alone had a modest ability to inhibit zzso zzso tumors, radiation and zzso demonstrated better zzso while significant zzso activity was found with concurrent zzso radiation, and zzso with the majority of animals demonstrating a decrease in tumor zzso The use of tumor zzso derived from freshly zzso adult human zzso tissue was relatively resistant to both zzso and radiation zzso zzso had a significant zzso activity against these zzso and could potentate the activity of zzso and zzso These data support the continued research of high grade zzso treatment combinations of zzso zzso zzso zzso and radiation zzso
