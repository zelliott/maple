To evaluate the role of zzso as a molecular marker zzso of the treatment response to zzso in prostate cancer zzso 

Four zzso cell lines with graded zzso expression levels and 63 primary tumor cultures derived from men with zzso and selected according to zzso tumor levels were zzso zzso tumor cultures and zzso cell lines were treated with zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso for 4 zzso The presence of a significant correlation between zzso expression and drug efficacy was used to define the role of zzso as molecular predictor of zzso zzso As an indicator of drug effectiveness we used the concentration that zzso 50% values determined after zzso zzso 

After zzso treatment, no significant differences in the concentration that zzso 50% were found among the different tumor cell lines zzso zzso zzso In this experimental model, the correlation analysis suggested that the effectiveness of this drug was not influenced by zzso levels zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In primary cultures with high zzso levels zzso tumor zzso the mean value of the concentration that zzso 50% for zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and in cultures with low zzso levels (20 tumor zzso the same zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The correlation analysis suggested that the effectiveness of this drug was not influenced by zzso levels zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

Our zzso data seem to indicate that the zzso effect of zzso is independent of zzso levels in zzso models of zzso zzso could be configured as a zzso option to treat patients with high or low levels of zzso
