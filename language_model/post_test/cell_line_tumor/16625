zzso expression in a tumor zzso can impact both host defense against the tumor and tumor cell zzso In this study, we sought to clarify whether the zzso gene expression profile could have clinical associations with zzso zzso We analyzed the expression of 16 zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of these tumors was carried out using zzso software and zzso expressed genes were examined between clear cell zzso zzso and other zzso Following this examination we evaluated the biological significance of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso gene expression revealed two distinct zzso The relationship between the two clusters and clinical parameters showed statistically significant differences in CCC compared to other zzso CCC showed a dominant zzso zzso expression pattern driven largely by zzso zzso zzso of zzso in CCC cells suppressed zzso signaling and rendered cells sensitive to zzso zzso The unique zzso expression pattern found in CCC may be involved in the zzso of this zzso In particular, high zzso expression appears likely to be driven by the tumor cells, fueling an zzso zzso involving zzso expression and zzso zzso and may influence survival when exposed to zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression or its related signaling zzso may be a promising strategy of treatment for zzso
