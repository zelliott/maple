Many zzso zzso zzso regulators of numerous cellular processes and zzso events, are zzso in zzso However, their role in zzso remains largely zzso In this work, we examined the role of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in human zzso zzso a soft tissue zzso thought to arise from skeletal muscle zzso We have shown that zzso was barely zzso in primary zzso of both the zzso and zzso zzso and that both zzso and zzso failed to be induced in zzso cell lines upon serum zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso in zzso cells promoted zzso differentiation and blocked tumor growth in zzso mice by switching the global zzso expression profile to one that resembled mature zzso Finally, we showed that the product of the zzso zzso the Met zzso zzso which is zzso in zzso and has been implicated in zzso zzso was zzso in zzso satellite cells by zzso at the onset of normal zzso Thus, failure of zzso zzso may zzso Met zzso in zzso and other types of zzso We propose that zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso given their ability to zzso hundreds of transcripts and to act as nontoxic zzso agents, may override the zzso zzso of solid tumors and ultimately hold greater therapeutic potential than single zzso zzso
