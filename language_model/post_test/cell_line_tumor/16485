zzso zzso 1 zzso a member of the zzso zzso family, plays a key role in zzso growth and zzso In the present study, we examined the potential role of zzso as a therapeutic target for zzso Here, we show that the active zzso form of zzso is abundantly expressed in a panel of zzso cell lines, including mantle cell, zzso large cell, and zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso expression via the use of zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso and zzso and induced zzso in zzso cell zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of zzso a novel zzso small zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cell zzso These molecular events were associated with the release of zzso c into the zzso zzso of zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso of zzso 9, and induction of zzso We also demonstrate that primary zzso cells express zzso and zzso and were sensitive to zzso cell zzso zzso our data demonstrate an essential role for zzso in regulating critical survival mechanisms in zzso and suggest that it may serve as a therapeutic zzso
