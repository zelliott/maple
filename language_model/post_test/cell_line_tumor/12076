zzso treatment followed by surgery is currently being investigated for locally advanced zzso cell lung cancer zzso This study reports zzso toxicity and feasibility of zzso chemotherapy with concurrent zzso zzso in stage zzso zzso positive zzso 

From March 2001 to February 2004, 52 patients with zzso confirmed stage zzso zzso positive zzso were zzso Patients received zzso zzso that consisted of weekly zzso plus platinum chemotherapy and concurrent zzso followed by zzso 

zzso response rate was zzso zzso zzso zzso The major grade zzso zzso were radiation zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso mortality rate was zzso zzso of 52 patients zzso subsequently underwent surgical zzso and 35 of 52 patients zzso underwent complete zzso Among them, pathological complete response was obtained in zzso zzso zzso rate to zzso and stage zzso at surgery were zzso and zzso zzso The zzso major morbidity rate was zzso and zzso mortality was zzso At a median follow-up of zzso months zzso zzso the median zzso survival and overall survival were zzso months zzso zzso zzso and zzso months zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses identified that patients achieved zzso zzso clearance zzso to pathological zzso or zzso after zzso zzso and age at zzso years zzso showed significantly improved zzso 

zzso zzso showed a high overall response rate with tolerable toxicity zzso zzso after zzso may increase the rate of complete tumor zzso and result in survival benefit in stage zzso zzso positive zzso zzso
