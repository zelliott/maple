zzso zzso zzso appears to be an ideal therapeutic technique for eliminating zzso zzso minimal zzso or zzso zzso These types of zzso are typically zzso complicating the evaluation of potential zzso This study presents a method of ex zzso activity zzso with an zzso device, allowing measurement of the activity taken up by tumor cells in zzso structures a few tens of zzso 

We examined zzso from a zzso model of zzso zzso after injection of a zzso labeled with zzso for zzso At different time points, zzso samples were excised and zzso The activity level and the number of tumor cells were determined by combined information from 2 adjacent zzso one exposed to the zzso and the other stained with zzso and zzso The zzso zzso for tumor cell zzso zzso fewer than 10 cells, were derived for 2 different injected activities (6 and 1 zzso 

High zzso and good retention of the zzso were observed at the surface of tumor zzso zzso calculations based on the measured zzso activity indicated that for an injected activity of 1 zzso isolated tumor cells received at least 12 zzso In larger zzso zzso 100 zzso in zzso the activity zzso per cell was lower, possibly because of hindered penetration of zzso zzso however, the mean absorbed dose delivered to tumor cells was above 30 zzso due to zzso zzso 

Using the zzso we developed a method of ex zzso activity zzso at the cellular scale, which was further applied to characterize the behavior of a zzso zzso administered in zzso against zzso zzso This study demonstrated a reliable measurement of zzso This method of activity zzso based on zzso measured data, is expected to improve the relevance of small-scale zzso studies and thus to accelerate the zzso of zzso
