zzso cancer tumor growth and zzso is promoted by an interplay between migratory tumor zzso cells such as specialized zzso zzso zzso and circulating zzso precursor cells zzso As vehicles for tumor therapy, human zzso are relatively easy to isolate from peripheral blood, are able to zzso long-term in zzso are amenable to viral zzso and zzso home to regions of zzso found in growing zzso We show here that human peripheral blood zzso expanded ex zzso migrate to prostate cancer cells in zzso and efficiently home to human prostate tumor zzso in zzso zzso of precursors ex zzso with an zzso constructed to zzso a soluble form of the zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso viability and migration in zzso significantly decreases the number of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso reduces proliferation zzso zzso zzso and vascular density zzso zzso zzso and suppresses the growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso These data show for the first time that targeting zzso cell processes with cellular therapy has the potential to zzso prostate tumor zzso
