After establishment of a cell culture, zzso growth and cell selection takes place at early zzso zzso the same zzso state among experiments might be zzso 

Here we used zzso zzso to compare the global gene expression pattern of two oral cancer cell lines at zzso zzso and zzso zzso Also, the stability of the global gene expression pattern during culture was assessed in two cell lines at passages 10 and 53 zzso and late zzso An zzso correlation zzso test was used for zzso 

The consistency between the different zzso states was almost perfect zzso zzso and substantial zzso Also the consistency between early and late passages was almost perfect in the cell lines zzso 

Our results indicate that neither the state of zzso nor passage have significant effects on the global gene expression profile, despite the zzso in expression levels of individual zzso
