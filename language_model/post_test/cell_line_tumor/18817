Ten zzso zzso cell zzso cell lines established at the University of Michigan zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and at the University of zzso zzso zzso zzso were characterized by zzso zzso comparative zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso flow zzso 

All cell lines had zzso DNA content as measured by flow zzso The DNA index zzso remained relatively stable through different passages in 9 of 10 zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were zzso as were the corresponding zzso The 10 zzso showed remarkable genetic similarities with respect to consistent zzso zzso Loss of zzso noted in zzso zzso was narrowed to the smallest common region at zzso Loss of zzso was observed in zzso cell zzso Loss of zzso was present in zzso and zzso and in all four recently zzso zzso Other consistent losses include zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso cell zzso Common gains included gain of zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso copy number imbalances were confirmed by zzso concerning loss of zzso in zzso to loss of zzso in zzso to gain of zzso in zzso and to gain of zzso in zzso of the cell zzso 

zzso and zzso showed zzso in defining copy number zzso thus supporting the accuracy of zzso to detect zzso imbalances in tumors that cannot be zzso
