zzso is an zzso zzso of zzso that belongs to the zzso series of zzso zzso The lack of zzso in zzso cancer cell lines and the absence of a zzso and zzso zzso make zzso a potentially less cardiotoxic replacement for existing zzso zzso zzso For this study, we investigated the zzso activity and mechanism of zzso in human prostate cancer cell zzso zzso was zzso against three human prostate cancer cell lines at zzso zzso zzso was found to be better tolerated and more effective at zzso tumor growth compared with zzso in a human zzso tumor zzso mouse zzso zzso we found that zzso inhibited zzso II activity by stabilizing the zzso complex, involving both zzso zzso and zzso In addition, zzso induced a potent zzso cell cycle arrest in the zzso 145 human prostate cancer cell zzso By creating stable cell lines with decreased expression of zzso zzso or zzso we found that a decrease in zzso zzso protein expression renders the cell line resistant to zzso The decrease in sensitivity to zzso was associated with a decrease in DNA damage and an increase in DNA repair as measured by the neutral comet zzso These data demonstrate that zzso is a zzso II poison and that it is zzso zzso in the zzso 145 human prostate cancer cell zzso
