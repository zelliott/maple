zzso is a zzso zzso inhibitor that binds to an zzso unique from that of zzso Our objective was to determine whether zzso with zzso zzso zzso could sensitively detect an early molecular response to zzso zzso by zzso zzso and a later tumor response revealed by a decreased number of zzso viable tumor zzso 

Changes in zzso density in zzso and zzso BC cells exposed to zzso zzso zzso in zzso were measured by zzso binding zzso using zzso and by zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso Imaging of zzso zzso was studied in zzso in zzso mice with subcutaneous zzso tumors treated for 3 d with zzso (4 zzso or zzso human zzso zzso or zzso saline zzso Imaging of tumor response to zzso was studied in mice bearing subcutaneous zzso zzso treated with zzso (4 zzso followed by weekly doses of zzso zzso or zzso or PBS (2 zzso Mice were zzso on a zzso system at 72 h after injection of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso 

zzso zzso binding to zzso and zzso cells was significantly decreased at 72 h after exposure in zzso to zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso controls zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso After 3 d of zzso in zzso tumor zzso of zzso decreased zzso in zzso versus zzso mice zzso zzso zzso percentage injected dose per gram zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso There was also a zzso decreased tumor zzso in zzso versus zzso mice by image zzso analysis zzso zzso zzso suggesting zzso zzso zzso After 3 zzso of zzso tumor zzso of zzso decreased zzso compared with zzso mice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso this decrease was associated with an zzso zzso of zzso tumor cells determined zzso 

zzso sensitively zzso zzso zzso after 3 d of treatment with zzso and detected a reduction in viable zzso tumor cells after 3 zzso of therapy in zzso human breast cancer zzso
