The majority of human prostate cancer cell lines, including the two zzso cell lines zzso and zzso are reported to be zzso zzso zzso However, other studies have provided evidence that the zzso and zzso cell lines express zzso zzso These contradictory observations prompted us to investigate whether zzso and zzso cell lines express the zzso zzso Using zzso zzso directed against three distinct regions of the human zzso protein and an improved method to detect zzso protein in zzso we report that zzso and zzso cell lines express zzso zzso We found that the relative levels of the zzso zzso and protein that were detected in zzso and zzso cell lines were lower than the zzso an zzso cell zzso Moreover, the zzso directed against the zzso region zzso acids zzso but not the zzso zzso or zzso region zzso acids zzso and zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso detected the expression of zzso in all prostate cancer cell zzso zzso treatment of these cell lines with zzso zzso resulted in measurable increases in the zzso protein levels and considerable nuclear zzso zzso treatment of zzso and zzso cells with zzso did not result in stimulation of the activity of an zzso reporter, zzso of zzso expression in zzso cells resulted in decreases in zzso protein levels, and a measurable decrease in the activity of the zzso Our observations demonstrate the expression of zzso protein in zzso and zzso prostate cancer cell zzso
