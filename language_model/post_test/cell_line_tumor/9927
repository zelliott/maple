zzso resistance zzso is the major cause of failure in cancer zzso Recent reports even suggest that zzso is associated with elevated invasion and zzso of tumor zzso In the current study, we used a zzso approach to identify genes that play an important role in zzso induced cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso approach were used to separate and identify zzso expressed proteins between zzso and zzso a zzso zzso breast cancer cell zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified as highly expressed in zzso cells, but not in zzso zzso Small interference zzso gene suppression demonstrated that zzso was required for enhanced cell proliferation and invasion of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso alone was not sufficient to zzso the cell sensitivity to zzso suggesting that zzso was not required for zzso zzso Taken together, our results showed that expression of zzso is enhanced when cancer cells, zzso acquired drug resistance and it plays an essential role in zzso tumor zzso
