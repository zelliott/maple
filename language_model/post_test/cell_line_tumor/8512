zzso of the drug zzso zzso zzso to the plasma membrane is thought to be the only contributor of zzso zzso resistance zzso However, very little work has focused on the contribution of zzso expressed in zzso zzso to drug zzso This investigation describes an additional mechanism for understanding how zzso zzso contributes to zzso These studies were performed using zzso zzso cells and their zzso zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso zzso was localized to zzso zzso In zzso cells, the zzso zzso zzso zzso became zzso in zzso zzso but this was not observed in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso was demonstrated to be functional because zzso zzso in this zzso was prevented upon incubation with the established zzso zzso zzso or zzso or by zzso zzso expression with zzso zzso to elicit drug resistance via zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso were required to be zzso zzso and also zzso at zzso pH zzso zzso resulting in them being zzso and trapped in zzso This property was demonstrated using zzso weak bases zzso zzso or zzso that increased zzso pH and zzso only zzso cells to such zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso mechanism of zzso was not found for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso Together, these studies reveal a new mechanism where zzso zzso zzso of zzso leads to zzso that is amenable to therapeutic zzso
