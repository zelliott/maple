The main regulator of the human tumor zzso gene zzso is the zzso factor zzso but more recently it has been suggested to be a primary zzso target for the nuclear zzso zzso in the presence of its zzso zzso D3 zzso To identify zzso responding regions, we analyzed 20 overlapping regions covering the first zzso zzso of the zzso promoter in zzso human breast cancer cells using zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso against zzso and zzso We confirmed two known zzso binding regions at approximate positions zzso and zzso and identified a novel site at position zzso In addition, we found three zzso promoter regions at positions zzso zzso and zzso zzso two regions showed binding for both zzso and zzso In zzso screening and in zzso binding zzso using zzso and in zzso translated proteins identified five zzso binding sites within the three zzso promoter regions and also five zzso response elements within the three zzso zzso zzso gene zzso confirmed the expected responsiveness of the respective promoter regions to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso zzso confirmed the functionality of the three zzso promoter regions by monitoring simultaneous occupancy of zzso with the zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso Taken together, we demonstrated that the human zzso gene is a primary zzso gene with at least three zzso binding promoter regions, in two of which also zzso zzso
