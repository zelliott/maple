zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly intractable and readily spreads throughout the surface of the zzso zzso and these cells have been shown to express zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We here examined the potential of our new and powerful zzso zzso virus zzso which shows zzso zzso fusion activity zzso zzso named zzso for tumor cell killing in two independent zzso zzso models of zzso zzso treatment using zzso resulted in the efficient rescue of these models, in association with zzso fusion and zzso Such an effect was also seen on both zzso and zzso cells in zzso however, we confirmed that the latter expressed zzso but not zzso Of interest, infection with zzso strongly facilitated the zzso release from zzso cells, and this effect was completely abolished by use of either zzso zzso zzso or zzso expressing the zzso dominant negative inhibitor for zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso expression of zzso was zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso detecting zzso viral zzso zzso zzso these results suggest a proof of concept that the tumor zzso mechanism via zzso may have significant potential to treat patients with zzso that is characterized by frequent zzso expression in a clinical zzso
