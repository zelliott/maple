Previous research has shown that accurate evaluation of environmental water samples for zzso activity requires a panel of in zzso and in zzso zzso which are based on different molecular and cellular action zzso In the current study, a test battery containing four zzso was used to analyze water from the zzso River, South Africa for zzso Three sites were used for analysis, namely zzso zzso site situated in the mountains at the origin of the zzso zzso sewage zzso from zzso sewage treatment works and zzso site zzso site on the zzso River downstream from zzso zzso was determined using an zzso zzso linked zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced proliferation of human breast cancer zzso cells zzso also known as the zzso zzso induced suppression of zzso zzso alpha protein expression zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso and by monitoring zzso induced zzso zzso synthesis in juvenile zzso zzso zzso zzso Low zzso of zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso near the detection limit of the zzso were detected in samples collected from zzso Water from this site shows no zzso in the zzso zzso zzso or zzso synthesis zzso The zzso zzso in the sewage zzso zzso as well as zzso site zzso ranged between zzso and zzso zzso The zzso using zzso induction by the zzso cell line, zzso proliferation and in zzso zzso synthesis by juvenile zzso showed that these samples are zzso The results obtained for the zzso in the battery are zzso
