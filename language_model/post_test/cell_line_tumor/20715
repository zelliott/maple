zzso zzso zzso is one of the most aggressive zzso with a poor zzso zzso the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso cancer progression is a high priority for improved zzso diagnosis and zzso Recently, zzso was shown to behave as an zzso in zzso zzso and zzso However, little is known about its function in zzso zzso We therefore examined the effects of zzso zzso on the growth of zzso zzso cell zzso zzso cells in zzso and in zzso in order to gain a better understanding of its potential as a tumor therapeutic zzso We employed zzso small hairpin zzso zzso to knock down the expression of zzso in the zzso cell lines zzso and zzso and demonstrated zzso of zzso cell proliferation and colony formation in zzso Furthermore, flow zzso and western zzso analyses revealed that zzso depletion induced cell cycle arrest by regulating the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso significantly inhibited the growth of zzso zzso in nude zzso Our results suggest that zzso may play an important role in zzso zzso
