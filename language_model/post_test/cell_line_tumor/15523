Human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso that exists in the zzso zzso and its expression is zzso under zzso It regulates a zzso state of various kinds of protein through zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso Interestingly, although the expression of zzso in normal zzso was comparatively zzso various types of cancer cells expressed it in large zzso zzso we examined the role of zzso in tumor growth using zzso breast cancer line zzso and found that zzso of zzso zzso inhibited in zzso tumor growth and decreased lung zzso compared with zzso zzso Moreover, we investigated the relationship between expression of zzso and prognosis in breast cancer zzso Seventy-one patients with breast cancer who underwent surgery between 2005 and 2006 in zzso Medical University Hospital zzso Japan) were analyzed in this zzso zzso differences were found between the zzso group zzso zzso zzso and zzso group zzso zzso zzso in nuclear grade zzso zzso zzso and intrinsic zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso More importantly, in zzso analysis of zzso survival by Cox regression, expression of zzso was the only independent prognosis factor zzso zzso zzso Finally, in zzso survival analysis, patients positive for zzso had significantly shorter zzso survival and overall survival than those patients negative for zzso These findings indicate that the expression of zzso in cancer cells is associated with poorer prognosis and thus can be a zzso factor for patients with breast zzso
