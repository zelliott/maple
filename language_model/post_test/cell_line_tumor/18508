The critical role of signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso in the growth and survival of human tumor cells identifies it as a promising target for cancer drug zzso We previously identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso and zzso (where zzso represents zzso which inhibit zzso zzso activity and biological zzso Here, we report novel zzso compounds based on zzso (or zzso with substitution of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso or zzso derivatives that are selective and greater than zzso more potent in zzso zzso activity in zzso than lead zzso The biological activities of these derivatives mirror that originally observed for zzso In this context, the representative zzso zzso 610 with zzso substitution zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso mouse zzso and human breast and lung zzso zzso This effect is not evident with the zzso counterpart, zzso zzso consistent with interaction of zzso with the zzso domain of zzso Moreover, zzso 610 zzso cell growth zzso and zzso of zzso zzso that contain persistently active zzso We present the first report of a zzso approach to design of zzso zzso of zzso that are also among the first examples of zzso of zzso factor zzso with the potential for novel cancer zzso
