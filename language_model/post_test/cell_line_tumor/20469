Lung cancer currently causes the majority of zzso deaths worldwide and new treatments are in high zzso Gene therapy could be a promising treatment but currently lacks sufficient efficiency for clinical use, primarily due to limited cellular and nuclear DNA zzso In the present study, we investigated whether it was possible to exploit the zzso zzso activity by the nuclear factor zzso B zzso system, which is highly prominent in many zzso as well as lung zzso We observed that zzso of a DNA zzso sequence zzso recognized by zzso could improve zzso nuclear delivery and enhance the therapeutic effect of a validated zzso zzso suicide gene therapy zzso A clear correlation between the number of inserted zzso sites and the therapeutic effect of the suicide system was observed in both small cell lung cancer zzso and zzso cell zzso The effect was observed to be due to elevated nuclear zzso of the suicide zzso zzso The results show that a significant improvement of gene therapeutic efficiency can be obtained by increasing the zzso trafficking of therapeutic zzso This is to our knowledge the first time a zzso strategy has been implemented for suicide gene zzso
