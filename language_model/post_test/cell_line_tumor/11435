Recent studies have shown that zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso family of antibiotics with demonstrated DNA zzso zzso activity, zzso Heat shock protein 90 zzso by binding zzso to a putative zzso site within its zzso To develop more potent zzso zzso that target this site and to define zzso relationships zzso for this class of compounds, we have zzso zzso seven zzso zzso starting from zzso and zzso These were evaluated for evidence of zzso zzso using several biological zzso including zzso of cell proliferation and cell cycle arrest, induction of the heat shock response, zzso of zzso in zzso and depletion of the zzso client protein zzso zzso This zzso study revealed that a substantial increase in biological activity can be achieved by introduction of an zzso group in place of zzso group at zzso of zzso in addition to zzso of the zzso group from the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso group in the zzso zzso moderately increased biological activity as shown by compounds 11 and zzso Our most potent new analogue 19 demonstrated biological activities consistent with known zzso agents, but with greater potency than zzso
