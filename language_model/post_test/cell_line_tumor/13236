zzso is considered an zzso zzso because its long zzso contains a zzso domain that allows its recruitment and zzso in several complexes by zzso death zzso zzso Because little is known about the function and specificity of zzso and its zzso zzso we compared the zzso specificity profile of zzso human zzso with those of zzso and zzso by analyzing cell zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the 68 zzso sites identified in 61 proteins revealed that the zzso zzso of human zzso zzso and zzso largely zzso revealing the zzso consensus zzso zzso We confirmed that zzso in zzso translation initiation factor zzso zzso is a zzso site preferred by zzso not only in zzso setup but also upon zzso in zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that activated human zzso shares remarkably overlapping zzso specificity with the zzso zzso executioner zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso could function as a zzso zzso once released from the zzso zzso
