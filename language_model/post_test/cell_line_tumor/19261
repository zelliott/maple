zzso modification of zzso and other zzso proteins regulates zzso zzso and gene zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso are among the most frequently described modifications in these zzso Whereas these modifications have been studied in detail, very little is known about a recently discovered chemical zzso the zzso zzso in zzso and other nuclear zzso Here we zzso for the first time, the sites of zzso zzso in zzso and several other nuclear zzso We found that core and zzso zzso are zzso at multiple zzso zzso located both in the tails and zzso zzso of zzso In core zzso zzso was found at zzso zzso known to be involved in organization of zzso particles that are frequently zzso and zzso In zzso zzso and high mobility group zzso multiple zzso sites were mapped to zzso with important role in DNA zzso zzso zzso in zzso proteins is relatively abundant, suggesting that it may interfere with zzso mechanisms governing zzso function, which could lead to deregulation of the cell and zzso
