Single zzso zzso zzso within the gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso also known as zzso have recently been associated with zzso As none of the disease associated zzso are coding, they may zzso zzso by altering some facet of zzso zzso Here we have zzso the cellular distribution of zzso in human brain using in zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso protein and zzso in two large brain series to determine if zzso expression is altered in schizophrenia or bipolar disorder or in relation to a zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue from the superior zzso zzso of schizophrenia and control subjects, and also zzso prefrontal cortex, anterior zzso cortex, and zzso from zzso bipolar disorder, and control subjects were zzso zzso expression was measured by quantitative zzso zzso and zzso zzso and was also zzso by zzso in zzso cell lines derived from schizophrenia and control zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso is expressed in zzso and its zzso protein is zzso to the nucleus and zzso No difference in zzso expression was found between diagnostic groups, or in the zzso cell lines, and no effect of zzso zzso on zzso expression was zzso zzso these data do not provide support for the hypothesis that altered expression is the mechanism by which genetic variation of zzso may increase zzso to zzso nor evidence that zzso expression is altered in the disease itself, at least in terms of the parameters studied zzso
