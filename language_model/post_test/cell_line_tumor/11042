The zzso zzso zzso zzso was addressed for its sensitivity, disturbances by zzso and cell number and zzso zzso were from a zzso zzso grade IV human zzso brain tumor cell line used in zzso well zzso zzso were counted by zzso and Coulter zzso zzso were zzso or zzso zzso The results indicate increased zzso zzso signals zzso zzso by using zzso red or by increasing fetal bovine serum from zzso to zzso The data also indicate that zzso results in reduced zzso ranging from a factor of 2 at 1-3 units of zzso up to a factor of 4-5 at zzso units of zzso Coulter counting indicated a decrease in cell volume with increasing zzso cell density, attributed to general shrinking at increasing zzso In zzso total zzso was considered relative to both cell total volume and cell zzso The result suggests that total zzso should be regarded as reflecting cell total volume rather than cell zzso In a comparative zzso exposure test, signals of both zzso and a sodium salt of zzso zzso zzso decreased with increasing zzso supply, while zzso signals remained largely zzso The data show the differences in responses in cell viability and zzso but, above all, indicate that zzso should be expressed on a per cell volume basis rather than per cell, to avoid the problem that mere density effects contribute to signals on compound or metal zzso
