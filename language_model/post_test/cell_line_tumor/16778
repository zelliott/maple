zzso tumor zzso is a cancer of the zzso that occurs typically in children and rarely in zzso Early diagnosis is very important for the treatment and prognosis of the zzso The aim of our study was to discover and identify potential zzso and convenient zzso for the diagnosis of zzso zzso 

zzso mice were used to construct a zzso tumor model by injecting zzso cells into their bilateral zzso We collected 94 serum samples from mice consisting of 45 samples with zzso tumor and 49 zzso The serum zzso profiles of the samples were analyzed via zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso The candidate zzso were zzso by zzso liquid zzso identified by liquid zzso zzso and validated using zzso zzso 

We finally retrieved two differential proteins zzso zzso zzso which were identified as zzso zzso and zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso was higher in the zzso tumor group than in the control group zzso zzso zzso By contrast, the expression of zzso was lower in the zzso tumor group than in the control zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso may be used as potential zzso for zzso in children, and the analysis of zzso zzso may help diagnose and treat zzso zzso
