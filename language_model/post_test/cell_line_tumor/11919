We have investigated the zzso activity, the induction of zzso and the zzso zzso efficiency in the zzso zzso tumor cell line, after replacement of the two zzso zzso groups in zzso zzso by zzso and zzso The data show that zzso is able to circumvent resistance to zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso In fact, zzso shows a zzso potency higher than that of zzso and zzso with the mean zzso values being 11, 58, and 300 zzso zzso In addition, at zzso doses zzso of the platinum drugs equal to their zzso zzso and after 24 hours of drug treatment, the level of induction of zzso by zzso is twice that produced by zzso Under the same experimental conditions, zzso does not induce significant levels of zzso in zzso zzso After 24 hours of incubation of zzso cells at zzso equal to the zzso value of the platinum drugs, the level of DNA zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso is two and three times higher, respectively, than those induced by zzso and zzso We also found that zzso formed DNA zzso between zzso and complementary zzso We propose that, in zzso cells, the induction of zzso by zzso is related to its greater ability zzso to zzso and zzso to form DNA zzso
