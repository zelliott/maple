Clinical application of zzso agents has been often hampered by toxicity against normal cells, so the achievement of their zzso action is still one of the major challenges to be zzso Previously, we reported that zzso zzso zzso could be a promising new drug against not only leukemia but also solid zzso The zzso of zzso occurred through the generation of zzso oxygen species zzso thus zzso radical scavenging systems would enhance the therapeutic efficacy of zzso provided that normal cells were relatively resistant to such a zzso Here, we report that the combination therapy of zzso with zzso zzso which zzso a critical step in zzso zzso effectively enhanced in zzso growth zzso effect of zzso on all 11 investigated cell lines arising from zzso breast, zzso zzso zzso zzso and kidney zzso compared with zzso treatment zzso Furthermore, this combination enhanced zzso to cell lines from prostate cancer with less toxicity to those from normal zzso In zzso zzso zzso using zzso compounds demonstrated that hydrogen zzso zzso is a major zzso zzso among zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that combined use of zzso and zzso blocked zzso systems including zzso zzso and zzso zzso and that the degree of this blockade was well correlated with zzso zzso levels and sensitivity to this zzso Finally, the effectiveness of the combination therapy of zzso with zzso was demonstrated with an zzso model of prostate cancer zzso We propose that the combination therapy of zzso with zzso is a valid means of blockade of zzso system, and that the combination of a zzso agent with an inhibitor of major scavenging systems is effective in terms of both efficacy and zzso Furthermore, because the effective doses of both compounds are within clinically achievable range, this report will lead to immediate benefit for the development of a new cancer zzso
