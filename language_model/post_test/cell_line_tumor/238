An isotope tags for relative and absolute zzso zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso mass zzso zzso method was developed for differential protein expression profiling in complex cellular zzso The zzso positive zzso cell line, cultured in the presence of zzso zzso and tamoxifen zzso was used as a model zzso zzso analysis was performed with a linear trap zzso zzso instrument operated by using zzso Q zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments were conducted to maximize the zzso labeling efficiency and the number of zzso zzso zzso data filtering criteria were chosen to result in a false positive identification rate of zzso The zzso of protein identifications was approximately zzso between zzso and approximately 50% among zzso zzso runs, zzso The zzso zzso in terms of relative standard zzso zzso of global mean zzso ratios, was better than zzso The zzso accuracy improved with the number of peptides used for protein zzso From a total of zzso identified proteins zzso zzso zzso in the zzso treated zzso cells, a list of 255 proteins zzso by at least two zzso was generated for differential expression zzso A method was developed for the selection, zzso and statistical evaluation of such zzso An approximate approximately zzso change in protein expression levels was necessary for a protein to be selected as a zzso zzso According to this data processing strategy, approximately 16 proteins involved in biological processes such as zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso cell proliferation and zzso were found to be zzso or zzso
