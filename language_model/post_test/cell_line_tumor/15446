zzso zzso is necessary for the zzso dissemination of tumor zzso However, the zzso breast tumor cell zzso does not bind to the zzso under zzso flow conditions, suggesting alternate mechanisms of zzso Since zzso are highly represented in the tumor zzso and also bind to zzso during zzso we hypothesized that the zzso assist in the arrest of zzso on the zzso Using in zzso models of the dynamic zzso environment of the zzso we show that zzso zzso human zzso and zzso cells form stable zzso and that the zzso in these zzso mediate the zzso of otherwise zzso zzso cells to inflamed zzso under flow zzso zzso zzso at a zzso stress of zzso zzso zzso We also show that the zzso forces determine the size and orientation of zzso zzso to the zzso and strongly favor the attachment of small zzso with tumor cells downstream of flow zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso on zzso zzso cells through the zzso zzso was found to be critical in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that, under inflammatory conditions, zzso may serve to zzso tumor cells through zzso and the zzso axis may represent a new therapeutic target to reduce cancer zzso
