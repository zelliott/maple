The formation of new blood vessels zzso and zzso vessels zzso promotes tumor outgrowth and zzso Previously, it has been demonstrated that bone zzso cells zzso can contribute to tumor zzso However, the role of zzso in zzso has largely remained zzso Here, we demonstrate by bone zzso zzso and genetic zzso experiments that zzso integrate into zzso zzso vessels in the zzso mouse model of zzso and in the zzso prostate cancer transplantation model, and that the integrated zzso originate from the zzso zzso zzso pharmacological depletion of zzso zzso reduces zzso No cell fusion events are detected by genetic tracing zzso Rather, the zzso conversion of zzso cells into zzso zzso cells and their integration into zzso structures is zzso in two in zzso tube formation zzso and is dependent on zzso growth zzso zzso Together, the results reveal that zzso cells can contribute to zzso zzso vessels, thus extending the findings on the previously reported role of zzso cells in zzso vessel zzso
