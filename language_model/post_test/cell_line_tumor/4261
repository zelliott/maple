zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso is highly expressed in various types of zzso However, the role of zzso H in zzso zzso zzso remains zzso In our study, we performed zzso zzso analysis of zzso human serum samples to explore zzso H zzso changes and found that zzso H is zzso in zzso B virus zzso zzso Similarly, zzso showed that zzso H expression was higher in tumors compared to normal zzso In addition, zzso 2 zzso the main synthetic zzso of zzso zzso was also increased in zzso cells zzso zzso X protein zzso zzso plays an important role in promoting cell proliferation and may be related to increased levels of zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, using zzso zzso we observed that zzso zzso was zzso in patients with zzso and confirmed association of zzso expression with expression of its product, zzso zzso zzso our results suggest that zzso suppressed the expression of zzso which directly targeted zzso and then increased levels of zzso H to enhance zzso cell zzso Additionally, proliferation of zzso zzso cells was significantly inhibited by treatment with zzso H zzso in zzso In zzso animal experiments, we found that zzso of zzso effectively suppressed tumor zzso The newly identified zzso H axis suggests one possible molecular mechanism of zzso cell proliferation and represents a new potential therapeutic target for zzso zzso
