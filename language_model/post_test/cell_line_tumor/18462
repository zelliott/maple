Arrest of circulating tumor cells in distant zzso is required for zzso zzso but the tumor cell surface molecules responsible have not been zzso Here, we show that the tumor cell zzso zzso makes an important contribution to arrest in the lung and to early colony zzso These analyses indicated that pulmonary arrest does not occur merely due to size zzso and raised the question of how the tumor cell zzso zzso contacts its zzso zzso zzso zzso a basement membrane zzso zzso Further analyses revealed that zzso is available to the tumor cell in zzso patches of exposed zzso in the pulmonary zzso The early arrest of tumor cells in the pulmonary zzso through interaction of zzso zzso with zzso in exposed zzso provides both a molecular and a structural basis for cell arrest during pulmonary zzso
