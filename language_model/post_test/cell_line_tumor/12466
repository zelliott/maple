The human zzso zzso zzso zzso is a major transforming zzso The zzso protein does not possess intrinsic zzso activity, but rather functions through direct and indirect interactions with cellular zzso several of which are well known cellular tumor zzso Using the zzso zzso system, we found that transforming growth zzso zzso early gene 1 zzso a member of the zzso family zzso that has been implicated as a putative tumor zzso interacts and forms a specific complex with zzso zzso zzso has been shown to mimic the effects of zzso in various zzso cells and plays a critical role in the zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso binds to the zzso of zzso and zzso its degradation via the zzso zzso zzso not only increased the zzso of zzso but also influenced the ability of zzso to affect zzso Our results suggest that suppression of zzso signaling by zzso may contribute to zzso zzso
