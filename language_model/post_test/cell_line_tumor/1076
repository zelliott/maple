zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which zzso zzso transition between zzso zzso and zzso zzso The ability of zzso zzso to change from zzso to zzso types is a major zzso zzso of this zzso However, the exact role of zzso transformation in establishing oral zzso infection is still poorly zzso 

In this study we used zzso with defects in zzso as well as oral zzso which differ in their capacity to form true zzso to examine the role of zzso transformation in the interactions of zzso zzso with oral zzso cells in zzso These interactions included the ability of these strains to adhere to and injure zzso cells, as well as their ability to trigger a zzso zzso zzso 

We found that strains zzso and zzso formed true zzso on zzso cells, whereas strain zzso and the zzso zzso formed only zzso Double zzso zzso grew exclusively as zzso We also found that zzso and zzso strains showed reduced adherence capacity to oral zzso and caused minimal cell zzso Moreover, we showed that both zzso and zzso forms have a strongly attenuated zzso zzso since they failed to induce significant zzso zzso and zzso responses by oral zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso into true zzso is particularly important in the interactions with oral zzso cells in zzso
