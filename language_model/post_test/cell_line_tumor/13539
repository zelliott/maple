zzso zzso play an essential role in the ordered execution of zzso events and 4 zzso zzso family members have been zzso zzso evidence indicates that zzso is an attractive target for zzso zzso In this paper, a series of zzso derivatives were zzso and three compounds, zzso zzso and zzso were identified as potent new zzso zzso We employed various zzso and cellular approaches to determine the effects of these compounds on the activity of zzso and other zzso zzso and on cell cycle zzso We found that these three compounds could selectively inhibit the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso They show strong zzso activity against a number of cancer cell lines with relatively low zzso zzso but are relatively less toxic to zzso cells zzso Moreover, these compounds could induce obvious zzso of zzso cells in zzso and S zzso and trigger zzso Although zzso cells show clear zzso arrest after treatment with these compounds, the zzso arrest and zzso are less zzso indicating the distinct sensitivity between normal and cancer zzso We also found that zzso cells treated with these drugs exhibit zzso zzso and increased zzso protein levels, the characteristics of cells treated with zzso zzso Together, these results demonstrate that zzso zzso and zzso zzso compounds are new zzso zzso with potential for cancer zzso
