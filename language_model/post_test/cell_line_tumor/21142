Although many tools of cellular and molecular biology have been used to characterize single zzso cycles of virus growth, few culture methods exist to study the dynamics of zzso spreading viruses over multiple zzso We have previously developed a method that addresses this need by tracking the spread of focal infections using zzso labeling and digital zzso Here, we build zzso models to account for zzso patterns formed by the spreading viral infection front as well as data from a single cycle of virus growth zzso zzso Systems with and without the zzso zzso response of the host cells are zzso Dynamic images of the spreading infections guide zzso model refinement steps that lead to reproduction of all of the salient features contained in the images, not just the zzso of the infection zzso The optimal fits provide estimates for key parameters such as zzso binding and the production rate of zzso For the examined data, zzso infection models that ignore the zzso growth dynamics provide a comparable fit to models that more accurately account for these zzso highlighting the fact that increased model complexity does not necessarily translate to improved zzso This work demonstrates how model building can facilitate the interpretation of experiments by highlighting contributions from both biological and zzso zzso
