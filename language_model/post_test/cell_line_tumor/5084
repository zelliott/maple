zzso zzso zzso is a fusion protein of humanized zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso melanoma and zzso patients received zzso in phase zzso zzso Patient zzso were examined in zzso to determine if an zzso zzso response occurred during zzso 

zzso was zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso based on ability to bridge zzso zzso to zzso zzso and ability to inhibit binding of zzso to zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso was also used to detect zzso to the zzso end of zzso 

zzso patients zzso developed an zzso zzso response zzso zzso in the bridge zzso Twelve patients zzso had an intermediate response, whereas 17 patients zzso were negative zzso zzso The development of zzso to zzso detected in the bridge zzso was not related to the dose of zzso Twenty of 33 adult patients zzso demonstrated an zzso zzso response based on binding zzso zzso The zzso response was zzso correlated zzso zzso zzso with zzso measured during the second course of treatment, indicating that development of zzso zzso zzso with detection of circulating zzso All patients developed some zzso activity in the binding zzso zzso designed to detect zzso to the zzso region of the zzso There was a positive correlation between the peak serum level of zzso in course 1 and the zzso zzso 

Patients treated with zzso developed zzso zzso and anti zzso zzso No association was seen between development of zzso zzso and clinical zzso
