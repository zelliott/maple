This study investigated whether zzso significantly affects the zzso production and gene expression of zzso from cultured airway zzso zzso zzso primary rat zzso surface zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso zzso for zzso and then chased for zzso in the presence of zzso to assess the effect on zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso At the same time, zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso for zzso and then zzso with zzso growth factor zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene expression and zzso protein production were measured by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso The results were as zzso zzso zzso significantly suppressed zzso zzso zzso from cultured zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the production of zzso zzso protein induced by zzso or zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso also inhibited the expression of zzso zzso gene induced by zzso or zzso from zzso zzso This result suggests that zzso can regulate the zzso production and gene expression of zzso by directly acting on airway zzso zzso
