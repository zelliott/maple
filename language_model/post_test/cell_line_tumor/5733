Several innate cellular zzso factors exist in zzso cells that prevent the replication of zzso Among them, the zzso motif protein zzso has been shown to block human zzso virus type 1 zzso infection in several types of Old World monkey zzso Here we report a novel zzso chronically infected monkey B cell line, zzso characterized by very low levels of zzso expression that allows zzso to overcome the zzso zzso produced by zzso cells fails to zzso monkey cells but retains the ability to zzso human peripheral blood zzso cells zzso and T cell lines, although with a reduced zzso compared to the input zzso zzso analyses revealed the presence of budding zzso at the zzso cells plasma membrane characterized by a typical zzso core zzso To our knowledge zzso is the first monkey cell line chronically infected by zzso and able to release infectious particles thus representing a useful tool to gain further insights into the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso
