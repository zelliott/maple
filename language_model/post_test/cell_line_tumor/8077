The natural zzso are ubiquitous zzso organic zzso which play important roles in regulating cellular proliferation and zzso Here we present a novel approach to investigating zzso functions by using optical zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso metabolically stable functional zzso of natural zzso We studied the ability of zzso and zzso to alter the normal zzso regulation pathways at the level of zzso zzso and the major control mechanisms known to affect the key zzso zzso zzso These include: zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso the zzso step of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the major zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which is required for the conversion of zzso into zzso and zzso into zzso We show that the zzso differ in their cellular zzso and ability to zzso zzso and zzso and to induce zzso These effects are zzso by the ability of the zzso to induce zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso to suppress the translation of zzso zzso zzso open reading zzso and to regulate the alternative zzso of zzso zzso The unique effects of zzso zzso zzso on zzso metabolism may offer novel possibilities for studying the zzso functions, control mechanisms, and targets of the natural zzso as well as advance therapeutic drug development in cancer and other human zzso zzso
