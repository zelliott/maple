The use of regulated gene expression systems is important for successful gene therapy zzso In this study, zzso structural change in the zzso zzso zzso was used to develop a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The system was studied using zzso of different zzso flanked on either side by the zzso domain and the zzso domain zzso The zzso zzso of different types showed efficient zzso zzso We also characterized a zzso zzso system based on the zzso and demonstrated its utility in zzso both reporter and therapeutic gene zzso The zzso zzso system developed by using a zzso form of the zzso zzso lacking affinity for the zzso zzso zzso whereas maintaining affinity for other zzso showed efficient zzso by the zzso zzso in living mice without significant interference from the circulating zzso zzso The zzso zzso system was used to test the therapeutic efficiency of the tumor zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells in culture and tumor zzso in living zzso The zzso capabilities of this system should be useful for gene therapy applications, to study zzso biology, to evaluate gene regulation, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in cells and living zzso
