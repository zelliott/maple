The purpose of this study was to develop a zzso zzso ultrasound zzso contrast agent for both zzso therapy and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were prepared and filled with zzso zzso The enhancement of US imaging and its zzso induced zzso effect were evaluated by both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso have a narrow size distribution and smooth surface with a mean diameter of zzso and zzso zzso efficiency of zzso and zzso efficiency of zzso The zzso could well enhance the ultrasound imaging both zzso and zzso A significant zzso effect was obtained by zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso growth rate and the zzso proliferation index were the lowest in the zzso plus zzso zzso And the zzso cell zzso index was the biggest in the zzso plus zzso zzso In conclusion, a zzso zzso contrast agent was constructed and the feasibility was demonstrated, which might provide a novel strategy for zzso imaging and zzso
