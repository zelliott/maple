A zzso is a small zzso structure found in the zzso of dividing cells that suffered from zzso zzso It is generally zzso that zzso content is eventually lost from cells, though the mechanism of how this occurs is zzso If DNA located within the zzso is not zzso it may explain the loss of zzso zzso Because there had been no compelling evidence for this issue, we have addressed whether DNA located within the zzso is zzso this zzso Pulse zzso of zzso revealed that DNA synthesis takes place in a portion of zzso that contain nuclear zzso B zzso By using zzso zzso double zzso we found that all zzso containing zzso B are zzso during one cell cycle, whereas zzso lacking zzso B are never zzso This result suggests that the content of zzso zzso zzso is lost during cell zzso Furthermore, we simultaneously zzso sites of DNA zzso zzso B and the zzso double minutes zzso which contain amplified zzso We found that although the replication timing of double minutes was generally preserved in zzso at times it differed greatly from the timing in the nucleus, which may zzso the expression of the amplified zzso Taken together, these findings uncovered the DNA replication occurring inside zzso
