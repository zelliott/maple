To study the effects of total zzso of zzso zzso on proliferation and zzso of human zzso zzso cells and its zzso 

The effect of the total zzso of zzso zzso on the proliferation of human zzso zzso cells was detected by zzso zzso and the zzso changes of cells treated with total zzso of zzso zzso were observed using contrast zzso zzso zzso was performed to analyze the zzso rate of the cells, and the gene expression levels of zzso zzso zzso were detected by zzso 

The total zzso of zzso zzso suppressed the proliferation of zzso cells in a zzso zzso zzso Under a microscope observation of cell zzso the volume became smaller zzso number of internal particles was zzso Cell zzso rate was positively related to the drug zzso After treated for 48 hours, zzso and zzso expression were zzso zzso and zzso were zzso 

The total zzso of zzso zzso can inhibit the proliferation of zzso cell line zzso by inducing cell zzso mechanism of which might be related with reducing zzso and zzso zzso
