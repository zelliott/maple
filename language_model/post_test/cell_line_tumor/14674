Bone zzso zzso is a zzso protein of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso that has been implicated in the nucleation of zzso zzso zzso an zzso of zzso zzso increased the zzso zzso level, which stimulates the proliferation and differentiation of zzso zzso growth factor 2 zzso is a potent zzso in many cell types, including zzso In human prostate cancer zzso cells, zzso (1 zzso and zzso (10 zzso increased zzso and zzso zzso and protein levels at 3 and zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses were performed using zzso zzso of the human zzso gene promoter linked to a zzso reporter zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso (1 zzso and zzso (10 zzso increased the zzso activities of zzso between zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso including the human zzso gene zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso included zzso zzso in the two zzso response elements zzso and zzso zzso activities induced by zzso and zzso were blocked by protein zzso A and zzso zzso zzso zzso mobility shift analyses showed that zzso and zzso increased the binding of zzso and zzso zzso complexes were zzso by zzso and zzso zzso and disrupted by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso complexes were disrupted by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These studies demonstrate that zzso and zzso stimulate zzso zzso in zzso human prostate cancer cells by targeting the zzso and zzso elements in the human zzso gene zzso
