zzso and zzso are plant zzso with reported zzso zzso This study aimed to determine the effect of zzso and zzso on cell viability in cultured cells derived from the zzso zzso cell zzso an oral cavity zzso zzso cell zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso cell line) and in zzso zzso zzso 

The in zzso viability of zzso zzso and zzso cells treated with zzso and zzso was zzso zzso growth of zzso zzso was evaluated in zzso mice that were zzso with either zzso or zzso 

Although zzso and zzso treatment decreased viability of cells in zzso zzso differences in responsiveness were zzso In zzso zzso treatment significantly increased the tumor size of zzso zzso zzso obtained using zzso were zzso 

The in zzso decrease in zzso cell viability by zzso and zzso was not observed in in zzso tumor zzso using the conditions described in this zzso
