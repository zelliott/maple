DNA zzso breaks zzso are arguably the most important zzso induced by zzso radiation zzso since zzso or zzso zzso can lead to zzso aberrations and cell zzso The two major pathways to repair zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Perhaps surprisingly, zzso represents the zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso of the cell cycle, but zzso also contributes and repairs a subset of zzso zzso in zzso Following zzso zzso zzso events give rise to sister zzso exchanges zzso which can be detected zzso in zzso Here, we describe that zzso occurring in zzso cells also generates zzso in zzso of zzso zzso Since zzso of zzso zzso in zzso is a slow process, zzso formation in zzso cells requires several zzso During this time, zzso zzso cells can also reach zzso which has contributed to the widely held belief that zzso form only during S zzso We describe procedures to measure zzso exclusively in zzso cells and provide evidence that following zzso cells do not need to progress through S phase in order to form zzso
