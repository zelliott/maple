zzso zzso is important for zzso zzso zzso genes by zzso loss of zzso zzso Although zzso zzso maps are plentiful, little is known about zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso is zzso in most zzso zzso and its usual mode of zzso is zzso zzso 

We mapped zzso zzso boundaries zzso between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in early zzso zzso 

zzso were zzso with the highest frequency between 65 zzso and 75 zzso close to a low copy number repeat region zzso zzso There were, surprisingly, few zzso close to zzso contrary to expectations were there constraints on zzso caused by uncovering zzso lethal zzso or if zzso zzso were mechanistically zzso by a longer residual zzso zzso The locations of zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso suggesting that the two types of zzso are influenced by similar zzso whether zzso or selective in zzso zzso were also associated with higher local zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso maps on zzso were not, however, zzso perhaps zzso to selective constraints on zzso dosage in early zzso zzso Since zzso within the region of frequent zzso zzso on zzso might influence the frequency of zzso we tested the zzso zzso low copy number repeat and nearby zzso but no associations with zzso cancer risk were zzso 

zzso on zzso is zzso but local factors do not greatly influence the rate of zzso at zzso or explain zzso differential zzso to zzso zzso
