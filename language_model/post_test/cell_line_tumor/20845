To study the effects of zzso acid zzso therapy zzso on human cervical cancer, and to identify the best administration regimen with the least zzso zzso 

zzso zzso nude mice underwent subcutaneous injection of human cervical cancer cells of the line zzso so as to establish animal models, and then randomly divided into 6 equal groups: pure topical administration group zzso injection of zzso 60 zzso around the zzso pure intravenous administration group zzso injection of zzso 250 zzso into the zzso zzso topical administration and zzso group zzso injection of zzso 60 zzso around the tumor and zzso of 630 zzso zzso laser 6 h after the drug zzso intravenous administration and zzso group zzso injection of zzso 250 zzso into the zzso vein and zzso of 630 zzso zzso laser 6 h after the drug zzso and control group zzso none of the zzso 24 h later 6 mice from each group were killed with their tumors taken zzso On the days 3, 7, 14, and 21 after treatment the remaining mice underwent measurement of the tumor zzso HE zzso and pathological examination were zzso zzso study was conducted to detect the protein expression of the zzso genes of zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso was used to detect the zzso expression of the zzso gene of zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso and zzso 

The tumor volumes after treatment of the pure topical administration and pure zzso vein administration groups were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, both significantly smaller than that of the control group zzso zzso zzso zzso both P zzso zzso The tumor volume of the pure topical administration group zzso days after treatment was the zzso HE zzso showed remarkable subcutaneous necrosis in the 2 zzso zzso zzso showed remarkable zzso of protein expression of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso expression levels of zzso and zzso were both significantly lower than that of the control group (both P zzso zzso and the zzso expression levels of zzso zzso and Bad were higher than those of the control group, however, not significantly (all P zzso zzso 

zzso is effective in treatment of cervical zzso zzso zzso administration + zzso is recommended in treating cervical cancer so as to minimize the zzso and inconvenience of zzso reaction brought by zzso
