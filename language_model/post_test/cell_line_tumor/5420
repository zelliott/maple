zzso zzso of zzso zzso receptors zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso Although zzso of zzso has been reported to be zzso by zzso pathway, studies describing zzso pathways are zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso of zzso is zzso by zzso We show that two zzso motifs of zzso interact with zzso Using cell zzso and total internal reflection zzso imaging, we found that zzso zzso of zzso is regulated by zzso motifs of the zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, in the zzso group I zzso zzso zzso increased the interaction of zzso zzso with zzso This interaction was blocked by zzso known to disrupt zzso signaling by cholesterol zzso zzso also blocked the zzso zzso of zzso Thus, these findings represent the evidence for zzso zzso of zzso via zzso and suggest that zzso might play a role in synaptic zzso by regulating zzso of zzso in the zzso
