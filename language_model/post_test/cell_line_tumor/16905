In tumor progression zzso zzso in nuclear zzso zzso protein composition as well as in zzso structure zzso The zzso interacts with zzso via specialized DNA sequences called zzso attachment regions zzso In the present study, using a zzso approach along with a two-dimensional zzso zzso and zzso laser zzso we show that the differentiation of stabilized human prostate zzso cells is marked out by modifications both zzso protein composition and bond between zzso proteins and zzso zzso zzso and slowly growing zzso cells are characterized by a less complex pattern and by a major number of proteins binding zzso sequences in comparison to zzso cells expressing zzso zzso but zzso Finally, in the poorly differentiated and strongly aggressive zzso zzso cells the complexity of zzso pattern further increases and a minor number of proteins bind the zzso Furthermore, in this cell line with respect to zzso cells, these changes are zzso with modifications in both the nuclear distribution of the zzso sequences and in the average loop dimensions that significantly zzso Although the expression of many zzso proteins changes during zzso only a very limited group of zzso proteins seem to play a key role in this zzso Variations in the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and special zzso zzso zzso zzso along with an increase in the zzso of zzso B represent changes that might trigger passage towards a more aggressive zzso These results suggest that zzso the zzso proteins that are involved in the differentiation of prostate cancer cells could be an important tool to improve our understanding of this zzso process, and they could also be novel targets for prostate cancer zzso
