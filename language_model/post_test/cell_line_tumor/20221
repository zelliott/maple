zzso is a zzso zzso isolated from the fruits of traditional Chinese herb zzso zzso zzso Previously, we identified zzso zzso derivatives as potent zzso I zzso by zzso virtual screening and lead zzso zzso a library of novel zzso derivatives bearing various zzso or modified scaffold were zzso Among them, a number of zzso derivatives showed substantial increase of the zzso activity, with zzso values lower than 3 zzso Moreover, these highly potent compounds can effectively induce the zzso of zzso zzso Interestingly, further zzso target prediction calculations in combination with biological zzso confirmed that the zzso derivatives acted by dual zzso of zzso I and zzso Moreover, several zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso also showed good in zzso zzso efficacy and low toxicity at the dose of 1 zzso or 2 zzso They represent promising candidates for the development of novel zzso zzso
