zzso in the coding region of zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso and its upstream promoter zzso that drives expression in the zzso are known to lead to zzso diabetes of the young 1 zzso zzso also controls zzso and zzso metabolism in the liver, where the zzso promoter zzso zzso However, very little is known about the role of zzso zzso in zzso Here, we examine the expression of zzso zzso in two diabetic mouse models, zzso mice zzso 2, insulin zzso and zzso mice zzso 1, insulin zzso We found that the level of zzso protein and zzso was decreased in the liver of zzso mice but increased in zzso zzso Because insulin increases the activity of zzso regulatory zzso proteins zzso and zzso we also examined the effect of zzso on zzso zzso gene expression and found that, like insulin, zzso expression of zzso decreases the level of zzso zzso protein and zzso both in zzso in primary zzso and in zzso in the liver of zzso zzso Finally, we use gel shift, zzso zzso small interfering zzso and reporter gene analysis to show that zzso binds the human zzso zzso promoter and zzso regulates its zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso zzso in the liver through the zzso of zzso thereby establishing a link between these two critical zzso factor pathways that regulate zzso and zzso metabolism in the zzso These findings also provide new insights into zzso complications such as fatty liver zzso
