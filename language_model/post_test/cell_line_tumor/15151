zzso insulin zzso zzso in pancreatic zzso is zzso by fatty acids zzso The initial step in the metabolism of zzso zzso is the conversion to zzso by long chain zzso zzso zzso Because the predominantly expressed zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells are zzso and zzso we characterized the role of these zzso in zzso function by using zzso to knock down zzso or zzso Compared with control cells, an zzso suppression of zzso decreased zzso and zzso zzso by 32 and zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not alter zzso zzso zzso did not alter zzso zzso or long chain zzso zzso With zzso zzso incubation with 17 zzso zzso increased media zzso acids zzso and reduced cell membrane levels of zzso Further, zzso zzso reduced zzso in zzso zzso cells, and in zzso zzso cells, an zzso zzso zzso partially rescued zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso activates zzso to form zzso that are incorporated into zzso thereby zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso or zzso reduced zzso zzso and protein expression and reduced zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso zzso by regulating the levels of zzso zzso and that zzso controls the expression of its zzso zzso
