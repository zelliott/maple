zzso a novel inhibitor of zzso was shown to enhance the effect of zzso radiation zzso on tumor cells under zzso zzso Since low oxygen tension is a common feature of solid tumors, we explore in the present study the impact of zzso on the combined treatment of lung zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell lines with zzso and zzso Cellular analysis included the zzso ability, expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell cycle progression and associated zzso as well as DNA damage measured by zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso revealed that in both cell lines zzso enhanced the zzso under hypoxic exposure to a level similar to that observed under zzso zzso zzso of oxygen supply during drug treatment, zzso also reduced the expression of zzso proteins zzso and zzso As judged by the levels of zzso zzso zzso hypoxic cells exhibited a lower repair rate of DNA zzso breaks than zzso zzso The zzso zzso changes in the cell cycle, zzso zzso depletion and G zzso arrest, developed not directly during hypoxic exposure but first upon 24 h zzso Under both oxygen zzso zzso zzso zzso the cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The finding that zzso can enhance the in zzso zzso of hypoxic tumor cells may have implications for the combined zzso treatment of solid zzso
