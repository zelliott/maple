Human zzso virus type 1 zzso is the zzso agent of adult zzso leukemia zzso In Japan, the number of zzso carriers is estimated to be zzso million and more than 700 cases of ATL have been diagnosed every zzso Considering the poor prognosis and lack of zzso therapy of ATL, it seems mandatory to establish an effective strategy for the treatment of zzso In this study, we attempted to identify the cell surface molecules that will become suitable targets of zzso for zzso zzso The expression levels of approximately 40,000 host genes of three human zzso lines carrying zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso zzso and compared with the expression levels of the genes in an zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso lines used for experiments had totally different expression patterns of viral zzso Among the genes zzso the expression levels of 108 genes were found to be enhanced more than zzso in all of the zzso lines examined and 11 of the 108 genes were considered to generate the proteins expressed on the cell zzso In particular, the zzso gene was zzso more than zzso and the enhanced expression of the zzso zzso was confirmed by laser flow zzso for various zzso zzso lines and primary zzso T cells isolated from zzso ATL zzso Such expression was not observed for primary zzso T cells isolated from healthy zzso Since zzso expression is strictly restricted in normal zzso such as highly activated T and B cells, zzso appears to be a potential target for effective zzso therapy against zzso
