zzso zzso and the zzso analog zzso inhibit proliferation and induce zzso in zzso colon and zzso pancreatic cancer zzso In this study, treatment with zzso zzso zzso of these compounds for 24 h induced zzso zzso and decreased zzso protein and zzso expression in both cell zzso However, results of time course studies show that zzso and zzso decrease zzso protein within 2 h after treatment, whereas zzso zzso levels were decreased only at later zzso indicating zzso of zzso and zzso pathways for zzso of zzso In addition, we also observed that zzso inhibited pancreatic and colon cancer cell growth and this was associated with enhanced expression of zzso after 24 zzso or 24 and 48 h zzso and correlated with previous studies on the role of zzso in zzso However, in cells zzso with zzso plus zzso or zzso induction of zzso by zzso was inhibited after zzso with both compounds, suggesting applications for these drugs in combination cancer chemotherapy with zzso
