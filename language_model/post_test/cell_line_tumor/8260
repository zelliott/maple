zzso an zzso protein involved in zzso and a novel drug in clinical trials, is of particular interest as cancer therapy because it can induce zzso in cancer cells but not in normal zzso Since some zzso develop resistance to zzso safe and effective methods of TRAIL zzso are of clinical zzso We explored how chemotherapy and zzso stress affect TRAIL sensitivity and expression of proteins in the zzso zzso 

zzso to TRAIL was assessed in viability zzso zzso was measured by zzso activity and/or nuclear zzso using zzso zzso Western zzso was used to determine zzso zzso or zzso in protein zzso 

TRAIL decreased the viability of zzso but not of zzso or zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso or zzso (Ben zzso Laboratories, Bedford, zzso decreased the expression of the zzso protein zzso and increased zzso zzso reversing TRAIL resistance in zzso zzso zzso targeting of zzso by zzso was insufficient for zzso to TRAIL in zzso zzso However, chemotherapy zzso TRAIL zzso was zzso by low zzso of zzso which resulted in the zzso of translation zzso and decreased the expression of several short zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso stress by low zzso zzso may reverse TRAIL zzso This warrants the further exploration of zzso as an zzso zzso treatment to lower the zzso threshold of zzso cancer zzso
