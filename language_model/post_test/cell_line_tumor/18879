zzso or acquired resistance to chemotherapy is a major clinical problem that has evoked the need to develop innovative approaches to predict and ultimately reverse drug zzso A prolonged zzso arrest has been associated with zzso resistance to various zzso agents zzso In this study, we describe the functional significance of the zzso zzso checkpoint zzso zzso and zzso in maintaining a zzso arrest after zzso disruption by zzso and a novel series of zzso the zzso zzso in human cancer zzso zzso expressing high levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso display a prolonged zzso arrest after exposure to zzso On the other hand, cells with low zzso levels of zzso zzso checkpoint proteins zzso and zzso zzso arrest in zzso and undergo increased zzso The zzso of zzso correlated with zzso zzso arrest in four cell lines tested, indicating an active zzso zzso zzso Gene zzso of zzso by small interfering zzso interference reduced zzso zzso arrest without enhancing zzso zzso Further analysis demonstrated that zzso zzso cells were both zzso and zzso with a zzso DNA content, suggesting a requirement for zzso in zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso contributes to the zzso checkpoint induced by the zzso
