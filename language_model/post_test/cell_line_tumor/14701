zzso of cancer experiences a number of shortcomings including development of drug zzso This fact also holds true for zzso utilizing zzso as zzso We performed a comparative analysis of molecular and cellular mechanisms associated with zzso resistance utilizing cell line as well as human tissue zzso zzso gene expression analysis revealed molecular features, processes and pathways afflicted with drug resistance mechanisms in general, and specifically with zzso significantly involving zzso associated zzso However, specific mode of resistance as well as underlying zzso of zzso zzso sensitive cells apparently exhibited significant zzso No consensus profile for zzso resistance could be zzso but zzso changes on the level of individual zzso cell lines as well as individual patient profiles became clearly zzso Based on these zzso we zzso the concept of synthetic zzso aimed at identifying hub proteins which when inhibited promise to induce cell death due to a synthetic lethal interaction with zzso zzso associated zzso Our screening procedure identified synthetic lethal hub proteins afflicted with zzso associated processes holding synthetic lethal interactions to zzso features individually found in all zzso cell lines tested, therefore promising an improved therapeutic zzso zzso of such synthetic lethal hub candidates in human zzso tissue expression profiles indicated the feasibility of this screening approach for addressing zzso resistance in zzso
