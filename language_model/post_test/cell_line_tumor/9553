zzso is a promising new zzso zzso zzso zzso agent used for cancer imaging whose mechanism has still not fully been zzso In this study, whether zzso determined by measuring the activity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso D zzso in rapidly zzso and zzso breast cancer zzso cells is related to cell proliferation or not was zzso 

The activity of zzso and zzso were determined using zzso exchange zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso content expressed as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 6) was significantly higher in the zzso growing zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso cells using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso activity expressed as the mean zzso zzso 6) zzso per minute zzso protein zzso zzso zzso S phase zzso zzso showed significantly higher zzso zzso zzso activity in the zzso growing cells zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso 

This study indicates that the major zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso as a consequence of increased zzso and zzso activity in the zzso growing cells compared to zzso zzso
