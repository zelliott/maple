In an attempt to enhance the zzso efficacy of genetic zzso we investigated a new biological means for delivering zzso gene directly to the zzso via membrane zzso In this context, we investigated zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA as a possible genetic zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that a FL could introduce and express zzso zzso gene efficiently and rapidly in zzso zzso with this zzso an in zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso delivery can induce potent presentation of zzso via the zzso class zzso zzso zzso zzso with FL containing the zzso induced potent zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso responses and zzso production were also observed in systemic compartments including the zzso upon zzso with the zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that FL is an effective genetic zzso carrier system for the stimulation of zzso immune responses against its zzso zzso
