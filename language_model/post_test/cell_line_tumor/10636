zzso cancer is a common zzso zzso Through zzso approaches, zzso zzso was identified and proposed as a urinary marker for zzso zzso zzso is a zzso molecular zzso that regulates various cellular functions such as zzso zzso and cell zzso zzso is zzso in various zzso but its mechanism of action in the development of zzso tumors remains zzso We generated zzso zzso cancer cells lines that either zzso zzso or knocked down zzso to investigate the zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso Compared with the zzso control zzso cells, the zzso of zzso suppressed cell zzso migration, and attachment, whereas zzso of zzso enhanced cell migration and zzso We further demonstrated that the zzso status of focal zzso zzso and zzso important regulators of the focal zzso complex, was also regulated in these zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso a protein zzso zzso reported to be affected by zzso was not significantly different between the control and zzso zzso Most importantly, we observed that tumors derived from zzso zzso cells were significantly smaller and had fewer zzso sites in the lung and liver in zzso than did zzso control zzso zzso In conclusion, our results suggest that zzso of zzso expression levels might affect zzso cancer progression in zzso and in zzso
