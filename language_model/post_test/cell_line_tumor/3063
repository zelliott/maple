The aim of this work was to confirm the existence of volatile organic compounds zzso specifically released by lung cancer zzso 

zzso cells were zzso and 100 zzso zzso cells were incubated in a sealed zzso zzso zzso from the zzso of the culture vessel were collected with simultaneous zzso by zzso on solid zzso and subsequently zzso for analysis by gas zzso mass zzso zzso 

The results showed a significant increase in the concentration of zzso and zzso in the zzso as compared with medium zzso zzso is also found in zzso breath of lung cancer patients in contrast to that from healthy zzso zzso significantly lower zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso 

Our findings demonstrate that certain compounds can be cancer cell derived and thus may be indicative of the presence of a zzso Some compounds were not released but seem to be consumed by cancer zzso
