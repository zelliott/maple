zzso delivery to tumors and efficient cellular zzso of zzso acids remain major challenges for zzso cancer zzso Here we report the use of a designed zzso repeat protein zzso specific for the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso as a carrier for small interfering zzso zzso complementary to the zzso zzso For charge zzso of the zzso the zzso was fused to a truncated human zzso zzso To increase the cell binding affinity and the amount of zzso delivered into cells, zzso zzso were generated and used as fusion proteins with zzso All proteins expressed well in zzso coli in soluble form, yet, to remove tightly bound bacterial zzso zzso they were zzso under zzso conditions by immobilized metal zzso affinity zzso followed by zzso The fusion proteins were capable of zzso four to five zzso molecules per zzso and fully retained the binding specificity for zzso as shown on zzso breast zzso zzso In contrast to unspecific zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso using fusion protein zzso zzso was strictly dependent on zzso binding and zzso zzso of zzso expression facilitated tumor cell zzso as shown by increased sensitivity to the zzso agent zzso
