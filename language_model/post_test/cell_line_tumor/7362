To study the expression of the inhibitor of zzso zzso gene zzso in prostate cancer and the relationship between its expression and its clinical stage or zzso zzso 

zzso zzso expression was detected by zzso in three prostate cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso prostate zzso and normal prostate zzso zzso SP method was used to examine the expression of zzso protein in 56 zzso prostate tissue zzso 

zzso gene was not expressed in normal prostate zzso but highly expressed in prostate cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso Thirty of the 56 zzso tumor samples were positive zzso zzso and only 12 zzso zzso samples were positive zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso not correlated with tumor stage or zzso grade zzso zzso zzso 

zzso may be involved in the development of prostate cancer and play an important role in human prostate zzso It is likely to be used as a target of prostate cancer zzso
