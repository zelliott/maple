zzso zzso is central to many cellular zzso including zzso zzso and zzso production in mast zzso Using single cell stimulation by zzso zzso and high-speed imaging of conventional or genetically zzso zzso sensors in rat zzso leukemia and bone zzso rat mast cells, we observe zzso waves that originate most frequently from the tips of extended cell zzso as well as zzso zzso throughout the cell that usually follow the initiating zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso to the tip of a zzso stimulates local, repetitive zzso zzso at the region of cell zzso zzso zzso waves are observed in most rat zzso leukemia cells zzso with soluble zzso and are sensitive to zzso of zzso release from zzso zzso stores and to zzso zzso but they do not depend on zzso zzso zzso zzso of transient zzso potential channel zzso and zzso channel proteins by short hairpin zzso reduces the sensitivity of these cells to zzso and shifts the wave initiation site from zzso to the cell zzso Our results reveal zzso zzso zzso signaling in response to zzso zzso that zzso zzso channels to specify the initiation site of the zzso zzso
