The potential zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso has been studied zzso but their potential interaction with conventional cancer therapies, such as radiation, remains zzso In the present work, the influence of zzso on the zzso activity of radiation in human zzso and zzso and zzso zzso breast cancer cells was zzso The zzso effects produced by combination of zzso and radiation were more effective than either agent zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso failed to inhibit growth or zzso the zzso effects of radiation, indicative of zzso Two other zzso zzso and zzso zzso also enhanced the zzso effects of radiation, but other synthetic cannabinoids zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso did zzso The combination treatment of zzso + radiation promoted both zzso and zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso also failed to alter zzso DNA damage or the apparent rate of DNA zzso Although the zzso actions of zzso were zzso through zzso zzso zzso the observation that zzso zzso with growth stimulation by zzso zzso implicates the potential involvement of zzso signaling zzso In addition to demonstrating that zzso compounds could potentially augment the effectiveness of radiation treatment in breast cancer, the present study suggests that zzso and zzso are unlikely to interfere with the effectiveness of radiation therapy, which is of particular relevance to patients using zzso drugs to zzso the toxicity of cancer zzso
