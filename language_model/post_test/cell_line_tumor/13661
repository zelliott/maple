zzso and zzso have previously shown zzso activity in neuroendocrine tumor cell zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the zzso activity of the drugs in a three-dimensional model and to study if the mechanism of the zzso activity was induction of zzso An in zzso hollow fiber model was used to study the zzso effect and a zzso zzso screening zzso was used for measurement of zzso The human pancreatic zzso cell line, zzso and the human typical and zzso zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso showed higher zzso activity on zzso compared to zzso and 3 day cultures were more sensitive than the 14 day zzso A zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and increase in nuclear fragmentation and zzso were observed for the drugs in zzso and zzso using a zzso zzso zzso These results were confirmed with nuclear zzso examinations on microscopic zzso zzso and zzso showed zzso activity and induced zzso zzso with modest changes in nuclear zzso indicating induction of zzso
