The zzso zzso zzso isolated from the sap of the zzso tree zzso zzso was found to inhibit the activity of zzso and to suppress zzso production in animal zzso The zzso of zzso as a zzso inhibitor was 37 zzso versus 70 zzso for zzso zzso a known inhibitor of zzso and zzso For the zzso of zzso production in mouse zzso melanoma cells, the zzso of zzso was 40 zzso versus 124 zzso for zzso zzso induced much less zzso stress than did zzso The effectiveness in zzso zzso production could be zzso by intermittent exposure of cells to zzso The potent zzso effects of zzso on zzso activity and zzso production are likely due to its zzso chain, which zzso retention of the compound in cell membrane compartments and may impede zzso of the zzso zzso As zzso activity accounts for zzso zzso of zzso products and animal skin zzso zzso could be useful for the preservation of these products or as a zzso zzso
