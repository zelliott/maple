A central event in the development of zzso melanoma is the loss of the zzso protein zzso Here, we report that this loss is linked to the zzso of the zzso zzso a key player in zzso In zzso zzso zzso show strong expression of the zzso protein in contrast to zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso levels did not differ in the melanoma cell lines when compared to zzso suggesting that zzso could be regulated at the zzso zzso To uncover the link between zzso and zzso we zzso zzso in melanoma cells and detected decreased protein expression and activity of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso is dependent on active zzso zzso zzso and regulated via the zzso Additionally, we determined that, with respect to zzso regulation, there are two melanoma zzso One zzso regulates zzso expression via the newly discovered zzso signaling pathway, whereas the other zzso uses the zzso to regulate its zzso In zzso our data provide novel insights into the zzso function of zzso which contributes to the suppression of zzso protein translation and zzso activity independent of zzso
