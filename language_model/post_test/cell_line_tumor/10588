zzso cells play a decisive role in regulating tumor zzso In this study, we assessed the significance of normal zzso zzso cells zzso in prostate cancer zzso An in zzso zzso tumor model was established as zzso Group 1, zzso cells alone; Group 2, zzso + zzso Group 3, zzso cells alone injected into zzso zzso and Group 4, zzso + zzso injected into zzso zzso Following injection, tumors were only zzso in the first two groups, with more aggressive growth in Group 2 than in Group 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed significantly higher proliferation zzso zzso zzso but not zzso or altered expression of zzso zzso in Group 2, as compared with Group zzso In zzso zzso cells isolated from Group 1 tumors showed lower viability and migratory capability than those from Group zzso zzso zzso on isolated zzso cells from Groups 1 and 2 revealed the differential expression of genes regulating cell cycle progression and cell mobility, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our results suggest that zzso cells derived from normal prostate zzso the development of tumor growth in zzso which is achieved at least in part through the regulation of zzso and zzso gene expression within the tumor zzso
