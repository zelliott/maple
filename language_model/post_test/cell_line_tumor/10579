zzso zzso are small, zzso zzso molecules that regulate growth and zzso zzso are frequently located at zzso fragile sites in the human zzso such as zzso zzso The nuclear zzso SKI is zzso in acute zzso leukemia zzso with zzso Here we asked whether loss of zzso on zzso zzso may explain this zzso zzso expression was found to be zzso in zzso with zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso Ski and its target zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso induced Ski zzso zzso zzso validated a functional binding site for zzso in the 3' untranslated region of zzso Finally, in samples of zzso patients, we observed an inverse correlation of Ski and zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso of Ski in zzso with zzso is caused by loss of zzso zzso may therefore function as an important tumor zzso in zzso by restraining expression of the SKI zzso
