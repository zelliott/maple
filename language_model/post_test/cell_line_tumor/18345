zzso presented in this study demonstrate that treatment of zzso cells with zzso resulted in induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso with a subsequent increase in zzso alpha zzso this effect was promoter specific since zzso did not affect total zzso in zzso cells and lacked an effect on zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast to the increase in zzso of the zzso alpha zzso zzso inhibited translation of the zzso alpha zzso This effect is also transcript specific since zzso did not alter total protein synthesis and did not affect the concentration of zzso zzso protein in the zzso The overall result of zzso treatment was to decrease the concentration of zzso alpha protein in the zzso zzso Evidence is presented that the effects of zzso on zzso alpha gene zzso may be zzso through the induction of zzso
