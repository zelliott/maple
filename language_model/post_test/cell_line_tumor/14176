Multiple functions have been reported for the zzso factor and candidate zzso zzso zzso Among others, they include regulation of cell growth, differentiation and zzso zzso activity and control of imprinted zzso zzso is usually localized in the nucleus and its zzso distribution during the cell cycle is zzso zzso was found associated with zzso zzso and the zzso suggesting different roles for zzso at different stages of the cell zzso Here we report the zzso zzso of zzso in several experimental model zzso zzso of zzso from zzso to the zzso was observed after differentiation of zzso zzso cells and induction of zzso in zzso breast cancer zzso zzso was also found in the zzso in terminally differentiated rat zzso zzso zzso Thus our data show that zzso zzso of zzso is associated with growth zzso Interestingly, the 180 zzso zzso zzso of zzso was predominantly found in the zzso zzso By zzso different zzso deletion zzso into cell lines of different origin we demonstrate that the central zzso domain of zzso is the region responsible for zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso of zzso revealed that it is distributed zzso in both dense zzso and zzso components of the zzso but is not associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso and protein synthesis were required to sustain zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso of active zzso sites by in zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso through a zzso zzso
