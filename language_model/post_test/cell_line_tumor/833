To investigate enhancement of the bystander effect by zzso zzso zzso in zzso system and the correlation with expression of zzso 43 zzso 

The zzso effect in zzso in cervical zzso cell line zzso zzso and zzso was examined by zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was detected by zzso zzso 

Tan markedly increased sensitivity of zzso cells for zzso in zzso zzso In the presence of 2 zzso zzso zzso compared with the absence of Tan zzso zzso an obvious decrease in survival rate was seen at any given mixture of ME and zzso cells exposed to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Statistics showed significant difference zzso zzso zzso However, enhancement of bystander zzso cell killing occurred only in the range of Tan zzso used zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the ratio of relative copy number of zzso zzso increased by zzso and zzso in ME cells exposed to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

For the first time we report that in cervical zzso zzso cell line, Tan possesses a remarkable enhancing role on the bystander effect in the zzso zzso It is associated with zzso of zzso zzso zzso
