The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso regulating cellular zzso levels, recently suggested as a tumor zzso However, the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso is not zzso We investigated the expression and DNA zzso of the zzso in primary zzso liver zzso from zzso zzso and primary zzso zzso zzso is expressed in all normal zzso and immortalized normal zzso cell lines, but was low or silenced in zzso zzso of zzso cell lines, which is well correlated with its promoter zzso zzso zzso was further detected in zzso zzso of zzso but less in zzso tumors generated from zzso and stomach in the liver zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso was also detected in primary zzso tumors, including zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso but none or occasionally in paired adjacent zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of 49 zzso sites at a zzso promoter region by zzso zzso sequencing confirmed the zzso zzso zzso could be reversed by chemical or genetic zzso of the promoter, indicating direct zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in silenced cell lines significantly inhibited their growth and colony formation ability by zzso cell zzso causing cell cycle arrest in zzso phase and inducing zzso through the intrinsic zzso zzso Moreover, zzso directly interacts with zzso and zzso zzso through the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso is common in primary zzso and other zzso zzso zzso appears to be a functional tumor zzso involved in the zzso of zzso and other zzso zzso
