zzso zzso is an zzso agent that can induce differentiation in human cancer zzso Recent evidence indicates that side population zzso cells possess characteristics of zzso cells, and may be capable of initiating tumor zzso 

The present study investigated the differentiation of cancer zzso cells derived from zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was used to isolated SP cells from zzso cell line zzso zzso These SP cells exhibit several zzso cell characteristics that are distinct from the main population zzso cells in zzso After zzso of induction with a low concentration of zzso the SP cells lost their capacity to zzso and zzso and their zzso zzso Based on real-time quantitative zzso we also found that the expression of zzso markers such as zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso and zzso gradually changed during the differentiation of SP zzso 

Our data suggest that a low concentration of zzso can induce zzso differentiation of cancer zzso cells from zzso cells, offering a possible therapeutic strategy for the treatment of human zzso
