zzso a model for predicting zzso activity of any classes of organic compounds based on molecular structure is very important goal for medicinal zzso Different molecular zzso can be used to solve this zzso zzso molecular zzso so-called the zzso approach, shown to be very successful in drug zzso Nevertheless, the structural diversity of compounds is so vast that we may need zzso models such as artificial neural networks zzso instead of linear zzso zzso analysis used to model the zzso activity of organic compounds has shown high average accuracy of zzso zzso zzso and predictability of zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso with different training and predicting zzso This ANN model zzso compares with respect to a previous linear zzso analysis zzso model zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso Model 9 zzso zzso that showed only zzso of accuracy and zzso of zzso The present zzso approach employed shorter training times of only zzso while previous models give zzso of zzso only after zzso h of zzso In order to illustrate the practical use of the model in zzso medicinal chemistry, we report the in zzso zzso and in zzso evaluation of six new synthetic zzso zzso having zzso values in a broad range between zzso and 138 zzso for leukemia zzso and human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso predictions coincide very well with experimental zzso
