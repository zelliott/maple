To evaluate the effects and molecular mechanism of action of zzso zzso in reversing zzso resistance by observing its impacts on nuclear zzso of zzso binding zzso zzso zzso resistance gene zzso expression and zzso zzso expression in human colon cancer cell line zzso with zzso induced by zzso 

zzso zzso cells were exposed to the zzso rat serum prepared by drug zzso zzso expressions in cell plasma and zzso were examined by Western zzso the binding activity of zzso to zzso gene promoter sequences was detected by zzso mobility shift zzso zzso the zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso related protein zzso were examined by zzso the expression of zzso on cell membrane was determined by flow zzso zzso Along with the increasing drug's concentration of zzso serum from zzso up to zzso and zzso the expressions of zzso decreased in zzso cell nuclear and increased in zzso zzso the binding activity of zzso to zzso gene promoter weakened zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso intensity of zzso on cell membrane attenuated zzso zzso zzso or P zzso zzso while zzso and zzso zzso unchanged zzso zzso zzso 

zzso could reverse the zzso of colon cancer cells by influencing nuclear zzso of zzso and reducing the expression of zzso
