In this study, we generated three zzso libraries from melanoma zzso Using zzso tools usually applied to zzso data, we identified several zzso including novel zzso which are zzso expressed in zzso zzso results zzso with previous zzso analysis on the importance of zzso calcium and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso We also examined the expression of zzso which was specifically, albeit not zzso expressed in the melanoma libraries using a melanoma progression tissue zzso and demonstrate that this protein is expressed by melanoma cells but not by benign zzso Many genes involved in zzso calcium and zzso signaling were highly expressed in melanoma, results we had observed earlier from zzso studies zzso et zzso zzso One of the genes most highly expressed in our melanoma zzso libraries was a zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso 3 moves from the zzso of zzso cells to the zzso of zzso cells, suggesting zzso of this zzso zzso Our zzso results and the clinical validation data demonstrate how zzso profiles can highlight specific links between signaling pathways as well as associations with tumor zzso This may provide insights into new genes that may be useful for the diagnosis and therapy of zzso
