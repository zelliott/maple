zzso zzso of biologically active peptides represents a powerful approach to the functional dissection of neuroendocrine zzso However, the requirement to generate separate, biologically active and reporter molecules zzso the use of internal zzso entry site zzso technology, which often results in preferential translation of the second zzso We report here a novel approach in which the zzso processing machinery of the regulated zzso zzso zzso has been exploited to generate multiple mature proteins from a zzso construct that encodes a single zzso This was achieved by zzso of the zzso zzso sites in zzso zzso The duplicated site included 10 zzso zzso acids on either side of the zzso zzso zzso This enabled the incorporation of a foreign zzso sequence (in this case, enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso between these zzso The zzso zzso construct generated zzso expression of fully processed zzso and zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso This approach represents an advance upon zzso and other extant approaches to the targeting of zzso biologically active proteins to neuroendocrine systems, and, importantly, permits the zzso of fluorescent markers with biologically active zzso In this study, our demonstration of the fusion of the first 10 zzso acids of the zzso sequence to the zzso of zzso shows that this putative sorting sequence is sufficient to direct expression to the zzso
