zzso zzso zzso promotes chemotherapy resistance through multiple mechanisms, including disabling zzso proteins and regulating gene zzso zzso of zzso wide analysis of zzso binding revealed that the zzso site motif zzso is prevalent within predicted zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso regulates gene expression through zzso in promoters and that zzso mediates the interaction with this zzso zzso we identified zzso a zzso DNA zzso involved in the repair of DNA damage caused by zzso as a zzso target of zzso We demonstrate that suppression of zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso and that zzso and zzso are frequently zzso in human lung zzso thus, our analysis identifies a potentially zzso component of zzso zzso zzso
