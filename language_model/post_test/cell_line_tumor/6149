Breast cancer is a zzso disease and several distinct zzso exist based on differential gene expression zzso zzso zzso zzso were recently identified as an additional zzso zzso as zzso zzso negative and zzso zzso positive zzso zzso but with an expression profile resembling zzso zzso breast zzso One possible explanation for the apparent incongruity is that zzso gene expression zzso could be zzso by zzso Using a cell line model of zzso zzso molecular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we map global zzso binding events and find a binding profile that is similar to zzso binding in breast cancer zzso We find that zzso binding is a near-perfect subset of zzso binding regions, a level of zzso never previously seen with a nuclear zzso zzso functionality is dependent on zzso since zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of the majority of the molecular zzso gene signature and growth cell zzso These findings show that zzso binds and regulates zzso zzso elements in molecular zzso zzso resulting in a zzso zzso reminiscent of zzso zzso in zzso breast zzso
