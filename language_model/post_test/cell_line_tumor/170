We investigated the mechanisms by which extracts of zzso zzso affect the inflammatory response in zzso zzso zzso 

Human zzso cells zzso were cultured in bacterial extracts prepared from zzso zzso zzso zzso The cells were zzso with zzso zzso or zzso with small interfering zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso 2 zzso 

The zzso of cells with zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at both the zzso zzso and protein zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression was significantly decreased in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression in zzso zzso cells is zzso by zzso
