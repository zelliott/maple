The primary aim of the study was to correlate pain development during bone cancer growth with zzso obtained zzso changes in bone zzso zzso zzso sensitivity of this bone pain was zzso Mice were injected into the zzso with zzso zzso cells, and zzso followed during a zzso zzso During the observation period increasing pain behavior was observed in zzso zzso zzso mice exhibited spontaneous and zzso zzso the latter evoked through zzso zzso of the zzso zzso use during forced zzso on a zzso decreased to substantial zzso of the affected limb by day zzso On day 23, zzso zzso scans of the zzso bones were evaluated for bone zzso Different bone parameters indicative of zzso or fragmentation were significantly correlated with pain zzso In a separate group of mice the effects of different zzso doses on pain behavior were evaluated on days 17 and 21 of tumor zzso zzso lifting and zzso lifting were sensitive to zzso treatment, although zzso analgesia due to repeated restraint might minimize zzso lifting in zzso zzso use during forced zzso was only slightly ameliorated by high zzso zzso
