To investigate whether the side population zzso cells possess cancer stem zzso characteristics in zzso and the role of SP cells in zzso process in gastric zzso 

We analyzed the presence of SP cells in different human gastric zzso cell lines, and then isolated and identified the SP cells from the zzso III human gastric cancer cell line by flow zzso The zzso ability and zzso were evaluated by clone and sphere formation zzso The related genes were determined by reverse zzso zzso chain zzso To compare zzso ability, SP and zzso population zzso cells from the zzso III human gastric cancer cell line were zzso injected into nude zzso 

SP cells from the total population accounted for zzso in zzso III, zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso SP cells could grow zzso and have zzso capability in zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was different between SP and zzso zzso However, there was no apparent difference between SP and zzso cells when they were injected into nude zzso 

SP cells have some cancer stem zzso characteristics in zzso and can be used for studying the zzso process in gastric zzso
