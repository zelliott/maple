zzso region 1 zzso of envelope protein 2 zzso of zzso C virus zzso serves important yet undefined roles in the viral life zzso We previously showed that the viability of zzso zzso zzso with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells was rescued by zzso zzso zzso and an E1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was fully zzso In zzso production zzso where zzso zzso was zzso into zzso zzso zzso cells with low zzso zzso we found no effect of zzso deletion on replication or particle release for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells showed that zzso deletion decreased entry by zzso to zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso restored entry for zzso while zzso further impaired zzso zzso We investigated zzso usage by zzso blocking and zzso zzso in zzso cells, followed by zzso of parental and zzso zzso zzso Compared to parental zzso scavenger zzso class B type I zzso dependency was decreased for zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dependency was decreased for zzso zzso but not for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed strong zzso of parental zzso but limited effect against zzso zzso zzso E zzso zzso zzso was similar for zzso zzso and zzso viruses with and without zzso In conclusion, zzso and zzso zzso envelope zzso appeared to be involved in zzso and zzso dependency, zzso Also, zzso served zzso but zzso functions in zzso zzso
