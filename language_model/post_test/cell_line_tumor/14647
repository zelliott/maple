zzso zzso zzso breast cancer cells with zzso has resulted in significant improvements in both zzso and overall survival zzso However, despite a favorable initial response, some cancer cells become resistant and develop into fatal zzso zzso Here we report that we can specifically target zzso zzso and zzso breast cancer cells by using an engineered zzso which has zzso bound to its zzso In zzso this zzso construct zzso both the expression of reporter zzso such as enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso and zzso zzso as well as the therapeutic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso application of the zzso zzso selectively killed breast cancer cells in which zzso zzso expression of zzso In zzso we successfully targeted the expression of zzso zzso to zzso breast cancer tumors established in nude zzso Furthermore, we found that systemic administration of zzso zzso led to expression of zzso in circulating zzso breast cancer zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso breast cancer cells resistant to zzso can be targeted for selective gene expression and destruction by viruses with zzso engineered to bind to this zzso
