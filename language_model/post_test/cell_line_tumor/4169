In our previous studies in grass carp zzso cells, local production of zzso hormone zzso was shown to induce growth hormone zzso production and gene zzso which constitutes a major component of the zzso feedback zzso regulating zzso zzso and synthesis via zzso interactions between zzso and zzso in the carp zzso To further investigate the signaling mechanisms zzso zzso action at the zzso level, promoter studies were performed in zzso cells zzso with the expression zzso for carp zzso zzso and zzso reporter zzso with grass carp zzso zzso In this cell model, treatment with human zzso zzso zzso was effective in increasing zzso promoter activity and the responsive sequence was mapped to position zzso and zzso of the grass carp zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso induced by zzso occurred with concurrent rise in zzso production, zzso zzso and could be inhibited by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso presumably via zzso production, could mimic zzso zzso zzso and zzso promoter activity, and these zzso effects were also sensitive to the blockade of zzso zzso and zzso dependent zzso These results, as a whole, suggest that zzso zzso zzso in the carp zzso may trigger zzso gene zzso through zzso zzso as a result of the functional zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso
