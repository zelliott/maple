The novel zzso second zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are both zzso by zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from rabbit skeletal muscle, zzso zzso release was zzso In the present paper, we show in zzso zzso the formation of authentic zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso reaction to form zzso and zzso as well as the zzso reaction to form zzso were strictly dependent on zzso Although the formation of zzso is zzso at pH 6, the synthesis of zzso was most pronounced at a pH below zzso A novel regulation mechanism is provided for zzso acid, the zzso for zzso zzso zzso acid had virtually no influence on the zzso reaction, but increased the affinity of zzso at an zzso pH and had the opposite effect at alkaline zzso zzso the side product of zzso zzso is an inhibitor of the zzso reaction zzso zzso zzso and was zzso more potent at suppressing the zzso zzso Although the synthesis of zzso was highly sensitive to zzso zzso this was not via a competition with the zzso zzso In contrast with the zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso reaction of the skeletal muscle zzso was inhibited by zzso and zzso while other zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso had virtually no zzso These findings allow for the prediction of a novel zzso zzso zzso in skeletal muscle zzso other than zzso Hence the zzso prerequisite for zzso and zzso zzso zzso is zzso
