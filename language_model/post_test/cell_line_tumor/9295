zzso is known for its role in zzso and zzso zzso In addition, its capacity to augment the immune response to weak or low affinity zzso makes it an ideal candidate to evaluate in combination with a zzso tumor cell zzso which has been shown to elicit broad zzso and cellular immune zzso The studies reported here show that zzso when combined with a zzso tumor cell zzso significantly prolonged the survival of zzso zzso The enhanced zzso protection correlated with an increased number of activated zzso cells zzso and T cells in zzso zzso such as the draining zzso zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, an increased number of activated zzso T cells were found in the tumor zzso zzso with a more potent systemic zzso zzso response than each zzso zzso Taken together, these studies demonstrate that zzso zzso the zzso response of a zzso tumor cell zzso in zzso zzso
