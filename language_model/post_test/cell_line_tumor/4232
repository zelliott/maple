zzso natural killer T zzso cells are a unique zzso zzso that mediates zzso activities upon zzso A current strategy to harness zzso cells for cancer treatment is zzso zzso cell zzso using zzso zzso cells zzso However, the limited number and functional defects of patient zzso are still the major challenges for this therapeutic zzso In this study, we investigated whether human embryonic stem cells zzso with an zzso expressed zzso gene could be exploited to address this zzso Using a zzso carrying an zzso expression zzso we generated zzso modified zzso lines that consistently zzso zzso These modified zzso lines were able to differentiate into zzso as efficiently as the parental zzso Most importantly, more than 50% of such derived zzso were zzso These zzso zzso were more efficient in inducing zzso cell response than those without zzso and their ability was comparable to that of zzso generated from zzso of healthy zzso The zzso cells expanded by the zzso zzso were functional, as demonstrated by their ability to lyse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso modified with the zzso gene may serve as a convenient, unlimited, and competent DC source for zzso zzso cancer zzso
