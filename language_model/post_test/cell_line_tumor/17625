The human zzso zzso zzso zzso form a zzso family of zzso proteins consisting of four zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso When activated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso in turn, activate a zzso zzso that degrades viral and cellular zzso In contrast, while the zzso zzso protein is highly zzso to the zzso family zzso zzso its 350 zzso acid zzso domain lacks zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso acid domain, which is zzso zzso to a tandem repeat of zzso further zzso the zzso zzso protein and suggests that it serves a biological role which is distinct from other zzso family zzso To dissect the function of zzso zzso we zzso the zzso zzso system to identify interacting zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso which functions as a zzso zzso was identified as a strong zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, like zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene was induced by zzso indicating that these genes are zzso zzso The interaction was confirmed in zzso and in zzso and was mapped to the zzso domain of zzso zzso The zzso zzso interaction was specific, because zzso zzso did not interact with any of the other zzso family members and zzso did not interact with zzso These findings link the zzso zzso with zzso zzso control in the context of an zzso cell, and provide the basis for future studies to examine the functional role of this zzso
