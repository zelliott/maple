The specificity of zzso have made zzso promising zzso for the delivery of zzso to cancer zzso however, their long zzso zzso zzso the use of zzso with long physical zzso a combination that leads to high radiation doses to zzso zzso the development of targeting zzso that harness the advantages of zzso without their zzso limitations is zzso To this end, we report the development of a methodology for zzso PET imaging based on the zzso zzso click reaction between zzso and zzso 

A zzso system based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer cells, and zzso was zzso The zzso zzso was zzso modified with zzso and a zzso zzso was zzso and zzso with zzso zzso in zzso zzso and PET imaging experiments were performed with zzso nude mice bearing zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso 

The zzso zzso was modified with zzso to produce a zzso with high zzso and the zzso zzso zzso was zzso with greater than zzso purity and a specific activity of zzso zzso For in zzso experiments, mice bearing zzso zzso were injected with zzso zzso after allowing 24 h for zzso of the zzso in the zzso the mice were injected with zzso zzso for PET imaging and zzso zzso At 12 h after injection, the retention of zzso in the tumor zzso zzso zzso percent injected dose per zzso coupled with the zzso zzso of excess zzso produced images with high zzso zzso PET imaging and zzso experiments performed using zzso directly labeled with either zzso or zzso revealed that although absolute tumor zzso was higher with the directly zzso zzso the zzso system yielded comparable images and zzso ratios at 12 and 24 h after zzso Further, zzso calculations revealed that the zzso zzso system resulted in only a fraction of the absorbed background dose of zzso directly labeled with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The high quality of the images produced by this zzso approach, combined with the ability of the methodology to dramatically reduce zzso radiation doses to patients, marks this system as a strong candidate for clinical zzso
