zzso stem cells zzso have been shown to migrate toward tumors, but their distribution pattern in zzso has not been completely zzso The primary purpose of the study was to zzso the zzso capacity of zzso to zzso to delineate the pattern of zzso distribution in zzso after systemic injection, and to track the migration and incorporation of zzso labeled zzso using zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

The zzso from Fischer 344 rats were zzso with zzso iron oxide zzso zzso and enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso The zzso capacity of zzso was zzso zzso in zzso using the zzso zzso To track the migration of zzso in zzso MR imaging was performed both 7 and 14 days after systemic administration of labeled zzso After MR imaging, the distribution patterns of zzso in rats with zzso were examined using zzso blue and zzso zzso 

The in zzso study showed that zzso possessed significantly greater migratory capacity than zzso cells ( zzso and that zzso of zzso zzso cells and cultured zzso cells showed a greater capacity to induce migration of cells than other stimuli ( zzso Seven days after zzso zzso the zzso zzso cells were distributed throughout the zzso where a zzso dark zzso region was represented on zzso echo zzso After 14 days, most of the zzso zzso were found at the border between the tumor and normal zzso which was represented on zzso echo sequences as diluted zzso dark areas at the edge of the zzso 

This study demonstrated that zzso transplanted zzso migrate toward zzso with high specificity in a zzso pattern, which can be tracked using MR zzso
