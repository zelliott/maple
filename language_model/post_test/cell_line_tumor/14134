zzso has a role in the regulation of immune responses, cell proliferation and migration, and zzso Little is known of its distribution in oral zzso zzso 

zzso zzso lines were tested for zzso protein by Western zzso zzso was used to stain zzso sections of oral zzso in health and in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Western zzso confirmed the presence of zzso in oral zzso zzso was generally expressed by zzso in the zzso layer, with variable zzso zzso zzso cells also stained zzso zzso was lost in nine of 33 zzso zzso zzso seven of which were zzso Eighty-one percent of well, zzso of moderately and 50% of poorly differentiated oral zzso cell zzso zzso expressed zzso Overall, 45 of 65 zzso zzso were zzso The pattern of expression was unrelated to zzso zzso 

zzso expression by zzso and zzso oral zzso is zzso zzso is lost in approximately one-third of oral zzso zzso and zzso The significance of such loss remains unknown, but may be related to zzso or other abnormalities of zzso zzso
