zzso zzso are the dominant drivers of zzso progression in human cancer, yet little is known about how the transformation from zzso to activated zzso drives the expression of transformed zzso An zzso model of zzso transformation of human zzso zzso cells was used along with zzso human breast zzso to investigate how zzso zzso alters its properties as a signaling zzso and changes the networks of zzso zzso Our results show that full zzso zzso of zzso is the result of a transition in which activated zzso acquires dominant signaling properties that zzso alter the network of genes regulated by the activated zzso compared with the zzso zzso gene expression programs related to invasion, cell stress, and zzso become regulated by zzso in a manner not observed in zzso cells, even when zzso is zzso Our results offer novel insights into biological processes that come under the control of zzso after it acquires full zzso zzso
