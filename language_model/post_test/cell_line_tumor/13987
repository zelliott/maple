In recent years, new chemotherapy regimens with promising activity, especially in zzso therapy zzso zzso of head and neck cancer zzso have been zzso Nevertheless, a major problem concerning the response of zzso to chemotherapy is the high percentage of resting cells zzso zzso being resistant to zzso To overcome this phenomenon, the capacity of several zzso to switch on cells into the division cycle and progress to the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso 

zzso zzso zzso colony stimulating factor zzso and zzso growth factor zzso were used to stimulate zzso zzso cell cancer cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for re-entry into the cell cycle to enhance the response to zzso The proportion of zzso cells was detected through zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso 

Cell cycle re-entry was most effective after combination treatment with zzso + zzso The proportion of zzso cells was significantly reduced after stimulation with zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to cell cycle zzso the zzso effect of zzso was significantly zzso zzso zzso enhanced in the zzso compared to the control cells zzso zzso 

Our investigations demonstrated for the first time that zzso zzso zzso cell zzso cells for chemotherapy is possible by zzso with target zzso Considering that up to zzso of tumor cells are in the resting zzso phase of the cell cycle at the initiation of chemotherapy, zzso with zzso and zzso could contribute to a synchronization of cancer zzso This would clearly enhance the zzso zzso
