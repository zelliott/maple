Cancer stem cells zzso or zzso cells, similar to normal tissue stem cells, rely on zzso zzso such as the zzso pathway, to maintain their stem cell zzso One of the regulators of the zzso zzso is zzso a zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso signaling by binding to the zzso of zzso the negative regulator of zzso zzso thus preventing its zzso zzso have also been shown to zzso their zzso zzso activity in several types of solid tumors, thus making them resistant to zzso used as zzso agents in the zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso can be inhibited by zzso degradation of the zzso zzso domain zzso therefore, zzso of the zzso zzso activity can lead to stabilization of zzso Here, we present evidence that the zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso constitutes another level of control by which zzso promotes signaling through the zzso zzso and maintenance of the stem cell zzso of this zzso of cancer zzso We demonstrate that zzso mediates the zzso of the zzso zzso by binding to the zzso of zzso the zzso factor regulating zzso zzso zzso zzso thus providing an additional route by which the degradation of zzso is zzso and zzso signaling is zzso
