Orientation of zzso zzso and cell division axis can impact normal zzso zzso including zzso tissue branching and zzso generation by zzso cell zzso zzso dynamics and its interaction with cortical proteins regulate the orientation of zzso zzso zzso However, the nature of zzso signals that control proper orientation of zzso zzso axis is largely zzso Here, we show that signals from two distinct surface zzso zzso sites are required for the orientation of zzso zzso axis in normal zzso zzso We identified zzso and zzso zzso as required zzso zzso We showed that high molecular weight zzso zzso zzso signaling from the zzso zzso regulated the orientation of zzso zzso axis to align parallel to the zzso zzso zzso zzso The same effect was achieved by zzso zzso signaling from the zzso zzso or by zzso of ROCK zzso On the contrary, zzso zzso signaling from the zzso zzso regulated the orientation of zzso zzso axis to align zzso to the zzso zzso We also found that zzso dynamics is required for zzso zzso zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso Our findings thus provide a novel mechanism for the regulation of zzso zzso zzso
