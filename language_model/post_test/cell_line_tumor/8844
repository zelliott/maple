zzso are implicated in the control of cell zzso but little is known about the role of the zzso system in human zzso zzso This study was aimed at characterizing the in zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso in zzso melanoma zzso The zzso expression of genes that code for proteins involved in the metabolism and in the mechanism of zzso action was assessed by zzso Cell viability was tested using zzso zzso and the zzso cell death was determined by measuring zzso zzso zzso zzso cells express high levels of fatty acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso transient zzso potential zzso channel zzso V member 1 zzso and zzso zzso 55 zzso zzso zzso induced a zzso zzso with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and such an effect was associated to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso increase, zzso and zzso by zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso decrease, zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors partially decreased zzso zzso whereas selective antagonism on the zzso barely affected the mechanism of zzso zzso Finally, zzso a membrane cholesterol zzso completely reversed the zzso induced by the selective zzso zzso zzso and zzso Overall, these findings demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso against human melanoma cells in the zzso range of zzso through a complex zzso which involves zzso and zzso product synthesis and zzso zzso zzso raft zzso probably linked to zzso zzso might also have a zzso
