zzso zzso has cell differentiation and zzso activity in human breast cancer cells in tissue culture and zzso activity in mice bearing zzso and zzso zzso zzso We investigated the mechanism of zzso action in zzso human breast cancer cells using electron spin resonance zzso zzso oxygen species zzso were detected in zzso cell suspensions incubated with zzso using the spin trap zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso by the addition of zzso zzso but not by zzso and we concluded that zzso was generated in the zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso zzso suppressed zzso production, providing evidence for the involvement of a zzso zzso system in the zzso response to zzso A biologically significant zzso response to zzso occurred in zzso zzso An early marker of zzso stress was a decrease in the zzso zzso ratio 1 h after zzso zzso zzso DNA damage, marked by the presence of zzso and zzso breakage occurred in cells exposed to zzso for 24 zzso zzso peaked 48 h after exposure to zzso zzso with the zzso precursor zzso zzso prevented zzso breakage and zzso zzso with zzso also reversed zzso decreases in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicative of zzso zzso in zzso cells during zzso phase of the cell zzso We conclude that zzso formation is involved in the zzso and cell differentiation responses to zzso in zzso zzso
