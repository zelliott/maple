zzso is the major zzso protein of human barrier zzso such as blood and zzso It is a zzso protein capable of binding DNA exposed on the surface of various zzso zzso zzso zzso was prepared by sequential zzso of human milk proteins on zzso zzso and zzso containing immobilized zzso zzso By subsequent zzso on Blue zzso the resulting zzso was zzso into several zzso with different affinity for the zzso and this was associated with separation of additional zzso zzso with zzso activity from the main zzso By various techniques, in particular, by in zzso testing the zzso activity of zzso in a zzso gel after zzso zzso of DNA was for the first time shown to be an intrinsic property of zzso The zzso specificity of zzso in zzso of DNA was different from zzso of known human zzso zzso of DNA was activated by zzso metal zzso and also by zzso and zzso Unlike the main fraction of zzso with the highest affinity for Blue zzso all protein zzso with zzso activity were zzso and suppressed growth of human and mouse tumor cell zzso
