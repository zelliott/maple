Alzheimer's disease zzso has been associated with altered activity of zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso which are proposed to contribute to both zzso zzso and zzso plaque zzso However, the molecular basis by which zzso affects the formation of zzso remains zzso Our aim was to identify the underlying mechanisms of zzso effects on the processing of zzso precursor protein zzso For this purpose, zzso cells zzso expressing zzso carrying the Swedish zzso were treated with specific zzso zzso or zzso with zzso short interfering zzso We show that zzso of zzso leads to decreased expression of zzso by enhancing its degradation via an increase in the number of zzso This induction of the zzso zzso was associated with nuclear zzso of zzso factor zzso zzso a master regulator of zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso zzso reduces zzso through an increase of the degradation of zzso and its zzso zzso zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso These results suggest that an increased propensity toward zzso zzso in zzso patients could have consequences for zzso zzso
