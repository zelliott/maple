To investigate the effects of zzso on the cell proliferation and zzso of cultured cervical cancer cell line zzso 

zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso and empty zzso expression plasmids via zzso and designated as zzso and zzso cells zzso The growth rate, cell zzso ability on soft zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso cells were studied using corresponding zzso The expressions of zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso of the 3 cell strains were determined with zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso and zzso was employed for detecting the expressions of zzso and zzso zzso 

No distinct differences in the growth rate, zzso ability on soft zzso cell zzso and zzso were observed between zzso and zzso cells, whereas by comparison, zzso cells exhibited decreased growth rate, zzso ability, the cell zzso and zzso with also lowered expression levels of zzso and zzso zzso as shown by zzso zzso Expressions of zzso and zzso zzso were detected in all the 3 cell strains zzso but compared with zzso and zzso cells, the zzso expressions in zzso cells were significantly zzso 

zzso zzso may partially inhibit the proliferation and reduce the zzso of zzso cells possibly through decreasing zzso and zzso expressions, which are the important agents for tumor zzso
