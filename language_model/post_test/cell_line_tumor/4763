zzso a cell type found in the zzso play a pivotal role in the function of the zzso as a barrier between the maternal fluid and the zzso Recently, zzso a zzso zzso zzso was identified as being responsible for the barrier function of zzso In the present study, we investigated the expression profiles of zzso and the changes in expression during the differentiation of zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction and zzso demonstrated the expression of zzso zzso zzso and -5 in zzso zzso zzso which zzso the differentiation of zzso cells from zzso cells into zzso cells, reduced slightly the expression of zzso This is the first report to show changes in zzso in zzso zzso zzso
