The cell line zzso is derived from a patient with plasma cell leukemia and has a complex and continually evolving zzso It is frequently used in biological studies of myeloma and plasma cell zzso so accurate characterization of the zzso is zzso Here we present a detailed zzso investigation using zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso in association with assessment of copy number zzso zzso throughout the zzso using zzso comparative zzso zzso zzso In addition to providing an accurate description of the zzso this complementary approach highlighted the relative merits of the individual zzso Conventional zzso and zzso indicated the location and types of the major zzso changes, whether balanced or zzso and at the same time demonstrated the level of zzso evolution between zzso The zzso profiles reflected the unbalanced zzso abnormalities detected by zzso providing refinement of their zzso zzso locations as well as the identification of novel zzso zzso Three zzso platforms, zzso bacterial artificial zzso zzso or zzso templates, were available for zzso Sixteen zzso were consistently detected by all three zzso Novel zzso zzso ( approximately zzso zzso were detected by the highest resolution platform only, whereas the clones from the zzso zzso provided zzso FISH zzso for confirmation of zzso
