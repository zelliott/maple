zzso systems allowing the control of gene expression in zzso cells are invaluable tools for genetic research, and could also fulfill essential roles in zzso and zzso zzso Currently available systems, however, often have limited in zzso functionality because of zzso insufficient levels of zzso lack of tissue specificity or zzso complicated zzso Here we describe a zzso zzso conditional gene expression system for zzso expression of zzso zzso II zzso zzso or Pol III zzso sequences zzso small zzso hairpin zzso zzso This system has great zzso and versatility, governing tightly controlled gene expression in cell lines, in embryonic or zzso stem cells, in human tumors zzso into nude mice, in the brain of rats injected zzso with the zzso and in transgenic mice generated by infection of zzso zzso These results open up promising perspectives for basic or zzso research and for the development of zzso zzso
