zzso is the hormone that plays an essential role in metabolism and zzso of normal and tumor cells, exerting its zzso effects through binding to specific membrane receptors and promoting the zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso itself and of other components of the signaling zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of insulin on zzso and cell growth in three different cell zzso the goldfish zzso zzso cells zzso and differentiated with zzso zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso zzso melanoma zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells responded to insulin with a small increase of cell zzso whereas zzso cells responded with a decrease of zzso In the two zzso cell lines, and in zzso zzso cells, the hormone strongly inhibited zzso by decreasing zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, insulin had no effect on zzso zzso An increase in the zzso zzso status of zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 -- zzso zzso degree was observed in zzso mouse melanoma and in differentiated zzso zzso cells, suggesting that this specific protein was maintained during transformation process and zzso in insulin zzso Our results imply an ancient and diverse history of the insulin signaling system in zzso zzso zzso
