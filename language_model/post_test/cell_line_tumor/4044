zzso zzso known as zzso act by zzso gene zzso These zzso are zzso through the action of zzso zzso such as DNA zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The present study evaluated the effect of zzso zzso and sodium zzso zzso as zzso of zzso and zzso respectively, in the expression of genes involved in zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso cell lines were exposed to zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso as well as a combination of both, for zzso The expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes was assessed by zzso 

They show that the zzso zzso and zzso genes were not expressed by the zzso and zzso lines, and that the zzso line did not express zzso After treatment, however, these cell lines expressed all of the genes due to the effect of zzso on zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso which suggests repression by zzso Meanwhile, zzso zzso and zzso were in the zzso and zzso lines expressed after zzso zzso The effect of zzso induced an increase in the expression of zzso and zzso while zzso produced a similar effect on the zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso reveal that zzso zzso is the principle mechanism for zzso these genes and that their zzso expression is regulated primarily by this form of zzso zzso
