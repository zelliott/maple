zzso a member of the zzso zzso channel family, is expressed both in the brain and immune cells of the zzso zzso zzso it is unique in its zzso by zzso zzso and both zzso and zzso zzso To date studies of this channel have concentrated on human zzso channels and zzso native zzso This provides the potential for zzso complications in the interpretation of native tissue observations based on zzso channel zzso zzso we have cloned and zzso expressed rat zzso zzso in zzso zzso We find that, like zzso it responds to zzso zzso in a manner dependent on zzso zzso At the single channel level zzso is a slow zzso large zzso zzso channel that rapidly runs down in isolated membrane zzso zzso zzso is rapidly and zzso blocked by zzso zzso thus resembling zzso but not the zzso current of the zzso zzso zzso which exhibits zzso zzso by this zzso We show that cultured rat zzso zzso exhibit an zzso zzso at both the whole cell and single channel zzso zzso this zzso current can be zzso inhibited by zzso It is also sensitive to removal of zzso zzso suggesting that it is zzso by zzso zzso These data provide a functional zzso of zzso expressed zzso and demonstrate that, in addition to the previous descriptions in immune cells, zzso and zzso a zzso zzso can be found in zzso derived from the zzso zzso
