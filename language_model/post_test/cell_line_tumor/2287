To evaluate zzso activity of zzso zzso in Swiss zzso mice with zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso were induced in mice by zzso injection of zzso zzso Ethanol extract of zzso zzso zzso was administered to the experimental animals in different doses after 24 h of tumor zzso The zzso effect of the zzso was evaluated by assessing in zzso zzso survival time, zzso parameters and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso increased the life span of zzso mice compared with that of the model control mice ( zzso or zzso zzso treatment also converted the changes of zzso parameters and zzso zzso levels in the zzso mice ( zzso or zzso zzso induced zzso of tumor formation in zzso mice compared with that of the model control group ( zzso or zzso 

The present study zzso proved the zzso activity of marine algae zzso zzso and the effect can be correlated with zzso
