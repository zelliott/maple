To clone full-length human zzso responsive zzso and predict its function by zzso zzso to observe full-length zzso protein and zzso its relative gene expression in four cell zzso 

Total zzso was extracted from zzso human embryonic kidney cells zzso and the full-length zzso was obtained by zzso zzso of zzso was predicted by zzso analysis with Internet and zzso zzso zzso full-length zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso and zzso was observed by laser scanning zzso zzso microscope and zzso 

zzso zzso of 2 zzso zzso was amplified and zzso zzso zzso was found in the zzso series that may have an important zzso zzso gene have been mapped to a particular zzso location in zzso zzso scanning zzso zzso microscope showed zzso protein was expressed in the cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso has been successfully cloned and its function has been zzso zzso of zzso has been detected in 4 cell zzso Present result would provide data for the further study of zzso
