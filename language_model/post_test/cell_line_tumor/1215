zzso D is a zzso extract derived from several species of zzso zzso which is used for the treatment of various liver diseases in traditional Chinese zzso In this study, we report that zzso D zzso the cell growth of human lung cancer cell line zzso and provide a molecular understanding of this zzso The results showed that zzso D inhibited the proliferation of zzso by inducing zzso and blocking cell cycle progression in the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso D significantly increased the expression of zzso and zzso zzso contributing to cell cycle zzso An enhancement in zzso and its two form zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and soluble zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso was responsible for the zzso effect induced by zzso zzso Taken together, our study suggests that the induction of zzso and activity of the zzso zzso system may participate in the zzso activity of zzso D in zzso zzso
