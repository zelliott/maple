The zzso zzso is a cellular inhibitor of zzso and is frequently zzso in human zzso However, the zzso gene encodes alternatively spliced zzso whose functional significance is poorly zzso We had previously reported the detection of alternative zzso forms in Hodgkin's zzso zzso cell zzso Here, we have cloned several of these zzso including the previously described zzso zzso and -C (which zzso the zzso zzso of zzso and two novel zzso zzso and zzso containing a complete zzso interaction zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso and zzso were selectively expressed by zzso cell lines and primary tumors, compared with their zzso zzso In transient zzso experiments, alternatively spliced zzso zzso were partially or totally localized within the zzso zzso was able to inhibit zzso of a zzso reporter construct and induced a partial zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso caused the zzso of zzso and induced growth arrest in primary cells, but also increased the expression levels of zzso D1 and zzso Other possible genes regulated by zzso and zzso were identified using zzso zzso zzso These results imply that zzso zzso may have multiple effects on cell cycle control, and provide insight into the mechanisms through which these molecules contribute to zzso
