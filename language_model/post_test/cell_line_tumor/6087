zzso zzso frequently exhibit zzso zzso of the zzso pathway, which is implicated in resistance to zzso radiation zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso based chemotherapy is commonly used for treatment of gastrointestinal zzso We previously reported zzso with zzso an inhibitor of zzso The purpose of the current study was to evaluate if zzso could enhance zzso induced by zzso 

zzso survival zzso were carried out with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell lines using zzso treatment with zzso zzso and zzso Cell proliferation was determined using a zzso conversion zzso zzso catastrophe and DNA repair were analyzed using zzso zzso zzso was used to analyze cell cycle and zzso Growth delay was used to determine effects of zzso on in zzso tumor zzso 

zzso treatment with zzso significantly decreased zzso survival compared with either agent zzso zzso zzso factors at a surviving fraction of zzso for zzso was zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso Cell proliferation was decreased by treatment with zzso as compared with single agent treatment regardless of treatment zzso Enhancement of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso treatment was accompanied by an increase in zzso catastrophe and zzso and reductions in zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso an additive growth delay was observed with zzso versus zzso and zzso zzso 

These data suggest that zzso can be used with zzso to augment radiation zzso
