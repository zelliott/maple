zzso zzso in zzso zzso are common in zzso melanoma, an aggressive tumor of zzso zzso In the present study, the zzso effect of the new zzso zzso targeting drug zzso on two types of melanoma cell lines with differing zzso zzso status was zzso and the underlying mechanisms were zzso In cellular zzso zzso displayed high selectivity for tumor cells bearing zzso showing more than zzso higher zzso of their proliferation than zzso zzso zzso As expected, zzso completely abolished zzso zzso in zzso cells harboring zzso In zzso cells expressing zzso zzso caused the paradoxical zzso of the zzso zzso but to a much lesser extent than that observed of other zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso may be a more ideal zzso inhibitor capable of preserving potency against zzso zzso while minimizing the paradoxical zzso of zzso zzso In addition, we showed that zzso treatment of zzso cells simultaneously induced cellular zzso and zzso However, zzso zzso with zzso and zzso of zzso by zzso of the zzso inhibitor of zzso failed to rescue melanoma cells from zzso cell death, zzso that zzso and zzso may cooperate in the induction of cell death in zzso zzso zzso our data suggest that zzso may be an effective zzso inhibitor and a potential therapeutic strategy for zzso and Ras zzso zzso
