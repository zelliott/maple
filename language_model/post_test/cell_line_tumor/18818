zzso the active agent of zzso zzso exhibits well-documented zzso properties, but little is known about the possible effects zzso by zzso cannabinoids on human zzso In the present study, we analyzed the effect of zzso zzso zzso on cervical zzso zzso cell zzso 

To assess the sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso we selected three cell lines that were exposed to increasing doses of zzso with or without zzso to receptors to zzso DNA fragmentation and zzso activity were used as zzso zzso The expression of receptors to zzso were analyzed in zzso cell lines as well as zzso zzso 

The major finding was that zzso induced zzso of zzso cell lines via zzso expressed zzso zzso whereas zzso binding to the classical zzso and zzso zzso receptors zzso a protective zzso Furthermore, unexpectedly, a strong expression of the three forms of zzso receptors was observed in ex zzso zzso zzso 

Overall, these data suggest that the specific targeting of zzso by zzso cannabinoids or synthetic molecules offers attractive opportunities for the development of novel potent zzso zzso
