The zzso zzso fatty acid zzso is highly expressed in pancreatic zzso zzso zzso II, which is the principal hormone of the zzso zzso system, is generated actively in the zzso and has been shown to increase the expression of fatty acid zzso The zzso II type 2 zzso has been proposed to play an important role in zzso and fat zzso In this study, we explored the potential role of the zzso II type 2 zzso in fatty acid zzso regulation in pancreatic zzso zzso cells, and we evaluated the mechanisms zzso 

zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and protein in pancreatic zzso zzso cell lines treated with or without zzso II zzso to zzso zzso in the presence or absence of the zzso II type 2 zzso blocker zzso zzso to zzso zzso were analyzed by real-time zzso chain reaction and Western zzso The zzso protein zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were analyzed by Western zzso The tissue zzso of the zzso II type 2 zzso was examined by zzso in invasive pancreatic zzso zzso zzso and matching normal zzso 

zzso II type 2 zzso treatment increased fatty acid zzso expression and promoter activity in significantly pancreatic zzso zzso zzso these effects were blocked significantly in the presence of zzso Interestingly, zzso II also induced zzso II type 2 zzso expression in pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso decreased fatty acid zzso protein levels, but only zzso increased zzso zzso All 3 agents activated zzso protein zzso zzso and inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso II type 2 zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso significantly in 20 of the 25 zzso zzso examined zzso when compared with matching zzso zzso II type 2 zzso protein was localized in the zzso ducts and in the zzso zzso 

Our data demonstrate a previously unknown involvement of the zzso II type 2 zzso in pancreatic zzso zzso cell fatty acid synthesis and suggest that its blockade has potential as a novel zzso and zzso mechanism for human pancreatic zzso zzso through the zzso of zzso protein zzso which could have zzso effects on cancer cell zzso
