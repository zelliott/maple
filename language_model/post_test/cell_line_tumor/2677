zzso loss of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is an essential event for zzso transition zzso a process that allows cell migration during embryonic development and zzso zzso In most zzso zzso repression has emerged as the main mechanism responsible for zzso zzso Here, we report the identification of class I zzso factor zzso zzso as a new zzso zzso Both zzso of zzso zzso and zzso induce a full zzso when zzso in zzso cells but without affecting the zzso properties of parental cells, in contrast to other zzso zzso such as zzso or class I zzso zzso zzso repression zzso by zzso is indirect and independent of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso studies indicate that zzso expression is zzso for maintenance of the zzso driven by zzso and zzso Comparative zzso analysis reveals that zzso factors induce similar, yet zzso genetic programs to that induced by zzso in zzso zzso These results, together with the embryonic expression pattern of zzso and zzso (which encodes zzso support a distinct role for zzso and suggest an interesting interplay between zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso and pathological zzso zzso
