zzso therapy zzso is a combination of light with a zzso zzso or its precursor to destroy the zzso zzso zzso has recently become an established zzso for several zzso and zzso conditions, but it can be further improved through a better understanding of the zzso affecting its therapeutic zzso In the present investigation, zzso IX zzso an efficient zzso either zzso induced by zzso acid zzso or zzso zzso was used to correlate its zzso zzso pattern with zzso efficiency of human zzso zzso zzso zzso and normal zzso cell zzso By means of zzso zzso zzso zzso was initially localized in the zzso whereas zzso zzso was mainly distributed in cell zzso At a similar amount of cellular zzso zzso with zzso was significantly more efficient than zzso treatment with zzso zzso at killing all the 3 cell zzso zzso of zzso membrane potential and zzso zzso content, and electron zzso showed that the zzso were initially targeted by zzso consistent with zzso zzso pattern of zzso zzso zzso This indicates that zzso zzso pattern of zzso is an important zzso for its zzso efficiency in the 3 cell zzso Our finding suggests that future new zzso with zzso zzso properties may be designed for effective zzso
