The structural change of zzso and the generation of zzso reaction products zzso are important to the increase in the biological activities of zzso zzso This study was carried out to identify the zzso active component of zzso zzso using the zzso reaction model experiment with zzso Re and zzso zzso Re was gradually converted into zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso followed by separation of the zzso zzso at zzso The free zzso activity of the zzso zzso mixture was increased by zzso The improved free zzso activity by zzso was zzso by the generation of zzso from the reaction of zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso cell damage was also significantly reduced by treatment with zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso mixture zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso showed protective effects against zzso zzso zzso damage in rats through the zzso of zzso zzso
