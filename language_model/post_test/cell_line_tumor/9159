The zzso tumor zzso protein zzso plays a critical role in the control of cell proliferation and in the DNA damage zzso zzso zzso cell cycle progression through interactions with the zzso family of zzso zzso Here, we report that DNA damage induced not only the zzso of zzso at zzso zzso sites and the binding of zzso to zzso but also the zzso of zzso at zzso zzso of zzso at zzso enhanced the formation of a complex between zzso and zzso zzso of zzso with Ala decreased zzso binding and the zzso repression zzso Until now, zzso of zzso has been thought to be zzso by zzso However, the zzso of zzso at zzso was conducted by zzso after DNA damage, and zzso of zzso activity suppressed the zzso of zzso and the binding of zzso to zzso These results suggest that zzso is zzso by zzso after DNA damage, leading to the formation of zzso This is the first report that zzso is zzso in zzso by a zzso other than zzso
