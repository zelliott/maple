zzso zzso zzso zzso the degradation of zzso zzso fatty zzso and so on) and the zzso of numerous environmental zzso such as zzso and zzso aromatic zzso that are found in zzso Several zzso zzso and zzso acid derivatives enhance zzso zzso zzso activity, but the mechanisms involved remain zzso The aim of this work was to study the role of zzso zzso receptors in zzso zzso zzso gene zzso 

The role of zzso zzso zzso zzso factors in zzso zzso zzso induction was assessed by means of zzso activities, quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction, gene reporter zzso zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso 

We show that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso induce human zzso zzso zzso gene zzso whereas zzso a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The induction of zzso zzso zzso transcripts by zzso was associated with a marked increase of zzso O zzso activity zzso at 200 zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso complementary DNA enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induction by zzso although zzso failed to activate zzso responsive element zzso Two zzso zzso response element sites were located at positions zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Their zzso by directed zzso suppressed the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that the 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso response element sites bind the zzso zzso zzso X zzso zzso 

We describe here a new zzso zzso zzso induction zzso involving zzso zzso zzso and 2 zzso zzso response element sites, indicating that zzso zzso zzso zzso which are common environmental compounds, may be involved in zzso
