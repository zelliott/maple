zzso cancer is one of the most lethal zzso with an zzso zzso zzso It is a zzso group of zzso in which pancreatic zzso zzso is most zzso zzso cancer cannot be cured even if detected zzso When treatment is zzso a suitable method of administration of zzso drugs must be zzso zzso drugs kill tumor zzso However, side effects including initiation are problematic in zzso drug zzso zzso methods for the diagnosis of side effects of pancreatic cancer by using sensitive and specific tumor markers are highly zzso zzso efficient strategies for zzso discovery are urgently zzso Here, we present an approach based on direct experimental access to proteins released by zzso human pancreatic cancer cells zzso A two-dimensional zzso map and catalog of this zzso zzso termed the zzso were established zzso more than 1,000 proteins observed by zzso difference zzso zzso analysis using zzso zzso We investigated 22 spots that were zzso zzso and 31 spots that were zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso in these spots were identified by zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso time of flight mass zzso zzso Most zzso constituents were zzso cellular zzso By mass zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso protein zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding protein precursor were zzso Western zzso confirmed the presence of zzso zzso and zzso We found that zzso of zzso zzso was associated with zzso and zzso of zzso was found to suppress zzso
