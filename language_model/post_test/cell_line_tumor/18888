zzso region zzso and zzso zzso is a frequent cause of zzso zzso gene zzso zzso in many human zzso Previously, to identify candidate zzso zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso zzso we monitored changes in gene expression in four zzso cell lines after treatment with the zzso agent zzso This enabled us to identify zzso as a novel zzso zzso candidate zzso zzso To identify further candidate zzso we undertook zzso and molecular genetic evaluation of a further 60 genes zzso expressed after zzso In addition to zzso four genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso had previously been shown to undergo promoter zzso in zzso After zzso zzso expression and/or zzso analysis of zzso cell zzso zzso was performed for 34 zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in zzso cell lines and primary zzso however, 22 genes were zzso expressed after zzso but did not show primary zzso zzso zzso in normal tissue zzso zzso only in zzso cell lines zzso and not zzso in zzso cell lines zzso zzso of zzso reduced growth of an zzso cell line in zzso In a zzso a functional zzso analysis of four zzso cell lines using zzso representing 11 zzso human genes yielded both known and novel candidate zzso zzso zzso in zzso suggesting that this is valid strategy for the identification of novel zzso and zzso
