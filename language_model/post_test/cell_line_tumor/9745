The reduced expression in immortalized cells zzso zzso a member of the zzso gene family, is a tumor zzso in a broad range of zzso zzso zzso stable clones of mouse prostate cancer zzso cells zzso and the empty zzso control clone cells zzso were zzso zzso were used to evaluate the zzso effects and a zzso analysis of zzso continuous expression was zzso The zzso cells show a zzso appearance and the cell membrane shows irregular buds known as zzso In zzso cell proliferation was significantly suppressed in zzso clones in comparison to the zzso The zzso zzso was done under standard culture conditions and zzso showed a higher zzso of zzso The zzso and zzso cells were zzso implanted into a zzso mouse zzso After 2 weeks, the tumor growth was significantly inhibited in zzso cells in comparison to the zzso zzso gel zzso was used to examine the modification of protein expression by the gene zzso The analysis with mass zzso disclosed that expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were increased and zzso and zzso protein were decreased in zzso zzso zzso zzso stable zzso show a reduction of zzso in mouse prostate cancer zzso cells in zzso and in zzso The result of the zzso analysis might provide important clues to clarify the zzso molecular mechanism of zzso gene zzso
