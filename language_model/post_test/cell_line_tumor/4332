The zzso family of genes is largely studied because of their roles in development, differentiation and host cell zzso zzso however, roles in cancer biology are zzso Loss of zzso of the zzso locus in zzso of human zzso raised the possibility that this zzso containing member of the zzso gene family might be a zzso tumor zzso zzso with this, reducing zzso expression increased the zzso of and accelerated the development of zzso growth factor zzso zzso in zzso Furthermore, zzso can bind to the zzso inhibitor zzso Thus, we conclude that zzso is a tumor zzso mapping to zzso zzso and that it might block tumor growth by zzso zzso and preventing it from zzso the zzso of zzso zzso
