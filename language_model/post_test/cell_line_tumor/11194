The zzso activity of the combined root and stem of zzso zzso zzso was evaluated to justify its African zzso use in the management of zzso 

A zzso extract and its zzso zzso zzso zzso ) were tested for zzso and in zzso zzso abilities using zzso rats and zzso cells, zzso In zzso zzso activities for the significantly ( zzso active zzso A5 and A6 and in zzso zzso activity of the C1 fraction and its isolated constituents were also similarly zzso 

The extract zzso zzso had higher in zzso zzso activity than the individual A1 zzso , indicating a synergistic effect of the plant zzso Higher in zzso insulin release in response to A5 zzso zzso than A6 , agreed with their in zzso zzso activities and confirmed insulin release as a mechanism of action of the zzso Compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the extract and the A3 , A6 , and C1 (all at zzso zzso zzso significantly higher in zzso insulin release that was similar to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C1 yielded a zzso mixture of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and two unidentified zzso Y and zzso The zzso mixture zzso zzso demonstrated the highest zzso activity that was comparable zzso to that of zzso zzso zzso 

The results confirm pancreatic activity as a mechanism underlying the zzso action of zzso zzso and justify its zzso zzso
