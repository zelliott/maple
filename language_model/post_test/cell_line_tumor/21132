zzso zzso 6 zzso is a multifunctional, zzso protein zzso that primarily acts on zzso Here we report that stable zzso of zzso expression causes a decrease in the zzso level of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso in zzso lung cancer zzso The decreased levels of in zzso in zzso cells, which correlated with increased zzso of zzso were due to increased turnover of zzso zzso Despite the decrease in zzso levels, zzso cells lacking functional zzso appeared to grow zzso probably due to increased expression of zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso Indeed, zzso cells were more sensitive than control cells to the zzso inhibitor zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso combined with zzso of growth factor signaling may be useful as cancer zzso
