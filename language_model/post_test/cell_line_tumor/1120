We examined if a range of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso activated zzso calcium channels zzso zzso by the human zzso zzso zzso recordings were made from zzso cells zzso expressing human zzso calcium zzso zzso (an zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso with an zzso close to 10 zzso The zzso zzso zzso also inhibited these zzso with an zzso close to 1 zzso and produced an accompanying zzso zzso shift in the zzso zzso zzso Other structurally diverse zzso zzso zzso and zzso produced approximately 30 - zzso zzso of zzso zzso currents at 10 zzso zzso (10 zzso an zzso with zzso activity, inhibited these currents by 68 zzso zzso This zzso activity of zzso at zzso may contribute to some of the effects they produce both in zzso and in zzso
