The active zzso of vitamin D, zzso zzso zzso zzso the growth of several types of human cancer cells in zzso but its therapeutic use is limited because it causes zzso Among its zzso zzso zzso zzso has fewer zzso effects and exhibits an activity zzso to that of zzso We assessed the zzso and zzso effects of zzso in gastric cancer cells, and evaluated the potential role of vitamin D in the treatment of zzso zzso gastric zzso In this study, treatment with zzso inhibited gastric cancer cell growth and induced cell cycle zzso zzso also induced zzso and showed zzso zzso Moreover, the growth of zzso zzso in zzso was reduced in mice treated with zzso zzso zzso was significantly lower in the zzso group compared to control group zzso control group zzso zzso zzso vs zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor volume was significantly lower in zzso treated mice zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the vitamin D zzso zzso has zzso activity on gastric cancer cells by regulation of the cell cycle, zzso and zzso
