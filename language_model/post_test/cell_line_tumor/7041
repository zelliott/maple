The efficacy of zzso systems containing zzso agents may be assessed in zzso prior to evaluation of the effects of targeted and controlled drug release on tumor zzso zzso prepared in a size range suitable for zzso delivery to the lungs zzso zzso would be useful in the treatment of locally occurring zzso zzso serum zzso zzso containing zzso zzso median zzso were prepared by an emulsion technique with zzso zzso zzso was used to assess drug release in zzso zzso buffer pH zzso and zzso buffer pH zzso at 37 degrees zzso Sixty percent of the zzso load was released in a zzso burst at pH zzso An additional zzso was released up to 70 zzso Fifty percent of the drug was released in 70 h at pH zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were incubated with zzso in solution and in zzso suspension for 24, 48, and 72 h to evaluate zzso zzso cells were recovered in smaller numbers following treatment with zzso zzso than following treatment with zzso zzso The action of zzso on growth of zzso zzso zzso cells was enhanced in zzso by delivery in zzso A zzso reduction in the effective dose, at which the rate of cell death exceeds zzso was observed for zzso (5 zzso than for zzso alone (20 zzso zzso the zzso zzso exhibit potential for greater therapeutic effect than drug alone when evaluated in zzso Further studies are required to demonstrate the aerodynamic properties of these particles and efficacy in an in zzso tumor zzso
