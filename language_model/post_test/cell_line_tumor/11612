zzso treatments such as zzso therapy zzso are attractive zzso strategies because they zzso accessible tumor sites while simultaneously zzso zzso immune zzso However, the immune response following zzso zzso is often insufficient to treat zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso and zzso and promotes the maturation of zzso cells within zzso zzso zzso thereby zzso zzso T cell zzso zzso however, these zzso effects were not beneficial to overall zzso zzso We found that zzso promoted the zzso of secondary tumor sites by zzso zzso zzso cells, consequently failing to slow the growth of poorly zzso zzso tumors and enhancing the growth of distant lung zzso To exploit the beneficial effects of zzso activity against local tumors and on zzso immunity whilst avoiding the adverse consequences, we zzso transferred zzso zzso T cells following zzso The combination of local control by zzso and systemic zzso immune zzso provided by zzso transferred T cells prevented primary tumor recurrence zzso inhibited tumor growth at distant sites, and zzso the outgrowth of lung zzso zzso the combination of zzso and systemic zzso prevented the adverse effects of zzso on zzso tumor growth and zzso overall tumor zzso
