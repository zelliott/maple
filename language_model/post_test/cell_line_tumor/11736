zzso are the end structures of zzso in zzso zzso they play a pivotal role in maintaining the stability of the zzso and become shorter with each cell zzso However, several types of tumor cells express zzso in very high levels to overcome this crisis and achieve the ability to zzso zzso The zzso zzso can partly inhibit tumor cell proliferation and promote zzso but their roles are only zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which has synergistic effect on zzso and is expressed in lung cancer cells in high zzso In the present study, zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used as specific zzso to silence the expression of target genes in zzso human lung zzso cells by zzso The results showed that zzso and zzso suppressed the expression of zzso and zzso zzso both inhibited the activity of zzso and the combination group achieved better effect, but only zzso shortened the length of zzso zzso did zzso Further studies showed that zzso and zzso zzso zzso was not zzso by zzso of the expression of the zzso gene zzso or zzso of the expression of the zzso gene zzso but by adjusting the two zzso proportion of zzso cell zzso zzso which can interact with zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso increased more than zzso zzso which is an zzso zzso leading to zzso cell zzso and a similar result was obtained in nude mice in zzso The present study suggests that combination of the zzso of zzso and zzso can be used as a strategy for the treatment of lung cancer in zzso
