Clinical practice reveals that zzso women treated with zzso zzso show an increased bone mass density and a reduced risk of zzso However, the mechanisms leading to these beneficial effects of zzso are still poorly zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso zzso a potent third-generation zzso may induce the expression of proteins associated with the zzso potential of zzso cells such as zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene is zzso by hormones that promote bone formation and has been associated with de zzso bone zzso Using real-time reverse zzso and zzso analysis, we demonstrated that zzso increased zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso Nuclear zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed no effect at the zzso level but a stabilization of zzso transcripts in zzso zzso zzso effect on zzso expression occurred through an interference with the zzso zzso since it was reversed by either zzso zzso zzso or a zzso zzso zzso We showed that zzso impaired membrane zzso of zzso in zzso cells indicating reduced zzso of this zzso By the use of small interfering zzso directed to zzso and zzso we identified both zzso zzso as negative regulators of zzso expression in zzso zzso Our study demonstrates that zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells through zzso of zzso zzso and provides a potential mechanism to explain the zzso effects of zzso treatment on bone mass and zzso
