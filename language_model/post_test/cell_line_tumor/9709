We observed that two zzso cell lines from the same tumor displayed marked differences in their sensitivities to zzso therapy zzso with zzso acid zzso zzso zzso We investigated why these two closely related lines had different zzso sensitivities and whether the zzso zzso of the less sensitive cell line could be increased by a simultaneous application of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was used to evaluate the zzso zzso of zzso IX zzso a zzso product of zzso acid, in two human zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso treated with zzso zzso or zzso combined with zzso zzso + zzso With zzso cells treated with zzso zzso zzso were zzso with a light dose of zzso zzso from a zzso zzso With zzso + zzso the cells were treated as for zzso except that the temperature was raised to zzso degrees C during zzso 

At 6 h after zzso treatment, zzso cells carried about zzso more zzso than zzso zzso With zzso the survival rate for zzso cells treated with 80 zzso zzso was zzso while that for zzso cells treated with zzso zzso was below zzso With zzso + zzso the survival rate for zzso and zzso cells treated with 80 zzso zzso was zzso and zzso zzso 

A combination therapy zzso zzso + zzso treatment may be very useful for the treatment of tumors containing cells that are insensitive to zzso such as the zzso cell line described in this zzso
