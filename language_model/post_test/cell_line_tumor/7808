The precise sequence of events that enable zzso zzso to convert transforming growth zzso zzso from a tumor zzso to a tumor promoter remains incompletely zzso We show here that zzso inhibitor of zzso protein zzso is essential for the ability of zzso to stimulate nuclear zzso zzso in zzso zzso breast cancer zzso zzso whereas zzso suppressed zzso activity in normal zzso zzso cells, those engineered to zzso zzso demonstrated zzso of zzso when zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso expression also zzso the zzso and zzso zzso activities of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso physically with the zzso type I zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso facilitated the formation of complexes between zzso protein 1 zzso and zzso zzso beta that enabled zzso to activate zzso and to induce the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We further observed that zzso the zzso zzso zzso function of zzso or expressing a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso was capable of blocking zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso dramatically reduced the zzso of zzso to zzso in zzso cells as well as inhibited their expression of zzso markers in response to zzso More importantly, zzso zzso also zzso the formation of zzso zzso beta complexes in zzso breast cancer cells, thereby diminishing their zzso of zzso their expression of zzso zzso their invasion through synthetic basement zzso and their growth in soft zzso zzso our findings have defined a novel role for zzso in zzso zzso signaling by zzso in breast cancer zzso
