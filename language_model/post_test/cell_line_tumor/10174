In the present study, we have investigated the effect of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso induced a zzso decrease in zzso cell viability as well as a zzso increase in the zzso of the zzso zzso Looking deeper into the mechanisms involved, we found that zzso de zzso synthesis of the zzso zzso zzso that was blocked by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso of cells with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso partially prevented the zzso effect, the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso suggesting a zzso zzso zzso zzso B1 did not have any effect in the zzso zzso increase induced by zzso However, even an incomplete zzso of zzso not a total zzso zzso zzso zzso expression by specific zzso prevented the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso regulates zzso metabolism in prostate zzso cells which is involved in cell death as well as in zzso zzso Our findings also suggest that zzso zzso may offer a novel approach in the treatment of prostate cancer by decreasing cancer zzso cell zzso However, the interaction of prostate cancer cells with their zzso and in particular with the immune system in zzso needs to be further zzso
