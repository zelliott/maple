Two new zzso zzso zzso were isolated as trace components from a zzso collection of the marine zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso and zzso B zzso feature a zzso zzso warhead directly connected to either zzso zzso or zzso zzso Their structures were zzso on the basis of extensive zzso and zzso analyses and confirmed by total zzso which in turn provided more material for further biological zzso zzso zzso A and B were found to inhibit the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the low zzso zzso Additionally, they exhibited strong zzso to lung and colon cancer cell lines, as well as exquisite zzso effects in the zzso zzso zzso These zzso results as well as initial structural biology studies suggest a distinctive binding mode for these new zzso
