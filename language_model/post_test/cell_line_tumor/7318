The maintenance of zzso length is required for continued cell zzso and approximately zzso of human zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso show high activity of zzso In the present study we report that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso by zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso analysis shows that zzso decreases the level of human zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso The decrease is not due to zzso repression through the putative vitamin D response element present in the zzso regulatory region of zzso zzso Instead, zzso zzso decreases the stability of the zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso cells decreases their response to zzso growth zzso Although the cell cycle progression of these clones zzso expressing zzso is inhibited by zzso to a similar degree as that of the parental cells, these clones are more resistant to zzso induced by zzso zzso contrast to parental cells, which lose proliferation potential after the zzso treatment, zzso clones resume rapid growth after withdrawal of zzso Overall, the study suggests that the zzso of zzso activity by zzso and the resulting cell death are important components of the response of zzso cells to zzso growth zzso
