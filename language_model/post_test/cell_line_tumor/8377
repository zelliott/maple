In normal zzso states zzso zzso and activates zzso However, under zzso conditions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling by zzso insulin zzso zzso zzso at zzso The molecular basis for the differential effect of zzso signaling on zzso is poorly zzso Here, it has been shown that zzso of zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso and zzso suppresses zzso zzso of zzso at zzso and zzso zzso after long term insulin zzso This zzso depends on the zzso zzso axis but is zzso At the molecular level, zzso binds the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso and regulates the zzso of zzso at zzso by zzso zzso lacking the zzso domain does not interact with zzso is not zzso at zzso and favorably interacts with zzso zzso Overall, these data provide new insights in the molecular mechanisms by which zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling at the level of zzso and suggest that zzso signaling toward zzso is zzso
