zzso is a complex process involving zzso production to regulate host defense zzso In contrast to the therapeutic significance of acute zzso a zzso impact of chronic inflammation on cancer development has been zzso zzso of inflammatory zzso such as zzso and zzso has been noted in prostate cancer patients and zzso has been shown to promote prostate cancer cell proliferation and zzso however, it is not clear whether zzso regulates zzso expression in prostate cancer zzso zzso is widely regarded as an zzso agent and thus we hypothesized that if zzso activated zzso production in prostate cancer cells, then zzso ought to blunt such an zzso Three prostate cancer cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso were used to evaluate the effects of zzso and zzso on zzso expression using zzso and zzso zzso zzso elevated zzso zzso expression and subsequent zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso appeared to induce zzso cell proliferation by zzso zzso involvement of zzso in zzso zzso cell migration was demonstrated by zzso and zzso migration zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were used to pinpoint zzso but not zzso being involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of all zzso was notably suppressed by zzso We suggest that zzso can activate the zzso pathways resulting in an induction of zzso production, which promotes prostate cancer cell proliferation and zzso In this context, zzso appears to inhibit zzso zzso of zzso and therefore reduces zzso zzso this, in turn, zzso cell zzso
