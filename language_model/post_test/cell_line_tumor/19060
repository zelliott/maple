zzso zzso such as gene amplification, zzso and loss of zzso are hallmarks of cancer and are thought to be major contributors to the zzso zzso zzso cancer cell lines have been the primary in zzso and in zzso models for cancer for more than 2 zzso however, few such cell lines have been extensively characterized at the zzso zzso Here, we present a high-resolution zzso zzso zzso and gene expression analyses of five of the most commonly used zzso cell lines and compare the findings with those observed in 83 primary human zzso Although zzso zzso known to occur in primary tumors were identified in the cell lines, we also observed several novel zzso aberrations in the zzso cell lines that are not frequently represented in primary zzso Additionally, a global gene expression cluster distinct from primary tumors was identified in the zzso cell zzso Our results indicate that established cell lines are generally a poor representation of primary tumor biology, presenting a host of zzso and gene expression changes not observed in primary zzso although some discrete features of zzso biology were zzso in the established cell zzso zzso maps of genetic zzso and zzso divergence from the original tumor type, such as the one presented here, may help serve as a zzso for a more biologically rational and clinically relevant selection of the most appropriate zzso model for a given zzso
