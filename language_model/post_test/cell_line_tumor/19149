zzso short hairpin zzso zzso genetic screens in zzso cells are powerful tools for discovering zzso zzso We describe a highly parallel multiplex methodology for screening large pools of zzso using zzso zzso for zzso zzso We carried out dropout screens for zzso that affect cell proliferation and viability in cancer cells and normal zzso We identified many zzso to be zzso that target core cellular zzso such as the cell cycle and protein translation, in all cells zzso Moreover, we identified genes that are selectively required for proliferation and survival in different cell zzso Our platform enables rapid and cost-effective zzso screens to identify cancer proliferation and survival genes for target zzso Such efforts are complementary to the Cancer Genome zzso and provide an alternative functional view of cancer zzso
