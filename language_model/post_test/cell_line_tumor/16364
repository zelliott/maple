Eight zzso compounds, zzso including two new compounds, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were isolated from the zzso fraction of a zzso extract of zzso zzso zzso The structures of the new compounds were zzso on the basis of extensive zzso analyses and comparison with zzso Upon evaluation of compounds zzso on the zzso in zzso melanoma cells induced with zzso hormone zzso these compounds were found to exhibit zzso activities with zzso and zzso reduction of zzso content at 30 zzso and 100 zzso respectively, with no or almost no toxicity to the cells zzso of cell viability at 100 zzso Western zzso analysis showed that compound 7 reduced the protein levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso mostly in a zzso manner, suggesting that this compound zzso zzso on the zzso zzso melanoma cells by, at least in part, zzso the expression of zzso followed by decreasing the expression of zzso zzso and zzso
