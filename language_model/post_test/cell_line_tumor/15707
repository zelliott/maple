zzso zzso serves as a central integration point for signaling from cell surface receptors known to promote zzso zzso proliferation and zzso This provides a rationale for the development of small zzso zzso that selectively target zzso as a treatment approach for patients with zzso zzso We thus identified zzso zzso a highly selective and potent zzso small zzso inhibitor zzso effective concentration zzso zzso zzso Using tumor cell lines and primary patient samples representing multiple zzso zzso we have demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso zzso resulting in decreased zzso of zzso and other downstream zzso an increase in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and an induction of zzso These effects have been observed across a broad range of immature and mature zzso zzso thereby providing a rationale for the ongoing clinical evaluation of zzso
