zzso therapy zzso remains the front-line treatment for high-grade zzso however, tumor recurrence remains the main obstacle for the clinical success of zzso Using a zzso zzso tumor cell line, zzso the present study demonstrates that whole brain zzso prolonged the survival of zzso mice, although the mice eventually died associated with increased tumor zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso decreased the zzso density zzso of the primary tumor core, but increased the zzso of the tumor invasion zzso zzso also increased the number of zzso zzso zzso and the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at the tumor invasion zzso zzso expression suppressed by zzso zzso zzso showed a decrease in zzso tumor zzso leading to prolonged survival of mice bearing these zzso The invasion front in zzso tumors showed a lower zzso and zzso density than that in the islands of the control or zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso is one key factor in zzso tumor zzso and that it exerts its effect likely through zzso zzso and tumor zzso
