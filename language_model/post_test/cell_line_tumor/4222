zzso of zzso zzso was investigated using three zzso cell cultures of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Two major converted products were identified by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and X-ray zzso Two zzso systems, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell cultures, showed a great capacity of zzso and two zzso groups were attached at zzso and zzso positions in the side chain of the zzso zzso resulting in the formation of the same compound with a name, zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso zzso cell cultures possessed the ability to reduction at zzso of the zzso zzso resulting in the production of zzso zzso Furthermore, the in zzso zzso activities of the above compounds were evaluated by zzso zzso Compared with the zzso zzso product 3 possessed stronger zzso activity on the human breast cancer cell line zzso and slightly lower zzso activities against zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso while the zzso product 2 possessed much lower zzso activity on tumor cells lines, which might be related to the zzso of two zzso zzso zzso 2 and 3 were considered to be zzso It was also the first time to zzso zzso zzso by these three zzso which suggested the potential role of microbial zzso to zzso novel compounds from plant secondary zzso
