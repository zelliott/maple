In this study, we focused the effects of zzso an zzso isolated from the zzso of zzso zzso on various human cancer zzso zzso treatment was found to significantly inhibit the proliferation of human zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso human zzso cells zzso and zzso cancer cell lines zzso and zzso of which zzso cells were the most sensitive to its zzso In contrast, zzso caused much less toxicity in human normal zzso zzso Our results demonstrated that zzso zzso cell cycle arrest at zzso phase and this was associated with zzso of zzso A and zzso In addition, zzso induced zzso which was detected by observation of the membrane zzso exposure in flow zzso Its induction of zzso was accompanied by an increase in zzso of zzso zzso -9 and zzso zzso zzso and was attributable to the zzso of zzso proteins zzso zzso also decreased zzso membrane zzso Taken together, zzso exerts zzso effects on human cancer cells through the induction of cell cycle arrest at the zzso zzso and zzso Our results suggest that zzso is a promising new candidate as a zzso agent for cancer zzso
