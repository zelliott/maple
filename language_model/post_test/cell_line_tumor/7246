A high level of zzso zzso zzso is believed to be favorable in the prognosis and treatment of zzso zzso and breast zzso High levels of zzso have been shown to inhibit the growth and zzso zzso potential of breast cancer cell zzso To bring about these zzso effects, zzso probably acts through other cellular factors involved in the regulation of cell zzso 

To investigate the role of high levels zzso in growth zzso of zzso cancer zzso 

A human zzso zzso was zzso zzso in an zzso cancer cell line, zzso zzso zzso parent, and control zzso cells were grown in zzso and their growth rates were compared by cell zzso zzso and parent zzso cells were also grown in zzso as tumors in a chicken zzso membrane zzso model, and tumor growth and zzso was zzso Finally, levels of zzso factors, zzso oxide zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso were examined in relation to zzso zzso 

The growth of zzso cells was found inhibited in culture as well as in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso tumors was also found inhibited in zzso zzso zzso factor zzso was inhibited whereas the activity of zzso was found elevated following zzso zzso 

Our work on the zzso cell line indicates that high levels of zzso in zzso cancer may inhibit cancer growth by modulating zzso factors, thereby limiting the blood supply to the growing zzso Our results support the earlier data from other groups that have shown a positive correlation between high zzso content and better prognosis of zzso zzso
