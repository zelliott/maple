Bone tissue zzso in different ways to implant surfaces with different zzso The aim of this study is to understand which laser generated surface pattern produces the best cell zzso in zzso evaluating both the activity of the alkaline zzso and the cells adhering to titanium zzso Tests were carried out on titanium samples with zzso surfaces with zzso holes with diameters of 5, 10, and 20 zzso and on zzso titanium zzso without holes as zzso The samples were inserted into culture medium containing zzso cells for 3, 7 and 10 zzso The results showed that at days 3 and 7 the laser surfaces zzso a higher production of alkaline zzso zzso compared to the data from the control zzso At day 10 there were no significant differences between the test group and the control zzso
