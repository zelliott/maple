zzso zzso zzso plays a central role in oxygen zzso by inducing the expression of a broad range of genes in a zzso zzso Here, we show that the orphan nuclear zzso zzso is an important regulator of zzso Under hypoxic conditions, zzso protein and transcripts were induced in a zzso zzso When zzso was zzso introduced, it enhanced the zzso activity of zzso whereas the dominant negative zzso zzso abolished the function of zzso The zzso protein was greatly increased and completely localized in the nucleus when zzso with zzso The zzso zzso domain of zzso was required and sufficient for the zzso of zzso The association of zzso with von zzso protein was not affected, whereas that with mouse double minute 2 zzso was greatly reduced in the presence of zzso Further we found that the expression of zzso was zzso at zzso level in the presence of zzso as well as under hypoxic zzso Finally, zzso decreased zzso zzso stability and recovered zzso zzso indicating that the zzso zzso zzso zzso is critical in the zzso zzso of zzso Together, our results demonstrate a novel function for zzso in the stabilization of zzso and suggest a potential role for zzso in tumor progression and zzso
