Fine control of zzso signaling is essential for various cellular and zzso decision-making zzso However, deregulation of zzso signaling leads to pathological consequences, one of which is zzso Here, we identify a function of zzso a component of zzso DNA zzso in modulating zzso zzso zzso is specifically zzso in colon cancer cells and zzso stem cells and is required for colon cancer cell zzso In zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso developing a secondary axis with zzso target gene zzso Upon zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso from zzso and binds directly to zzso Then, zzso recruits zzso to the zzso zzso complex and specifically enhances zzso target gene zzso independently of zzso zzso zzso In mice, conditional expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso signaling zzso Our studies reveal an unexpected role of zzso in regulating zzso signaling and propose a regulatory mechanism of zzso signaling during zzso
