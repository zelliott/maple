To investigate the effect of zzso zzso gene expression towards the proliferation of zzso zzso cancer cells and its zzso to zzso 

The small interference zzso zzso fragments were designed and zzso into zzso cell lines by zzso zzso for choosing the best zzso zzso to silence zzso gene zzso The zzso zzso was used to construct the zzso zzso which was zzso into zzso cell line with expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and western zzso were employed to confirm the zzso efficacy of zzso The growth curve of cells, cell cycle, the zzso index of cells and zzso drug concentration were measured by zzso zzso flow zzso zzso and high performance zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso results showed that zzso zzso expression copy number in zzso zzso with zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso which was significantly lower than that in zzso zzso with other zzso fragments zzso zzso zzso respectively), and was zzso to construct the zzso zzso The zzso zzso expression was zzso in short hairpin zzso zzso cell lines that confirmed by western zzso zzso The growth curve showed that growth zzso of zzso cell lines was lower than that of zzso and zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso The results of zzso also showed that zzso of cells in zzso cell lines were in S + zzso phase, while only zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso cell lines respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso index of zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was lower than that in zzso and zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso statistically significant zzso zzso zzso zzso but there was not statistically significant difference in zzso drug concentration between zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso after treated by zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso gene resulted in slowing growth zzso and descending the zzso index of zzso cell lines, which may be related with descending in capability of DNA zzso repair in zzso
