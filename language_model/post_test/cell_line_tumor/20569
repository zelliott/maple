zzso zzso signaling at the cell surface is an zzso mechanism in a significant proportion of breast zzso While clinically effective therapies targeting zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso exist, tumors zzso zzso eventually progress despite zzso Thus, zzso of persistent zzso expression at the plasma membrane to zzso with current approaches may represent a novel therapeutic zzso 

We generated zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso mice with an zzso expressing human zzso and assessed their signaling effects in zzso and zzso effects in a zzso zzso In addition, we studied the signaling effects of human zzso zzso induced by zzso breast cancer patients with a zzso protein zzso 

zzso bound zzso at the plasma zzso initially zzso the downstream zzso zzso zzso protein zzso 1/2 and zzso but subsequently inducing zzso zzso in zzso pits in a zzso zzso manner, followed by zzso and degradation of zzso into a 130 zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso and zzso Following vaccination of breast cancer patients with the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso were zzso and these zzso bound to cell zzso zzso and inhibited zzso signaling through blocking zzso 877 zzso of zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso human zzso zzso induced by protein vaccination did not mediate zzso zzso and zzso 

These data provide new insight into zzso trafficking at the plasma membrane and the changes induced by zzso zzso zzso The reduction of zzso membrane expression and zzso signaling by zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso vaccines supports human clinical trials with this strategy for those breast cancer patients with zzso zzso zzso
