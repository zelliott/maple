To investigate the expression of zzso protein zzso during zzso and its dependency on zzso factor zzso zzso in pancreatic cancer cell zzso 

zzso pancreatic cancer cells were zzso zzso with zzso to zzso and zzso protein measured after growth in zzso or zzso In addition, zzso dependency was assessed by zzso zzso zzso pancreatic cancer cells with zzso with a zzso oxygen degradation domain resulting in stable zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso pancreatic cancer cells with low zzso zzso expression were zzso zzso with zzso and cell survival and response to platinum cancer agents were zzso zzso zzso was zzso to measure the expression of zzso and zzso 1 in human pancreatic cancer zzso 

zzso protein was induced during zzso in pancreatic cancer cells in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso cells resulted in a higher zzso zzso and increased sensitivity to zzso and zzso A negative correlation was observed between zzso and zzso 1 expression in human pancreatic cancer zzso 

zzso zzso a putative tumor zzso zzso is induced in response to zzso in a zzso manner in pancreatic cancer cells, resulting in increased zzso and increased sensitivity to platinum zzso zzso Increased zzso may be a mechanism to counterbalance the zzso effects of zzso
