Prior studies in breast cancer cells have shown that zzso and zzso interact in a greater than additive fashion to cause cell death and do so through a toxic form of zzso The present studies sought to extend our analyses to the central nervous system zzso tumor cells and to further define mechanisms of drug zzso zzso and zzso killed multiple zzso tumor zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso and zzso zzso on zzso 10) function were relatively resistant to drug combination zzso expression of zzso in zzso cells restored drug sensitivity, and zzso of zzso promoted drug zzso On the basis of zzso of zzso zzso leukemia viral zzso zzso zzso we discovered that the zzso of zzso receptors were most important for enhancing zzso zzso rather than zzso In zzso we noted in zzso tumor cells that zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso in an additive fashion to facilitate zzso zzso zzso of tumor cells with zzso enhanced the zzso of zzso to a greater extent than zzso zzso Treatment of animals carrying zzso zzso tumor zzso with zzso and zzso zzso Altogether, our data show that zzso and zzso therapy could be of use in the treatment of tumors located in the zzso
