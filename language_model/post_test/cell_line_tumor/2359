zzso a form of programmed cell death, is a critical zzso mechanism against the formation and progression of cancer and acts by eliminating potentially deleterious cells without causing such adverse effects, as inflammatory response and ensuing zzso zzso zzso targeting zzso pathways becomes an intriguing strategy for the development of zzso zzso In last decades, marine natural products, such as zzso have played an important role in the discovery and development of new zzso Interestingly, many of these compounds have a strong potential as zzso drugs by zzso cell proliferation and/or inducing cell zzso In the present study, we investigated the effects of zzso and zzso two zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso marine zzso on the zzso zzso zzso in three different human zzso zzso zzso were obtained by using DNA zzso comet and viability zzso zzso of the zzso zzso potential and Western zzso The zzso zzso breast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso colon zzso cells were incubated for 24 h with zzso or zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso or zzso for 24 h brought about a significant increase in DNA migration as well as zzso Moreover, incubation of zzso and zzso cells with zzso or zzso for 24 h caused an increased expression of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso or zzso added to zzso and zzso cells overnight, induced a significant and zzso loss of zzso zzso potential, an early zzso zzso zzso These effects paralleled with those achieved with zzso and zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso In conclusion, zzso and zzso by determining human cancer cell zzso may represent new promising compounds to inhibit cancer cell zzso
