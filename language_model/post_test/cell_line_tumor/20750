A zzso design approach has been applied to develop zzso as potential zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso A detailed kinetic analysis of zzso by these zzso zzso reveals that this class of compounds zzso a panel of protein zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso manner, consistent with the zzso modification of the zzso active zzso An zzso experiment in the presence of sodium zzso a known competitive inhibitor of protein zzso zzso indicated that these zzso were active site zzso This finding is consistent with the mass zzso analysis of the zzso modified protein zzso zzso zzso Additional experiments indicated that these compounds remained zzso toward other classes of zzso zzso and alkaline and acid zzso zzso experiments with human zzso lung cancer cell lines indicated that zzso zzso caused an increase in zzso zzso levels in a zzso manner thereby suggesting its zzso zzso Taken together, the newly identified zzso zzso could serve as a novel zzso for the development of zzso zzso and therapeutic agents against protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso
