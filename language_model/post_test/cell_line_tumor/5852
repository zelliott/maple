The zzso zzso coli zzso tumor zzso zzso between nucleus and zzso to perform distinct zzso Here we identify a specific role for zzso in the DNA replication stress zzso The zzso of zzso caused an zzso of zzso cells in early S phase and delayed S phase progression in cells released from zzso replication zzso zzso zzso revealed a selective binding of zzso to replication protein A zzso zzso zzso and the zzso complex increased at zzso after zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso prevented zzso at zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso forms of zzso and reduced the expression of zzso forms of zzso and zzso Using zzso cells we showed that zzso of zzso diminished the zzso delay caused by loss of zzso In contrast to full-length zzso the truncated zzso zzso protein expressed in zzso colon cancer cells was impaired in its binding and regulation of zzso and failed to regulate cell cycle after replication zzso We propose that zzso associates with zzso at stalled DNA replication zzso and promotes the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in response to DNA replication stress, thereby influencing the rate of re-entry into the cell zzso
