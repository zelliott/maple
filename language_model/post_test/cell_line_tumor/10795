zzso To collect an entire set of full-length zzso clones derived from human zzso cell lines and to identify full-length transcripts for retinal zzso expressed zzso zzso The full-length zzso libraries were constructed from a zzso cell line, zzso and a retinal zzso zzso cell line, zzso using the zzso method, which generates a genuine full-length zzso By zzso sequencing of the zzso of zzso clones and subsequent mapping to the human zzso the authors determined their zzso start sites and zzso the zzso zzso zzso Of the zzso clones isolated from zzso zzso libraries, zzso full-length zzso clones were identified and classified into zzso zzso including genes of zzso zzso Of the zzso genes obtained from the zzso and zzso libraries, the authors selected 72 genes that were zzso expressed in the eye, of which 131 clones corresponding to 57 genes were fully zzso As a result, we discovered many zzso that were produced by different zzso start sites, alternative zzso and alternative zzso zzso The zzso full-length zzso libraries constructed using the zzso method were shown to be useful for collecting an entire set of full-length zzso clones for these retinal cell zzso zzso zzso analysis of these zzso libraries revealed that there were, unexpectedly, many transcript zzso for each zzso indicating that obtaining the full-length zzso for each zzso is indispensable for analyzing its zzso The full-length zzso clones zzso zzso clones each for zzso and zzso will be useful as a resource for investigating the human zzso
