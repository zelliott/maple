zzso zzso is a gut zzso that plays an important role in gastrointestinal zzso zzso zzso and growth as well as the proliferation of zzso zzso positive zzso zzso of zzso is regulated by zzso zzso protein zzso C zzso zzso and zzso and may involve protein zzso D zzso The purpose of our present study was: zzso to define the role of zzso in zzso release from zzso zzso cells and zzso to delineate the upstream signaling mechanisms zzso this zzso Here, we demonstrate that small interfering zzso zzso targeted against zzso dramatically inhibited both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso release is significantly increased by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso attenuated zzso activity, whereas zzso of zzso and zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso effectively increased zzso zzso zzso protein inhibitor zzso dramatically inhibited both zzso zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, our results demonstrate that zzso zzso plays a central role in zzso zzso zzso upstream regulators of zzso include zzso and zzso and zzso zzso our results identify novel signaling zzso which culminate in gut zzso zzso
