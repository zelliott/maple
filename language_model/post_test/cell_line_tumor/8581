zzso growth factor zzso zzso 1 zzso is a potential therapeutic target for treatment of zzso zzso cell zzso zzso We investigated the zzso activity of zzso a novel therapeutic humanized zzso zzso in zzso zzso has been shown to inhibit in zzso zzso activity of zzso and has high affinity zzso of zzso zzso In human zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso inhibited zzso signaling and zzso In zzso the tumors in zzso mice or mice treated with zzso zzso continued their aggressive growth to reach the size of 2,000 zzso at which point the mice were zzso In contrast, treatment with zzso not only significant arrested further growth of the tumors zzso zzso zzso but also demonstrated differences in tumor volume compared with vehicle already on Day zzso A similar zzso activity of zzso was observed when the zzso was given in low (1 zzso or high (10 zzso doses zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso cell migration, zzso zzso structure and mature vessels zzso Administration of 10 zzso zzso for up to 35 days resulted in minimal body weight loss and no observations of gross toxicity were zzso zzso the data obtained with zzso are consistent with potent zzso of zzso zzso and tumor zzso zzso is being developed clinically as an intravenous therapy for the treatment of clear cell zzso
