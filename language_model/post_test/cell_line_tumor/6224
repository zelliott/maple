The ability to explore cell zzso and zzso communication is essential for understanding cell biology and developing effective zzso However, it is not yet possible to monitor the interaction of cells with their environments in real zzso Here, we show that a fluorescent sensor attached to a cell membrane can detect zzso molecules in the cellular zzso The sensor is an zzso (a short length of zzso zzso that binds to zzso growth factor zzso and contains a pair of fluorescent zzso When bound to zzso the zzso changes zzso and the zzso come closer to each other, producing a zzso The zzso which is zzso attached to the zzso of zzso stem cells, can zzso detect with high spatial and zzso resolution zzso that is added in cell culture medium or zzso by zzso zzso The engineered stem cells retain their ability to find their way to the bone zzso and can be monitored in zzso at the zzso level using zzso zzso
