We have evaluated the effects of zzso acid zzso treatment of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, which zzso differentiation into primitive zzso on gene expression zzso zzso cells were exposed to zzso in culture, and global expression patterns were examined with zzso zzso at early (8 zzso and later times (24 zzso after zzso Of the zzso known transcripts zzso we identified 57 genes zzso that were responsive to zzso at 8 and/or 24 zzso 35 were zzso 20 were zzso and 2 were zzso regulated at these time zzso To determine if our results were dependent on the array technology zzso we also evaluated the response to zzso at 24 zzso with zzso zzso With these more dense zzso zzso zzso we identified an additional 353 zzso genes zzso 173 were zzso and 180 were zzso Thus, a total of 410 genes regulated by zzso were identified with roughly equivalent numbers induced or zzso Although the expression of many genes found on both array platforms was consistent, the results for some genes were zzso zzso zzso studies on a subset of these genes supported the results obtained with the zzso zzso Our results confirmed the regulation of several known zzso genes and we also identified a number of genes not previously known to be zzso Those novel genes that were induced presumably contribute to the cellular processes required for a shift from proliferation to zzso whereas those new genes that were zzso may possibly contribute to the maintenance of cell zzso
