The aim of the study was to zzso some new compounds with potential zzso activity, containing zzso and zzso zzso zzso as zzso The obtained derivatives were evaluated regarding their biological activity zzso and zzso as well as their influence on the zzso cell zzso The results suggested that the newly obtained derivatives of zzso exhibited different biological activities, depending on their zzso thus, the most active compound in terms of zzso and zzso tuberculosis effects proved to be the zzso acid zzso This compound also increased the expression of zzso and zzso zzso which are implicated in the metabolism of the zzso demonstrating that it could be rapidly zzso and thus well zzso The largest spectrum of zzso activity zzso zzso zzso was noticed for the zzso acid zzso which was also the most zzso especially at high zzso although not significantly affecting the cellular cycle zzso The obtained results showed that the new derivatives could represent potential candidates for the treatment of zzso tuberculosis infections, but further research is needed in order to improve their pharmacological properties, by increasing their zzso activity and reducing the risk of zzso
