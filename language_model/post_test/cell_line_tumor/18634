zzso zzso factors have been linked to cell growth regulation and zzso in a number of zzso In the zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso is limited to zzso zzso cells, indicating a zzso zzso zzso with this role, we demonstrate that expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enhances colony formation, zzso D1 transcription, and cell zzso However, in contrast to these effects in zzso cells, zzso reduced colony number, failed to enhance zzso D1 transcription, and was zzso correlated with cell growth in colon cancer cell zzso The relationship between tumor progression and zzso was further investigated using zzso transformation of zzso and zzso cells as zzso zzso zzso zzso differences in the effects of zzso on cell growth and zzso D1 transcription, providing a direct link between zzso tumor progression and altered function of zzso zzso also markedly zzso zzso further analysis indicated that reduced expression of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso protein occur in zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso were also detected in zzso mouse and human familial zzso zzso zzso compared with normal zzso zzso indicating that zzso of zzso is an early event in zzso zzso in zzso zzso these data indicate that zzso tumor progression is associated with a change in the zzso functions of zzso and that zzso tumors zzso zzso expression by multiple zzso
