In zzso zzso loss of zzso zzso is a predictor of good prognosis and treatment zzso In contrast, in zzso zzso zzso of zzso 3 has been linked to poor prognosis and zzso of zzso In the present study, we have analyzed the expression of zzso proteins zzso to characterize zzso of zzso and their zzso features and to correlate with other molecular markers including zzso of zzso zzso from patients with primary zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso zzso in zzso zzso and fluorescent in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and total zzso expression levels were associated with high-grade zzso zzso and zzso zzso In grade III zzso the zzso levels were significantly higher zzso Low zzso zzso zzso expression was associated with grade II zzso zzso zzso expression was associated with grade zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tumors were more frequently found in grade zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso was associated with zzso zzso In addition, a higher zzso expression correlated with zzso of zzso zzso this was also tested in two zzso cell zzso MSP was successful in only six zzso No significant correlations were found for the other zzso In conclusion, in zzso tumors, zzso appeared as a surrogate marker of zzso of zzso which could also help to predict the disease zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso correlated with zzso zzso suggesting that these markers could predict the disease outcome and the response to zzso
