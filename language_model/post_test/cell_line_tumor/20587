zzso of zzso signaling appear to be involved in the zzso of zzso presenting zzso of zzso zzso coli zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso factor zzso However, the precise role of zzso zzso in the bone cancer progression remains zzso We previously showed that zzso factor zzso zzso are responsible for the repression of zzso a key zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso cells, suggesting a role of zzso signaling in zzso In this study, we investigated the functional relationship between zzso zzso signaling and zzso in these zzso To this goal, we selected resistant zzso cells from sensitive human cell lines using repeated zzso to zzso In zzso but not in zzso cells zzso expression was zzso by zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso restored the sensitivity to zzso in zzso zzso We found that zzso induction by zzso is zzso box protein zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in increased zzso expression in sensitive and zzso zzso zzso modulated zzso binding on zzso gene promoter and induced zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso impaired zzso induction by zzso indicating that zzso signaling is competing with the action of the zzso zzso However, zzso was also found to be required for zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso protein 1 zzso altered zzso action in sensitive cells, whereas zzso of zzso activity strongly decreased cell viability and increased sensitivity to zzso in sensitive and resistant zzso zzso zzso also increased the effect of zzso treatment in an zzso bone tumor model in zzso Altogether, these data provide evidence that the repression of zzso by zzso signaling contributes to the resistance of zzso cells to zzso and suggest that zzso zzso may represent a novel therapeutic strategy in zzso
