zzso zzso zzso is the major zzso event in Alzheimer's disease zzso believed to be responsible for synaptic dysfunction and zzso cell zzso However, the zzso activity of zzso peptides remains zzso zzso might not only play a toxic role, but also act as a functional signaling zzso We recently reported that zzso promotes zzso zzso through the zzso of the zzso zzso Here, we show that the zzso increase in zzso expression is accompanied by a decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and activity in different cellular models such as zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso We also found that the increase in zzso and the decrease in zzso are related events and depend on zzso zzso thus, zzso is able to activate zzso zzso and the zzso with a pharmacological zzso able to block the nuclear zzso of the zzso unit zzso almost completely prevents both the decrease in zzso and the increase in zzso zzso In addition, the decrease in zzso activity interferes with the zzso degradation of zzso as demonstrated by the decrease in zzso D activity and the partial zzso of zzso in zzso after zzso treatment as well after zzso zzso In support of the in zzso data, we observed low protein levels of zzso associated with high protein levels of zzso in sporadic zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso could be an attractive target for the development of new therapeutic approaches for zzso
