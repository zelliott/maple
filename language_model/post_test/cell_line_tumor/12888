Sensitive detection and characterization of circulating tumor cells zzso could revolutionize the approach to patients with zzso and zzso zzso The current zzso have significant limitations, including limited capture efficiency and ability to characterize captured zzso Here, we report the development of a novel zzso membrane zzso portable zzso for zzso isolation with high recovery rate and direct zzso characterization of captured zzso from human peripheral zzso 

We evaluated the sensitivity and efficiency of zzso capture in a model system using blood samples from healthy donors spiked with tumor cell zzso zzso model system samples were tested to determine the recovery rate of the zzso Moreover, 10 model system samples and 57 blood samples from cancer patients were subjected to both membrane zzso device and zzso platform zzso for direct zzso 

Using the model system, the zzso achieved zzso recovery with probability of zzso recovering at least one cell when five are seeded in zzso zzso of zzso zzso were identified in 51 of 57 patients using the zzso compared with only 26 patients with the zzso zzso When zzso were detected by both methods, greater numbers were recovered by the zzso device in all but five zzso 

This zzso zzso is both a capture and analysis platform, capable of zzso imaging and genetic zzso The zzso presented here has the potential to enable routine zzso analysis in the clinical setting for the effective management of cancer zzso
