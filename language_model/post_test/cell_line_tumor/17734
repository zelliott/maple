Both stem cells and cancer cells are thought to be capable of unlimited zzso Paradoxically, however, some zzso seem to contain zzso cells zzso stem zzso To help resolve this paradox, we investigated whether established zzso cell lines, which have been maintained for years in culture, contain a zzso of stem zzso In this article, we show that many cancer cell lines contain a small side population zzso which, in many normal zzso is thought to contain the stem cells of the zzso We demonstrate that in the absence of serum the combination of basic zzso growth factor and zzso growth factor maintains SP cells in the zzso zzso cell zzso Moreover, we show that zzso SP cells, but not zzso cells, can generate both SP and zzso cells in culture and are largely responsible for the in zzso zzso of this cell zzso Finally, we provide evidence that zzso SP cells can produce both zzso and zzso cells in zzso and in zzso We propose that many cancer cell lines contain a minor zzso of stem cells that is enriched in an SP, can be maintained indefinitely in culture, and is crucial for their zzso
