zzso zzso have a distinctive ability to zzso the brain zzso and disrupt the neural zzso zzso that zzso zzso of zzso and normal neural zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are among the major zzso components in the neural zzso but surprisingly, some are zzso in zzso and act as zzso zzso In the normal brain, zzso are thought to associate with zzso acid and zzso such as the zzso and link proteins to form the zzso zzso Here, we examined for the first time the expression of link proteins in human brain and zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso and zzso are the zzso members of this family in the adult human brain but are strongly reduced in the tumor zzso To test if their absence was related to a zzso gain of function of zzso we expressed zzso in zzso cells in combination with the zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso increased zzso cell zzso and migration and even zzso the zzso effect of zzso Further characterization revealed that zzso expressed in zzso cells was largely soluble and did not reproduce the strong, zzso association of the native protein to brain zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggest that the tumor zzso is rich in zzso that are not associated to zzso and could instead interact with other zzso zzso proteins produced by zzso zzso This zzso may contribute to changes in the zzso scaffold caused by invasive zzso zzso
