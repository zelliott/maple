zzso is a childhood cancer derived from immature cells of the sympathetic nervous zzso The disease is clinically heterogeneous, ranging from zzso differentiated benign zzso to aggressive zzso zzso with poor zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is a well established poor zzso factor found in up to zzso of high risk zzso zzso cell lines to study zzso differentiation in zzso is now well zzso Several zzso including exposure to various agents and growth factors, will differentiate zzso cell lines into zzso zzso These cells are characterized by a zzso zzso with long extensively zzso zzso and expression of several zzso zzso 

In this study we use zzso delivered zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to knock down zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso cell zzso By addition of the zzso zzso we show that the Kelly and zzso zzso cell lines efficiently differentiate into zzso cells with an extensive network of zzso These cells are further characterized by increased expression of the zzso differentiation markers NFL and zzso In addition, we show that induced expression of zzso delivered zzso zzso zzso cell proliferation by increasing the fraction of zzso zzso cells in the zzso phase of the cell cycle and that the zzso growth potential of these cells was also dramatically zzso 

We have developed an efficient zzso in zzso model system to study zzso differentiation in zzso zzso
