zzso is a solid tumor often diagnosed in zzso While there have been intense efforts to develop a treatment for zzso current therapies remain unsuccessful due to high rate of resistance and zzso Most zzso originate from a subset of zzso cells, primarily cancer stem cells zzso which establish a tumor through continuous zzso and zzso The successful elimination of zzso is an important goal in the development of effective strategies to achieve complete zzso for zzso Although zzso has been associated with several zzso mechanisms, the efficacy of zzso against zzso remains zzso In the present study, zzso was shown to reduce cell growth and induce zzso cell zzso zzso with a marked increase in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso More importantly, zzso inhibited zzso characteristics of zzso and decreased expression of several stem cell zzso zzso of zzso and protein of zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso were zzso following treatment with zzso In addition, zzso of zzso by zzso enhanced the zzso effect of zzso on colony formation of zzso zzso zzso also zzso the effect of zzso on the zzso characteristics of zzso in zzso revealing that zzso has the capacity to zzso cells to zzso zzso by directly targeting zzso In conclusion, zzso was shown to strongly increase the zzso efficacy against zzso cancer zzso zzso Moreover, these results suggest that the targeting of zzso is a novel mechanism of zzso Thus, zzso is a potential zzso zzso for this zzso
