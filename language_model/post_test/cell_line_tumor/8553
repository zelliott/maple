A small population of cells known as zzso cells zzso which have the capacity to zzso zzso and form tumors at high frequency, has a potential role in tumor zzso zzso and zzso In human breast zzso zzso are identified by surface zzso such as zzso and zzso and an zzso zzso based on zzso zzso activity zzso using flow zzso However, the usefulness of surface markers zzso and zzso and zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso remains largely zzso We attempted to identify zzso and zzso cells using 8 zzso zzso zzso cell lines, including zzso which was obtained from a primary zzso and the capacity to generate tumor zzso was analyzed in zzso mice injected with zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso cells were detected in all cell lines derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso transplantation into zzso mice demonstrated that as few as 1 zzso zzso zzso cells could initiate tumor growth in 1 out of 4 mice, while 1 zzso zzso zzso cells initiated tumor growth in 5 out of 6 zzso However, 1 zzso zzso zzso cells failed to initiate tumors in all the tested zzso zzso tumors contained both zzso and zzso cells, indicating that zzso zzso cells had higher zzso than zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may exist in zzso zzso zzso and further characterization of zzso and zzso cells is needed to define novel therapies targeted against zzso This study provides the foundation for zzso the contribution of zzso in zzso
