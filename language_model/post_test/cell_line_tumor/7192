The tumor zzso protein zzso is emerging as a central regulator of zzso zzso zzso processes and DNA zzso zzso may zzso zzso through multiple mechanisms including the reported associations with the zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso Here, we investigated whether the interaction of zzso with human replication protein A zzso is necessary for the regulation of zzso By employing a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso lung zzso cells, we studied the zzso properties of a panel of zzso zzso which varied in their ability to interact with zzso Both zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso and prevented zzso binding to zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso that specifically disrupt the zzso domain, while not compromising zzso zzso function zzso and zzso did not affect zzso zzso of zzso was also not seen with zzso zzso in the zzso core domain zzso and zzso which retained the ability to interact with zzso suggesting that the disruption of additional binding interactions of zzso for example, with zzso or zzso zzso also impacts on zzso We zzso that zzso of zzso by zzso at the sites of zzso is one means by which zzso can inhibit zzso zzso Our data support and extend the previously formulated zzso zzso of zzso role as zzso of the zzso
