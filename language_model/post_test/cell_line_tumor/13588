zzso acid zzso interacts with at least six G zzso zzso zzso zzso Recently, it has been demonstrated that each zzso zzso acts as a positive or negative regulator of cellular zzso In the present study, to assess a biological role of zzso receptors on cell migration of pancreatic cancer cells, we generated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells from zzso pancreatic cancer cells by zzso with short hairpin zzso plasmids and measured their cell zzso and invasive zzso In cell zzso and invasion zzso a Cell Culture zzso coated with or without a zzso was zzso While the cell zzso and invasion of zzso zzso cells were markedly enhanced than those of control cells, zzso zzso cells showed significantly lower cell zzso and zzso Moreover, to investigate an involvement of zzso and zzso in the development of pancreatic zzso we also measured the expression levels of zzso and zzso genes in zzso pancreatic duct zzso zzso induced by a zzso zzso The expressions of zzso gene in zzso were significantly lower than those in normal pancreatic zzso By contrast, the elevated expressions of zzso gene were detected in zzso We thus demonstrate that zzso and zzso play the different roles on cell migration ability of pancreatic cancer cells, suggesting the opposite effects via zzso and zzso may contribute to the zzso of pancreatic zzso in zzso
