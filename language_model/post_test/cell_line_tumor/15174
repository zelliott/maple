zzso zzso zzso is the second leading cause of zzso deaths zzso The regulator of zzso signaling 5 zzso has been reported to be highly expressed in some zzso zzso However, its expression and role in zzso has not been zzso 

The expression of zzso was examined in liver cancer zzso and cell lines by real-time quantitative zzso The cell migration and invasion was investigated by wound healing and zzso invasion zzso The zzso transition markers were detected by Western zzso or zzso 

We observed that zzso is zzso in most of liver cancer tissue samples and cell lines compared with matched normal zzso Further analysis showed that the zzso of zzso is associated with liver cancer zzso zzso zzso and patients' poor zzso Next, we found that zzso of zzso significantly zzso liver cancer cell migration and invasion in highly invasive liver cancer zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso of zzso zzso zzso transition in zzso liver cancer zzso 

These results indicate that zzso of zzso promotes tumor zzso by inducing zzso transition in zzso
