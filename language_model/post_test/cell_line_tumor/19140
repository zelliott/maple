zzso zzso derive from zzso and its zzso They are formed zzso in humans and zzso and occur zzso zzso in cooked meat and tobacco zzso They have been detected in human brain, zzso fluid, and zzso Up to now they were predominantly identified as compounds exhibiting zzso zzso Since significantly higher amounts are present in zzso patients, they are regarded as potential zzso factors in Parkinson's zzso We identified for the first time a BC zzso zzso exerting zzso and zzso zzso Treatment of primary zzso zzso cultures with zzso inhibited the zzso release of zzso zzso and reduced the number of cells stained with zzso zzso zzso activity was zzso the total protein content was unchanged and zzso content was zzso Furthermore, the expression of zzso genes was zzso The number of differentiated zzso zzso was significantly increased and a wide array of zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and marker genes zzso zzso zzso decisive for zzso differentiation was zzso zzso the zzso content was slightly, although zzso increased and the zzso zzso capacity was zzso An zzso effect was observed in human zzso zzso cells which is consistent with a reduced incorporation of zzso into the DNA of primary zzso zzso Whether the additional zzso zzso in primary culture derive from zzso precursor cells, previously zzso zzso negative zzso zzso or are the result of a zzso process remains to be zzso
