This study was conducted as a part of the zzso Human zzso Project zzso of the Human zzso zzso The United States team of zzso is focused on characterizing the zzso genes in zzso zzso Despite its small size, zzso 17 is rich in zzso zzso it contains many zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso The goal of this study was to examine the zzso zzso expressed in three zzso expressed breast cancer zzso models of zzso breast zzso by zzso zzso and zzso mass zzso zzso The cell lines represent distinct zzso variations zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inflammatory breast zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inflammatory breast zzso We identified more than one zzso zzso for zzso genes expressed in at least one of the three cancer cell zzso We found multiple zzso of genes that are in the signaling pathways downstream of zzso along with zzso specific to one cancer cell line compared with the other two cancer cell lines and with normal zzso zzso The overall transcript profiles based on read counts indicated more similarities between zzso and zzso The zzso Gene zzso and zzso pathways for the zzso specific zzso pointed to distinct key mechanisms zzso zzso sugar zzso zzso activity, and zzso in zzso different aspects of zzso especially of lipids in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso control in zzso The analyses indicated an enrichment in the electron transport chain processes in the zzso zzso cell line models and an association of zzso zzso zzso zzso and translation processes with the zzso models, zzso and zzso zzso experimental studies on the distinct zzso identified from each of these three breast cancer cell line models that may open opportunities for drug target discovery and help unveil their specific roles in cancer progression and zzso
