The parameters critically influencing the delivery rate on the zzso zzso zzso zzso laser zzso are investigated in detail with the aim of developing efficient molecular zzso Cell membrane was zzso by the zzso of zzso focused zzso laser zzso to the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso to the cell zzso The delivery of zzso zzso and fluorescent zzso particles to zzso cells is investigated in zzso The increase in the number of zzso laser zzso had resulted in the increase of delivery zzso The delivery rate depends on the size and zzso of fluorescent zzso particles in which zzso particles of 100 zzso in diameter were able to be delivered into zzso of the zzso cells, suggesting that the pore sizes are large enough for the delivery of therapeutic agents into zzso These findings contribute to the development of an efficient and safe zzso and drug zzso
