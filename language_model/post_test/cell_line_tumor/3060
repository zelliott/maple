Despite the fact that zzso zzso exhibits important biological activities related to tumor growth and zzso little is known about the regulation of its zzso In the present work, the effect of serum on zzso expression and zzso in the culture medium of human zzso vein zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells was zzso 

The protein levels of zzso were estimated by Western zzso and pin zzso was estimated by measuring zzso activity of a reporter gene zzso carrying the zzso or zzso full length promoter of the zzso zzso 

zzso induced zzso protein zzso in both types of cells and zzso zzso activity of the zzso promoter in a zzso and zzso zzso Use of a zzso construct that lacked the serum response element zzso showed that zzso zzso activity was partially abolished in zzso but not affected in zzso zzso zzso with a construct zzso at both zzso binding sites led to complete zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in both types of zzso 

The two zzso binding sites of the zzso promoter are involved in the serum stimulation of its zzso while zzso involvement seems to be partial and cell zzso
