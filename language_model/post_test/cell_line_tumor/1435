zzso is involved in numerous zzso processes such as growth, zzso and function of the male and female zzso zzso In the developing brain, zzso signaling has been linked to cognitive functions, such as learning and zzso however, the molecular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are poorly zzso We have previously shown a link between zzso zzso and zzso zzso when we studied the functional interactions between the zzso candidate protein zzso and the zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here, we investigate the zzso zzso regulation of zzso zzso 1 candidate 1 zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso not zzso binds to a zzso active zzso region upstream of zzso zzso start site and that zzso expression is enhanced by zzso in a zzso cell zzso This regulation is dependent on zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso recruitment to this zzso In addition, we describe that a single zzso zzso previously shown to be associated with zzso and located in the zzso region of zzso may alter the zzso and zzso regulation of this zzso Our data provide important molecular insights into the relationship between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
