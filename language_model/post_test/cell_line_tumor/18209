The zzso factor zzso is commonly zzso in zzso cell zzso of the head and neck zzso By zzso analysis of zzso zzso cells we identified zzso genes whose expression relies on zzso of zzso More than zzso of these genes are involved in cell zzso zzso zzso and reporter zzso revealed zzso and zzso as direct zzso zzso zzso In addition to zzso most of the key cell zzso molecules are zzso by zzso such as zzso and zzso Our findings indicate a contribution by zzso in cell invasion and migration, supporting an zzso role for zzso in zzso
