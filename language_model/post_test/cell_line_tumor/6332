zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits potent zzso activity via membrane receptors on cancer cells without deleterious zzso for normal zzso Unfortunately, like many other cancer types, breast cancer cells develop resistance to zzso therefore, zzso agents are currently being zzso In this study, we report that zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso compound with zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso human breast cancer cells and zzso zzso to undergo zzso In zzso zzso reduces the viability of cancer cells by inducing cell cycle arrest in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso efficiently zzso zzso and zzso cells but not zzso human zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso as evidenced by enhanced zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso From a zzso standpoint, we show that zzso zzso the expression of TRAIL receptors zzso but not zzso on both zzso and protein levels in a zzso zzso Moreover, zzso treatment also suppresses zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso pathways by preventing zzso zzso degradation and zzso nuclear zzso zzso the combined administration suppresses zzso proteins zzso regulated by zzso In zzso zzso and TRAIL are well tolerated in mice, and their combination significantly zzso the growth of zzso zzso and promotes zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso by dual treatment were also observed in zzso zzso Overall, zzso zzso resistant breast cancer cells to zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso These findings provide strong evidence for the therapeutic potential of this combination against breast zzso
