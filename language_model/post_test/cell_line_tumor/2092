To explore the relationship between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso signaling pathways in the expression of zzso zzso gene G zzso 

Acute zzso leukemia cell line zzso and signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso The protein levels of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells were detected by Western zzso The culture zzso of zzso cells treated with zzso for different time or zzso cells zzso with zzso regulatory factor zzso were respectively zzso And the concentration of zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso The effects of zzso cell culture zzso on the zzso of zzso and the expression of zzso were detected by Western zzso 

The level of zzso was obviously zzso in zzso cells treated with zzso for 72 hours, as well as the concentration of zzso in culture zzso The concentration of zzso increased from zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso After a zzso treatment, the concentration of zzso was up to zzso zzso zzso zzso And these culture zzso could induce the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso the protein level of zzso As for zzso cells zzso with zzso the concentration of zzso from the culture zzso also increased zzso versus the control group zzso with empty zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso gene expression is closely correlated with the zzso between zzso and zzso signaling zzso zzso increases the zzso of zzso by zzso the protein level of zzso Then the zzso zzso may induce the zzso of zzso and reinforce the expression of zzso
