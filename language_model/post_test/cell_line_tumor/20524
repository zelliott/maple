zzso has been proposed as one of the primary mechanisms for cellular entry of zzso peptides zzso and their zzso However, a major limitation of zzso zzso is zzso of the zzso in zzso zzso from which the cargo must escape into the zzso to exert its biological zzso Here we demonstrate that a zzso zzso with an zzso fusion zzso derived from the influenza virus zzso zzso remarkably enhances the zzso delivery of proteins in human zzso zzso To determine the zzso effects, zzso DNA plasmids containing coding sequences of zzso zzso and red fluorescent proteins zzso were zzso The fusion proteins were zzso from zzso zzso coli, and their effects on protein zzso were examined using live cell imaging and flow zzso Our data indicate that zzso is the major route for cellular zzso of zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that the zzso zzso zzso dramatically zzso zzso protein entry through the release of zzso zzso from zzso into the zzso Furthermore, incorporating the zzso fusion zzso of the zzso fusion protein improved zzso zzso without causing zzso These findings strongly suggest that the zzso tag could be an efficient and safe carrier that overcomes zzso zzso of delivered therapeutic zzso
