zzso zzso zzso and the activities of zzso zzso are reduced in Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso In this study, we analyzed the relationship between zzso zzso zzso and zzso precursor protein zzso processing in both cellular and animal models of zzso In zzso zzso cells zzso zzso TD promoted maturation of zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and increased zzso activity which resulted in elevated levels of zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso An inhibitor of zzso efficiently reduced zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso supplementation reversed the zzso zzso Furthermore, TD treatment caused a significant zzso of zzso oxygen species zzso antioxidants suppressed zzso production and maturation of zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso enhanced zzso production of zzso A study on mice indicated that TD also caused zzso zzso in the brain, which was reversed by zzso zzso Taken together, our study suggests that TD could enhance zzso generation by promoting zzso activity, and the zzso of zzso subsequently exacerbated zzso zzso zzso
