The design, synthesis and in zzso activities of a series of zzso nitrogen mustard zzso zzso of zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso has been replaced by zzso of different zzso features are zzso and the zzso relationships are zzso In spite of the relevance of these modifications on the zzso zzso these derivatives showed significant growth zzso activity against mouse leukemia zzso zzso A selected series of compounds have been evaluated for their sequence selective zzso properties and zzso against human zzso leukemia zzso zzso the presence of the zzso zzso and in general of a basic zzso is not an absolute requirement for biological zzso Our preliminary results indicated that the compounds of this series have a pattern of zzso similar to that of zzso but they seem to be less zzso overall in zzso naked zzso
