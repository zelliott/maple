zzso can suppress the growth of various tumor cells including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso plays a critical role in zzso and development of zzso zzso However, the effect of zzso on zzso signaling zzso remains zzso Thus, we investigated the effect of zzso on zzso signaling zzso in human zzso cancer cell zzso The results of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso zzso showed that zzso inhibited growth, induced zzso and arrested the zzso cell cycle of zzso cells in a zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso and zzso 13 genes and 17 genes in zzso signaling using zzso zzso Furthermore, as evidenced by western zzso zzso protein level zzso whereas zzso zzso protein level increased under zzso The present study reveals that zzso can inhibit human zzso cancer cell growth through zzso of zzso signaling zzso
