The zzso zzso A zzso has been shown to exert potent zzso effects, possibly via the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso transition pore zzso Here, we investigated the zzso profile of a novel zzso of zzso zzso by evaluating its effects against in zzso zzso damage and in zzso brain damage in transient global or focal cerebral zzso models, in comparison with those of zzso zzso of zzso zzso was estimated from its zzso effect on the mixed zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso effect of zzso was approximately zzso less potent than that of zzso In contrast, zzso suppressed zzso zzso swelling measured in isolated liver zzso with greater potency than zzso Further, zzso showed approximately zzso greater zzso potency than zzso against zzso cell damage induced by zzso in zzso zzso In a transient global cerebral zzso model in zzso zzso showed the zzso suppression of zzso cell death, while zzso was less zzso than zzso In a rat transient focal zzso model, zzso tended to reduce brain damage on both intravenous injection as well as zzso infusion, but with less efficacy than zzso which significantly reduced the zzso These findings suggest that zzso exerts a potent zzso effect by zzso zzso damage in zzso but that in in zzso transient cerebral zzso its zzso component which possibly acts via the zzso of zzso may play a more important role in attenuating brain damage than its zzso effect against zzso zzso
