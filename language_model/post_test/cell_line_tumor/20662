zzso growth factor zzso zzso is commonly zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso targeted against zzso and zzso potent zzso cellular zzso The action of zzso against zzso cells has not been well zzso zzso in this study, we investigated the zzso activity of zzso against zzso cell lines, particularly with respect to zzso activity zzso and zzso zzso expression of zzso cells was measured by a quantitative flow zzso analysis and zzso The effect of zzso on growth zzso was assessed using a modified zzso zzso The zzso activity was measured by a zzso zzso release zzso using fresh or zzso peripheral blood zzso zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso was evaluated using an zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso activity against zzso cells was observed at low concentration zzso and was enhanced by zzso whereas no direct effect on growth zzso was zzso A zzso correlation was observed between the number of zzso on zzso cells and zzso zzso Low zzso expression on the zzso cells, which was zzso zzso by zzso was sufficient for maximum zzso zzso In the mouse model, zzso treatment with or without zzso significantly inhibited zzso tumor growth and prolonged their zzso Our study shows that zzso has potent zzso activity both zzso and zzso mainly through the zzso mechanism of zzso zzso has the potential to be used as a novel therapy for zzso zzso
