zzso is essential for the repair of zzso DNA zzso breaks zzso in zzso and higher zzso zzso In this study, we examined whether suppressed zzso expression by small interference zzso zzso could enhance radiation sensitivity in cancer cells with different zzso zzso We used human zzso cell lung cancer cells differing in zzso gene status zzso cells bearing zzso zzso or zzso cells bearing zzso zzso A DNA cassette expressing zzso targeted for the zzso gene was zzso into those cell lines, and radiation sensitivity was examined with a zzso zzso Cellular levels of zzso and other proteins were analyzed using Western zzso We found that the radiation sensitivity of zzso and zzso cells was enhanced by zzso of the DNA zzso In the zzso cells, we observed decreased zzso expression of zzso protein and decreased zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso expression of the zzso factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso was suppressed by zzso zzso X-ray sensitivity after zzso zzso was achieved in zzso zzso cells and sensitivity was even more pronounced in zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso targeted for zzso also enhanced X-ray sensitivity even more for zzso zzso cells compared to zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that the zzso to radiation results from zzso suppression of DNA repair zzso or zzso cell survival signaling pathways through zzso and zzso zzso targeting appears to be a novel zzso agent, particularly in human zzso zzso cancer zzso
