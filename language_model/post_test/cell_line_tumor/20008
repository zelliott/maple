A zzso zzso setup combined with zzso for zzso zzso detection is proposed in this zzso An zzso zzso laser zzso zzso and a solid state laser zzso zzso were chosen to zzso the fluorescent zzso DNA probe after zzso zzso of zzso The zzso of zzso spectrum of Alex zzso zzso and Alex zzso zzso is minimized with a zero zzso zzso for Alex zzso zzso to zzso zzso The linear ranges of the device for the fluorescent zzso DNA probe were both from zzso zzso to zzso zzso The limits of detection for Alexa zzso zzso DNA and Alex zzso zzso DNA were zzso and 31 zzso zzso The detection of specific zzso has been accomplished by combining zzso zzso with the fluorescent zzso zzso The linear range for the synthetic zzso is from zzso zzso to zzso zzso Without zzso amplification, zzso was applied to discriminate a zzso cells zzso precursor zzso from zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso this result indicates zzso has great potential to provide a rapid comparative zzso for zzso zzso
