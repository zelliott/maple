zzso B zzso is a zzso zzso It zzso zzso division by blocking the formation of zzso zzso it zzso cell movement and zzso nuclear zzso In the present study, we investigated the zzso activity of CB in zzso human cervical zzso zzso CB showed significant zzso with an zzso of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso and significantly inhibited cell zzso Furthermore, results from zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that CB induced early zzso of zzso cells in a zzso zzso The cells exhibited zzso zzso including cell shrinkage and nuclear zzso CB induced cell cycle arrest at the S zzso We also observed zzso of DNA replication in a zzso incorporation zzso Furthermore, CB induced a zzso increase in zzso oxygen species and a decrease in zzso membrane zzso Western zzso analysis showed an increase in levels of zzso factors zzso and zzso which was followed by zzso of zzso and zzso These results suggested that CB induced zzso via a zzso zzso in zzso zzso
