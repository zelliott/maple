zzso is a zzso whose zzso leads to cycle arrest during zzso making it a potential therapeutic target in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of our zzso series of zzso with zzso motor domain revealed enhanced binding in the presence of zzso zzso zzso Using this information, we studied the interaction of this series with zzso complexes using a zzso shift zzso We measured up to a 7 degrees C increase in the zzso melting zzso of zzso for an inhibitor that produced zzso values of 60 and 130 zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In general, the inhibitor potency of the zzso series in in zzso biological zzso correlated with the magnitude of the zzso stability enhancement of zzso The zzso shift zzso also confirmed direct binding of zzso zzso identified in a zzso screen and demonstrated that the zzso shift zzso is zzso to a range of zzso and can be useful in evaluating both potent zzso and relatively zzso binding zzso zzso Overall, the zzso shift zzso was found to be an excellent zzso method for evaluating direct binding of a large number of compounds to zzso and it zzso the zzso zzso screens by providing an alternative determination of inhibitor zzso
