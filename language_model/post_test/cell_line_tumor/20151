zzso cells are characterized by their zzso and resistance to conventional zzso The zzso of human zzso reverse zzso zzso can lead to decreased cell proliferation and/or the induction of zzso cell death in cancer cells but has rarely been reported in zzso zzso Here, we assessed the effect of the zzso of the zzso gene on cell zzso and its possible molecular mechanism in zzso zzso zzso We found that the zzso of the zzso gene in zzso cells significantly decreased cell proliferation and zzso activity, increased the number of cells in zzso phase and decreased the number of cells in S phase, and induced zzso via decreasing the protein level of zzso and zzso and increasing the protein levels of zzso and zzso
