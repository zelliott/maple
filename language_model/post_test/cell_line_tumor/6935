The zzso drug zzso zzso which is known to block cells in the zzso phase of the cell cycle through stabilization of zzso is meanwhile commonly used for chemotherapy of advanced head and neck zzso zzso is primarily used in order to preserve zzso and/or zzso zzso Although zzso generally seems to be a powerful agent, it failed to reach a zzso tumor control in a sufficient percentage of zzso In order to investigate molecular resistance mechanisms, we have established a zzso zzso originating from the zzso zzso cell line zzso which seemed to be partially dependent on zzso The original and the descendant cell line were characterized by growth zzso zzso We used western zzso and the zzso zzso zzso technique to identify genes zzso expressed in the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso revealed increased expression of six zzso including zzso heavy chain, zzso a zzso zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso associated transcript 3 and collagen zzso in the zzso cell zzso Furthermore, western blots showed an zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso while zzso and zzso and zzso were expressed in equal amounts in both cell zzso
