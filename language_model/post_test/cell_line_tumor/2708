By exploiting a zzso zzso zzso with a common zzso zzso a series of zzso modified zzso of the zzso marine natural product zzso were zzso and evaluated in zzso for growth zzso against a range of human cancer cell lines, including the zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso was found to be well tolerated and led to the retention of zzso activity in the low zzso range zzso zzso in the zzso cell zzso while partial and full zzso of the zzso region led to a progressive reduction in biological zzso The zzso ring size was found to be critical, as zzso to zzso zzso to afford zzso zzso zzso led to a significant loss of zzso In a series of zzso experiments performed on the zzso cell line, all three of the zzso zzso zzso acted in an analogous fashion to zzso through a mechanism of zzso stabilization, causing both an zzso of cells at the zzso phase and formation of characteristic dense zzso zzso zzso
