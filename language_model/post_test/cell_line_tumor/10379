The zzso binding protein 1 zzso is zzso in many human zzso including zzso zzso It is also essential for normal brain development, suggesting that zzso is part of a neural stem cell zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso was highly expressed in the zzso zone zzso of mouse fetal brain zzso but not in terminally differentiated primary zzso zzso zzso knockout mice had reduced zzso zzso and zzso expression in the zzso Although primary zzso zzso were rich in zzso its expression was lost during zzso zzso zzso tumors often express zzso markers and tend to loose the cellular control that zzso zzso therefore, we addressed whether zzso served a similar role in cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso expressed in zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso primary brain zzso cells zzso zzso zzso with zzso attenuated the expression of these zzso zzso reduced zzso growth, and triggered differentiation via coordinate loss of zzso Furthermore, differentiation of zzso with zzso serum or bone zzso zzso suppressed zzso protein zzso Likewise, zzso expression was lost during differentiation of normal human zzso zzso with these zzso zzso expression increased with tumor grade zzso zzso 49 zzso zzso was also zzso with zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso based on the analysis of 282 cases of high-grade zzso These proteins were highly expressed in zzso zzso of zzso patients that subsequently zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso expresses with zzso markers where it functions to promote cell growth and inhibit zzso
