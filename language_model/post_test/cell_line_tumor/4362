Development of resistance to zzso deprivation therapy zzso is a major obstacle for the management of advanced prostate zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso withdrawal initially zzso tumors but development of zzso mechanisms including zzso bypass signaling leads to zzso of zzso zzso zzso are small regulatory zzso that are involved in maintenance of cell zzso but are often altered in tumor zzso 

In this study, we determined the association of zzso wide zzso expression zzso unique zzso with development of resistance to zzso We used zzso sensitive prostate cancer cells that progressed to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance upon zzso withdrawal and treatment with zzso zzso of expression of a subset of 100 zzso led to identification of 43 zzso that are significantly altered during progression of cells to treatment zzso We also show a correlation of altered expression of 10 proteins targeted by some of these zzso in these zzso 

We conclude that dynamic zzso in zzso expression occur early on during zzso deprivation therapy, and zzso zzso zzso The cumulative effect of these altered zzso expression profiles is the zzso zzso of multiple signaling pathways promoting survival and acquisition of zzso These early events are driving the transition to zzso resistance and cannot be studied in already developed zzso cell lines or zzso zzso our results can be used a zzso marker of zzso with a potential to be resistant to zzso
