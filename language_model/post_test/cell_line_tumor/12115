zzso domain zzso 1 zzso is a zzso zzso zzso activated by various types of zzso and is known to play a role in cell attachment, migration, survival, and zzso However, little is known about the molecular zzso underlying the role of zzso in zzso We report here that zzso zzso zzso zzso expression resulting in enhanced zzso zzso of zzso zzso induction using short hairpin zzso zzso results in increased zzso We also show that zzso activates the nuclear zzso zzso zzso and blocking this zzso by an I zzso zzso zzso results in the zzso of zzso zzso leading to enhanced zzso indicating that zzso zzso induction is zzso zzso We identify the upstream zzso zzso of the zzso pathway, zzso beta and zzso zzso as essential for zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso alpha seems to be zzso Finally, zzso zzso of zzso expression significantly enhanced zzso to zzso drugs in breast cancer zzso Thus, zzso signaling provides a novel target for therapeutic intervention with the zzso machinery of tumor zzso
