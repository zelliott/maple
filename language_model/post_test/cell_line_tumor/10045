zzso zzso are the most common zzso benign tumor and greatly affect zzso health and zzso They are the zzso indication for zzso in zzso zzso Current zzso study reported that soy products intake is zzso associated with diseases leading to zzso zzso is a zzso zzso and its zzso effect on zzso cell proliferation is zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso cells zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso cells were zzso Cell proliferation was assessed by counting the number of zzso The expression of zzso receptors and zzso zzso zzso zzso was evaluated by Western zzso zzso 

zzso was expressed in zzso cells and zzso acted as zzso zzso This zzso effect of zzso was attenuated by the treatment of cells with zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso or zzso 

These experimental findings in zzso show that the repressive effect of zzso on zzso zzso cell proliferation is through the zzso of zzso zzso may be useful as an alternative therapy for zzso
