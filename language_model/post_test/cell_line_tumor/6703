Both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso play important roles in zzso metabolism and insulin zzso We demonstrate that expression of the zzso gene is zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the cultured zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso treatment also results in zzso of the zzso gene in liver and skeleton muscle from an experimental obese rat model, accompanied by the decreased zzso content in these zzso The zzso promoter zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso was found to be essential for zzso zzso zzso This important promoter region contains two zzso and binds the zzso factor specificity zzso zzso but not zzso The zzso binding activity can be zzso enhanced by zzso and zzso as demonstrated by analysis of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso sequences reduce the promoter binding activity of zzso and the zzso activity of zzso In addition, zzso A, the specific inhibitor for zzso binding activity, zzso the zzso zzso of zzso These results indicate that zzso positively regulates the zzso gene zzso and zzso of zzso by zzso requires the involvement of zzso Taken together, this study suggests that zzso may be a newly identified zzso target zzso and zzso of zzso may be an important mechanism involved in action of zzso zzso in type 2 zzso
