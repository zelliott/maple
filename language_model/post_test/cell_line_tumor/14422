Members of the zzso zzso factor family are critical downstream targets of the tumor zzso RB and are often zzso and zzso in human zzso zzso regulates a diverse array of cellular functions including cell proliferation and zzso Recent studies indicate that zzso also regulates expression of upstream components of pivotal signal zzso zzso thereby modulating the activity of these zzso We show here that zzso zzso the activity of the zzso zzso via zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sustained zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso zzso involves zzso induction of the zzso zzso a zzso that can activate zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is an important zzso of zzso zzso and we show here that zzso of zzso expression or activity significantly zzso zzso zzso Overall, our data identify the zzso zzso as a novel zzso gene and reveal a functional link between a central signaling pathway, namely the zzso pathway, and the zzso factor zzso
