Growing and zzso human stem cells in zzso can provide access to study the molecular mechanisms that control cellular development in a manner pertinent to human zzso To fully understand such zzso however, it is important to recreate culture conditions that most closely relate to those in living zzso As step in this direction, we have developed a robust three-dimensional cell culture system using zzso highly porous solid zzso manufactured from polystyrene that can be routinely used to study the differentiation of human zzso stem zzso zzso in zzso zzso outgrowth was significantly enhanced when zzso were grown in a three-dimensional environment compared to traditional flat surfaces and resulted in the formation of extensive neural zzso These data suggest that the topography within the culture environment can significantly alter cell development and will therefore be an important feature when investigating the potential of human stem zzso
