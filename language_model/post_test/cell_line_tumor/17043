The zzso protein zzso formerly known as a peripheral zzso zzso exerts zzso function via regulation of zzso membrane zzso We examined zzso expression in human zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso 15 zzso zzso zzso and 70 zzso zzso zzso The role of zzso in the regulation of cell growth, migration, and zzso was examined in zzso cancer cell lines after zzso zzso with zzso and after treatment with zzso zzso zzso Compared with normal zzso the level of zzso expression was increased in zzso zzso and PC in 24, zzso and zzso of cases zzso zzso cancer cell lines demonstrated variable levels of zzso zzso without specific association with zzso zzso zzso Treatment with zzso of zzso or zzso signaling was not associated with changes in zzso zzso Treatment with zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso increased zzso expression in zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso gene zzso or treatment with zzso did not affect zzso cancer cell growth and migration but prevented zzso of zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso acid was associated with increased sensitivity of zzso to zzso zzso zzso Overall, we showed that zzso expression is frequently increased in zzso In zzso data suggested the role of zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso cancer cell response to zzso stress suggested its potential role in the regulation of zzso cancer cell response to treatment with zzso and warrants further zzso
