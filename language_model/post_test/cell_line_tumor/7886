Poly zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso which possesses the ideal properties of drug zzso In the present study, we prepared a series of zzso implants zzso loaded with different weight percent of zzso zzso 5, zzso and zzso We studied the infrared spectrum properties, in zzso degradation and drug release, in zzso degradation and tissue zzso of zzso in order to provide detailed information for the application of zzso as zzso drug carrier in cancer zzso zzso all zzso wafers in zzso buffer solution (PBS) kept their zzso during the degradation period of 30 zzso The in zzso degradation rates of zzso were accelerated when higher concentration of zzso was zzso zzso electron zzso observation showed that the surfaces of zzso with higher concentration of zzso had irregular zzso The cumulative drug release profiles of zzso exhibited a zzso release with an initial burst release in the first zzso After 7 days, almost zzso cumulative release of zzso was found for all zzso degradation rate of zzso in zzso was much quicker than that in zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed that no remarkable zzso were observed in the tissue surrounding zzso zzso suggesting zzso had good zzso and no tissue zzso In zzso zzso activity zzso suggested that zzso exhibited zzso activity through zzso drug zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is a candidate of zzso drug zzso
