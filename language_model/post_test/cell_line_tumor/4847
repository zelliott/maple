To identify zzso expressed genes in lung zzso cell zzso zzso the suppression zzso zzso method zzso was performed comparing six lung zzso zzso and 10 zzso normal zzso zzso zzso A zzso library consisting of 220 zzso genes in zzso tissue was established and named as zzso zzso zzso cell zzso Of them, six were tested using zzso reverse zzso on 27 pairs of zzso tissue and normal lung zzso zzso expression was confirmed in five of these six zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The elevated zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso three genes located on zzso zzso were further validated in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of lung SCC zzso zzso respectively, by quantitative real-time reverse zzso zzso Moreover, western zzso analysis showed that the protein expression of zzso was also zzso in zzso zzso of lung SCC zzso samples, as well as in five lung cancer cell lines and in one human immortalized zzso zzso cell zzso All the initial characteristics of these genes were first reported in the lung zzso The zzso expressed genes reported in this study will provide a valuable resource for understanding the zzso of lung zzso and for discovery of novel diagnostic or therapeutic zzso
