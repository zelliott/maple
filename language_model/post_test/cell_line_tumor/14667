zzso is the zzso neurotransmitter in the zzso zzso and a role in bone has been zzso The expression of zzso receptors has been reported in zzso but the expression and function of zzso zzso in bone remain zzso In this study, we investigated the expression and functional activities of zzso zzso zzso in human zzso cell lines and animal and human bone zzso The zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso were detected by zzso zzso chain zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were expressed at different levels in human zzso zzso cells, rat zzso and human rib bone zzso zzso zzso zzso were in cultured mouse zzso bone cells and cultured mouse zzso bone zzso zzso zzso zzso were in bovine zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was not found in human bone zzso to exclude the possible contamination from zzso zzso zzso induced an zzso in zzso calcium concentration and proliferation in zzso zzso Both effects were blocked by zzso We conclude that zzso zzso is present in bone tissue to evoke calcium signaling and zzso cell zzso Different zzso zzso zzso are distributed in various parts of the animal skeletal system including the different species and bone zzso Bone zzso involving zzso proliferation leads the possibilities that zzso zzso may play roles in bone zzso
