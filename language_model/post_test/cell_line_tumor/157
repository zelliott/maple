zzso bone zzso zzso is present in almost all myeloma patients requiring therapy and correlated to treatment response and zzso We assessed the expression of 402 zzso genes by zzso DNA zzso in zzso samples, including zzso myeloma cells zzso from 300 previously zzso patients, in zzso zzso by dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging, and in zzso zzso zzso zzso bone zzso plasma cells zzso express a median of 39 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 28 zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso unlike those of memory B cells induce zzso in zzso zzso do not show a significantly higher median number of expressed zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso but zzso of zzso samples zzso express at least one of the zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso and human myeloma cell lines induce significantly higher in zzso zzso compared with zzso In conclusion, zzso express a surplus of zzso over zzso genes zzso to the ability to induce in zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso of zzso genes by zzso further increases the zzso zzso together leading to bone zzso zzso at various degrees in all myeloma zzso
