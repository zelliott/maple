zzso of cells with short zzso synthetic DNA molecules that contain a zzso factor binding site, known as decoy zzso zzso has been proposed as a novel approach in zzso and in zzso for the study of gene regulation and for gene zzso Once delivered into cells, decoy zzso are predicted to bind to nuclear zzso factors, preventing their binding to consensus sequences in target zzso Using a zzso decoy zzso containing a consensus sequence for the zzso zzso factor, we show that zzso zzso were readily zzso into cells, but were consistently zzso in the zzso and not in the zzso The same phenomenon was observed in three different cell lines including zzso zzso and zzso The zzso decoy zzso failed to inhibit the zzso activity of an zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso zzso decoy zzso on the zzso zzso and function of zzso induced by the zzso inhibitor zzso which strongly induced zzso zzso was zzso No difference in protein level or nuclear zzso of zzso zzso or of one of its target zzso zzso was noted when cells were zzso with zzso or zzso forms of the decoy zzso We suggest that zzso zzso is an unappreciated and key limiting factor for the use of zzso factor decoy zzso that must be addressed before meaningful data interpretation can be zzso
