zzso contains small population of cancer stem cells zzso that are responsible for its maintenance and zzso Analysis of these zzso may lead to effective zzso and therapeutic strategies for the treatment of cancer zzso We report here the identification of zzso from human lung cancer cells using zzso zzso followed by zzso cell sorting zzso zzso cancer cells with relatively high zzso zzso 1 zzso activity display in zzso features of zzso including capacities for zzso zzso and zzso resistance to chemotherapy, and expressing zzso surface marker zzso In zzso experiments show that the zzso cells could generate tumors that zzso the zzso of the parental cancer zzso zzso analysis of zzso clinical specimens from three independent zzso of lung cancer patients and controls show that expression of zzso is positively correlated with the stage and grade of lung tumors and related to a poor prognosis for the patients with zzso lung zzso zzso is therefore a lung tumor stem zzso zzso These findings offer an important new tool for the study of lung zzso and provide a potential zzso factor and therapeutic target for treatment of the patients with lung zzso
