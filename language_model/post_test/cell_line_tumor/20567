The majority of deaths from breast cancer are a result of zzso however, little is understood about the genetic zzso underlying their zzso zzso profiling has identified the zzso zzso zzso as being zzso reduced in expression in primary breast tumors that have zzso compared with zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate a functional role for zzso in the shedding of tumor cells from the primary site into the zzso 

We investigated the effects of zzso zzso on breast cancer cell zzso migration, zzso and invasion in zzso and on tumor growth and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cells were zzso zzso with zzso sequences targeting the zzso zzso or scramble zzso Gene and protein expression was monitored by quantitative zzso chain reaction zzso and Western zzso Cell zzso zzso migration, and invasion were measured by cell zzso flow zzso and scratch and zzso Chamber zzso For in zzso experiments, zzso zzso and control cells were zzso into zzso fat pads of mice, and tumor growth, shedding of tumor cells into the zzso and evidence of zzso bone zzso were monitored with zzso zzso flow zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso expression were reduced by more than zzso in all zzso cell lines used but were zzso after zzso with the scrambled zzso zzso zzso resulted in significantly increased in zzso and zzso cell proliferation in zzso and in zzso compared with control, with significantly more tumor cells being shed into the zzso of mice bearing zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso cells showed a zzso increase in invasion through basement membrane and exhibited reduced zzso zzso compared with control zzso 

zzso zzso expression increases the invasive behavior of breast cancer zzso This is the first demonstration of a functional role for zzso in the zzso process, indicating that this zzso may represent a target for zzso zzso
