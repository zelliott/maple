zzso production is impaired in zzso and zzso zzso cells of classical zzso zzso zzso in spite of functional zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso in coding and regulatory regions, as well as zzso of zzso zzso factors, has been suggested as a potential reason for the lack of zzso zzso chain gene zzso We have investigated the impact of zzso zzso in suppressing zzso heavy zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to analyze zzso factor binding to zzso motifs present in the zzso regulatory zzso zzso factors were bound to these motifs in control cell lines, however, they were absent in the zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso factor zzso and/or zzso Oct binding zzso factor zzso did not result in any measurable binding to these zzso Increased zzso 3 zzso 9 zzso zzso was observed in the promoter region of the zzso locus in zzso and zzso zzso This is a typical feature of zzso zzso silent zzso Treatment of zzso cell lines with the DNA zzso agent zzso zzso partially zzso zzso zzso and affected zzso zzso Our results suggest an important role of zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
