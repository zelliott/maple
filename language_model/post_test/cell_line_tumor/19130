We have investigated the zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and have explored its possible mechanisms on human zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso status of cells treated with zzso was measured by the zzso zzso zzso Cellular zzso was zzso using zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso Reduction of zzso membrane potential zzso zzso was also detected by flow zzso Western zzso zzso was used to evaluate the release of zzso c and expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso It was shown that zzso displayed a significant zzso effect on growth of zzso cells in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso analysis showed an increase of zzso rate and decrease of zzso membrane potential after zzso cells were exposed to zzso for 24 zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso significantly induced a decrease of zzso protein expression and an increase of zzso activity and zzso protein zzso The results indicated that zzso could effectively inhibit proliferation by induction of zzso and could be a promising candidate in the development of a novel class of zzso zzso
