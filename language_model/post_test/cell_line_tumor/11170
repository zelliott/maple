A series of zzso zzso zzso have been designed and zzso in an attempt to develop potent zzso zzso A zzso approach using zzso zzso zzso reaction of zzso zzso zzso with various aromatic zzso was employed to target an array of zzso derivatives in an efficient zzso Their structures were confirmed by using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso All the compounds were evaluated for zzso activity against a panel of four human cancer cell lines including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a normal human zzso cell line zzso using zzso zzso The pharmacological results showed that most of the compounds displayed high level of zzso activities against the tested cancer cell lines compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to be the most potent compounds in this zzso
