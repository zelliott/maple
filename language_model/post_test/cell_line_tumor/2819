In an attempt to understand the molecular factors underlying zzso cell zzso in zzso oral and cervical zzso we examined the zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso Two sets of zzso were zzso the simple zzso zzso 7, 8, 18, 19, and 20, which are generally expressed in simple zzso and zzso 10, 13, and 17, which are expressed in zzso zzso Two additional zzso pairs, zzso zzso and zzso were analyzed as controls of the zzso cell status, zzso We report that zzso gene zzso specifically hits zzso and zzso which are markers of oral and cervical zzso zzso These data may be of help in zzso definition of zzso zzso
