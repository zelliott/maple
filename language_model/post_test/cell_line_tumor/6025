The use of zzso stabilizing agents zzso is a promising strategy for zzso therapy alone and as part of combined treatment zzso with zzso zzso However zzso molecular and cellular processes including the regulation of zzso zzso signaling pathways are far from zzso Here we investigated the interference of the novel, clinically relevant zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso derived vascular zzso growth factor zzso which is most relevant for tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso specifically reduced zzso stabilization of the zzso factor zzso in the zzso lung zzso cell line zzso but not in the zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso further reduced zzso zzso expression and zzso but only in the zzso zzso cell zzso In the zzso cell line, zzso radiation alone induced zzso zzso but a strong dominant zzso effect of zzso was always observed when zzso radiation was combined with zzso on the level of zzso protein stability, zzso and zzso These results demonstrate that zzso and zzso radiation zzso zzso stress responses, which might contribute to the potency of this promising, combined treatment zzso
