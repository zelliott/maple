Clinical studies suggest that stress-related zzso factors can accelerate the progression of zzso zzso such as acute zzso leukemia zzso but it is unclear whether such effects are zzso or what biological pathways mediate such zzso Given the network of sympathetic nervous system zzso fibers that zzso the bone zzso to regulate normal zzso zzso zzso cells, we tested the possibility that zzso zzso signaling might also affect ALL zzso In an zzso mouse model, zzso human zzso ALL cells were zzso with the zzso gene for zzso zzso imaging and injected zzso into male zzso mice for bone zzso zzso Two weeks of daily restraint stress significantly enhanced ALL tumor burden and dissemination in comparison to controls, and this effect was blocked by the zzso zzso zzso Although zzso ALL cells expressed zzso for zzso and zzso zzso they showed no evidence of zzso signaling in response to zzso and zzso failed to enhance zzso proliferation in zzso These results show that chronic stress can accelerate the progression of human zzso ALL tumor load via a zzso signaling zzso that likely involves indirect regulation of ALL biology via zzso in the function of other host cell types such as immune cells or the bone zzso zzso
