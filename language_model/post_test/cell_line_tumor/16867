zzso zzso kill zzso cells in the presence of zzso zzso in zzso However, for in zzso zzso the zzso need to zzso from the circulation by passing through zzso zzso To study zzso migration in the presence of zzso cells in zzso we established a three-dimensional collagen culture in which zzso zzso colonies were grown in the presence or absence of an zzso zzso We demonstrated that - in contrast to targeting zzso on zzso with zzso - targeting the zzso A zzso zzso zzso instead triggered zzso migration and zzso leading to zzso destruction, which coincided with release of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso necrosis factor zzso Interestingly, zzso migration was enhanced in the presence of zzso cells, which coincided with production of significant levels of the zzso zzso zzso This supports the idea that stimulation of zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso cells, leading to enhanced zzso migration towards zzso colonies and subsequent zzso zzso
