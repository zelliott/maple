zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso by zzso zzso zzso gene is a zzso protein with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It has been zzso that formation of zzso complex results in an zzso initiation signal while subsequent zzso of zzso zzso this zzso A series of zzso zzso have been identified in zzso as strong zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso We assumed that in zzso cells these compounds might zzso bind to zzso and inhibit its zzso activity what would prolong the lifetime of zzso initiation zzso zzso zzso several zzso zzso were tested for their zzso and ability to induce zzso in zzso zzso zzso These experiments have shown that zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso instead of the central zzso and two terminal zzso zzso zzso is the most zzso among test compounds zzso zzso and triggers zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso cells (in which zzso was silenced by zzso were not sensitive to compound zzso These results indicate that the zzso analogue 1 zzso zzso zzso and therefore, it can be considered as a drug candidate for zzso therapy in zzso cancer cells and in zzso cancer cells, in which zzso of zzso was accomplished by gene zzso
