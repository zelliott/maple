Head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso is known to have a poor zzso The resistance to treatment and distant zzso are important clinical problems in zzso The zzso transition zzso is a key process in successful execution of many steps such as the invasion and zzso for cancer zzso Snail is one of the master regulators that promote zzso in many types of zzso including zzso Recently, it has been shown that zzso zzso could induce a cancer stem cell zzso zzso in a number of tumor zzso In this study, we investigated the role of Snail in inducing zzso properties and zzso zzso in zzso We established zzso cell lines zzso with zzso zzso was analyzed using western zzso analysis and zzso zzso Cell migration and invasion were assessed using zzso zzso and modified zzso chamber zzso zzso zzso markers of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were also evaluated with western zzso analysis, and zzso was assessed with zzso zzso Introduction of Snail induced zzso properties in zzso cells and enhanced cell migration and zzso Moreover, zzso zzso gained zzso zzso and was associated with increased zzso These results suggest that Snail could be one of the attractive targets for the development of therapeutic strategies in zzso
