The zzso zzso zzso is a critical component of the persistent inflammatory milieu that pancreatic cancer cells frequently zzso Although several studies report diverse mechanisms responsible for this association, yet a comprehensive global analysis of the effect of zzso in these cells is not clearly zzso In this study, we performed whole zzso zzso analysis of control and zzso treated human pancreatic zzso zzso cells, validated the most targeted zzso and evaluated the role of zzso zzso 225 Genes were zzso and zzso were zzso and these were zzso into biological processes and cellular pathways using the zzso zzso zzso The altered genes zzso into significant biological processes that included those of cell cycle, zzso transport and zzso protein zzso The zzso signaling zzso emerged as harboring the maximum number of zzso expressed zzso Two important genes of this pathway, namely zzso and zzso were validated and both depicted significant zzso by zzso that was prevented in the presence of zzso zzso In a wound healing zzso zzso increased the migratory rate of zzso zzso and zzso cells that was zzso by zzso zzso Additionally, zzso and zzso zzso also increased the migration of these cells along the wound zzso These results suggest that in these pancreatic cancer cells, zzso zzso components of the zzso signaling zzso in a zzso dependent manner that contributes to their increased migratory zzso zzso zzso might be potentially targeted to prevent the migration and invasion of pancreatic cancer zzso
