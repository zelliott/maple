zzso modifications are important markers of function and zzso state, yet the DNA sequence elements that direct them to specific zzso locations are poorly zzso Here, we identify hundreds of quantitative trait zzso zzso that affect zzso modification or zzso zzso II zzso zzso occupancy in zzso zzso cell lines zzso In many cases, the same zzso is associated with quantitative changes in multiple zzso marks and Pol II, as well as in zzso I sensitivity and zzso zzso zzso factor binding site zzso are correlated overall with differences in local zzso zzso and we identify specific zzso factors whose binding leads to zzso modification in zzso Furthermore, zzso that affect zzso at zzso regulatory sites frequently also direct changes in zzso and gene expression at associated zzso
