zzso hypoxic regions in head and neck zzso cell zzso like in zzso zzso are avascular and, therefore, hinder drug delivery leading to drug resistance and tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per day per oral for 35 days starting 7 days before the first zzso zzso has been found to increase efficacy of a wide variety of zzso agents including zzso zzso zzso per week zzso 4 zzso Whereas zzso leads to a zzso complete response zzso in zzso zzso the combination of zzso and zzso increased the zzso to zzso Surviving tumors were found to consist largely of avascular hypoxic zzso Here, we investigated the combination of zzso zzso 70 zzso per week zzso zzso 4 administered 3 or 72 hours before zzso a zzso drug in clinical trial with selective toxicity for hypoxic cells, with zzso and zzso in further enhancing the cure zzso zzso response, change in tumor hypoxic regions, and DNA damage were monitored in zzso zzso administered 3 hours before zzso in combination with zzso + zzso led to a lower tumor zzso zzso did not increase cure rate beyond that of zzso + zzso combination and was instead found to decrease cures with no evidence of an increased DNA damage or a significant reduction in avascular hypoxic tumor zzso zzso zzso in zzso demonstrated disruption of tumor vessels by zzso that could lower zzso drug delivery to zzso zzso zzso hypoxic tumor cells and may explain at least partially these unexpected zzso
