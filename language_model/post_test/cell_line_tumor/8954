Small interfering zzso zzso provides a highly selective method to target zzso zzso however, its use is complicated by specific delivery to tumor zzso The aims of the present study were to develop a novel zzso model of portal vein zzso for the chronic delivery of therapeutic agents to liver zzso determine the benefits of local delivery of zzso to liver zzso and determine the utility of zzso cell zzso zzso zzso as a selective target for zzso delivery to zzso cancer zzso zzso 

First, portal vein zzso was performed through a zzso zzso in 2 zzso zzso zzso Second, the portal zzso flow distribution and zzso zzso were evaluated using zzso zzso zzso studies were performed by zzso injection of zzso zzso colon cancer zzso zzso of zzso zzso was assessed by zzso imaging, with delivery to the zzso confirmed using fluorescent zzso Finally, zzso expression was evaluated using zzso zzso of human tissue zzso 

zzso portal vein zzso was confirmed by saline injection and zzso Fluorescent imaging of zzso confirmed excellent distribution and zzso zzso zzso zzso injection of zzso zzso demonstrated a high level of zzso throughout the liver, with zzso also identified within the liver zzso Also, all primary zzso and liver zzso stained strongly for zzso with no expression in normal zzso 

zzso therapy can provide the selective delivery of zzso to zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso but not normal liver, could further selectively target zzso zzso of zzso zzso
