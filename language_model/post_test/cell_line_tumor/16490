zzso zzso 1 zzso cellular prion protein zzso natural zzso zzso protein 2 zzso and zzso proteins control the cell zzso and zzso of copper zzso zzso in nervous zzso upon zzso zzso Little is known about their regulation under reduced zzso zzso a condition underlying the onset of diffused neurodegenerative zzso In this study, rat zzso cells were exposed to zzso zzso for 48 zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and the impairment of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity depicted the initiation of a zzso program, preliminary to the appearance of the zzso signs of zzso The zzso response related to zzso transport proteins has been zzso zzso zzso transcript and protein levels were consistently elevated upon zzso zzso The zzso protein amount was stable, despite a zzso increase in the transcript amount, meaning the zzso of zzso regulatory zzso zzso and zzso expressions were zzso The zzso zzso has been demonstrated to enhance the cell zzso zzso ability by about 50% with respect to the zzso zzso and so sustain the zzso delivery to the zzso zzso zzso zzso the study suggests a pivotal role for zzso in the cell adaptation to zzso limitation through a direct activity of zzso zzso In this view, the zzso zzso observed in several cancer cell lines could be interpreted as a molecular marker of cell zzso zzso and a potential target of therapeutic interventions against disorders caused by metal zzso
