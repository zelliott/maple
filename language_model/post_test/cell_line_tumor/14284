To study the zzso effects of zzso deleted zzso zzso gene on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso 

We constructed a zzso zzso expression zzso zzso zzso containing zzso human zzso zzso and zzso with zzso resistance zzso which were introduced by zzso gene zzso into zzso cell line that does not express zzso zzso thus forming zzso zzso the experimental cells were classified into zzso zzso and zzso By using reverse zzso chain reaction and zzso the expression of zzso zzso and its protein were zzso 

zzso zzso had successfully been transferred into zzso cells and obtained permanent zzso The growth speed of zzso was slower than the other two groups, there was significant difference between them zzso zzso zzso zzso clones number was 38 zzso 8, while zzso and zzso were 192 zzso 8 and 186 zzso 10, respectively, there was significant difference between them zzso zzso zzso The percentage of zzso phase cells increased to zzso which that of S phase decreased to zzso by analyzing cell cycle, there was significant difference between them zzso and zzso P zzso zzso The zzso changes of the cells were observed under electron zzso revealing growth zzso 

zzso gene played an important role in generation and development of zzso zzso
