Acid zzso zzso zzso activity is required to zzso zzso into zzso An inherited zzso of this zzso activity leads to the zzso storage disorder, zzso zzso zzso zzso activity also has been demonstrated in several human zzso We have characterized a zzso putative promoter region of the zzso zzso gene by zzso reporter zzso zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso zzso A zzso sequence essential for zzso promoter activity was found, and mobility shift and zzso experiments using nuclear extracts of zzso cells demonstrated that a zzso zzso zzso could bind the zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells significantly increased the activity of a zzso zzso reporter construct containing the zzso zzso promoter, and a positive correlation was observed between zzso and zzso zzso and protein expression in two different human cancer cell lines in which zzso expression was either zzso by zzso or increased by zzso gene zzso Northern zzso analysis also revealed a correlation of zzso and zzso gene expression in various human zzso These results provide the first characterization of the zzso promoter from any species and demonstrate that zzso is one zzso factor involved in the regulation of zzso gene zzso
