The presence of zzso on zzso allows the targeting of zzso zzso at the zzso surface of human M cells and the enhancement of an immune response after oral zzso To check the hypothesis that zzso zzso targeting zzso M cells or zzso would be more efficient for oral zzso than zzso novel zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso were grafted on the zzso chain of zzso and incorporated in zzso zzso zzso and zzso significantly increased the transport of zzso across an in zzso model of human M cells as compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso enhanced zzso zzso by zzso in zzso The zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso a higher production of zzso zzso than the intramuscular injection of free zzso or zzso administration of either zzso or zzso zzso zzso were also able to induce a cellular immune zzso In conclusion, the in zzso transport of zzso zzso by zzso and the immune response were positively influenced by the presence of zzso at the surface of zzso These zzso could thus represent a promising delivery system for oral zzso
