We found that the zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly expressed in cervical zzso cancer relative to normal zzso and its expression levels positively correlate with clinical zzso Reduction of zzso protein levels by zzso using zzso decreases the expression levels of zzso and the zzso invasion and zzso of zzso a cervical zzso cancer cell zzso zzso zzso also increases the zzso to zzso I inhibitor zzso and II zzso and zzso Our results suggest that zzso is associated with the growth and zzso of cervical tumor zzso zzso the zzso zzso may have potential clinical applications for the treatment of cervical zzso
