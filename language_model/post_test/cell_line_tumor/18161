zzso from multiple human studies have continued to spur the development of zzso cells zzso as therapeutic vaccines for the treatment of cancer, chronic viral infections, and zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso is dependent on the ability of the zzso to take up and process zzso zzso for presentation to the immune zzso Although immature zzso have been shown to naturally take up zzso zzso by zzso approaches that significantly affect zzso delivery need further zzso especially if such zzso can be demonstrated to result in the zzso of more robust and comprehensive immune zzso We have developed a zzso zzso zzso and zzso process for loading zzso with whole tumor zzso The use of whole tumor zzso zzso the generation of a more robust immune response targeting multiple unique zzso zzso in patient's tumors and likely reduces the zzso potential of immune zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso with tumor zzso elicit significantly stronger zzso responses both in a tumor challenge model and in a therapeutic vaccination model for zzso zzso zzso These effects are observed in a processing scheme that requires zzso to zzso lower amounts of tumor zzso when compared with the standard zzso methods employed in loading zzso
