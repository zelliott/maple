The zzso zzso cancer 1) breast cancer zzso gene is recognized as responsible for most familial breast and zzso zzso and is suggested to be a zzso tumor zzso zzso In this report, we investigated the tissue specificity of tumor zzso activities induced by a zzso zzso coding for zzso zzso zzso We demonstrated a pronounced in zzso zzso effect on zzso lung and zzso colon cells upon infection with zzso We describe a prolonged zzso cell cycle arrest associated with a decrease in the zzso form of zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso is implicated in zzso cell growth zzso We also observed a significant zzso effect in these zzso subcutaneous tumors after in zzso delivery of zzso although these two tumors do not express zzso zzso and also zzso alpha and zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso can induce a strong prolonged cell cycle arrest and zzso cell death but no significant zzso effect in zzso zzso Finally, our data indicate that zzso administration of zzso significantly zzso growth of lung and colon steroid zzso zzso
