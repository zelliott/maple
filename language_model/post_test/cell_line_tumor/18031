There is clear evidence of a zzso zzso system in the prostate and studies to date suggest that zzso blocking drugs inhibit the growth of some prostate cancer cell lines and delay the development of prostate zzso The present studies examine the action of zzso II in two prostate cancer cell lines and report the presence of functional zzso that regulate the actions of growth zzso 

zzso was used to identify the presence of zzso II and zzso techniques to examine zzso and zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso and independent zzso cell zzso The effects of zzso and zzso zzso upon zzso DNA synthesis and zzso zzso in these cells were also zzso 

zzso zzso together with zzso II were identified in both cell lines and stimulation of these receptors inhibited zzso DNA synthesis and zzso zzso zzso although present in both cell lines, were only functional in zzso cells where zzso zzso DNA zzso 

zzso zzso are present and have the capacity to inhibit zzso prostate cancer cell growth in zzso and fast growing zzso zzso cell lines, whereas functional zzso are found only in zzso cells where their zzso stimulates DNA zzso
