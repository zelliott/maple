zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso has been observed in many zzso tumors and its zzso signal zzso zzso the proliferation of zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso are widely used as a zzso agent for the zzso of zzso signaling and show considerable therapeutic effect in zzso cell lung zzso harboring zzso zzso zzso However, prolonged treatment inevitably produces tumors with additional zzso zzso in zzso which is a critical issue for current zzso We aimed to characterize the distinct molecular response to zzso between the drug-resistant and zzso lung zzso cells in order to learn about zzso based on the molecular zzso From the quantitative zzso analysis, we found a specific increase in zzso expression in zzso lung zzso zzso which was absent in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso triggered the most zzso zzso in both zzso We identified the zzso acid zzso spanning from 38 to 65 as a functional core of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which reduced the zzso membrane potential and caused zzso zzso The zzso zzso covering the zzso zzso zzso induced growth suppression of the zzso clones without affecting zzso zzso zzso zzso of the minimized dose of the zzso zzso zzso restored the response to zzso like that in the sensitive zzso These findings suggest that the region of zzso zzso zzso is critical in the zzso action of zzso against zzso lung zzso cells and has potential utility in the zzso of zzso zzso
