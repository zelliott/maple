We investigated the potential role of zzso DNA zzso in zzso zzso by constructing a zzso expression zzso of the zzso zzso gene from zzso cancer cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso cells exhibited a significantly increased growth rate and colony formation rate, and also had a decreased zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected in the zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso Our results suggested that zzso from zzso cancer cells promotes the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Further study of the biological functions of zzso cells might be helpful in understanding the role of zzso in zzso zzso
