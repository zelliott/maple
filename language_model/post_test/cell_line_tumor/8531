Growth factor zzso zzso signaling is meanwhile recognized as a complex signaling network, which is initiated by recruiting specific patterns of zzso proteins to the zzso domain of zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso to globally identify zzso proteins are required to zzso this zzso We zzso zzso with its interacting proteins by zzso from zzso of zzso zzso A total of 183 proteins were repeatedly detected in high-resolution zzso zzso For 15 of these, direct interactions with zzso were listed in the zzso interaction database, including zzso zzso zzso and 2, zzso 1 and 3, zzso zzso and zzso The newly developed zzso zzso zzso allowed retrieving and visualizing 93 zzso protein complexes that contained at least one of the proteins found to interact with zzso in our zzso zzso of 14 proteins were modulated more than twofold upon zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complex zzso showed zzso zzso These proteins were further zzso with different cellular zzso Finally, interactions of zzso proteins and the newly discovered interaction of zzso could be zzso In conclusion, a powerful technique is presented that allowed identification and quantitative assessment of the zzso zzso to provide further insight into zzso zzso
