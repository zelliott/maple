To silence zzso II gene expression by using small interference zzso zzso in prostate cancer cell line zzso 

For in zzso transcription, four sequences of zzso DNA template zzso were zzso and one pair of the sequences were complementary to zzso II zzso The other pair was negative zzso The 8 zzso at the 3' end of each zzso were complementary to the zzso zzso zzso The sense and zzso zzso templates were transcribed by zzso zzso zzso and the resulting zzso transcripts were zzso to create zzso The zzso was zzso into prostate cancer cell zzso For zzso the efficiency of zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso and Western zzso were employed to examine the expression of zzso II protein and its zzso zzso zzso was used to measure DNA zzso 

The zzso sequence specific to zzso II gene was capable of zzso the expression of zzso II protein and its zzso And cellular DNA synthesis was significantly reduced in zzso zzso zzso 

The protocol for the synthesis of zzso by zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso II might be involved in DNA zzso
