zzso extracted from the ginger plant, possesses zzso activity against a broad range of zzso zzso However, the mechanism underlying zzso zzso remains incompletely zzso Here, we show that zzso promoted zzso cell death in human zzso cells, zzso zzso gene zzso and induced zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso was associated with zzso of zzso gene zzso and restoration of zzso levels remarkably attenuated zzso zzso cell zzso Moreover, we found that the interaction between surviving and zzso a critical regulator of zzso activity, was impaired by zzso zzso The results, therefore, reveal a zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso in human zzso cells, which is associated with zzso of zzso itself and the interaction between zzso and zzso
