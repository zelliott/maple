The aim of this study was to assess pivotal factors determining the zzso status of zzso tumors, and, for comparison, of normal zzso For this purpose, zzso patterns, blood flow data, zzso consumption rates and zzso zzso were correlated to the median zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso human tumors, and of various normal zzso No correlations were found between median zzso values and vascular patterns, zzso consumption rate or blood flow zzso When zzso zzso however, was considered (a comprehensive zzso which encompasses all of the above zzso a strong inverse correlation was found between this zzso and the median zzso values, both for zzso tumors zzso and normal zzso zzso At similar zzso extraction values, the median zzso values in the solid tumors were substantially lower than those in normal zzso a finding which most probably reflects the chaotic zzso found in tumors, the loss of flow regulation which in normal zzso meets the zzso demands of the cells, and in some cases, zzso zzso
