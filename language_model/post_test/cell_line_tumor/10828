zzso binding protein zzso is one of the most significant genes in the signature of major aggressive zzso Previously, we have shown that zzso enhances proliferation and invasion of zzso cells, suggesting that zzso activates a zzso gene expression program in these zzso Gene expression profiling in human zzso zzso zzso cells indicated that zzso zzso activated a gene expression program consistent with enhancement of zzso zzso was significant for genes involved in zzso zzso and zzso including the zzso of vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene by zzso zzso was demonstrated via zzso of a zzso promoter zzso construct in zzso zzso of zzso promoter zzso construct with zzso protein in zzso zzso cells indicated that zzso of zzso promoter only occurs in the presence of zzso zzso Cell zzso and zzso in zzso cells demonstrated nuclear zzso of zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso of zzso promoter is likely to be zzso by nuclear zzso The levels of zzso zzso (up to 400 zzso zzso suggested that zzso might elicit zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and control clones cultured in collagen sponge were zzso onto chick zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed by 72 zzso solely in the zzso cell zzso In conclusion, our data indicate that zzso is an zzso of aggressive behavior in cancer cells, involving nuclear entry and zzso of a zzso gene expression program, including zzso regulation of the zzso gene and zzso zzso activity of zzso cell zzso in zzso
