Human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso also known as zzso zzso is correlated with the poor prognosis and zzso in zzso Breast cancer resistance protein zzso and zzso is a drug zzso pump responsible for zzso resistance zzso in a variety of cancer zzso zzso and zzso are associated with poor treatment response in breast cancer patients, although the relationship between zzso and zzso expression is not zzso Here, we showed that zzso of zzso into zzso breast cancer cells zzso resulted in an zzso of zzso via the zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso B zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with the zzso inhibitor zzso the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and the dominant negative zzso of zzso inhibited zzso zzso promoter zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso zzso led to an increased resistance of zzso cells to multiple zzso drugs such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso the expression of zzso or selectively zzso the activity of zzso or zzso zzso the zzso cells to these chemotherapy agents at least in zzso Taken together, zzso of zzso through zzso signaling zzso played an important role in zzso zzso of zzso cells, and zzso zzso and zzso pathways might serve as potential targets for therapeutic zzso
