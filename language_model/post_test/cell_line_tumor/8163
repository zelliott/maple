zzso and zzso forms of zzso beta zzso zzso are found in diffused and dense core plaques in Alzheimer's disease zzso and zzso syndrome patients as well as transgenic mouse models of zzso Although the pathological significance of these shortened forms zzso is not completely zzso previous studies have demonstrated that these peptides are significantly more resistant to degradation, zzso more rapidly in zzso and exhibit similar or, in some cases, increased toxicity in zzso zzso cultures compared to the full length zzso In the present study we further investigated the mechanisms of toxicity of one of the most abundant zzso zzso zzso bearing zzso zzso at position 3 zzso We demonstrated that zzso zzso induce zzso zzso zzso and membrane damage in zzso zzso Also, we produced zzso zzso zzso in rabbit and identified an zzso zzso recognized by zzso zzso Our results are important for developing new zzso compounds specifically targeting zzso zzso since the most commonly used zzso in the majority of vaccines for zzso have been shown to induce zzso that recognize the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the full length zzso which is absent in zzso truncated zzso
