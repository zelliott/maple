Parkinson's disease is characterized by the selective depletion of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso particular those containing zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso may be either zzso or zzso Recently we found that zzso reduces the activity of zzso zzso In this paper, the detailed mechanisms behind the reduced activity were studied using zzso isolated from the human zzso zzso increased the zzso stress, but synthetic zzso did zzso zzso zzso and zzso completely suppressed the increase, indicating that zzso produced by an zzso reaction plays a central zzso Iron was shown to reduce in zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso cells and the reduction was protected by zzso These results suggest that iron released from zzso increases zzso stress in zzso and then causes zzso dysfunction and reduces zzso zzso The role of zzso is discussed in relation to the selective vulnerability of zzso zzso in Parkinson's zzso
