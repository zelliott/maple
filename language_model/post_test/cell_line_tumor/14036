zzso and zzso rabbit models of chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were established and the role of both viable and zzso bacteria was investigated in zzso A total of 29 rabbits were zzso to four zzso Groups A and B were fed a zzso diet, and groups C and D were fed a normal zzso zzso segments of group A and C animals were zzso in zzso using viable zzso chronically using repeated zzso zzso zzso arteries were treated using zzso zzso Group B and D animals were treated with repeated zzso injections of bacterial zzso zzso and saline zzso Additional zzso rabbits were treated by repeated injections using viable and zzso zzso each controlled by saline zzso To compare the effects of this chronic zzso model, additional animals received single injections of either viable zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso treated arteries of 29 zzso were analyzed using zzso at zzso zzso was detected by zzso and zzso zzso chain zzso Only in zzso but not in zzso zzso chronic zzso infection of all bacterial zzso viable and zzso zzso as well as zzso resulted in a significant increase in zzso zzso formation zzso area zzso zzso zzso and zzso when compared to controls zzso area index zzso zzso zzso persisted in zzso zzso and vascular zzso Single zzso infection using zzso or zzso zzso was not able to induce zzso formation zzso area zzso zzso zzso vs zzso after single saline zzso zzso In conclusion, chronic vascular infection with zzso or zzso components acts as a zzso requiring other major zzso zzso rather than as a zzso zzso
