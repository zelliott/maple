Additional zzso abnormalities are currently detected in zzso zzso They play major roles in the progression of zzso and in zzso The genes involved remain zzso A zzso zzso array zzso analysis correlated with zzso and FISH was performed in a set of 27 zzso zzso cell lines and primary zzso More than half of the 145 zzso zzso were mapped to zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso an zzso zzso possibly zzso to some zzso zzso cell zzso zzso localized to the zzso locus were consistently observed with the zzso K zzso zzso Among 136 zzso zzso zzso gains were found in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were found in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Twenty one minimal critical regions zzso zzso zzso zzso were delineated in tumors and cell zzso Three zzso were localized to zzso The zzso one was mapped to zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso harboring zzso and zzso In the other 2 zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso appeared as possible drivers of these gains zzso The zzso zzso zzso contained an zzso and zzso might be the driver of this zzso The 40 zzso zzso zzso zzso was the smallest gained zzso and specifically zzso the zzso zzso which is already implicated in B cell zzso The most frequently deleted zzso was zzso zzso that removed the fifth zzso of zzso Further investigations which combined gene expression and functional studies are essential to understand the zzso mechanism and for the development of more effective, targeted therapeutic zzso
