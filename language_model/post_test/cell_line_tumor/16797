zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso have been confirmed to possess zzso and antivirus activities due to their zzso zzso However, strong zzso and short plasma zzso limit their clinical zzso To solve this problem, the two proteins were modified with zzso (20 zzso 

In this article, a novel zzso strategy for the two main type I zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso was successfully developed for zzso zzso Using this dramatic method, 200 zzso of zzso and about 120 zzso of zzso was obtained in only one zzso process from 200 g of zzso zzso zzso The zzso and some other properties of the two proteins were assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso quadruple mass zzso and zzso sequence analysis as well as Western zzso Two zzso zzso zzso proteins were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso proteins were characterized by zzso laser zzso zzso of flight mass zzso The analysis of zzso and antivirus activities indicated that the serial zzso zzso preserved moderate activities on zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, both zzso proteins showed about zzso zzso and antivirus activities, and at the same time decreased zzso zzso when compared with their unmodified zzso 

zzso and zzso obtained from this novel zzso strategy can meet the requirement of a large amount of samples for zzso Their chemical modification can solve the problem of strong zzso and meanwhile preserve moderate zzso All these findings suggest the potential application of zzso zzso and zzso zzso as zzso and antivirus zzso According to these results, zzso zzso can be constructed with zzso to be a targeting drug that can further decrease zzso and side zzso Through zzso we can make them zzso drugs, which can further prolong their zzso period in the human zzso
