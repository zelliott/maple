The distinguishable zzso features of zzso of acute zzso leukemia cells with enlarged size and finely distributed nuclear zzso indicate incomplete zzso zzso that can be related to elevated gene zzso To confirm this, zzso zzso structures were studied in zzso growing rat zzso leukemia 1 cells isolated at the University of zzso zzso zzso This cell line was established from primary rat leukemia chemically induced by zzso zzso The enlarged zzso of zzso cells allowed improved fluorescent zzso of zzso zzso Increased resolution revealed major zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bodies, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso spiral zzso and circular zzso zzso zzso zzso bent, zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed the existence of the zzso zzso the first visible zzso zzso generated by the zzso of the zzso zzso Other zzso not seen previously included the spiral zzso that are involved in the zzso folding of zzso zzso The existence of spiral zzso favors the zzso zzso model of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in leukemia cells throughout the cell cycle is an indication of zzso contributing to enhanced gene expression and is regarded as a zzso zzso
