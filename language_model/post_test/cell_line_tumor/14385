The zzso zzso axis represents a novel target in several zzso including zzso zzso Upon being zzso the zzso A zzso zzso mediates multiple zzso activities, including zzso escape from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transition, and zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso focal zzso protein that conveys zzso signaling zzso by zzso and growth factor zzso In this study, we investigate whether the signaling triggered by zzso leading to an aggressive zzso is zzso by an zzso zzso In zzso and zzso 433 zzso zzso cell lines, zzso of zzso by zzso enhances the expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity increases as zzso cancer cells adhere to type I collagen through zzso zzso zzso and do so to a greater extent on zzso zzso zzso increases zzso zzso and protein expression and activity in a zzso and zzso zzso An zzso zzso inhibitor zzso or zzso with a zzso zzso zzso effectively blocks the zzso of downstream signals, zzso and zzso zzso zzso The blockade of zzso zzso activity results in an zzso of zzso zzso zzso as well as of cell zzso and zzso in a zzso 3 zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso a specific zzso zzso suppresses zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor zzso These data show that zzso functions as a downstream zzso of the zzso axis to zzso aggressive cellular zzso Thus, the zzso signaling cascade can be efficiently targeted by zzso blockade of zzso
