zzso zzso C zzso zzso play a major role in signal zzso and contribute to the regulation of cellular differentiation and zzso However, little is known about zzso zzso expression of zzso in human zzso zzso To characterize the relationship between expression of zzso and zzso zzso based on the different subspecies, we investigated the expression of four subspecies zzso beta II, gamma and zzso in five cases of zzso zzso zzso 77 cases of human zzso zzso and 17 human zzso cell zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso beta zzso cells were found in the mantle zones and marginal zones, and zzso and zzso in the zzso centers showed zzso zzso with strong intensity against zzso zzso The present study is the first report to examine the expression of zzso delta in zzso zzso zzso In zzso areas, a small number of zzso were positive for zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso cells were not found in these zzso zzso Eight cases of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the zzso of zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso but other zzso zzso cases except three cases of diffuse large zzso zzso did not express zzso zzso In addition, six and eight out of nine zzso cell lines expressed the protein and zzso of zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso alpha was predominantly expressed on zzso in comparison with other types of zzso The expression of zzso gamma was observed in only five cases of zzso The overall survival of zzso zzso zzso was significantly better than that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso gamma seems to be associated with a better prognosis in the limited number of zzso cases in the present zzso
