We investigated the efficacy of a powerful zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso administered as a single agent or in combination with zzso agents on the growth of zzso zzso and zzso human colon cancer in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso and protein were found in all three cell lines zzso Exposure of zzso cells to 10 zzso zzso led to an increase in the number of cells blocked in S phase and G zzso and cells with lower zzso DNA zzso Similar changes on the cell cycle traverse of zzso cells could also be seen at lower zzso of zzso (1 zzso after zzso with 100 zzso zzso zzso indicating a zzso mechanism of action based on the zzso of zzso induced proliferation of tumor cells at lower zzso Daily in zzso treatment with zzso zzso zzso decreased the volume of zzso zzso and zzso tumors zzso into zzso nude mice by 25 to zzso zzso zzso zzso Combined treatment with zzso and zzso agents zzso and zzso resulted in a synergistic tumor growth suppression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso to zzso In zzso and zzso zzso the zzso for the combinations of zzso and zzso zzso single substances zzso zzso zzso was significantly zzso These findings support the use of zzso as an zzso agent and may help to design clinical trials using zzso in combinations with zzso zzso
