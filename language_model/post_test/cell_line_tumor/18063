zzso are zzso extensions generally attributed with a guidance role in cell zzso We now show in fish zzso that zzso play a major role in generating zzso zzso in the zzso region behind the zzso zzso zzso that developed zzso to the zzso via zzso containing focal complexes contributed their zzso part to stress fiber zzso and zzso that folded zzso contributed to the construction of zzso zzso parallel to the cell zzso zzso light and electron zzso of cells labeled for zzso and zzso confirmed integration of zzso zzso into the zzso zzso zzso of zzso II did not subdue the waving and folding motions of zzso or their entry into the zzso but zzso were not then integrated into zzso zzso zzso results were obtained with zzso melanoma zzso These and other findings support the idea that filaments generated in zzso and zzso for zzso are recycled for seeding zzso zzso for use in zzso
