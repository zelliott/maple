zzso screening approaches have allowed for the identification of a large number of potentially relevant tumor zzso in cancer zzso Within this group, cancer zzso zzso represent promising targets for cancer zzso since they are widely expressed in a variety of human cancer zzso In pancreatic cancer, however, there are only few data available about the expression pattern and zzso response to cancer zzso zzso and other zzso tumor zzso zzso we investigated the zzso zzso response against 11 cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed on zzso surface zzso in patients with pancreatic cancer zzso zzso zzso chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso and healthy donors zzso zzso zzso We found in zzso of all patients zzso responses to zzso but not to other cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso response correlated with the expression of zzso in the primary tumor of the respective patient as shown by zzso zzso and Western zzso In contrast, no zzso response to cancer zzso zzso was observed in healthy zzso The zzso immune response against zzso was associated with the size of zzso but not with other zzso parameters such as zzso stage, presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso age, gender or zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso response to cancer zzso zzso zzso is found in a proportion of pancreatic zzso zzso These results indicate that identification of additional tumor zzso by zzso screening of tumor zzso expression libraries by zzso is a promising goal in pancreatic zzso
