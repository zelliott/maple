zzso is a naturally occurring zzso virus in clinical zzso Although tumor infection by zzso can generate zzso zzso zzso its therapeutic importance versus direct viral zzso is zzso This study addresses the requirement for viral zzso and zzso and the relative importance of zzso immunity and direct zzso in zzso 

zzso specific T cells loaded with zzso were delivered zzso to zzso and severe combined zzso mice bearing zzso zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso melanoma, zzso with assessment of viral zzso zzso clearance by tumor colony zzso and immune zzso Human zzso zzso zzso zzso were done with zzso cells loaded with zzso cells before the addition of zzso 

zzso was resistant to direct zzso in zzso and failed to support zzso replication in zzso or in zzso Nevertheless, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso mice and generated zzso zzso In contrast, zzso failed to reduce tumor burden in severe combined zzso mice bearing either zzso or zzso zzso zzso In the human system, zzso acted solely as an zzso when added to zzso cells already loaded with zzso supporting zzso of specific zzso zzso zzso in the absence of significant direct tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso was similarly zzso 

The immune response is critical in zzso the efficacy of zzso and does not depend upon direct viral zzso or zzso The findings are of direct relevance to fulfilling the potential of this novel zzso zzso
