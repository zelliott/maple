In this study, we investigated the zzso effect of zzso on human pancreatic cancer cell line zzso zzso and zzso as well as the possible mechanisms zzso zzso human pancreatic cancer cell line zzso was exposed to varying zzso of zzso zzso 10, 20, 40 or zzso Then the zzso membrane potential zzso was analyzed by zzso zzso cell zzso was analyzed by flow zzso zzso and cell proliferation was analyzed by zzso zzso nude mice zzso implanted were randomly divided into five groups to receive treatments by different doses of zzso control group zzso saline zzso E10 group zzso zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso group zzso zzso and zzso group zzso zzso Each mouse was treated 5 times by zzso injection of zzso every 3 zzso During the treatment, the feeding stuff was zzso One week after the last treatment, we recorded the body weight and the maximum diameter of tumor in each group before the mice were zzso Then the cell zzso of the tumor was tested by zzso zzso The results zzso showed that the zzso of the cells declined and the zzso rate increased with the zzso concentration increasing and the cell proliferation of each group was inhibited in a zzso and zzso manner by zzso The feeding stuff curve did not decline significantly in zzso group and the zzso rate of the tumor cells in this group was higher than the zzso zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that zzso may induce the pancreatic cancer cell zzso via declining the zzso and a moderate dose of zzso improved the living state of the model zzso
