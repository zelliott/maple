Two genes have a zzso lethal relationship when the zzso or zzso of 1 gene is only lethal in the context of a zzso or zzso of the second zzso This situation offers an attractive therapeutic strategy, as zzso of such a gene will only trigger cell death in tumor cells with an activated second zzso but spare normal cells without zzso of the second zzso Here we present evidence that zzso is zzso lethal to zzso cells with zzso amplification and zzso zzso are childhood tumors with an often lethal zzso Twenty percent of the tumors have zzso amplification, and these tumors are ultimately zzso to any zzso zzso zzso of zzso by 3 zzso interference techniques induced zzso in zzso zzso cell lines, but not in zzso single copy zzso zzso of zzso zzso this zzso response in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso single copy cells did not trigger zzso unless a zzso zzso was zzso The zzso induced zzso after zzso zzso was accompanied by nuclear stabilization of zzso and zzso profiling showed zzso of zzso target zzso zzso of zzso rescued the cells from zzso zzso The synthetic zzso of zzso zzso in zzso activated zzso cells can also be triggered by zzso of zzso with a small zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso a zzso zzso at clinically achievable zzso induced zzso zzso The zzso lethal relationship between zzso and zzso indicates zzso zzso as potential zzso cancer zzso
