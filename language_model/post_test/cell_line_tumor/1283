zzso also known as zzso has been identified as a zzso and zzso regulated gene in in zzso studies, hence zzso levels were strongly zzso zzso high expression of zzso was associated with poor clinical outcome in breast cancer zzso However, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso varied widely in tumors and cell lines suggesting that zzso regulation differed according to pathological zzso The goal of this study was to determine the expression patterns of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso tumors with disparate zzso and molecular zzso We hypothesized that tumor environments with relatively high zzso levels would have different zzso patterns than tumor environments with relatively low zzso zzso We measured levels of zzso and zzso zzso and protein in tumors from zzso mice that were of high grade and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso zzso and proteins levels were significantly lower in the less aggressive tumors that developed in zzso zzso zzso from both mouse lines express zzso protein and we found that zzso zzso levels correlated positively with zzso levels in both zzso However, zzso and zzso transcript levels correlated positively only in tumors from zzso zzso We identified prominent zzso protein in zzso and less prominent zzso in the zzso of zzso cells of ducts and zzso from normal zzso zzso as well as in zzso and tumors obtained from zzso zzso This zzso pattern was reversed in tumors from zzso mice as nuclear zzso was faint or absent and zzso zzso more zzso In zzso the regulation of expression and zzso of zzso varies in tumor environments with high versus low zzso levels and demonstrate the importance of zzso clinical breast zzso based on zzso zzso
