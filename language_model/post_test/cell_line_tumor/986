To evaluate the effect of zzso zzso on drug sensitivity, primary human zzso cells were infected with zzso zzso expressing zzso and then exposed to zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso C was zzso in both primary zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells were more sensitive to zzso C than parental zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso cells to zzso and its zzso zzso but only at low zzso This phenomenon was also observed in cervical cancer cells and was independent of zzso zzso a target of zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso specifically zzso the activity of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso cells hypersensitivity to zzso but not high-dose zzso and zzso zzso analysis indicates that induction of zzso and zzso and suppression of zzso are associated with zzso induced by zzso and may partly explain the hypersensitivity of zzso cells to zzso zzso
