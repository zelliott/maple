zzso has shown a potent zzso activity against a variety of human zzso However, little is known about the mechanism of action underlying its zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso has differential zzso effects in zzso zzso type zzso cells, causing growth arrest, and in zzso zzso zzso human breast zzso cells, causing massive zzso cell zzso Comparisons between the effects of zzso on these two cell lines allowed us to identify the mechanism underlying the zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso analysis indicated that zzso induced cell cycle arrest in the zzso phase in zzso zzso A marked induction of zzso expression as well as zzso of zzso and zzso was observed after zzso treatment of zzso cells but not zzso zzso zzso also induced zzso of zzso A and zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, probably via zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso with a zzso inhibitor or zzso inhibitor abolished zzso zzso of zzso A and zzso but not zzso induction of zzso expression and zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso or with zzso a specific inhibitor of protein zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced the zzso zzso and almost completely abolished zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso A and zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso small interfering zzso or zzso zzso or zzso zzso significantly suppressed the zzso of zzso Taken together, our data suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso cell death of zzso cells via zzso of zzso in a protein zzso zzso zzso
