Large zzso cells zzso commonly exist in zzso cancer cell lines that are used widely in zzso However, the contributions of zzso to zzso are zzso 

In this study, zzso were characterized in the zzso zzso cell line zzso in zzso and in zzso at the zzso zzso 

The authors observed that zzso originated from a rare zzso of zzso cells and were positive for a zzso marker, zzso In addition, zzso were responsible for the majority of zzso activity when cultured in hard zzso they were more resistant to zzso agents than zzso zzso they could undergo zzso division zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and in zzso and, most zzso a single zzso produced zzso subcutaneous tumors zzso mainly of zzso zzso that gave rise to spontaneous lung zzso in nude zzso 

The current results indicated that the growth of zzso may be arrested under stress and that zzso are highly resistant to chemotherapy and can generate zzso zzso zzso zzso
