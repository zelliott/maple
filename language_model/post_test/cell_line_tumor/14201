zzso are a family of zzso zzso zzso zzso by 15 genes which all zzso in tandem on zzso zzso Several members of this family have been previously associated with zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso and 10 zzso are elevated in zzso cells, serum and zzso fluid of zzso cancer patients and correlate with disease zzso Other zzso that have been related to zzso cancer include zzso 5, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14 and zzso We hypothesized that zzso and zzso can be zzso to monitor dissemination of zzso cancer cells in blood and zzso fluid of zzso cancer zzso 

zzso was isolated by zzso separation of cancer cells and was amplified by zzso 

zzso for zzso cancer cells in blood from 24 zzso cancer patients, with zzso for zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso however, this was not different from the zzso of normal zzso By utilizing zzso as a marker, the zzso of patients was zzso versus zzso of zzso zzso of zzso fluid of zzso cancer patients revealed zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso compared with zzso for other cancer zzso zzso correlations were identified among zzso of zzso 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 13, 14 and 15 in cancer cells isolated from zzso zzso 

zzso expression by zzso cancer cells is not specific enough for detecting zzso zzso zzso expression may have some value for zzso zzso cancer from other types of cancer or from zzso diseases that lead to zzso zzso
