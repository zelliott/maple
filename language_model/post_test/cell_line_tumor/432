zzso is a naturally occurring zzso with zzso zzso In present study, we investigated the zzso activity of zzso against zzso lung cancer cells zzso and the possible mechanism in zzso Our results showed that zzso inhibited zzso cells proliferation in a zzso and zzso manner and caused zzso death of zzso zzso zzso zzso was characterized by enhanced zzso zzso c release, zzso of zzso but not zzso Exposure of zzso cells to zzso resulted in zzso of zzso protein zzso and zzso of zzso In addition, proliferation zzso effect of zzso was associated with decreased level of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso exhibit less toxicity to zzso cells than tumor zzso In conclusion, our results indicated that zzso can inhibit zzso lung cancer cell proliferation by inducing zzso via zzso zzso zzso and by decreasing zzso zzso zzso and zzso Its potential to be a candidate of zzso agent is worth being further zzso
