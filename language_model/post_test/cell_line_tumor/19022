zzso zzso zzso 2) is a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso factors which is often zzso in zzso zzso Previous results suggested that it might be involved in the regulation of breast cancer invasion and zzso In order to analyze the role of zzso in breast cancer cells, it was silenced in the highly invasive zzso cells using zzso zzso On the other hand, stable zzso of the zzso invasive zzso cell line were established in order to analyze the effects of zzso zzso In both approaches, cell proliferation was not or only zzso influenced by zzso In contrast, the invasive potential of the cells was increased, and a weaker effect on zzso was zzso By zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso followed by validation on a protein level, we identified several zzso target genes which might be involved in cell invasion and migration, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, zzso expression levels of various genes which are associated with a more zzso behavior of the tumors in zzso were zzso or zzso zzso members of the zzso family, zzso zzso zzso zzso These results show that zzso zzso is associated with a more aggressive tumor zzso and is probably involved in breast cancer progression in zzso
