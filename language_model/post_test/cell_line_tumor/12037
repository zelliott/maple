A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso region of the zzso zzso gene was shown to influence zzso stability, but the molecular basis of this effect has not been zzso Here, studies of both zzso and zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso protein zzso has higher affinity for zzso D zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed D zzso zzso levels, whereas zzso zzso selectively elevated D zzso zzso zzso Our results illustrate the functional consequences of zzso associations involving a zzso zzso sequence and uncover a novel mechanism of action for zzso zzso zzso
