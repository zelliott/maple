Low levels of zzso zzso oxygen species zzso originating from zzso zzso have been implicated in various signaling pathways induced by growth factors and zzso by zzso However, the main source of zzso is known to be the zzso and increased levels of zzso from the zzso have been observed in many cancer zzso Thus far, the mechanism of zzso production in cancer cell proliferation in the zzso is not zzso We recently identified a novel zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and reported that increased expression of zzso zzso production in the zzso The experiments conducted in the present study showed that zzso zzso were indispensable for the proliferation of both normal and cancer zzso Furthermore, whilst cell growth was inhibited by blocking the zzso zzso in cells zzso with zzso directed against zzso the cell growth was recovered by addition of zzso hydrogen zzso The results of this study suggest that zzso zzso may play an important role in zzso signaling in cancer zzso
