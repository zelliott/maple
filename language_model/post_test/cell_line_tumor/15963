zzso is a zzso zzso acid which, in nature, is zzso with zzso or zzso units forming the zzso abundant components of saffron (a spice with many reputed medicinal zzso We have previously reported that saffron, zzso and zzso inhibit breast cancer cell zzso In order to further study the effect of zzso on breast cancer cells, we used the highly invasive zzso cells and measured the viability with the zzso zzso and the zzso through a zzso basement zzso After 24 h zzso zzso significantly inhibited not only proliferation but also invasion at 1 and 10 zzso Cancer zzso and zzso are associated with the expression of zzso zzso zzso In order to study the molecular changes of zzso expression that might accompany the observed zzso effects, gene expression of zzso was studied by zzso whereas protein expression and zzso activity were determined with Western zzso and zzso zzso The gene and protein expression of zzso and zzso were greatly attenuated by both zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso used as zzso zzso with 10 zzso zzso for 24 h in zzso conditions reduced zzso activity and zzso protein zzso When cultured in media with zzso 2 and 5 zzso zzso at 10 zzso also reduced zzso zzso The above findings show that zzso the main zzso of zzso zzso zzso cell zzso via zzso of zzso zzso
