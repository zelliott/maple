In Alzheimer's disease zzso beta zzso zzso produced from zzso precursor protein zzso is considered to induce cell zzso To clarify the molecular mechanism underlying zzso zzso we established the cell line zzso wild or zzso zzso zzso in human zzso zzso This paper presents that zzso of zzso in the cells zzso increased the levels of zzso and zzso but not zzso and reduced zzso level and zzso activity with increased zzso to zzso zzso The zzso levels of zzso oxygen species in zzso increased significantly by zzso zzso The level of zzso zzso but not zzso was markedly decreased in zzso cells, which was zzso correlated with zzso expression among zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that increased expression of wild type zzso renders zzso cells more vulnerable to zzso stress leading to cell zzso
