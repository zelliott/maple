To improve the utility of zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso for gene therapy, the viral envelope needs to be manipulated to achieve zzso gene zzso In this report, we have engineered an zzso zzso virus, zzso zzso deleted for the zzso C zzso and the zzso zzso domain zzso of zzso in order to express zzso and zzso active zzso zzso fusion zzso zzso and a 27 zzso acid active zzso inside zzso zzso are supposed to be the molecules that the human zzso B virus zzso needs to bind specifically to zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the zzso fusion zzso was expressed and incorporated into the envelope of the zzso zzso virus zzso Moreover, zzso zzso virus gained a specific binding activity to an zzso cell line zzso with a zzso productive zzso In addition, zzso zzso were shown to neutralize zzso virus zzso and a synthetic zzso zzso was able to zzso zzso virus bound on zzso zzso These data provide further evidence that zzso can zzso zzso cells through a specific binding to a zzso zzso Furthermore, these data strongly support the hypothesis that the zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso to zzso
