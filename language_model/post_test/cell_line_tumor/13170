zzso zzso zzso cells were established by one-week exposure of zzso cells to zzso to analyze the effects of zzso medicines on zzso zzso zzso zzso cells expressed high levels of zzso and efficiently exported zzso zzso which is a zzso of zzso suggesting that zzso cells resist zzso by zzso zzso We assessed the effects of 26 kinds of zzso medicine on zzso by zzso zzso zzso using zzso cells, and the results revealed that zzso and zzso are potential zzso of drug zzso by zzso Additionally, the sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso was increased in combination with these zzso zzso indicating that zzso and zzso overcame zzso resistance in the cells by suppressing drug export by zzso We further clarified that zzso zzso contained in both zzso and zzso reversed zzso resistance by preventing drug zzso by zzso without affecting the expression levels of zzso Moreover, the principal components of zzso zzso zzso A, zzso B, and zzso B zzso were found to increase the sensitivity to zzso in zzso by zzso drug export by zzso without affecting the expression levels of zzso These results suggested that the reversal effects of zzso and zzso on zzso resistance are derived from these principal components in zzso zzso zzso zzso medicines containing zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso may be useful as zzso zzso
