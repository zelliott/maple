zzso zzso zzso is a common cancer with poor prognosis worldwide and the molecular mechanism is not well zzso This study aimed to establish a collection of human zzso cell lines from zzso zzso zzso zzso From the 20 surgical zzso sample collections, 7 tumors were successfully developed in zzso mice and further established 7 novel zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by primary zzso The characterization of cell lines was defined by zzso growth zzso cell cycle, zzso analysis, short tandem repeat zzso analysis, molecular profile, and zzso Additionally, response to clinical zzso was validated both in zzso and in zzso zzso analysis indicated that all cell lines were unique cells different from known cell lines and free of contamination by bacteria or zzso The other findings were quite zzso between individual zzso zzso aberration could be found in all cell zzso zzso was zzso only in 3 out of 7 cell zzso 4 cell lines expressed high level of zzso zzso was strongly stained in all cell zzso zzso level of zzso acid induced protein 3 zzso was decreased in all cell zzso The 7 novel cell lines showed variable sensitivity to 8 tested zzso zzso and zzso possessed multiple drug resistance zzso zzso inhibited zzso tumor growth of zzso but not of zzso Our results indicated that the 7 novel cell lines with low passage maintaining their clinical and pathological characters could be good tools for further exploring the molecular mechanism of zzso and zzso drug zzso
