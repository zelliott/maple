Gene transfer of zzso to tumor cells has been proven to inhibit tumor growth in zzso by zzso zzso and stimulation of zzso To investigate the zzso mechanism of zzso that suppresses lung cancer growth, we have established a zzso zzso zzso Lewis lung zzso zzso cell line zzso to evaluate its zzso potential in zzso Mice zzso with zzso displayed zzso of tumor zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso T cell activity against zzso was manifest in zzso zzso Of note, zzso exhibited decreased expression of zzso zzso and zzso On the cellular level, the zzso zzso had reduced zzso including zzso of zzso expression and reduction of cellular migration and zzso The suppression of zzso by zzso on lung cancer cells was further confirmed by the treatment with zzso on the zzso zzso and human zzso cell lung zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso movement, and zzso were also suppressed by the treatment with zzso Our data show that zzso not only suppresses expression of zzso and zzso but also decreases the levels of zzso and the abilities of cellular migration and zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso into zzso zzso mice also exhibited reduced tumor zzso Our data indicate that zzso zzso responses can contribute to significant zzso zzso Taken together, the results suggest that zzso may serve as an effective agent for lung cancer therapy in the zzso
