The product of Snail gene is a zzso of zzso zzso and an zzso of the zzso transition in several zzso tumor cell zzso In order to examine Snail expression in animal and human zzso we have raised a zzso zzso zzso that zzso with the regulatory domain of this zzso Analysis of zzso zzso shows that Snail is expressed in zzso zzso and embryonic zzso in zzso cells of lungs and zzso as well as in zzso Little zzso was detected in adult zzso as Snail was not zzso expressed in most zzso zzso However, Snail expression was observed in activated zzso involved in wound healing in mice zzso Moreover, Snail was detected in pathological conditions causing zzso of zzso such as zzso Analysis of Snail expression in tumors revealed that it was highly expressed in zzso and zzso In zzso tumors, it presented a more limited distribution, restricted to zzso cells placed in the vicinity of the tumor and to zzso cells in the same zzso These results demonstrate that Snail is present in activated zzso cells, indicate its relevance in the communication between tumor and zzso and suggest that it can promote the conversion of zzso cells to zzso zzso
