The ability of human zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated after meals enriched in saturated fatty acids zzso zzso zzso and zzso to inhibit the zzso of zzso LDL by the LDL zzso was investigated in zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and degradation products of zzso LDL zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rate zzso zzso resulted in significantly greater zzso of zzso zzso than zzso particles zzso zzso zzso and total zzso of zzso LDL compared with zzso and zzso particles zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso but not zzso content of the zzso removed the effect of meal fatty acid zzso and addition of an zzso zzso reversed the zzso effect of zzso on the total zzso of zzso zzso Real time zzso showed that the zzso zzso zzso increased the expression of genes involved in zzso zzso synthesis zzso zzso zzso and decreased the expression of the LDL zzso protein 1 compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, these findings suggest an alternative or additional mechanism zzso acute fat zzso can influence LDL clearance via competitive zzso effects of zzso on the LDL zzso
