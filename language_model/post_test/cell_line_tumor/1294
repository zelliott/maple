Side population zzso cells and their relationship to stem zzso properties have been insufficiently studied in zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso have attracted much attention but their roles in the maintenance of SP zzso remain zzso 

The zzso from zzso cell lines and primary cell cultures were zzso for stem zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis identified zzso as a potential zzso zzso of SP zzso The level of zzso expression in clinical samples and its correlation with SP fraction were zzso zzso and zzso studies were performed to examine its roles in cancer zzso SP zzso Furthermore, zzso prediction and experimental validation were used to identify zzso target zzso 

The SP cells sorted from zzso possess cancer stem cell zzso properties, including zzso zzso resistance to chemotherapy, invasive and strong zzso formation zzso zzso expression was significantly reduced in SP cells compared with zzso cells ( zzso Moreover, zzso expression was zzso in zzso zzso zzso and low zzso expression tend to correlate with high SP fraction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies indicated that zzso expression affects the number of SP zzso In addition, zzso zzso reversed drug resistance and inhibited cell invasion of SP zzso Furthermore, zzso reporter zzso demonstrated that zzso directly targets zzso and zzso and affects the levels of zzso and protein expression in SP zzso 

These findings indicate that zzso contain cancer zzso SP zzso zzso has an important role in maintaining cancer zzso SP zzso that may be a potential target for effective zzso zzso
