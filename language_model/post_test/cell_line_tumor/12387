In gastric cancer, increasing numbers of genes have been reported to be silenced by zzso zzso However, global analysis of zzso zzso in cancer cells has rarely been zzso For screening the genes zzso by the zzso agent zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso containing 30,000 zzso was performed using gastric cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso treated with zzso The candidate zzso genes were confirmed by real-time zzso and the zzso status of zzso islands was determined by zzso DNA sequencing or zzso zzso Among the zzso genes considered to have zzso island in their promoter regions, we selected 5 genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that exhibited a greater than zzso increase in at least 2 cell zzso Of these, we could determine the zzso status of zzso islands of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was zzso in 4 of 5 gastric cancer cell lines, whereas zzso of zzso was zzso in only 1 cell zzso MSP analysis for zzso revealed that the zzso island was zzso after zzso zzso In addition, we observed that zzso of zzso could promote zzso and zzso effect in gastric cancer cell zzso In conclusion, some of the genes zzso by zzso treatment may be zzso zzso by promoter zzso These genes might be related to gastric zzso In particular, the suppression of zzso which could induce zzso and inhibit proliferation of cancer cells, might be one of the underlying mechanisms for gastric zzso
