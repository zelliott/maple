zzso zzso zzso is characterized by permanent growth arrest and the acquisition of a zzso zzso zzso Increasingly, zzso is viewed as an important barrier to zzso Surprisingly, relatively little is known about the zzso changes that accompany and therefore may contribute to zzso Here, we have performed a zzso and zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso approximately 300 different zzso zzso reveals that cells that have undergone zzso develop a unique zzso signature that differs markedly from cells undergoing zzso zzso A number of zzso zzso appear uniquely increased in zzso cells, including a marked increase in the level of certain zzso long chain fatty zzso zzso studies reveal that this zzso in the zzso reflects substantial changes in overall zzso zzso In particular, zzso zzso cells manifest a decline in zzso synthesis and a significant increase in fatty acid zzso Increased fatty acid zzso results in an unexpectedly high rate of zzso oxygen consumption in cells that have undergone zzso zzso or genetic zzso of zzso zzso 1, the zzso step in zzso fatty acid zzso restores a zzso zzso rate and, surprisingly, selectively zzso the zzso zzso state that accompanies zzso Thus, zzso zzso cells demonstrate profound zzso in their zzso and zzso profiles, particularly with regards to the levels, synthesis and zzso of free fatty zzso Furthermore, the inflammatory zzso that accompanies zzso appears to be related to these underlying changes in cellular zzso
