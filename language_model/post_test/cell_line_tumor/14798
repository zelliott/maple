zzso zzso translation initiation factor zzso is the only cellular protein containing zzso zzso zzso is activated by the zzso synthesis of zzso and the zzso modification is essential for cell zzso In the present study, we report selective zzso of the zzso and/or zzso zzso of zzso by a key zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso normally zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso to form zzso which in turn are zzso to lower zzso Although zzso has been reported to exert other effects in cells by its interaction with other cellular zzso zzso is the first target protein specifically zzso by zzso zzso or zzso as the free zzso acid, does not act as a zzso for zzso suggesting a zzso interaction between zzso and zzso Indeed, the binding of zzso and zzso was confirmed by pull-down zzso The effect of the zzso of zzso on zzso activity was assessed by comparison of zzso with zzso bovine zzso zzso in the zzso synthesis zzso The loss of zzso activity by this zzso zzso confirms the strict structural requirement for the zzso side chain and suggests a possible regulation of zzso by zzso zzso
