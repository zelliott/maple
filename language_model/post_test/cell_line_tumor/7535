zzso efforts have been devoted to the development of zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso and/or zzso agents for cancer zzso in zzso However, the intrinsic chemical instability and zzso properties of zzso zzso in zzso condition limit their widely applications in the zzso study in living zzso zzso zzso are among the most promising zzso zzso with high zzso zzso bright zzso and zzso By introducing zzso groups into conventional zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso not only show superior zzso zzso properties zzso zzso higher quantum zzso but also exhibit more chemical zzso In this work, we demonstrated highly stable and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and the natural carrier zzso zzso bovine serum zzso zzso zzso for tumor targeted imaging and zzso therapy in zzso zzso was selectively bound to zzso zzso domain via zzso and hydrogen bonding interactions with up to zzso enhanced zzso zzso By zzso zzso target zzso to zzso the zzso was capable of targeting tumor sites and allowed for monitoring the zzso zzso of zzso which consequently determined the protocol of zzso therapy in zzso We envision that this zzso strategy for selectively binding functional imaging agents and/or drugs into human serum zzso might potentially zzso in the zzso and even clinic studies in the zzso
