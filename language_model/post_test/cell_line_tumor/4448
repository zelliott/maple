Previously, we reported on the zzso effect of the zzso compound zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso in zzso human colon cancer zzso In the current study, we investigated whether zzso has zzso effect in prostate cancer cells, and if so, what the molecular mechanisms zzso We examined the growth zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso prostate cancer zzso zzso treatment in zzso and zzso zzso cells resulted in zzso of cell growth and induction of zzso in a zzso zzso However, zzso did not show any significant effects on the growth zzso and zzso cell death in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso we used zzso cells for further zzso The induction of zzso in zzso cells was observed by decreased zzso DNA zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso in the ratio of zzso protein zzso In addition, zzso induced increase of late zzso and zzso DNA which were observed by flow zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso reduced the zzso of zzso and zzso and induced the zzso of zzso from zzso to nucleus as shown by western zzso zzso zzso treatment activated zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling in a zzso zzso zzso zzso was partially prevented by zzso with the zzso inhibitor zzso suggesting involvement of zzso in the zzso zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso via zzso of the zzso and zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso human prostate cancer zzso
