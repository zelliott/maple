The deregulation of the DNA damage response zzso can contribute to zzso and favor the progression from zzso syndrome zzso to acute zzso leukemia zzso Since zzso agent, notably zzso constitute an efficient therapy for patients with high-risk zzso we assessed whether such compounds can activate the zzso in zzso zzso While zzso and zzso had moderate effects on zzso and cell cycle zzso both agents induced profound changes in the expression and functionality of zzso zzso zzso and to a lesser degree zzso induced the zzso of checkpoint zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso of the zzso zzso In addition, zzso agents were found to cause the zzso of the zzso regulator zzso box zzso best known as zzso whose zzso has been related to poor prognosis in zzso The zzso of zzso induced by zzso or zzso in zzso blasts was accompanied by the zzso of zzso from the zzso to the zzso Upon stimulation with zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso and the zzso zzso targets zzso and zzso and this effect was attenuated or abolished in zzso zzso zzso Altogether, our results suggest that the zzso of zzso may contribute to the effects of zzso agents in zzso zzso
