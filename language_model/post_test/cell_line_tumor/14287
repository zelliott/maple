To investigate the zzso effect of zzso cells zzso on the growth of the implanted tongue zzso cell zzso zzso tumors in nude zzso 

Being induced from human peripheral blood zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso by zzso cells zzso Those zzso and T zzso were zzso to induce specific zzso T zzso zzso zzso was then performed after those zzso and zzso were implanted into the zzso nude zzso 

zzso were induced from zzso with multiple zzso Compared with the control groups, the growth of tumors was significantly inhibited in the group that had been implanted with zzso and zzso and tumor doubling time also increased markedly zzso zzso zzso 

zzso function normally after being induced from human zzso with multiple zzso zzso zzso with tumor cell zzso and zzso zzso with those zzso have a significant zzso immune activity in nude zzso
