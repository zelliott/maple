The giant zzso zzso is one of four zzso zzso of the zzso tumor zzso zzso It engages in several functions, including cell polarity and migration, and in zzso signaling during zzso zzso deletions in oral cancer suggest that zzso may play a tumor zzso role, although zzso of zzso has been reported in some other zzso Here we show using Northern zzso that human melanoma cell lines zzso but universally express zzso and less commonly zzso zzso and zzso Both normal zzso and zzso also express comparable zzso zzso relative to melanoma zzso Analysis of the protein processing of zzso in zzso revealed that, like zzso zzso human zzso is zzso into a zzso zzso before achieving cell surface zzso The use of zzso also established that such zzso requires the zzso zzso zzso However, in melanoma cells, the zzso zzso of zzso is also expressed at the cell surface together with the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso processing generates a potentially functional zzso product in melanoma cells, a persistent zzso zzso zzso zzso no longer in association with the zzso zzso In zzso zzso studies of zzso showed that melanoma cells display high levels of zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso despite comparable zzso expression levels, exhibited mainly zzso zzso zzso Such differences in protein distribution appear to reconcile with the different protein products generated by dual zzso zzso We suggest that the zzso zzso could promote altered zzso and the novel products of alternate processing provide a dominant negative function in zzso
