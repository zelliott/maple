Despite being highly effective for newly diagnosed chronic zzso leukemia zzso zzso not only is inactive against zzso zzso stem cells, but also has limited activity against blast crisis zzso zzso The relative activity of zzso and the expression levels of zzso proteins in zzso and zzso zzso BC zzso zzso cells and the effects of targeting zzso proteins in these cells are zzso Here we report higher levels of zzso in zzso than in zzso zzso zzso cells and comparable expression levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the two populations in BC zzso zzso of zzso by zzso in cells from patients with zzso zzso inhibitor zzso BC zzso promoted zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells with an efficacy similar to that in zzso zzso Combination of zzso with zzso (which decreases zzso zzso or zzso (which decreases zzso and zzso zzso induced death of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells obtained from zzso BC zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso proteins are critical targets in BC zzso and that zzso of zzso signaling can eliminate both zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells in BC zzso independent of response to zzso
