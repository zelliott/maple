Despite the benefits of zzso zzso zzso zzso therapies in breast cancer, many tumors develop zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso is zzso in several types of cancer, and our previous work showed that high expression of zzso in zzso breast zzso was associated with a poor clinical outcome for women on zzso zzso we now probe the role of zzso in zzso resistance, and we examine the functional dimensions and molecular basis that zzso zzso zzso 

From analyses of four independent breast cancer zzso zzso from nearly 400 women, we characterized a gene signature that correlated strongly with high expression of zzso in breast tumors and examined its association with breast cancer molecular zzso and zzso zzso We investigated the effects of altering zzso levels in zzso zzso sensitive and resistant breast cancer cells on the regulation of zzso signature zzso and on cellular signaling pathways and cell zzso zzso 

The gene signature associated with high zzso levels in breast tumors zzso many with functions in zzso and zzso including aurora zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The gene signature correlated with early recurrence and risk of zzso and was found predominantly in zzso B breast zzso the more aggressive zzso molecular zzso The expression of the signature genes was significantly decreased or increased upon reduction or zzso of zzso in zzso breast cancer cells, indicating their zzso zzso also played a critical role in the regulation of zzso with zzso acting upstream of zzso to regulate cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso markedly increased zzso reduced proliferation and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and, importantly, reversed zzso zzso 

This study reveals that zzso is a key zzso marker for risk of failure on zzso therapy and serves a pivotal role zzso growth factor zzso and promoting cell survival and resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso such as zzso should prove valuable in restoring zzso sensitivity and reducing risk of breast cancer zzso
