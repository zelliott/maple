To construct zzso expression zzso expressing full length zzso zzso tumor transforming gene zzso zzso and observe its blocking effect on the potential invasion of human zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso containing designed zzso cut sites were used for cloning full-length zzso gene fragment, and the resulting zzso product was inserted into the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was then zzso into zzso by zzso The positive cell clone was screened by zzso zzso and zzso at protein level expression were detected by Western zzso The biological behavior change of zzso positive cells was observed by colony formation in soft zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso clones zzso expressing full-length zzso zzso were zzso The expressions of zzso and zzso protein in zzso cells were decreased by zzso and zzso respectively as compared with zzso zzso The number of colony formation was reduced significantly in zzso cells as compared with empty zzso zzso and zzso zzso It is concluded that the zzso zzso zzso is a novel tool and provides an alternative zzso gene therapy targeted at zzso in human zzso
