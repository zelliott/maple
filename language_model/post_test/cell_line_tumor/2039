zzso peptides derived from zzso virus C zzso have previously been studied in our group for the development of new systems capable of diagnosing diseases caused by this zzso zzso We also recently described specific zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein of zzso that have the capacity to interfere with the zzso fusion zzso produce a notable decrease in cellular membrane fusion, and zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The present work zzso the design and synthesis of both linear and zzso zzso peptides based on a previously reported zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso fusion zzso were performed to evaluate their diagnostic value to detect zzso zzso in zzso patients, as well as their putative zzso activity as entry zzso Our results showed that chemical modifications of the selected zzso linear zzso to afford zzso architecture do not result in an enhanced zzso of zzso zzso zzso fusion nor improved sensitivity in the detection of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso data reinforce the potential utility of linear versions of the zzso region for the development of new zzso zzso devices for the detection of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso
