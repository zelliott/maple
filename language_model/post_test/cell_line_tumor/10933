zzso modification is one of the important processes during zzso zzso This modification of proteins is either due to direct zzso of proteins by various zzso or due to secondary modification by zzso zzso products, zzso zzso In the here presented work we compare the zzso distribution of protein modification products after treatment of human zzso zzso cells with hydrogen zzso or zzso The treatment with hydrogen zzso leads mainly to a zzso formation of oxidized proteins whereas zzso treatment is forming zzso throughout the zzso zzso we concluded that zzso diffusion distance in cells enables this zzso zzso product to act as a second zzso within the cell and on the other hand is the reason for the zzso properties of this zzso
