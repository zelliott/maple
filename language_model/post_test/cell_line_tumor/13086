The zzso properties of zzso acid zzso make it a promising agent in cancer zzso However, there is limited information on its direct effects on tumor zzso 

zzso zzso and protein expression in soft tissue zzso zzso and bone zzso zzso cell lines were determined by zzso and flow zzso zzso zzso and proliferation zzso were performed using zzso V zzso and zzso incorporation zzso zzso A relative cell zzso was evaluated with zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso proteins were evaluated by Western zzso 

We demonstrate that zzso treatment resulted in a significant decrease in zzso and zzso cell count by inducing zzso and zzso of cell zzso All cell lines examined expressed zzso and the effect of zzso was partially zzso through zzso Several zzso proteins including zzso were activated or increased in zzso cells after treatment with zzso Administration zzso resulted in significant growth zzso of zzso without any zzso adverse effects in mouse zzso tumor zzso 

These results zzso the effect of zzso in zzso and zzso cells and demonstrate that zzso may be a potential therapeutic agent for zzso and zzso
