Although patterns of zzso zzso have been reported for tumor zzso little is known on how they compare with zzso present in zzso zzso A comparison of the two would be crucial to better characterize the genetic zzso driving zzso We zzso the zzso of a zzso zzso and a breast tumor zzso cell line derived from the same patient and compared the zzso zzso present in zzso The zzso zzso presents a comparable number and similar spectrum of zzso zzso to that found in the tumor zzso However, a significant difference in the ratio of zzso to synonymous zzso was observed between both zzso zzso zzso interaction analysis revealed that zzso in the tumor zzso zzso affect zzso zzso and are zzso to present synergistic functions zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that in the tumor zzso most zzso genes were organized into signaling pathways related to zzso No such organization or zzso was observed in the zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso and replication errors can generate the overall number of zzso required to drive zzso and that it is the combination rather than the frequency of zzso that is crucial to complete zzso zzso
