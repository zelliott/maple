zzso C virus zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is a component of the replication complex consisting of several host and viral zzso We have previously reported that human zzso transcript 1 zzso recruits heat shock protein 90 zzso and zzso protein 8 zzso to the replication complex through interaction with zzso To gain more insights into the biological functions of zzso in zzso zzso we assessed the potential zzso activity of zzso because it has significant zzso with zzso zzso which regulates zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso in which the zzso domain was replaced with the zzso domain of zzso exhibited zzso activity comparable to that of the authentic zzso zzso the zzso zzso signaling in an zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso in which the zzso domain was replaced with the zzso domain of zzso resulted in the same level of recovery of zzso propagation as seen in the authentic zzso in cells with zzso of the zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso was zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells exhibited a more potent zzso response zzso than the parental and the cured cells upon treatment with an inhibitor for zzso These results suggest that an zzso zzso zzso incorporating zzso is involved in protein folding in the zzso web for the zzso of the zzso and that it zzso zzso zzso
