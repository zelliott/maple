Exposure to cigarette smoke is well documented to increase zzso stress and could account for higher risk of cervical cancer in zzso zzso zzso zzso that are initiated by human zzso zzso infection generally zzso in the absence of known risk factors such as zzso zzso zzso is a highly zzso zzso DNA zzso that is formed by the zzso of zzso In the present study, we zzso a) the effect of cigarette smoke zzso zzso on zzso formation in and its removal from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso human cervical cancer cells, and b) the cell cycle progression and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso in a zzso zzso and time zzso fashion in zzso zzso cells as determined by flow zzso A zzso higher level of zzso was observed in zzso compared with zzso zzso However, zzso zzso were almost completely removed 72 h zzso in all cell lines as determined by zzso zzso This observation zzso with the zzso and zzso increase in the zzso levels in zzso zzso and zzso cells with no significant change in zzso zzso We conclude that: a) cigarette smoke constituents induce zzso stress with higher burden in zzso cervical cancer cells and b) the significant increase observed in zzso levels in zzso cervical cells zzso zzso and zzso may be attributed to the zzso DNA repair zzso while a zzso zzso in zzso cells cannot be ruled zzso
