zzso zzso zzso has been used for thousands of years in China as a remedy against cancer and inflammatory zzso This study aims to investigate whether zzso zzso extract zzso could inhibit zzso which is the pivotal step in tumor growth, zzso and zzso 

In this study, the extract from the stem of zzso zzso was zzso Mouse zzso zzso cells zzso were treated with zzso in different nontoxic zzso zzso 20, 40, 80, and 160 zzso The zzso and protein expression levels of vascular zzso growth factor zzso were detected by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and Western zzso zzso the active zzso were further tested on zzso mice and human zzso vein zzso cells zzso for any zzso zzso 

zzso significantly inhibited proliferation and induced zzso in zzso cells and inhibited zzso expression at both zzso and protein zzso Furthermore, this agent inhibited the formation of the zzso structure in primary cultured zzso in a zzso zzso In zzso zzso significantly reduced the volume and weight of solid tumors with low adverse effects and decreased tumor zzso 

In zzso zzso could be used to treat zzso zzso The mechanisms of the zzso activity of zzso may be due to its effects against tumor zzso by targeting the zzso zzso
