zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 are efficiently expressed in zzso gut, lung and immune zzso The function and the regulation of these zzso in zzso are still largely zzso We report here that zzso 1 and 2 are expressed in human zzso zzso cells as well as in a human zzso cell line zzso and in rat brain and they are induced by zzso derived growth factor zzso The levels of zzso 1 and 2 proteins and zzso are induced by zzso oxygen species zzso produced by the membrane zzso zzso As to the zzso we find that zzso stimulates membrane zzso zzso to produce zzso which stabilize zzso and 2 zzso and increases the levels of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso or of the other membrane zzso of zzso zzso zzso blocks zzso induction of zzso and zzso These data unravel a novel mechanism of regulation of zzso zzso by zzso and identify a zzso linking zzso zzso activity to zzso and 2 levels in zzso zzso
