The plasma membrane protein zzso zzso vitamin A from its blood carrier zzso binding protein zzso into cells, and it also functions as a zzso zzso which activates zzso zzso We show here that, unlike other zzso zzso zzso of zzso is not simply induced upon binding of its zzso zzso Instead, zzso of the zzso is triggered by zzso zzso of zzso from serum zzso to an zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso The observations also demonstrate that the movement of zzso from zzso to zzso and thus zzso of zzso is critically linked to the zzso metabolism of the zzso Furthermore, the data show that zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso to zzso zzso the observations demonstrate that zzso zzso a zzso zzso that couples vitamin A zzso and metabolism to zzso of a signaling cascade and that, in turn, zzso signaling regulates the cellular zzso of the zzso zzso appears to be a founding member of a new class of proteins that may be termed zzso signaling zzso
