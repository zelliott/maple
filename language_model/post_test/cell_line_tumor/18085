zzso interference zzso technology is emerging as a very potent tool to generate a cellular zzso of a desired zzso The aim of this study was to explore whether zzso targeting vascular zzso growth zzso zzso could inhibit zzso tumor zzso and tumor zzso 

We used zzso zzso to inhibit zzso expression in colon cancer in zzso and in zzso zzso expression was zzso by real-time zzso chain reaction and zzso zzso To establish zzso cell tumor zzso in mice, we zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells in nude zzso after injection, tumors were allowed to grow for 4 weeks until the volume reached zzso zzso The mice were then randomly divided into two groups: zzso the zzso group zzso received direct injection of zzso zzso 50 zzso of zzso into the tumor zzso zzso the control group zzso were injected with zzso in 20 zzso of sterile zzso zzso solution into the tumor zzso zzso growth, zzso and zzso were compared for mice administered either systemic zzso or control over 4 zzso 

The zzso and protein expression of zzso in the colon tumor cell line, zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso were significantly zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso four weeks after injection, the tumor volume were significantly smaller in zzso group than in zzso group zzso zzso vs zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso were significantly inhibited compared with zzso group zzso in zzso group, the number of zzso per microscopic field was zzso and the number of zzso per microscopic field was zzso decreased compared with zzso group zzso and zzso (all zzso 

zzso of zzso expression using zzso gene zzso zzso reduced zzso and zzso zzso zzso and enhanced zzso
