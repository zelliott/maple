Recent evidence suggests that some solid zzso originate from cancer stem zzso We have identified a subset of candidate stem cells, which are termed side population zzso cells, in the zzso zzso cell line zzso Because most stem cells reside in the zzso phase of the cell cycle, zzso cells were isolated, and the relationship between SP cells and zzso cells was investigated to clarify the biological characteristics of zzso zzso 

zzso cells were sorted using zzso zzso and zzso zzso The cells were then divided into zzso zzso and zzso zzso and cultured under zzso conditions to obtain cellular zzso zzso ability was investigated using subcutaneous transplantation to zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells were analyzed for markers indicative of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 19 zzso differentiation and DNA synthesis zzso 

The zzso distribution of cultured zzso cells was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso cells were located within the neck of the SP zzso The zzso cells showed zzso formation and zzso zzso Those cells showed marked zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells, which did not express zzso were zzso positive for expression of zzso and were clearly positive for the expression of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso cells were positive for zzso and zzso expression but negative for zzso zzso 

zzso cells are present in the SP fraction of zzso They show zzso zzso and zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso cells within the zzso cell line are promising candidates as cancer stem cells for future studies of zzso zzso
