zzso processing is carried out by zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso In order to understand the distinct roles of a member of this family zzso gene zzso in cultured cells is an ideal zzso Previous studies showed limited success in either the degree of zzso obtained or the stability of the cell zzso Here we demonstrate the high potential of delta zzso as a zzso gene zzso tool in cultured zzso We used an expression zzso based on the zzso zzso III promoter to establish zzso stable cell lines expressing the zzso zzso zzso transcript targeting zzso zzso Northern and Western zzso zzso showed a specific reduction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of processing effects was tested by measuring the levels of zzso zzso which are present in zzso cells as a result of the unique zzso of zzso zzso by zzso Moreover, a differential zzso analysis confirmed these results and allowed identification of zzso II as a potential zzso of zzso The development of efficient, specific, and durable zzso tools, such as described in the present work, will be of great importance in zzso the functions of the zzso zzso zzso in regard to zzso processing and derived cellular zzso
