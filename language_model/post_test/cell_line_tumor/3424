We have tested a novel hybrid zzso made of zzso zzso zzso and sodium zzso zzso groups, called the zzso zzso zzso on the proliferation of breast cancer and zzso cells as well as zzso effects between these two cell zzso Our results showed that zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso cells and zzso cells in a zzso zzso zzso was zzso more active on highly invasive zzso cells than the zzso parental zzso On zzso cells, which present a less aggressive zzso zzso was only zzso more active than the zzso parental zzso Furthermore, zzso had only a slight effect on the proliferation of primary cultured zzso cells zzso A zzso effect of zzso on tumor cells was observed with cells accumulating in zzso phase after 96 h of zzso In addition, zzso induced a strong zzso effect on the two breast cancer cell zzso zzso media zzso from tumor cells inhibited zzso zzso and this effect was enhanced in the presence of zzso (6 zzso and zzso (10 zzso In addition to this zzso effect, CM from tumor cells induced a zzso early zzso which was increased, zzso in the presence of zzso (15 zzso Thus, this study shows that zzso is a more powerful zzso zzso than its parental zzso zzso with zzso and zzso effects on zzso and zzso tumor zzso Also, both molecules increased a zzso effect of tumor cells on zzso
