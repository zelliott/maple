We investigated, in the panel of 60 human zzso cell lines of the National Cancer Institute zzso whether the zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso were associated to the in zzso zzso of zzso agents, extracted from the zzso zzso For zzso the same study was performed independently on a second panel of zzso cell lines, zzso 

Both zzso were identified in cell DNA using zzso techniques confirmed by direct sequencing and by zzso For the analysis of the results, the zzso status of zzso was taken into zzso 

In the zzso panel, the zzso zzso frequency was zzso and the zzso zzso frequency zzso The zzso zzso were distributed according to zzso equilibrium whereas this was only found, for the zzso zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso results were obtained in the zzso validation zzso The zzso zzso had low impact on zzso drug zzso in either zzso In contrast, the zzso gene zzso had a major impact on zzso drug zzso essentially in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso of the rare zzso was associated to significantly higher zzso protein expression and to increased sensitivity to zzso zzso In the zzso panel, a similar effect of the zzso gene zzso was observed, but was less dependent on the zzso zzso zzso 

We zzso that cell lines zzso the zzso G zzso presented a lower availability of zzso for DNA repair, translating into higher sensitivity to zzso zzso
