The zzso is the site of zzso gene transcription, processing of zzso transcripts and maturation of zzso zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso are also involved in processes as diverse as aging, proliferation control, stress response and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a sensitive marker of both zzso activity and zzso zzso We show that zzso for the zzso zzso zzso is lost from zzso during growth arrest following zzso zzso Surprisingly, before cells enter growth arrest, zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso sites within 4-6 h of zzso zzso zzso is accompanied by segregation of zzso zzso The timing of zzso response zzso well with zzso zzso growth arrest and restoration of zzso However, zzso segregation and zzso zzso occur in the absence of functional zzso and other components of damage response pathways zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Neither zzso nor zzso treatment causes zzso zzso or loss of zzso zzso In marked contrast, treatment of cells with zzso zzso does induce zzso disruption and zzso of zzso suggesting that bulky zzso formation in zzso rather than strand breaks is sufficient to cause zzso zzso Our data reveal a previously zzso cellular response to zzso stress and may reveal novel pathways leading to growth zzso
