zzso is a primary bone tumor with a dismal zzso most patients with this disease develop fatal pulmonary zzso suggesting the need for a better systemic zzso zzso treatment may be useful, because zzso is critical for both tumor growth and zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso is the most potent zzso factor and is regulated by pathways related to the normal zzso response to zzso and genetic zzso related to the zzso zzso Our prior work has shown that zzso is zzso in high grade zzso and zzso cell zzso Working on the premise that zzso pathways giving a selective growth advantage are often zzso in tumors, we investigated the regulation of zzso by zzso and zzso in zzso We tested the hypothesis that there is zzso of zzso gene expression and that decreased zzso expression accounts for at least some of the increased zzso expression seen in zzso We show that reduced expression of zzso in zzso cells increases expression of zzso leading to increased expression of zzso and in zzso zzso Thus, both zzso and zzso expression of a zzso zzso are causes of increased zzso expression in zzso
