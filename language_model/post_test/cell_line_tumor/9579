In this study, we used zzso Box zzso zzso transgenic mice and conditional zzso zzso mice to examine the role of zzso in colon cancer development and zzso 

To induce mouse zzso cancer, we used a single zzso injection of zzso zzso followed by three zzso cycles of zzso zzso sodium zzso zzso water, each cycle separated by 2 zzso For these colon tumor studies, we used either zzso transgenic mice that zzso expressed the human zzso complementary DNA or mice in which the zzso zzso targeted zzso was deleted in zzso zzso cells using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor number and zzso labeling were determined in zzso mice, zzso zzso mice and zzso mice after 12 weeks of zzso zzso We also used zzso small interfering zzso human zzso and mouse zzso colon cancer cell lines to examine DNA replication and zzso zzso 

After 12 weeks of treatment with zzso zzso zzso transgenic mice showed an increase in the number and size of zzso tumors compared with zzso zzso Likewise, a significant reduction in the development and growth of zzso tumors was found in zzso zzso mice compared with zzso zzso mice after zzso treatment, which was associated with decreased expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso factor 4 zzso Moreover, zzso colon cancer cell lines showed reduced DNA replication and zzso zzso 

These studies suggest that zzso is critical for the proliferation and growth of zzso zzso
