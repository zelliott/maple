Despite recent progress, therapy for zzso clear cell zzso cell zzso zzso is still zzso zzso zzso signaling in zzso contributes to tumor growth, but the full spectrum of downstream processes regulated by zzso in this tumor form is zzso 

We show that zzso of zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso dependent gene regulation in zzso zzso Analysis of gene expression data representing 176 zzso showed that elevated zzso zzso activity correlated significantly with shortened disease specific survival zzso test, zzso and patients with zzso disease showed a significantly elevated zzso signaling activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling led to zzso of both zzso and zzso induced zzso signaling in zzso cells, including an extensive set of genes known to be involved in migration and zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso zzso decreased the migratory and invasive capacity of zzso zzso 

An extensive zzso between the zzso and zzso signaling zzso is present in zzso and the functional properties of these two pathways are associated with the aggressiveness of this zzso
