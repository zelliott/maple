zzso of cancer cells is a key zzso of zzso which is correlated with poor prognosis in zzso Evidence shows that cancer cell zzso is regulated by zzso cell zzso To zzso the role of zzso and zzso zzso interaction in migration, a two-dimensional migration zzso has been developed by zzso zzso Two breast cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso were used to develop zzso of cancer cells zzso zzso that revealed distinct migration profiles in this zzso Although the individual migration rates of these cells showed only a zzso difference, zzso islands migrated significantly lower than zzso islands, indicating differential regulation of migration in isolated cells zzso zzso Island size had the greatest impact on migration, primarily for zzso zzso zzso of zzso islands was decreased by interaction with zzso cells, and significantly more by zzso zzso zzso In addition, a mathematical model of island migration in zzso population has been developed using zzso zzso The model showed qualitative agreement with experimental results and predicted a zzso relation between cell zzso and island zzso The combined experimental and mathematical model can be used to zzso study the impact of zzso interactions on zzso
