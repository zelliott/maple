Starting from zzso zzso acid zzso two different imaging zzso zzso zzso targeting zzso are generated simultaneously in zzso and from one zzso This extends the previously introduced labeling strategy of zzso zzso reaction with zzso zzso We demonstrate that chemically active zzso such as zzso acids are not following this labeling zzso zzso the principle of replacing zzso rings by zzso entities, potent zzso zzso zzso Re zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso evaluation on different tumor cell lines revealed low zzso values zzso for these compounds, comparable to their purely organic zzso
