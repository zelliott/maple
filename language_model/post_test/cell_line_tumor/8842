The use of zzso therapies in cancer treatment is rationalized by zzso the efficacy and/or protecting from the major side effects of zzso zzso besides its zzso properties, is an inhibitor for DNA synthesis and repair which might recommend its use as zzso zzso zzso we have studied the effect of zzso in zzso the efficacy of zzso zzso against liver cancer cells and protecting from its zzso cardiotoxic zzso zzso combination with zzso significantly decreased in the zzso of zzso to half its original value in zzso and zzso liver cancer cell zzso The calculated combination index zzso indicated additive type of drug interaction zzso ranged from zzso to zzso Both zzso and zzso significantly blocked the cell cycle in zzso and their combination significantly increased cell cycle zzso Also, zzso combination significantly increase the zzso level compared to zzso treatment zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly protected the zzso membrane integrity and decreased the zzso zzso stress induced by zzso treatment (15 zzso This protective effect was reflected in reverting the zzso and zzso features induced by zzso zzso Also zzso prolonged the median survival time of mice treated with zzso and decreased the mortality risk by zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso significantly zzso the zzso of zzso in liver cancer cells and protected from its zzso
