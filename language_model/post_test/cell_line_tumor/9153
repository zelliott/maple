zzso and zzso are members of the zzso family of small zzso that play essential roles in diverse cellular functions, including cell zzso The activities of these zzso family proteins are controlled by growth factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso a well-documented tumor zzso zzso also controls cell zzso through zzso zzso zzso Using the zzso and zzso binding protein pull-down zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso we showed that treatment of zzso tumor cells with zzso zzso for a short time period significantly inhibited the activity of zzso and zzso but not zzso The zzso site loop zzso within zzso protein is the functional domain involved in the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso deleted or a point zzso in the zzso region lost their zzso zzso We further examined the ability of zzso to inhibit zzso and zzso signaling pathways and zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso led to the zzso of zzso zzso activity as zzso by zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso activity downstream of zzso zzso zzso was also zzso Together, we have identified zzso and zzso as the downstream targets that mediate the zzso of zzso tumor cell migration by zzso
