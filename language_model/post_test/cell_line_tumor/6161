Most cancer vaccines, to date, fail to control established zzso However, their application in preventing tumors is another question that is zzso In the current study, we investigated the zzso memory T cell responses of zzso zzso zzso and its potential to prevent melanoma using both zzso zzso tumor and zzso melanoma zzso We found that zzso zzso human zzso could induce potent zzso responses that zzso with mouse zzso zzso the zzso zzso response consisted of a high number of memory precursors and could be further increased by zzso zzso virus zzso zzso boost, resulting in enhanced zzso memory zzso These long-lasting zzso memory T cells played a critical role in immune surveillance and could rapidly respond and expand after sensing zzso tumor cells to prevent tumor zzso Although zzso response plays a dominant role after zzso zzso both zzso and zzso T cells are responsible for the immune zzso In addition, we surprisingly found that zzso help was not only critical for generating primary zzso responses, but also important for secondary zzso responses of zzso zzso zzso depletion prior to zzso prime or prior to zzso boost substantially reduced the magnitude of secondary zzso zzso and memory responses, and severely compromised the effect of cancer immune zzso More importantly, the zzso memory response from zzso zzso zzso could effectively prevent zzso melanoma in zzso transgenic mice, providing a strong evidence that zzso zzso strategy is an effective approach for cancer immune zzso
