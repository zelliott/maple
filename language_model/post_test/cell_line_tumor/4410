zzso zzso with multiple zzso therapies represents a promising area of treatment for zzso zzso We investigated combining the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso 

Drug combination studies with zzso and zzso were performed on cultured tumor cells and in mouse zzso models of zzso zzso In patients with zzso locally advanced or zzso breast cancer zzso zzso was zzso with a fixed standard zzso dose in a zzso phase zzso study zzso 

Treatment of zzso tumor cells in zzso with zzso plus zzso resulted in synergistic zzso of cell proliferation and induction of zzso cell zzso The presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced the zzso activity of zzso in a subset of breast cancer zzso this effect was reversed by the addition of zzso zzso from mouse zzso models showed enhanced zzso efficacy with zzso and zzso resulting from the unique zzso activities of each zzso In patients with zzso previously treated with zzso zzso and chemotherapy, zzso could be zzso at the maximum tolerated dose zzso zzso zzso every 3 weeks) with standard dose zzso zzso events were mostly grade 1 and 2, with indications of clinical zzso 

zzso targeting of zzso with the combination of zzso and zzso in cell culture and mouse zzso models resulted in enhanced zzso zzso In patients, this combination showed an encouraging safety and zzso profile with preliminary evidence of zzso
