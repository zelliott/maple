zzso is used both for solid tumors and in zzso treatment of various zzso zzso Nevertheless, its development in zzso remains zzso because of the low selectivity of zzso zzso towards human tumor zzso To enhance zzso efficiency, we recently zzso linked a zzso zzso to a plant zzso zzso zzso known to recognize with high affinity zzso T and zzso zzso The zzso allowed a quick zzso of zzso by zzso zzso leukemia cells and efficient zzso zzso The present study was zzso zzso to evaluate the targeting potential of the zzso towards tumor and normal cells and its zzso on various leukemia cells, zzso to investigate the mechanism of zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso strongly increased zzso the zzso zzso towards zzso zzso T cells through an zzso process; zzso specifically zzso tumor cells from a zzso mixture of zzso leukemia zzso and healthy zzso zzso preserving the zzso potential of healthy zzso zzso was effective against various zzso cell lines with distinct zzso as well as fresh human primary acute and chronic zzso leukemia zzso zzso induced mostly a zzso cell death, which might be an advantage as tumor cells often resist zzso cell zzso Altogether, the present observations suggest that zzso with plant zzso can allow targeting of zzso towards zzso zzso of tumor cells, zzso to purge leukemia cells from blood and to preserve the normal zzso in zzso zzso
