zzso zzso is derived from a zzso form zzso by zzso zzso and is a zzso that activates zzso growth factor zzso zzso We have recently shown that zzso zzso from the plasma membrane to the nucleus after zzso of 11 zzso acids at the zzso which is independent of the conventional zzso signaling zzso Although zzso zzso has reportedly been detected in the nucleus of cancer cells, its biological meaning has never been zzso This study was performed to investigate the roles of zzso nuclear zzso in human gastric zzso We constructed zzso truncated 11 zzso acids at the zzso zzso that spontaneously zzso to the nucleus, and established zzso zzso gastric cancer cells zzso zzso using the zzso zzso Using these cells, we found that zzso nuclear zzso significantly induced zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso the relationship between zzso zzso of zzso and the clinical outcome for 46 advanced gastric cancer cases treated with chemotherapy, median survival time was 311 days in 16 patients with zzso zzso in the nucleus and zzso days in 30 patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The present study demonstrates that zzso nuclear zzso increases resistance to zzso drugs, which might be associated with poor prognosis in human gastric zzso
