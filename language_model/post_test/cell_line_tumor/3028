Four zzso zzso peptides named zzso A, B, C and D were designed and zzso on the basis of zzso insect zzso from two zzso The zzso peptides maintained bacterial membrane disruptive activity similar to the original peptides and also showed various zzso of growth zzso activity against different cancer cell zzso Of these zzso zzso B exhibited the highest selective cancer cell zzso against the mouse myeloma cell line, zzso zzso zzso and scanning electron microscopic analysis revealed zzso B zzso mouse myeloma membrane construction, whereas no zzso effect on normal zzso was zzso Moreover, a strong correlation between zzso charged zzso zzso density in cancer cell membrane surface and sensitivity to zzso peptides were observed in various cancer cell zzso These results suggest that zzso peptides have negative zzso selective cancer cell zzso targeting zzso in the cancer cell zzso In addition, zzso growth zzso activity against mouse myeloma was observed in combinations of zzso B and zzso These results suggest zzso peptides are promising candidates for novel zzso zzso
