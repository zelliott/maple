zzso zzso of central nervous system zzso zzso cells in the brain of live animals is a powerful method to determine the functions of these cells and to reveal novel avenues for the treatment of several zzso zzso To achieve this goal, we generated a line of transgenic rats expressing a bacterial zzso zzso coli zzso gene zzso under control of the zzso zzso In this system, zzso cells are selectively eliminated upon application of zzso zzso through zzso of programmed cell death zzso At 5 days of age, which is a time when zzso development is zzso transgenic rats bearing the zzso fluorescent protein zzso gene are overtly normal and express zzso in zzso stem cells, without any toxicity in these zzso The functional consequence of zzso cell zzso was demonstrated by administering zzso zzso into the zzso at this zzso time zzso Stem cell zzso in these zzso resulted in zzso zzso zzso zzso overall reduction in zzso zzso and manifestation of zzso In adult rats, zzso expression was not seen in the zzso zzso cells and seen only at very low levels in the lateral zzso indicating a different zzso expression pattern between zzso and zzso In addition, application of zzso by zzso delivery reduced the number of zzso zzso cells in the lateral zzso but not zzso of zzso zzso These findings shows that targeted expression of zzso under a specific promoter might be of significant value in addressing the function of distinct cell population in zzso
