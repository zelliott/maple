zzso zzso class zzso located near the zzso zzso zzso is a family of zzso class zzso molecules zzso outside the zzso which displays the highest sequence similarity to human zzso molecules among known class I zzso In the present study, we show that the two members of the mouse zzso family, zzso and zzso are zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso and that cell surface expression of zzso or zzso does not require functional TAP zzso zzso and zzso molecules expressed in bacteria could be zzso in the presence of zzso without adding any zzso zzso neither zzso nor zzso is likely to be involved in the presentation of zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso is expressed in a zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells and a restricted region of inner root zzso in hair zzso The present study provides additional evidence that zzso is a class I family distinct from zzso
