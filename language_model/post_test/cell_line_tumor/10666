zzso zzso zzso is a zzso brain tumor characterized by diffuse zzso of single cells into the brain zzso which is a process that relies in part on zzso zzso and zzso interactions between tumor cells and the brain zzso zzso zzso A major obstacle to understanding zzso regulation of zzso invasion is the absence of model zzso systems that zzso the distinct composition and physical structure of brain zzso while allowing independent control of adhesive zzso density, mechanics, and zzso To address this need, we zzso zzso zzso based on zzso acid zzso with a range of zzso that encompasses normal and zzso brain tissue and zzso these materials with short zzso zzso peptides to facilitate cell zzso zzso electron zzso of the zzso revealed a dense, zzso zzso with apparent zzso zzso similar to brain zzso zzso On flat zzso zzso zzso cell spreading area and zzso stress fiber assembly increased strongly with increasing density of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso under constant zzso density produced similar trends and increased the speed of random zzso In a three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso cells invaded zzso zzso with zzso patterns distinct from those observed on flat surfaces or in zzso zzso zzso but highly reminiscent of those seen in brain zzso This material system represents a zzso model zzso with zzso zzso density and zzso amenable to investigations of the zzso regulation of brain tumor zzso
