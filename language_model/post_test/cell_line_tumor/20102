Small cell lung cancer zzso is an aggressive zzso distinct from zzso cell lung cancer zzso in its zzso potential and treatment zzso Using an zzso zzso and zzso analysis, we investigated molecular differences contributing to the distinct clinical behavior of zzso and zzso zzso showed lower levels of several zzso zzso zzso and decreased zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways but significantly increased levels of zzso factors including zzso of zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA repair zzso In addition, zzso a DNA repair protein and zzso zzso was highly expressed at the zzso and protein levels in zzso zzso growth was inhibited by zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso was significantly more sensitive to zzso zzso than were zzso and zzso zzso zzso key components of the DNA repair machinery and enhanced the efficacy of zzso 

zzso is a highly lethal cancer with a zzso survival rate of less than zzso To date, no zzso targeted agents have prolonged survival in patients with zzso As a step toward identifying new targets, we systematically zzso zzso with a focus on zzso relevant signaling zzso Our data reveal fundamental differences in the patterns of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso and identify several potential therapeutic targets for zzso including zzso and zzso On the basis of these results, clinical studies evaluating zzso and zzso zzso together with chemotherapy or other agents, warrant further zzso
