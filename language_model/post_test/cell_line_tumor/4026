zzso is an aggressive breast cancer zzso that does not express hormone receptors zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso or amplified human zzso growth factor zzso type 2 zzso and there currently exist no targeted therapies effective against zzso zzso finding new molecular targets in triple negative breast cancer zzso is critical to improving patient zzso Previously, we have detected the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and observed that targeting zzso signaling zzso zzso growth both in zzso and in zzso In this study, we explored how zzso contributes to zzso zzso using the zzso zzso progression series, which models breast zzso from zzso zzso to zzso zzso breast zzso We observed that zzso is expressed in human breast cancer and that in zzso cells, which model zzso zzso zzso but not in zzso cells, which model zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso results in increased zzso zzso growth, and zzso In contrast, zzso zzso results in a decrease in these activities in zzso zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso of zzso signaling in zzso cells results in a decrease in proliferation and zzso zzso Finally, zzso of zzso cells, which express zzso using a zzso construct expressing zzso results in transformation to zzso in zzso of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso with other factors in zzso zzso zzso to contribute to zzso progression and therefore propose that zzso signaling represents a promising new molecular target for zzso zzso
