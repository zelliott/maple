The zzso of cell proliferation by zzso zzso zzso was evaluated in zzso against 4 cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso selected for their resistance to zzso zzso zzso and zzso and their zzso zzso zzso is a novel zzso compound obtained years ago within a research project of Organic zzso aimed at zzso zzso zzso Because of its chemical structure, zzso was suggested to interact with zzso zzso in particular DNA, and the other cellular zzso This hypothesis made us consider zzso as a candidate for studies concerning its zzso zzso We used the zzso zzso to test the zzso of cell proliferation after incubation of the cell lines with zzso for 72 zzso For comparison, resistant and zzso cell lines were also tested against those zzso drugs used in zzso for their zzso In these culture conditions zzso retained its zzso activity against all resistant cells with zzso values similar to those obtained in corresponding zzso cell zzso Moreover, zzso was twice as effective as zzso against zzso zzso zzso Our previous findings about the interaction of zzso with DNA through the formation of zzso zzso suggested a mechanism of action similar to that of zzso agents or zzso zzso zzso zzso Our present data obtained by the zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells showed that zzso is not able to form a stable zzso complex as is the case for zzso zzso In conclusion, our results indicate that zzso is able to overcome some of the classical mechanisms of resistance selected by some zzso drugs mainly used in clinical zzso
