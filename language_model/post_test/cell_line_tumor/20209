The zzso zzso complex zzso plays important roles in regulation of cell cycle zzso zzso is an essential core zzso of the zzso and has a DNA binding region zzso zzso which consists of two zzso zzso zzso separated by a short zzso We generated various zzso zzso such as zzso deletion zzso and investigated their zzso zzso and effects on cell zzso zzso zzso was predominantly localized in the zzso We identified two nuclear zzso signals zzso both of which were required for nuclear zzso of zzso Interestingly, deletion of one zzso domain resulted in an increased zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso accumulated in the nucleus after zzso B treatment, suggesting zzso nuclear export of zzso Point zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso domain that abolish DNA binding activity also increased zzso zzso These data suggest that DNA binding activity of zzso is required for its nuclear zzso We also found that zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibited cell cycle progression and led to abnormal nuclear zzso Other zzso zzso also induced similar abnormalities in cell cycle zzso zzso zzso led to a decreased expression of some zzso zzso whose expressions are regulated by zzso This cell cycle zzso was partially restored by zzso of zzso zzso These results suggest that abnormal cellular zzso of zzso may have effects on zzso zzso
