More than 80 years ago Otto Warburg suggested that cancer might be caused by a decrease in zzso energy metabolism paralleled by an increase in zzso zzso In later years, it was shown that cancer cells exhibit multiple zzso in zzso content, structure, function, and zzso We have zzso zzso the zzso zzso protein zzso in several colon cancer cell zzso These cells have increased zzso zzso as shown by concurrent increases in zzso activity, zzso membrane potential, cellular zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso hypothesis, we found that zzso cells also have decreased growth rates and increased population doubling times, show inhibited colony formation capacity in soft zzso zzso and exhibit a reduced capacity for tumor formation when injected into nude zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso leads to an increased zzso of the tumor zzso zzso zzso protein zzso as well as decreased zzso of zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results support the view that an increase in zzso metabolism induced by zzso zzso may inhibit cancer growth in zzso
