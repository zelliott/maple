zzso disease is a severe progressive neurodegenerative disorder caused by a zzso expansion in the zzso zzso which encodes zzso The disease primarily affects the zzso and cerebral zzso and also associates with increased zzso of zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso transport and insulin zzso by direct interference with zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso in zzso zzso without altering stored levels of zzso Using zzso we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we demonstrate that the speed of insulin zzso trafficking is zzso Using zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in combination with mass zzso we reveal an enhanced and zzso interaction between zzso zzso and zzso zzso the underlying mechanism of impaired zzso zzso Thus, our findings have revealed a novel zzso process by which zzso zzso may disrupt hormone zzso from zzso and possibly impair zzso transport in any cell that expresses the zzso zzso
