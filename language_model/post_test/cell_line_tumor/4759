zzso and zzso have been used to treat zzso prostate cancer with some zzso In zzso data suggest that the combined zzso may be sequence zzso Thus, we explored the combined effects of the 2 agents, both in zzso and in zzso 

The combined zzso of zzso and zzso and the possible schedule dependence were studied in zzso using zzso and zzso cells and the zzso zzso zzso There were 23 patients with zzso prostate cancer treated with the regimen zzso zzso 90 zzso zzso 1 hour on days 1 and zzso zzso 2000 zzso and zzso 300 zzso intravenous 24-hour infusion on days 2 and 9, which repeated every 21 zzso The allowed percentage of bone zzso zzso was zzso 

zzso synergistic zzso was seen only when zzso was given 24 hours before zzso With the zzso regimen, 11 zzso of the 21 zzso patients had zzso or zzso 50% reduction of zzso zzso lasting for 6 zzso Of the 7 patients with measurable disease, 2 had a partial zzso Median overall survival was zzso zzso Grade zzso zzso occurred in 2 zzso There was no zzso zzso zzso were well zzso 

The combined zzso of zzso and zzso is schedule zzso It is feasible to administer weekly zzso and high-dose zzso infusions in patients with zzso prostate zzso Our findings may serve as an important rationale for future trial zzso
