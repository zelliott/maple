zzso zzso treatment is used in chronic zzso leukemia zzso but resistance to zzso develops in association with accelerated repair of zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is located at DNA zzso break zzso zzso zzso it recruits and retains zzso zzso This damage can be repaired by zzso DNA zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso repair zzso zzso A key component of zzso is the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso Increased zzso activity is associated with resistance to zzso in zzso We used the specific zzso inhibitor zzso zzso to sensitize zzso cells to zzso Our results indicate that in a zzso cell line zzso and in primary zzso zzso plus zzso has synergistic zzso activity at nontoxic doses of zzso zzso treatment results in zzso phase arrest, and zzso increases this zzso zzso zzso Moreover, a kinetic time course demonstrates that zzso zzso activity was inhibited by zzso providing direct evidence of the ability of zzso to inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso were enhanced 24 to 48 h after zzso and further increased by zzso plus zzso suggesting that the zzso of the combination is zzso by zzso zzso of zzso with subsequent zzso of zzso zzso
