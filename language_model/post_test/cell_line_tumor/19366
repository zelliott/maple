We report an extensive zzso relationship zzso of 62 compounds active against two drug-resistant colon cancer cell zzso Our comprehensive evaluation of two generations of compounds zzso zzso zzso and molecular modeling to evaluate the key zzso features of potent zzso Of the seven most potent compounds reported here, five are zzso emphasizing our ability to incorporate potent features found in the first generation and zzso their structures to design potency into the second zzso These zzso share no structural zzso to current colon cancer drugs, are zzso at levels on par with existing drugs treating other zzso and demonstrate selectivity for drug-resistant colon cancer cell lines over zzso cell zzso Thus, we have established zzso A as an excellent lead for treating multiple drug-resistant colon zzso
