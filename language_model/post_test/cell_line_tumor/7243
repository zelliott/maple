A growing body of evidence indicates that zzso of cerebral zzso zzso zzso zzso and their interactions with zzso and zzso zzso may contribute to the Alzheimer's zzso pathology, and thus metal zzso could be a rational therapeutic approach for zzso zzso zzso However, poor target specificity and consequential clinical safety of current zzso agents have limited their widespread clinical zzso To develop the next generation of metal zzso we have designed and zzso a new zzso zzso based on a novel zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso has both zzso and zzso zzso zzso connected by zzso zzso It achieved a putative binding geometry with zzso zzso by the zzso chemistry modeling and reduced zzso zzso zzso in zzso as determined by zzso Moreover, our pilot data indicated that zzso has no significant zzso at low zzso zzso and acute animal zzso zzso specifically reduced zzso protein expression in human zzso zzso cells and attenuated cerebral zzso zzso pathology in zzso transgenic mice without inducing apparent toxicity and behavior zzso zzso these preliminary findings carry implication for zzso being a zzso lead compound for zzso zzso targeting Alzheimer's zzso although further studies are zzso
