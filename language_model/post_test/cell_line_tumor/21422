zzso zzso zzso represents a highly zzso tumor entity and the process of zzso is essential for the growth of zzso zzso the zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso have been implicated in zzso zzso thus representing interesting targets for molecular targeted zzso We hypothesized that therapeutic zzso of zzso could be achieved by using a novel zzso agent zzso zzso is an analog of zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso 

The human zzso cell lines zzso and zzso were used for zzso zzso of zzso on zzso and zzso zzso growth zzso zzso of signaling zzso including zzso and zzso were investigated by Western zzso Changes in zzso expression were determined by real-time zzso zzso of zzso on cancer cell migration and invasion were evaluated in in zzso The zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso were determined in a subcutaneous tumor model zzso 

zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso and zzso was dramatically reduced by zzso which resulted in lower zzso zzso expression zzso zzso zzso In addition, tumor cell migratory and invasive properties were significantly inhibited zzso zzso zzso for zzso In zzso treatment with zzso led to a significant reduction in tumor growth, tumor zzso and numbers of zzso tumor cells zzso zzso zzso for zzso 

The novel zzso zzso agent zzso is suitable for zzso zzso and zzso in human zzso cells and leads to reduced tumor growth and zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso could prove valuable for therapy of zzso zzso
