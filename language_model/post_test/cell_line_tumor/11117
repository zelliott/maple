To explore a new method in the gene therapy of human zzso 

The zzso zzso and F gene of the zzso disease virus were cloned into the zzso by zzso The human zzso zzso zzso model in nude mice had been established by transplantation of the zzso cell zzso The nude mice had been grouped two in the third week of the zzso cell line had been zzso The zzso of the zzso and the zzso and zzso were injected into the tumor in the experimental group, the equal weights zzso was injected into the tumor in the control zzso The zzso and zzso changes of zzso were observed under light and electron zzso The zzso DNA were extracted from all tissue of the nude mice, the DNA was tested to do template by zzso whether or not exist the zzso zzso The nude mice zzso were examined by the method of zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso of the DNA zzso 

There were statistically significant difference in the mice weight, the tumor weight, the tumor volume and the restrained tumor rate between the experimental group and the control group (each P zzso zzso A nude mouse died in the control group, the others were very zzso The tumor looked like zzso and the tumor surface were zzso The tumor in the experimental group were smaller than that in the control group, the tumors were round shape and hard and not zzso on the skin and deep part zzso The necrosis and zzso of the tumor cell had been found under light and electron zzso The zzso gene had not been explored in all tumor tissue by zzso in the experimental zzso The experimental group was positive in zzso The control group was zzso 

The zzso zzso and F gene could play a role in treating zzso
