In cultured cells, zzso and serum provide constant sources of energy and growth factors, both of which are important for cell survival and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso plays a key role in sensing zzso zzso levels and acts as a critical regulator of energy zzso To investigate the relationship between energy status and zzso activity in lung cancer, zzso cells were starved in either zzso or zzso medium and then zzso with zzso and serum, zzso The levels of zzso and zzso and the activities of zzso and zzso zzso zzso were analyzed at different time zzso During zzso treatment, the activity of zzso was induced by zzso and showed zzso reaction zzso The zzso level was gradually increased up to zzso compared with that in serum treatment after zzso and zzso level was decreased to approximately zzso The zzso activity slightly increased and reached a peak after zzso During serum treatment, the activity of zzso was suppressed and the zzso level showed a dramatic zzso increase after zzso In contrast, the zzso level was gradually increased and then reverted to the background level after zzso The activity of zzso was slightly decreased after zzso and eventually returned to the background zzso This study showed the zzso of energy status in lung cancer cells in response to altered levels of zzso and zzso We suggest that the zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso might be exploited as therapeutic tactics in cancer zzso
