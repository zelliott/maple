zzso zzso gastric cancer zzso is a highly zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso A detailed understanding of the regulation of its liver zzso is zzso zzso nuclear factors zzso are implicated in the zzso regulation of zzso in the fetal zzso To investigate the regulatory role of zzso in zzso the expression of zzso including zzso binding protein zzso zzso zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso and zzso was investigated in 3 cell lines of zzso and 7 cell lines of control zzso The liver zzso protein zzso an zzso zzso of zzso was predominantly expressed in zzso whereas the liver zzso protein zzso an zzso zzso of zzso predominated in the control zzso zzso was relatively suppressed in zzso zzso was expressed in one of three zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso were expressed at the same levels in both cell types of zzso zzso expressed a set of zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso while they still retained the several zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso The induction of zzso reduced zzso expression and induced zzso expression in an zzso zzso Collecting these results, it was suggested that the contribution of zzso especially zzso of zzso is possibly important in zzso regulation of zzso
