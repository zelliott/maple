zzso V zzso is a common tool in zzso zzso However, in zzso growing cell lines, substantial experimental bias could be introduced by membrane damage during the harvesting zzso We investigated the influence of three different harvesting methods on the cell membrane integrity of six zzso cell zzso 

Six zzso cell lines were detached zzso by standard zzso or mechanically by scraping or zzso by water zzso zzso damage was measured by zzso V zzso 

Three out of six cell lines zzso zzso and zzso zzso were not susceptible to membrane damage long the zzso used zzso In zzso 29, zzso 1 and zzso cell lines, a high percentage of cells were stained positively for zzso V after mechanical zzso These cells would wrongly be declared zzso zzso 

To avoid substantial experimental bias caused by membrane damage, we recommend zzso of different harvesting methods before performing zzso zzso
