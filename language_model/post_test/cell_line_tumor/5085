Identification of novel zzso and zzso targets for prostate cancer zzso is crucial to better diagnosis and zzso We sought to identify novel zzso zzso zzso zzso that are expressed in zzso absent in zzso human zzso and zzso for immune responses restricted by human zzso 

Using zzso analysis of normal and zzso human prostate zzso we identified zzso genes zzso in zzso After zzso 195 transcripts in publicly available array data sets, we interrogated expression of these zzso in normal human zzso to identify genes that are not expressed at zzso levels in normal, zzso adult human zzso We identified 23 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed that 15 of these genes were zzso in zzso zzso zzso for zzso The most frequently zzso zzso single-minded zzso 2 zzso was selected for further evaluation as a potential target for zzso zzso zzso revealed that a fraction of zzso patients exhibited immune responsiveness to zzso as evidenced by the presence of zzso to zzso in their zzso We next showed binding of putative zzso zzso zzso to human zzso and zzso of transgenic zzso mice showed induction of zzso zzso responses in zzso 

Our findings that zzso is selectively expressed in zzso that human zzso zzso zzso induce specific T cells in zzso and that zzso zzso are zzso in zzso patients' zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso that is a suitable potential target for zzso zzso
