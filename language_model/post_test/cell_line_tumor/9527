Human zzso type 18 zzso is frequently detected in cervical cancer zzso The viral proteins E6 and zzso are expressed consistently and have zzso zzso The zzso protein binds to a tumor zzso the zzso gene product zzso however, leading to the stabilization of tumor zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, another viral product, zzso forms complexes with zzso and abrogates its function, resulting in tumor zzso These facts imply that the E6 zzso is one of the ideal targets for directed gene therapy in zzso cervical zzso In this study, we tried zzso zzso regulation of the zzso E6 expression using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso strategy effectively zzso the zzso death of zzso cervical cancer cells through the selective repression of E6 zzso and zzso stabilization of zzso zzso zzso signals potentially activated the zzso function and mobilized the zzso zzso to deliver zzso signals to the cancer cells, leading to the suppression of in zzso zzso An extremely low concentration of zzso in addition to zzso further zzso zzso activity, provoking massive zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso strategy has the great therapeutic potential in zzso cervical zzso
