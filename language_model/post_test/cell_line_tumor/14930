Axis zzso protein 1 zzso is a negative regulator of zzso signaling via regulating the level of zzso However, the role of zzso in the zzso and progression of zzso B virus zzso zzso zzso zzso is less zzso zzso sequence analysis, zzso and Western zzso were performed on 22 zzso zzso samples and corresponding zzso liver zzso to detect zzso in zzso gene and the expression level of zzso Human zzso cell lines zzso and zzso were zzso with zzso or zzso zzso zzso The growth curve and zzso rate of cell lines, zzso of zzso and cell cycle regulatory proteins depending on zzso zzso activity were zzso We identified four zzso of zzso in 22 primary zzso zzso and demonstrated a lower expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso than that in paired adjacent zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso but not zzso zzso inhibited the growth of zzso cell lines, accelerated their zzso and zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso Our study revealed that zzso of zzso were involved in zzso zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso zzso regulated zzso zzso activity and zzso the level of cell cycle regulatory zzso suggesting that zzso may be a potential target for gene therapy of primary zzso
