As a continuous study we prepared several zzso zzso zzso zzso and evaluated for the pharmacological activity and mode of zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso test, compound 4 showed strongest zzso activity among the compounds at 10 zzso zzso activities of the compounds are in the order of 4 zzso zzso 4) zzso 1 zzso zzso 3) zzso 5 zzso zzso 5) zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso zzso 4) zzso 7 zzso zzso 3) zzso 9 zzso zzso 5) zzso 10 zzso zzso 6) where zzso is the number of carbon in the zzso side chain in ring C and compounds zzso have additional zzso group in ring A compared to compounds 1, zzso zzso 4 showed efficient zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, which are higher than zzso zzso 4 was also an zzso human zzso zzso zzso inhibitor with partially blocking human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso into zzso zzso 4 induced much less DNA damage than zzso in zzso human zzso zzso zzso Overall, compound 4 can be a potential zzso agent acting as zzso zzso zzso inhibitor with low DNA zzso
