zzso zzso zzso zzso containing repeated zzso linkages on the zzso backbone was zzso through zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso could spontaneously form zzso zzso complexes through zzso interactions with zzso in an zzso zzso These zzso were rapidly zzso under the reductive zzso environment with subsequently releasing the zzso cargo into the zzso where zzso takes place, as a result of the breakdown of zzso bonds in the zzso The reductive degradation behavior of the zzso zzso is more likely to increase zzso activity with enhancing the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso may have great potential as a gene carrier especially for therapeutic applications of zzso zzso to the reductive degradation zzso
