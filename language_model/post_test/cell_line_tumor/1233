zzso such as zzso zzso can mimic zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso through binding the zzso zzso zzso and modulating target gene zzso In the present study, we compared global gene regulation by zzso and zzso in zzso responsive zzso human breast cancer cells derived from the zzso cell zzso The zzso cells zzso zzso zzso were exposed to zzso zzso or zzso zzso for zzso followed by analysis of global gene zzso More than 40 transcripts were significantly changed in zzso cells, with many being unique to zzso At least 15 genes were modulated by zzso in the zzso zzso cell line, indicating zzso independent zzso zzso quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction zzso we confirmed zzso and zzso zzso regulation of four selected zzso A consensus zzso zzso responsive element zzso was found in the zzso syndrome protein zzso zzso which zzso responsiveness to zzso and zzso in a reporter gene zzso zzso stimulation was seen only in zzso expressing cells, thus indicating a functional zzso Taken together these data illustrate novel gene regulation by zzso and zzso which has implications for in zzso actions and previous reports of additive and synergistic effects on breast cancer cell zzso
