Based on the assumption that molecular mechanisms involved in zzso are characterized by groups of zzso expressed zzso we developed and validated a novel method for analyzing zzso data called zzso Gene Set Analysis zzso Using 50 extracted gene sets we identified three different profiles of tumors in a cohort of 364 zzso large zzso zzso and related mature aggressive zzso zzso other than zzso zzso The first profile had high level of expression of genes related to proliferation whereas the second profile exhibited a zzso and immune response zzso These two profiles were characterized by a large scale gene zzso affecting genes which were recently shown to be zzso zzso and which were enriched in zzso zzso energy metabolism and zzso zzso The third and novel profile showed only low global gene zzso similar to that found in normal B cells but not cell zzso Our study indicates novel levels of complexity of zzso with low or high large scale gene zzso related to metabolism and zzso and, within the group of highly activated zzso differential behavior leading to either a zzso or a zzso and immune response zzso
