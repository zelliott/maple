The aim of this study was to investigate the zzso effect of a zzso inhibitor zzso on zzso a cell line of human tongue zzso cell zzso zzso cells were treated with 10, 20, and zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso rate was determined with zzso zzso zzso double zzso zzso of zzso zzso was determined by zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso protein was assessed by zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso was observed zzso after zzso zzso The zzso rate in the 10, 20, and zzso zzso group was zzso zzso and zzso respectively, which was higher than in the zzso zzso zzso or control group zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso in the 10, 20, and zzso zzso group was zzso zzso zzso respectively, which was lower than in the zzso zzso zzso or zzso or control zzso zzso or zzso zzso The levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein in the zzso groups were higher than in the control group ( zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells in a zzso zzso The zzso zzso may involve zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso
