zzso selective therapy for zzso zzso zzso remains an zzso medical zzso In present study, we found that the tumor zzso zzso zzso was significantly zzso in a proportion of primary zzso zzso (12 of 33, zzso and zzso cell zzso In line with this finding, we have engineered a zzso zzso fiber zzso zzso zzso by introducing eight copies of zzso target sites zzso into the 3' untranslated region of zzso a key gene associated with zzso zzso The results showed that the zzso expression (both zzso and protein zzso of the zzso was tightly regulated according to the zzso expression level of the zzso As contrasted with the zzso zzso and the control virus, the replication of zzso was distinctly inhibited in normal liver cells lines zzso zzso and zzso expressing high level of zzso zzso zzso whereas was almost not impaired in zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso with low level of zzso zzso the zzso of zzso to normal liver cells was successfully decreased while was almost not attenuated in zzso cells in zzso The zzso ability of zzso zzso was maintained in mice with zzso zzso zzso whereas was greatly decreased against the zzso zzso tumor expressing a high level of zzso similar with zzso when compared to the zzso zzso These results suggested that zzso may be a promising zzso agent or zzso to mediate the expression of therapeutic zzso broadly zzso in the treatment for zzso and other zzso where the zzso gene is zzso
