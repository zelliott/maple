zzso consisting of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is the most common type of zzso in zzso Currently, there are no targeted drug therapies available for zzso In searching for new molecular therapeutic targets, we carried out zzso small interfering zzso zzso library screens targeting human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso initially against an zzso cell line, zzso Sixteen zzso and 50 zzso were identified based on growth zzso after 72 zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso had the most remarkable impact on growth zzso zzso zzso and zzso on all three zzso cell lines tested, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas there was no effect on normal muscle zzso The loss of zzso expression and subsequent growth zzso correlated with decreased zzso and zzso zzso Increased expression of zzso 1 was also zzso The induction of zzso after zzso zzso was confirmed by increased zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Ewing's zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso models were also highly sensitive to zzso zzso Finally, based on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso in 10 of 10 zzso cell lines and in zzso and 51% of primary zzso (17 of 36 zzso and zzso (21 of 41 zzso tumors, respectively, compared with normal zzso Similarly, pediatric Ewing's zzso zzso and zzso tumors expressed high zzso We conclude that zzso could be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of a wide range of pediatric solid tumors including zzso
