zzso is a zzso expressed by some zzso zzso It promotes zzso and protects some tumor cells from complement system zzso In the present study, we show for the first time the in zzso expression of zzso by breast cancer cells by zzso in patients' zzso Moreover, we demonstrate high expression and zzso zzso of zzso in the aggressive zzso breast cancer cell zzso zzso exhibited a strong zzso zzso in these cells, zzso at the cell periphery in a thread of filaments near the cell zzso but also in zzso zzso zzso was zzso from zzso medium of zzso cells, and represented the major zzso zzso by these cells, having a molecular size of zzso 250 zzso and carrying zzso zzso side zzso mainly composed of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited early steps of both the classical and the zzso pathways of complement by binding to zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in less aggressive zzso breast cancer cells induced their zzso zzso growth, migration and zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso lacking the zzso attachment sites failed to promote these cellular functions, suggesting that zzso of zzso is a zzso for its zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso promotes a more aggressive cancer cell zzso and may protect breast cancer cells from complement attack supporting their survival and zzso
