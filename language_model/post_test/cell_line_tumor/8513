zzso zzso in human class I major zzso complex zzso products zzso have recently been shown to correlate with zzso disease progression or zzso An identical zzso zzso (at zzso zzso in the mouse class I product zzso influences stability of the zzso To gain insight into the human zzso here we examined zzso zzso stability, and structures of the corresponding zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso genes in a cell line that is zzso competent showed that zzso was expressed at higher levels than zzso consistent with enhanced stability of zzso zzso To further examine zzso capacities of these two zzso zzso we used a high affinity zzso specific probe to zzso examine a collection of zzso and foreign peptides that bind to zzso zzso bound more effectively than zzso to most zzso although zzso bound more effectively to two zzso The results support the view that many zzso in the zzso system (or the zzso zzso would exhibit enhanced binding to zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso the zzso complexes would influence zzso selection behavior, zzso the zzso repertoire of these individuals, and could also impact peripheral T cell activity through effects of zzso interacting with zzso and/or zzso The structures of several zzso and zzso complexes provided a framework of how this single zzso could impact zzso zzso
