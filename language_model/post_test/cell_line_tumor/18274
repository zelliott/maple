Previous studies have firmly demonstrated that zzso a naturally occurring zzso extracted from the root of the Chinese herb medicine zzso zzso could effectively inhibit the proliferation of several cancer cell zzso However, little is known about the effect of zzso on differentiation induction of zzso zzso Here we investigate the potential role of zzso in the proliferation and differentiation of zzso a human zzso leukemia cell line derived from a patient with acute zzso zzso Our results indicated that zzso significantly suppressed the proliferation and efficiently induced the differentiation of zzso zzso zzso cell growth was inhibited by zzso after treatment with 50 zzso zzso for a period of 5 zzso The results of the zzso zzso zzso reduction test (with zzso positive cells by 50 zzso zzso for 5 zzso zzso zzso (with zzso positive cells by 50 zzso zzso for 5 zzso and the expression of zzso zzso differentiation zzso zzso and zzso (with zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells by 50 zzso zzso for 5 zzso demonstrated an increase in the zzso action of zzso on the zzso cells, which was accompanied by an increase in zzso and protein expression of zzso zzso 1 zzso Meanwhile, the level of zzso zzso delta zzso was dramatically increased in zzso treated zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso treatment displayed little effect on the zzso of zzso zzso Taken together, the results reported here demonstrated that zzso could promote the zzso differentiation of zzso cells by zzso the expression of zzso zzso
