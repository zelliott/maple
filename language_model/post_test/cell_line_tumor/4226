Although it is becoming clear that certain zzso zzso a fundamental role in the regulation of the zzso transition zzso a comprehensive study of the zzso associated with this process has yet to be zzso Here, we zzso the signature of zzso expression in an in zzso model of zzso zzso expressing in zzso cells one of seven zzso zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso or the zzso zzso zzso In this way, we identified a core subset of zzso zzso that were further validated in zzso studying zzso zzso zzso a zzso entity that represents an extreme example of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso through DNA zzso of zzso genes of the zzso family and zzso that are zzso during zzso was evident in both the in zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso models of zzso The strong correlation between expression and DNA zzso suggests a major role for this zzso mark in the regulation of the zzso zzso
