To date, efforts to study zzso therapies, such as zzso have been limited due to the lack of stable zzso expressing transformed zzso lines and animal zzso We describe generation and zzso of cell lines that zzso express zzso both in zzso and in zzso 

By limiting zzso we have established several clones of zzso zzso cell line that express surface zzso zzso and zzso characterization of these clones was zzso In zzso usefulness of the zzso cell line to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of zzso zzso was investigated using a zzso mouse zzso zzso 

zzso expression of zzso was confirmed in cells cultured in zzso up to 52 weeks of continuous zzso The functional integrity of the expressed zzso zzso was shown using zzso which induced zzso effects in zzso in the zzso but not the zzso zzso Compared with control zzso zzso treatment in zzso zzso mice resulted in significantly increased median zzso zzso levels of zzso direct zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso delivery of synthetic zzso zzso in zzso clone and primary zzso zzso leukemia cells implicated potential in zzso application of this model for evaluation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso therapeutic zzso 

These results show the in zzso utility of the cloned zzso cell lines that zzso express high levels zzso The zzso zzso mouse model described zzso using these stable cell lines can serve as an excellent system for in zzso therapeutic and zzso evaluation of existing and novel zzso directed against zzso zzso
