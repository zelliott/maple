zzso viruses have emerged as a novel class of potent zzso agents offering an improvement on zzso and zzso in terms of tumor targeting and reduction of zzso Among these agents, autonomous zzso have attracted the attention of researchers for their ability to zzso replicate in and kill transformed cells, and to suppress tumors in the absence of adverse reactions in various animal zzso We have previously shown that lethally zzso zzso tumor cells can support zzso zzso production and serve as carriers to deliver progeny zzso into the vicinity of lung zzso in a rat tumor model, resulting in zzso infection of and zzso in zzso zzso It is known that zzso zzso zzso cells can also act as a therapeutic vaccine against the original zzso Yet the ability of these cells to suppress zzso in the above model was found to be much increased as a result of their zzso zzso This prompted us to determine whether zzso zzso the zzso capacity of the zzso vaccine by increasing its zzso potential and/or by making it a factory of zzso viruses able to reach and destroy the zzso Both effects could be zzso in the presence of zzso zzso which either prevent the progeny viruses from spreading to zzso cells, or zzso the zzso zzso cells from the immune zzso This strategy revealed that the zzso infection of tumor cells enhanced their ability to trigger an immune response for which zzso tumor cells could be the targets, thereby amplifying and taking over from the direct viral zzso zzso This dual zzso effect of zzso holds out promises of clinical applications to cancer zzso
