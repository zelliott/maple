zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso are a possible molecular target for cancer zzso zzso is frequently amplified in zzso and 30 to zzso of zzso also express the deletion zzso zzso This frequent zzso zzso provides an opportunity for identifying new zzso zzso In this study, we sought small zzso zzso specific for cancer cells expressing zzso using zzso parental cells without zzso as a zzso 

A screen of the zzso small zzso diversity set identified one compound, zzso which consistently inhibited growth of different human zzso cells expressing zzso but permitted normal growth of matched control zzso zzso had no previously established medicinal use, but has a zzso structural zzso Further experiments showed this compound increased zzso in cells with zzso and moderately affected the expression of zzso independent of any changes in zzso levels or in zzso zzso 

These initial results suggest that zzso or a closely related structure might be further investigated for its potential as an zzso drug, although its precise molecular mechanism is still zzso
