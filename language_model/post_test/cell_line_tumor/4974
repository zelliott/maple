zzso zzso protein zzso factor 1 alpha 2) is a protein translation factor that is likely a human zzso by virtue of its capacity to transform zzso cells and its high expression in tumors of the zzso breast and zzso Here, we show that expression of zzso is sufficient to stimulate the formation of zzso in zzso human breast cancer cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso formation in zzso cells is dependent on the activity of zzso zzso zzso and the ROCK and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso expression is sufficient to activate zzso in a zzso fashion and zzso of zzso by short interfering zzso reduces zzso zzso Using breast cancer cell line zzso zzso we show that zzso expression stimulates cell migration and invasion in a largely zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso regulates zzso through zzso and zzso zzso zzso
