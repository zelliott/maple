zzso is a human gene previously described by our group to exert important functions in cancer cells of different zzso We now performed zzso gene expression profiling with subsequent network modeling to further zzso the role of zzso in breast cancer zzso zzso the effect of zzso zzso on the zzso of zzso cells, we found 151 zzso expressed genes exhibiting more than twofold changes, 97 of which were zzso and 54 zzso Most of the zzso genes were zzso genes associated with poor zzso invasion and zzso building an zzso network of zzso target zzso On the other hand, network analysis identified the zzso genes to be primarily involved in zzso signaling and cellular zzso zzso these network data, we observed that cells with reduced levels of zzso exhibited an impaired response to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The data of this study suggest that zzso might exert a zzso function in breast cancer and that its loss might zzso relative resistance of breast cancer cells to zzso zzso
