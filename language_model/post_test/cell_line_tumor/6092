Little is known about the ability of zzso C virus zzso to alter early innate immune responses in infected zzso Previous studies have shown that natural killer zzso cells are functionally impaired after interaction of zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso in zzso however, the functional consequences of a prolonged contact of zzso cells with zzso particles have remained zzso We have examined the zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells from healthy donors and zzso zzso zzso patients after culture for 5 days with zzso zzso zzso and serum samples containing zzso zzso zzso zzso cells from healthy donors and chronic zzso patients were found to zzso receptors associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso receptors from the killer cell zzso zzso family zzso predominantly having an zzso function, were significantly zzso after culture in the presence of zzso particles compared with control cultures of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso significantly higher zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso necrosis zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso the zzso potential of zzso cells from normal donors and zzso The enhanced zzso of zzso cells after prolonged culture with zzso or zzso zzso for 5 days suggests that these innate zzso cells may play an important role in viral control during early zzso of zzso zzso
