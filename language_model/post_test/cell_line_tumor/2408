The majority of human breast zzso exhibit zzso zzso zzso However, most aggressive behavior, including invasion and zzso cancer stem cell activity, are considered characteristics of zzso zzso We asked the following questions: Must zzso breast cancer cells become zzso to initiate tumors or to zzso Could zzso differentiated cells within a zzso initiated hierarchy also be zzso To answer these questions, we used rare and mutually exclusive lineage markers to isolate zzso of zzso and zzso cells from human breast zzso We enriched for populations with or without prominent zzso traits from individual tumors or single cell cloning from cell lines and recovered cells with a zzso zzso zzso cells with zzso traits zzso zzso and functional behavior associated with stem cells assessed by gene zzso zzso formation and lineage zzso zzso cells without zzso traits, surprisingly, were fully capable of initiating invasive tumors in zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso In fact, these zzso pure zzso cells generated larger and more invasive tumors than their zzso zzso The zzso and invasive potential of the zzso cancer cells relied strongly on the expression of the gene zzso which encodes a key zzso controlling zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso cells, as defined zzso are not a requirement for breast tumor zzso and that within a single tumor there are multiple zzso cells with zzso potential casting some doubt on the hypothesis of zzso or zzso loss of zzso
