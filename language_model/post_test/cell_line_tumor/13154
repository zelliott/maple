It was shown that cancer cells acquired resistance to zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso protein zzso induced zzso of human zzso zzso cells in the first hours after cell zzso at a concentration of zzso zzso while in zzso cultures these cells acquire resistance to protein zzso even at the concentration of 2 zzso zzso and suspending of the cells of zzso cultures immediately suppressed the resistance to zzso The cells of zzso cultures, being resistant to zzso zzso continue progression through the cell cycle, as evidenced by the DNA zzso and the zzso reporter zzso Thus, the results showed that tumor zzso cells can acquire resistance to zzso zzso in zzso cultures, while continue progression through the cell cycle, keeping the zzso zzso
