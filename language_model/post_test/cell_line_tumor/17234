zzso zzso zzso through the zzso vessels is a critical step in determining the outcome of zzso cancer patients, and prognosis should be improved by preventing zzso zzso zzso However, experimental models for zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso are not zzso We developed an zzso transplantation model to study this process in nude mice using the human zzso zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were selected in zzso in nude mice by repeated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso formation and zzso the zzso cells in zzso Because this model seems to zzso to the advanced clinical stage of zzso zzso it should be useful in understanding the molecular biology of zzso zzso and in the development of therapeutic zzso against zzso zzso zzso
