In human breast cancer, a growth status switched from zzso to growth zzso is a critical step during development of acquired tamoxifen zzso However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this switch remain poorly zzso The zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein zzso that functions as a zzso zzso High levels of the zzso expression have been associated with de zzso tamoxifen zzso The goal of this study was to investigate the function of zzso in acquired tamoxifen zzso 

A stable zzso cell line zzso was established by selecting zzso breast cancer zzso cells in a medium containing zzso Western zzso cell growth zzso and zzso method were used to examine the role of zzso in acquired tamoxifen zzso 

zzso cells expressed zzso zzso and zzso at higher levels compared to zzso parental zzso zzso zzso cells responded zzso to zzso zzso grew rapidly in the absence of zzso and were insensitive to zzso We also established stable cell lines from zzso cells to express zzso specific for zzso and found expression levels of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to be zzso in zzso cells with zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso cells with zzso expression zzso by zzso still retained tamoxifen zzso 

Our results indicated that zzso is involved in zzso regulation of the zzso family members and zzso during development of acquired tamoxifen zzso
