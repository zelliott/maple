zzso zzso requires zzso zzso to zzso to exert its deleterious zzso We compared the respective roles of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the formation of zzso and zzso respectively, in intact zzso cells manipulated to express either zzso zzso formation was confirmed by zzso and zzso measured by zzso In zzso zzso cells zzso zzso the zzso zzso product zzso increased over zzso h to a constant zzso In zzso zzso zzso formation of zzso was elevated for zzso h but significantly decreased after 24 zzso Interestingly, zzso were also detected in zzso zzso even though they do not zzso express zzso zzso Northern and Western zzso confirmed the induction of zzso by zzso in parental cells and the induction of zzso by zzso in zzso zzso zzso induction was blocked in zzso zzso by the zzso inhibitor zzso the zzso scavenger zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso induction in these cells was verified by measuring a decrease in zzso zzso Our studies show that the formation of zzso by zzso in human zzso cells leads to an induction of zzso and that a functional consequence of this induction is elevated zzso production as detected by increased zzso zzso zzso the role of zzso in the zzso of zzso is zzso that is, it directly activates zzso to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and it indirectly zzso the zzso gene by generating the zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso zzso zzso
