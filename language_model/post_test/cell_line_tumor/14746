DNA zzso produced by zzso zzso capture therapy zzso and those produced by gamma radiation in a colon zzso cell line were zzso We have also derived the relative zzso effectiveness factor zzso of the zzso beam of the zzso Argentine nuclear reactor, and the compound zzso effectiveness zzso values for zzso zzso and for zzso zzso IX zzso 

zzso growing human colon zzso cells zzso were distributed into the following groups: zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso alone, and zzso gamma rays zzso source at 1 zzso zzso Different zzso times were used to obtain total absorbed doses between zzso and 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso flux zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The frequency of zzso zzso cells and the number of zzso per zzso zzso cells showed a zzso increase until approximately 2 zzso The response to gamma rays was significantly lower than the response to the other treatments zzso zzso zzso The zzso with zzso alone and zzso + zzso showed zzso that did not differ significantly from, and showed less DNA damage than, zzso with zzso + zzso A decrease in the surviving fraction measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso as a function of the absorbed dose was observed for all the zzso The zzso and zzso factors calculated from zzso block zzso zzso and zzso zzso were, respectively, the zzso beam zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1; zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and gamma zzso showed different zzso zzso To our knowledge, these values represent the first experimental ones obtained for the zzso in a zzso model and could be useful for future experimental studies for the application of zzso to colon zzso
