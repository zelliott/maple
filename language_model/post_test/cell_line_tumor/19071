The mechanisms and biological implications of coordinated zzso zzso zzso zzso remain poorly zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso are frequently zzso in zzso including those associated with zzso growth factor zzso zzso such as zzso zzso In a previous analysis of the zzso zzso we found that two zzso zzso transforming growth zzso and zzso zzso growth zzso growth factor zzso are prominently zzso by zzso in human zzso zzso We now report that stimulating human zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso biologically relevant zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso increased 6 to 24 h after cell stimulation with zzso and temporally coincided with the induction of transforming growth zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in response to zzso was inhibited by zzso and zzso D, consistent with a requirement for DNA zzso and zzso zzso Specifically, blocking zzso binding to zzso with the zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso by zzso to zzso and inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso also inhibited zzso zzso cell proliferation but had no effect on zzso zzso These findings establish that zzso can be activated with functional consequences by zzso as a result of zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso expands our understanding of zzso zzso zzso signaling networks and may have considerable consequences for zzso mechanisms and cancer zzso
