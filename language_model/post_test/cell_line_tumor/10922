The relationship of plasma membrane zzso properties to the zzso effect of zzso zzso was investigated in zzso zzso cell lines with sensitivity to growth zzso parallel zzso zzso selected for resistance, and one zzso zzso zzso mobility of surface differentiation zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were measured by zzso recovery after zzso zzso The mean diffusion zzso D, values for two clones of zzso resistant zzso cells were significantly higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than for parental sensitive cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the plasma zzso were zzso by electron spin resonance zzso zzso These results also indicate a greater degree of molecular zzso freedom in resistant zzso Treatment of sensitive zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso consistently increased mean values of D and the degree of zzso zzso freedom, whereas no significant differences were detected in resistant zzso The effect of zzso on the membrane potential zzso of zzso cells was zzso by flow zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso potential of all clones was similar zzso to zzso zzso Treatment with zzso for 8-10 zzso caused zzso in the sensitive cells zzso up to 45 zzso but only minimal zzso in the resistant ones zzso up to 7 zzso We concluded that sensitivity to zzso and treatment with zzso are related to the zzso status of plasma zzso
