zzso gene therapy zzso by gene transfer of the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso gene followed by zzso zzso treatment has been reported to inhibit zzso tumor growth in a variety of zzso The magnitude of zzso zzso is an essential factor for this zzso approach in zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso brings zzso zzso is poorly zzso In this report, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were transferred to the human zzso zzso zzso line zzso cell zzso The zzso cells zzso was monitored using zzso resonance energy transfer zzso zzso First, zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells zzso was monitored using zzso zzso The zzso was induced by zzso and initiated by zzso The zzso efficient was remarkably decreased and then disappeared during cellular zzso which indicated that the zzso expressing zzso cells zzso induced by zzso was via a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mixed expressing zzso cells zzso induced by zzso were monitored using zzso zzso The zzso phenomena appeared in the zzso zzso zzso The results show that zzso system killed zzso cells using its bystander zzso These results confirm that zzso system is potential for cancer gene zzso
