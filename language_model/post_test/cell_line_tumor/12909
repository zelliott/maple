The intrinsic zzso of pancreatic cancer zzso is caused by multiple zzso signaling zzso In contrast to combining radiation therapy zzso with targeted therapeutic zzso whose blockade can be zzso by redundant signaling zzso we evaluated the combination of zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso by zzso was analyzed using zzso survival zzso zzso was evaluated using flow zzso and zzso DNA repair was evaluated using zzso assessment of zzso zzso zzso and zzso for DNA repair zzso zzso zzso proteins were measured by zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso 

zzso significantly zzso zzso cells to radiation, but zzso zzso did not contribute significantly to the observed zzso However, zzso inhibited DNA damage repair by targeting key DNA repair proteins and also zzso zzso pathways responsible for zzso aggressiveness and zzso Specifically, the zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso and nuclear factor zzso pathways were shown to be induced by radiation and inhibited by zzso 

zzso zzso the zzso effects of zzso by zzso zzso responses of zzso cells zzso by zzso and DNA repair pathways and promises to be a clinically relevant adjunct to zzso for treatment of zzso
