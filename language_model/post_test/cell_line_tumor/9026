zzso melanoma remains one of the most invasive and highly drug resistant zzso The over expression of zzso protein zzso has been associated with inferior survival, poor prognosis and zzso of zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso has demonstrated efficacy in several forms of zzso However, the efficacy of zzso depends on zzso Because the over expression of zzso is frequently observed in melanoma, specifically targeting of zzso may overcome the resistance of zzso In this study, we investigated the effects of zzso a novel zzso zzso alone and in combination with zzso on the survival of human melanoma zzso 

For cell viability assessment we performed zzso zzso zzso was determined using western zzso and flow zzso zzso 

The treatment of zzso reduced the cell viability of melanoma cells with an zzso of between zzso zzso Further, treatment of melanoma cells with zzso showed significant decrease in zzso zzso We found that zzso was able to induce zzso in melanoma cells in a zzso zzso Moreover, zzso induced zzso degradation via the zzso system, which was associated with its zzso zzso We also found that zzso treatment increased zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso markedly enhanced the efficacy of zzso against melanoma cells in both two- and three-dimensional zzso 

Taken together, these results suggest that targeting of zzso by zzso may represent a new therapeutic strategy for melanoma treatment that warrants further investigation as a single therapy or in combination with other agents such as zzso zzso
