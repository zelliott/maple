zzso is a zzso analog currently in Phase I trials for advanced cancer as a zzso and in combination with a number of approved zzso zzso The use of zzso as a target for zzso therapy is based on findings that cells zzso zzso excessively when induced to grow and that zzso metabolism is frequently zzso in zzso A selective zzso transport system provides access for zzso into rapidly dividing cells to inhibit zzso zzso zzso to induce the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which could subsequently induce zzso oxygen species that contribute to tumor cell responses to zzso and to function as a zzso with altered function when it binds to natural zzso binding zzso The objective of the present study was to assess the zzso effects of zzso alone and in combination with approved zzso zzso 

The zzso efficacy of zzso as a single agent, and in combination with zzso and zzso was tested in models of lung zzso and prostate zzso cancer, zzso 

zzso significantly inhibited tumor development in both lung and prostate cancer models when administered as a single zzso In the lung cancer model, zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso Although potent activity was observed with zzso and zzso when administered as single agents in the prostate cancer model, the combination arm significantly enhanced zzso activity compared with either agent zzso In all experiments, zzso was well tolerated with no adverse effects on zzso zzso 

The zzso data support the rationale for the current Phase I trials which are assessing zzso as a zzso and in combination with a number of approved zzso agents including zzso and zzso
