The zzso of zzso by human zzso was investigated in the presence of high (40 zzso and low (5 zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso nickel, zzso and zzso zzso zzso of metal zzso and zzso complexes will be formed and the zzso of zzso zzso could be correlated with the calculated complex zzso to investigate competition between zzso For each metal, the calculated zzso of zzso complex giving 50% zzso of zzso zzso were similar at both 5 zzso and 40 zzso zzso zzso appeared to have a much higher affinity for the binding site than the other zzso complexes, which had similar affinities to each zzso Studies of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso by the addition of zzso confirmed that zzso does act as a zzso for the zzso in a similar fashion to the other metals zzso In addition, human zzso cells zzso zzso were used as a model for zzso precursor zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The other metals zzso with zinc in a similar manner to that seen in zzso and the affinity for zzso was much greater than for the zzso complexes of the other three zzso Both the capacity for metal transport per cell, and the affinity of the zzso for the zzso complexes, were much greater in the zzso cells than in the zzso It is suggested that zzso metal transport may play a role in the supply of metals to maturing zzso zzso
