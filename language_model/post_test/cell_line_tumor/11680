Nuclear hormone zzso family member zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso zzso Previous studies have shown zzso has zzso activities upon zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the clinical pathological significance of zzso zzso is not completely understood in human breast zzso zzso is zzso and its frequent amplification and zzso correlated with the grade of zzso In this study, the role of zzso zzso and zzso expression was investigated in human breast cancer zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed on zzso zzso sections of 70 zzso Furthermore, Western zzso and zzso zzso analysis were used to study the relationship between expression of zzso zzso and zzso expression in human breast cancer cells in zzso zzso showed that the expression of zzso zzso was positively correlated with zzso expression zzso zzso zzso and correlated significantly with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and pathological grade zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso can provoke zzso zzso of zzso upon zzso mechanisms in human breast cancer cells by zzso zzso technology and zzso zzso zzso Using zzso interference technology, we also found that zzso zzso reduced the zzso level of zzso and significantly reversed zzso nuclear export of zzso in zzso zzso The changes in the zzso zzso of zzso may represent a novel target for selective interference in patients with breast zzso
