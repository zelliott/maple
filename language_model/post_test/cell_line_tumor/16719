To study the effect of the zzso zzso 1 zzso inhibitor zzso zzso in combination with zzso drugs zzso zzso zzso on the proliferation of gastric cancer cells zzso in zzso and to evaluate whether zzso zzso could be used as zzso agents in zzso 

zzso cells were incubated in zzso with zzso (1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso at different zzso in combination or separately for 24 zzso The effects on the growth and survival of zzso cells were determined by zzso zzso The zzso rates were assessed by response surface analysis and the interactive relationships between the combined drugs were evaluated on the basis of zzso values of the cross product zzso in the response surface zzso 

The growth zzso rate of the gastric cancer cells by treatment with zzso (1 zzso was zzso zzso zzso The growth zzso rates of the gastric cancer cells treated with zzso zzso 5 and 25 zzso for 24 h were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The growth zzso rates of the gastric cancer cells treated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for 24 h were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The growth zzso rates of the gastric cancer cells treated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for 24 h were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso There were significant differences among the zzso rates caused by different zzso of the drugs zzso zzso zzso When 1 zzso zzso was used in combination with zzso zzso 5, and 25 zzso for 24 zzso the growth zzso rates of the cancer cells were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso When 1 zzso zzso was used in combination with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for 24 zzso the growth zzso rates of the cancer cells were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When 1 zzso zzso was used in combination with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for 24 zzso the growth zzso rates of the cancer cells were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There were also significant differences among the growth zzso rates caused by different zzso of the drugs alone and in combination groups zzso zzso zzso 

zzso can suppress the proliferation of zzso cells in zzso and there are evident zzso effects when it is used in combination with zzso zzso The results of this study indicate that zzso zzso may become novel and promising zzso zzso
