zzso zzso is an inherent impediment to cancer treatment that is both clinically significant and zzso In this study, we conducted a zzso screen to identify small molecules that could reverse the zzso resistance of hypoxic cancer zzso Among the compounds, we identified were a structurally related group that zzso hypoxic cancer cells to zzso by zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of these proteins in hypoxic cancer cells and tumors increased levels of zzso and decreased expression of zzso and the central zzso response regulator zzso factor zzso zzso In mice, these compounds zzso the hypoxic tumor cell death induced by zzso chemotherapy, blocking zzso and tumor zzso Taken together, our findings suggest that zzso zzso of zzso and zzso augment the zzso sensitivity of hypoxic tumors, and they offer zzso validation of a novel and readily zzso strategy to improve cancer zzso
