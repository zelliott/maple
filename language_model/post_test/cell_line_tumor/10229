zzso belongs to a group of zzso proteins (including zzso and zzso that share characteristic tandem zzso zzso zzso and can be rapidly induced by multiple zzso zzso has been shown to regulate vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso stability in zzso zzso primary zzso zzso zzso has also been documented as a negative regulator of zzso during development, but nothing has yet been reported in the context of human zzso The Von zzso zzso tumor zzso protein regulates zzso gene expression at both the zzso and zzso levels in zzso However, whether it can do so in zzso is still zzso Here, we report a unique regulatory function of zzso in zzso expression in zzso that is zzso through zzso of zzso protein levels in zzso cancer zzso In zzso we detected increased expression of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso cancer cell line zzso We also show that this increased expression of zzso decreased zzso protein expression by zzso regulation in zzso In contrast, in zzso increased zzso expression paralleled an increased zzso zzso stability in zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso in zzso may be important for zzso gene expression: we observed a zzso of zzso zzso in zzso in zzso cells compared with parental zzso cells, and this effect was zzso by zzso zzso zzso
