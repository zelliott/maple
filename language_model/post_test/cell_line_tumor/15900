The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates many fundamental zzso zzso To identify novel zzso zzso we used a recently developed zzso zzso screen zzso zzso zzso to detect interactions among membrane zzso This screen led to the identification of many novel zzso zzso including the putative membrane protein zzso protein 147 zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso is highly zzso among zzso but its zzso roles are unknown at zzso We initially demonstrated that zzso could be zzso with zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso imaging studies showed that zzso was localized to zzso zzso zzso zzso and that the zzso interaction occurred in the zzso of zzso zzso cells, resulting in impaired trafficking of the zzso to the cell zzso To study the role of zzso in modulating zzso function in a more zzso relevant setting, we carried out studies with zzso human colon cancer cells that zzso express zzso and zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso a zzso stable zzso zzso promoted zzso cell proliferation and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Small interfering zzso zzso of zzso expression significantly zzso the zzso effects of zzso on zzso cell proliferation and zzso zzso These effects were associated with an increase in the density of cell surface zzso Our data clearly indicate that zzso represents a potent negative regulator of zzso function, most likely by interacting with zzso in an zzso compartment zzso These findings may lead to new strategies aimed at modulating zzso activity for therapeutic zzso
