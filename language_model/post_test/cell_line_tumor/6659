zzso blocks zzso zzso gap zzso and two zzso zzso domain zzso zzso are essential for this zzso zzso To further examine the molecular basis for block, we zzso a portion of a basic zzso acid zzso motif on the zzso zzso zzso Replacement of the zzso zzso + zzso zzso with the zzso + A16 sequence native to zzso zzso zzso gap junctions increased the equilibrium zzso constant zzso and reduced the maximum zzso by zzso The corresponding electrical distance zzso approximation was decreased by about zzso The zzso zzso zzso gating of zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso gap junctions was also significantly zzso The minimum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased from zzso to zzso with an increase in the zzso zzso from 48 to 60 zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso zzso 160 zzso was only slightly altered, and the relative zzso zzso and zzso ratios were unchanged from zzso zzso gap junction zzso The relative zzso zzso zzso ratio increased from six to ten when zzso was reduced to zzso of zzso These data suggest that the zzso motif at positions 15-17 is important to the zzso structure of the putative zzso sensor and zzso zzso of zzso without causing significant zzso of the zzso surface charge zzso that contribute to the zzso selectivity of this gap junction zzso
