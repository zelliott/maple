zzso zzso is highly abundant in liver and a zzso zzso There is evidence to show that zzso expression is zzso in human zzso zzso zzso It is not known whether zzso affects the cellular behavior of zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of zzso on the viability and zzso of zzso zzso zzso AND zzso The viability and zzso of zzso and zzso cells treated with zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso flow zzso and terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso zzso The zzso coding genes in both cell lines were zzso zzso Although two putative promoter sequences for the zzso gene at zzso were zzso the zzso coding sequence was missing in zzso cells, which might be the reason for the absence of zzso zzso There was no significant difference between the zzso of zzso cells zzso with zzso and mock zzso cells zzso zzso However, the viability of zzso zzso with zzso was significantly elevated at 24, 36, and 48 h zzso compared with that of mock cells zzso zzso Both the flow zzso and zzso zzso showed that the zzso level of zzso zzso with zzso was significantly decreased at 48 h zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the viability but zzso the zzso of zzso cell zzso The absence of zzso expression in zzso cells was due to the loss of the zzso coding sequence in zzso zzso These results imply that zzso expression of zzso may contribute to zzso
