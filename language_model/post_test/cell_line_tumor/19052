Although zzso zzso zzso has revolutionized the treatment of chronic zzso leukemia zzso some patients develop resistance with progression of zzso Alternative or additional targeting of signaling pathways zzso in zzso zzso cells may provide a feasible option for improving clinical response and overcoming zzso In this study, we show that zzso zzso an orally zzso calcium influx and signal zzso zzso is equally effective in zzso the proliferation and zzso zzso and zzso pathways in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of cellular proteins including zzso and zzso at zzso that induce zzso in zzso zzso zzso The combination of zzso and zzso also zzso zzso protein zzso Since zzso is already available for clinical use, these results suggest that it may be an effective addition to the zzso of drugs for the treatment of zzso
