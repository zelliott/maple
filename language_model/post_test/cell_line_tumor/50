To add to the understanding of the properties of zzso carbon zzso in biological applications, we report a zzso pH sensitivity of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso carbon zzso zzso zzso zzso in human zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso linkage and localized zzso pH changes are proposed as zzso zzso zzso may serve as zzso pH zzso
