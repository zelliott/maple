The zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso binds many aromatic hydrocarbon compounds and mediates their zzso We demonstrate that the zzso zzso physically associates with the zzso zzso complex in a zzso zzso The zzso zzso which is known to interact with several nuclear hormone receptors through its zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter gene activity in an zzso zzso zzso of zzso substantially reduces zzso zzso zzso from the mouse zzso zzso gene zzso Both zzso and zzso (another zzso of zzso are recruited to the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso fashion in zzso and zzso zzso motifs are not zzso zzso rapidly and persistently associates with the zzso but not the promoter of the zzso gene after zzso treatment with similar zzso as zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso Our findings demonstrate a novel role for zzso in zzso zzso that differs mechanistically from its role in zzso regulation by other previously studied zzso zzso
