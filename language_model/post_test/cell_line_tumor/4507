A growing body of evidence suggests that zzso stem cells zzso account for tumor zzso therapy resistance, and the subsequent regrowth of zzso Thus, continuous efforts have been undertaken to further characterize this zzso of less differentiated tumor zzso Although we are able to enrich zzso we still lack a comprehensive understanding of zzso zzso and zzso The advent of zzso technologies raised hope that incorporation of these newly developed platforms would help to tackle such zzso Since then a couple of comparative zzso zzso and zzso studies on zzso have been conducted giving new insights in zzso zzso However, lessons had to be learned in designing zzso experiments and some of the resulting conclusions fell short of expectations because they were performed on only a few zzso lines or at one molecular level instead of an zzso zzso zzso Despite these shortcomings, our knowledge of zzso biology has markedly expanded due to a number of zzso zzso as well as zzso signaling pathways and therapeutic targets being zzso In this article we review recent findings obtained by comparative zzso analyses of zzso We further zzso fundamental concepts of systems biology as well as its applications for zzso stem cell zzso
