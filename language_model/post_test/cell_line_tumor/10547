Japanese encephalitis virus zzso a zzso zzso causes acute encephalitis with high mortality in zzso We used a pair of virulent zzso and attenuated zzso zzso of zzso to pull down the cell surface molecules bound with zzso zzso their identities were revealed by zzso zzso One major protein bound with zzso and zzso with zzso was identified as the intermediate filament protein zzso zzso of zzso but not that of zzso was blocked by zzso zzso and by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression reduced the levels of viral binding and viral production of zzso but not that of zzso The different zzso dependency for zzso infection could be attributed to the major structural envelope zzso as the zzso zzso with an zzso zzso became resistant to zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso mainly depended on cell surface zzso for viral binding and it became zzso only when binding to zzso was zzso Thus, we suggest that zzso contributes to virulent zzso infection and might be a new target to intervene in this deadly zzso
