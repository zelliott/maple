zzso profiling in zzso models of cellular transformation involving either breast zzso cells or zzso reveals that expression of zzso is lower in transformed cells than in zzso zzso The zzso factors Max and zzso bind directly to the zzso promoter and inhibit zzso expression during zzso zzso zzso cellular transformation by directly targeting the 3' untranslated regions of zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso controls zzso growth in soft zzso through zzso whereas it affects invasive growth through zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso diverse but not all cancer cell types, and it zzso tumor growth in zzso and zzso zzso Finally, expression of zzso is zzso correlated with zzso and zzso in human colon zzso Thus, a zzso in which Max and zzso inhibit zzso zzso thereby zzso the zzso and zzso zzso is important for distinct aspects of cellular zzso as well as tumor growth and colon (and perhaps other types zzso zzso
