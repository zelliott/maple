A mathematical model for fractional tumor cell survival was developed incorporating components of cell killing due to direct radiation interactions and bystander signals resulting from zzso dose zzso 

Three possible mechanisms for signal production were tested by fitting predictions to available experimental results for tumor cells zzso cell lung cancer zzso and melanoma zzso exposed to zzso zzso zzso The zzso fitting allowed zzso of the contribution of bystander signaling to cell death zzso for all zzso zzso of the two components of cell killing allowed determination of the zzso and zzso parameters of the zzso model both with and without the presence of bystander zzso 

For both cell lines, cell death from bystander signaling and direct radiation interactions were zzso For zzso cells, the values for zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively when direct and bystander effects were combined, and zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively when the signaling component was zzso For zzso the corresponding respective values were zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the combined response, and zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the isolated direct radiation zzso The bystander component in cell death was found to be significant and should not be zzso Further experimental evidence is required to determine how these results translate to the in zzso situation where tumor control probability zzso models that currently assume cellular independence may need to be zzso
