zzso and zzso experiments have illustrated that the family of zzso regulatory factors is necessary and sufficient for the formation of skeletal zzso Furthermore, zzso required cellular zzso to induce zzso in zzso zzso zzso stem zzso To determine the mechanism by which stem cells can be directed into skeletal muscle, a time course of zzso cell differentiation was examined in the presence and absence of zzso zzso By quantitative zzso the first zzso zzso transcripts were the zzso zzso factors zzso zzso zzso and zzso on day 4 of zzso zzso the zzso markers zzso zzso and zzso were zzso leading to skeletal zzso These results were zzso by Western zzso analysis, showing zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso prior to zzso protein zzso To determine at what stage a zzso zzso zzso could inhibit zzso stable cell lines were created and zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso factors, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and as expected, skeletal zzso was zzso Finally, to identify direct targets of zzso in this system, zzso zzso experiments were zzso zzso was observed associated with regulatory regions of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, zzso directs stem cells into the skeletal muscle lineage by binding and zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso prior to zzso zzso zzso
