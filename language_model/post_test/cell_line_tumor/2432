Discovery of mechanisms that impede the aggressive and zzso zzso of human zzso zzso breast zzso zzso could provide novel targets for therapy for this form of breast cancer that has a relatively poor zzso Previous studies have demonstrated that expression of zzso the master zzso regulator of zzso zzso zzso can reduce the zzso and zzso propensity of the human zzso zzso cell line zzso although the mechanism for reduced zzso was not zzso We demonstrate through gene expression profiling that zzso expression in 231 cells resulted in the dramatic reduction in the expression of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso in part, through zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso was further confirmed in the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso reduction of zzso expression by small interfering zzso in zzso zzso cells increased zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression in zzso cells restored zzso zzso A strong inverse association between zzso and zzso expression was confirmed in a panel of 51 human breast cancer cell zzso Similarly, human breast cancer zzso data demonstrated that high zzso zzso expression is associated with the zzso zzso of breast cancer and poor patient zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso to a less aggressive zzso and zzso a major mechanism of zzso through zzso of zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells or novel approaches that inhibit zzso expression or activity could be important strategies for treating zzso
