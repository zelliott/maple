The aim of the current study is to probe the zzso potential of seven zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso of zzso on the production of key zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The results demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso and zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso NO and zzso release in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed considerable zzso of zzso beta production in zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso production was significantly inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso in a concentration dependent zzso The results revealed that zzso zzso and zzso significantly decreased zzso release in zzso activated zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso properties of the zzso was investigated on zzso induced zzso production zzso zzso and zzso release zzso zzso zzso The results showed that only zzso and zzso showed marked zzso effect on zzso production, however, only zzso exerted zzso zzso towards zzso zzso zzso this study indicates that some of these zzso exhibit potent zzso effects by modulating different zzso zzso zzso these zzso might provide useful zzso treatment against variety of inflammatory and allergic zzso
