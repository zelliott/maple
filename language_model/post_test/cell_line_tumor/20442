zzso is a highly invasive cancer of central nervous system diagnosed mainly in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are over expressed in several zzso and well established for their roles in tumor zzso The present study is aimed to determine the consequences of targeting these molecules on zzso zzso 

zzso is one of the zzso methods applied for treating cancer and considerable evidence showed that radiation elevated zzso and zzso expression in zzso zzso Therefore efforts are made to target these molecules in zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso zzso of zzso and zzso either alone or in combination with radiation modulated a series of events leading to zzso Down regulation of zzso and zzso inhibited the expression of zzso molecules like zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activated zzso zzso enhanced the expression of zzso and zzso zzso C to zzso zzso and -9 activities were also increased in zzso and zzso zzso The zzso induced by targeting zzso and zzso was initiated by zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso related signaling zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited DNA binding activity of zzso and also reduced the recruitment of zzso protein at the promoter region of zzso and zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso and zzso reduced the expression of zzso molecules by zzso the zzso activity of zzso In addition, treating zzso zzso with zzso against zzso and zzso both alone or in combination with radiation suppressed zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and induced zzso zzso leading to zzso 

Taken together, our results illustrated that zzso zzso targeting of zzso and zzso might have therapeutic potential against zzso
