zzso imaging analysis revealed yellow fluorescent zzso precursor cells that were readily recognized in the blood of zzso mice after zzso of red fluorescent protein zzso and green fluorescent protein zzso zzso human prostate zzso cells were implanted in the nude mouse prostate and zzso The yellow fluorescent cells were zzso from the blood of nude mice to zzso zzso by zzso expanded in culture, and zzso in the prostate of nude zzso The yellow fluorescent zzso was zzso and zzso maintained by tumor cells for many generations in zzso and in zzso In the animals implanted with the zzso cells, zzso developed aggressive zzso zzso Lung zzso were demonstrated in zzso of the animals as early as four weeks after injection of the zzso cells in the mouse zzso In contrast, when the zzso and zzso parental cells were zzso into the mouse prostate zzso none of the animals developed lung zzso All animals had almost exclusively yellow fluorescent cells in the blood and bone zzso These results are consistent with the idea that spontaneous genetic exchange between tumor cells in zzso contributes to zzso instability and creation of highly zzso zzso
