In human zzso zzso zzso are thought to arise sporadically in individual cells surrounded by unaffected zzso This contrasts with most current transgenic models where zzso are induced zzso in entire cell zzso Here we have modeled sporadic zzso zzso using a transgenic mouse in which zzso is zzso activated in prostate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression resulted in mild pathology, but zzso deletion of a single zzso of the zzso tumor zzso gene cooperated with zzso to induce high grade zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso were in all cases associated with loss of zzso protein expression from the wild type zzso In the zzso of mice with concurrent zzso deletion of zzso and focal zzso zzso double zzso zzso zzso cells were of higher grade and proliferated faster than single zzso zzso cells within the same zzso zzso double zzso cells zzso single zzso cells despite the presence of increased rates of zzso in the zzso The zzso zzso was activated in zzso prostate cells and zzso but zzso expression shifted the zzso response from zzso to zzso by zzso the zzso target gene zzso We conclude that zzso zzso and zzso zzso cooperate to promote prostate zzso but a zzso zzso response may present a barrier to further zzso Our results highlight the utility of inducing zzso zzso to model the competitive interactions between cell populations with distinct genetic zzso during zzso
