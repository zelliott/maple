zzso chronic zzso zzso zzso can be divided into two clinical entities based on the zzso variable heavy chain zzso gene zzso status, as cases with zzso zzso genes display a more aggressive disease with shorter survival time than zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate whether differences in cellular drug resistance could give an explanation for these divergent clinical zzso 

The zzso gene zzso status was zzso in patients with previously zzso zzso using zzso gene zzso zzso amplification and zzso zzso In zzso sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was assessed using the zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso genes and in zzso drug resistance were successfully zzso in 46 cases, revealing that 25 zzso cases showed zzso and 21 zzso cases zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso group generally tended to be more zzso than the zzso group with significant differences for zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

The propensity of inferior drug response in zzso zzso may reflect a more differentiated disease than in zzso zzso We conclude that the difference in prognosis between zzso cases with zzso and zzso zzso genes could not be explained by difference in cellular drug zzso
