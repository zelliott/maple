The short circulating zzso and side effects of zzso affect its dosing schedule and zzso Fusion of zzso to a zzso zzso zzso can enhance potency because of increased tumor zzso and improved zzso We used the zzso method to generate zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso linked to zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso inhibited various zzso zzso leukemia and myeloma cell zzso In most cases, this zzso was more effective than zzso zzso or a mixture zzso the parental zzso and zzso Our findings indicate that responsiveness depends on zzso zzso and sensitivity to zzso and zzso zzso induced more potent and zzso zzso signaling compared with zzso zzso zzso of zzso was more robust and persistent than that of zzso which may promote zzso zzso efficiently depleted zzso and myeloma cells from whole human blood but also exhibited some toxicity to B cells, zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed superior efficacy compared with zzso zzso zzso or a combination of zzso and zzso using human zzso and myeloma zzso These results suggest that zzso should be useful in the treatment of various zzso zzso
