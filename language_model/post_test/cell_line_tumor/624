The zzso zzso zzso A zzso previously isolated from zzso zzso was zzso and showed significant zzso resistance zzso reverting activity in zzso cancer zzso In an attempt to discover more potent zzso reversal agents for efficient cancer chemotherapy, zzso derivatives with zzso rings zzso were zzso and their zzso and zzso reversal activities were evaluated in zzso zzso zzso zzso and in their parental cells by zzso zzso In response to treatment with each compound, the zzso cell line was the most sensitive, and the zzso zzso cell line was the most zzso zzso decreases in zzso and zzso cell viability were zzso after treatment with the zzso derivatives of zzso while less zzso effects on cell growth were observed in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, among the tested compounds, the intermediate 17 and the zzso 19, 20, and 21 showed potent zzso reversal activities and increased zzso zzso in zzso cells, with the reversal fold ranges from zzso to zzso zzso which is zzso stronger than the natural product zzso
