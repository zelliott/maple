While extensive evidence indicates that tumor cells shift their global zzso programs, the molecular details of the zzso transformation in tumor invasion, zzso and zzso remain largely zzso zzso of the zzso zzso shift during the tumor invasion, development, and zzso will describe an important aspect of tumor zzso and potentially allow us to design therapies that inhibit tumor cell zzso In this study, a zzso study was performed to characterize the global zzso changes during the process of tumor invasion and zzso to lung in a mouse model with subcutaneous transplantation of zzso zzso cell line zzso The serum zzso profiling revealed that many key zzso in zzso and zzso acid zzso cycle, as well as most of the zzso acids were elevated at rapidly growing stage of zzso presumably resulting from a high energy demand and turnover of anabolic metabolism during the tumor cell zzso zzso levels of zzso acid and zzso significantly increased (with fold change zzso zzso zzso and zzso relative to zzso among all the zzso in the third zzso The serum zzso profile of lung zzso at week 4 was different from that at week 3, in that most of previously increased serum zzso were found zzso except for cholesterol and several free fatty zzso suggesting lowered zzso and zzso acids zzso but an elevated zzso metabolism associated with tumor zzso
