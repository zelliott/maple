We describe the design of a potent and selective zzso inhibitor of zzso I zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso which increases the levels of the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso breast tumor zzso in zzso zzso with zzso small interfering zzso in breast cancer cells and zzso zzso zzso embryonic zzso demonstrate that the ability of zzso to induce cell death requires zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso at zzso and accumulates zzso in the zzso In nude mouse zzso zzso suppresses the growth of human breast zzso Furthermore, in zzso transgenic mice, zzso increases zzso and zzso significant zzso of breast zzso We conclude that zzso zzso activity is, at least in part, due to zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso and accumulating nuclear zzso Thus, zzso treatment might improve the poor prognosis of breast cancer patients with low nuclear zzso zzso
