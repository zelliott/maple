zzso of the breast cancer resistance protein zzso expression has been found in various zzso and zzso after exposure to chemicals including zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, the zzso underlying zzso induction of zzso is largely zzso Here, we demonstrate the zzso induction of zzso expression in human colon zzso zzso zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso element zzso located zzso upstream of the zzso zzso start site has been identified and characterized as a functional unit pivotal to zzso induction of zzso zzso reporter zzso revealed that deletion of zzso and 4 dramatically attenuated zzso zzso of zzso reporter activity, while further deletion of the zzso zzso and 2 only moderately changed the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in the zzso reporter construct alone resulted in approximately zzso decrease in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso additional zzso of the zzso site had negligible effect on the zzso promoter zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that treatment with zzso significantly enhanced the recruitment of zzso to the zzso occupied region, and zzso of the zzso site clearly zzso zzso protein from this promoter zzso Together, these data show that the novel zzso zzso is critical for zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene expression in zzso cells, and it may offer new strategies for early identification of zzso zzso which would be of benefit for preventing zzso zzso zzso
