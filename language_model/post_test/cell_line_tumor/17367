We have generated a molecular description of the zzso at which zzso of expression of a zzso zzso zzso zzso occurs within the zzso expression zzso zzso these data show that, in the absence of changes to copy number for the zzso gene zzso all cell lines examined exhibit a progressive loss zzso in expression of zzso during prolonged zzso However, not all cell lines express instability at the level of zzso protein zzso The molecular distinction between stable and unstable production at the protein level is a reflection of the cellular amount of zzso zzso zzso zzso Our data indicate a threshold level, a putative zzso point for zzso of zzso in zzso events, that defines stability or instability of protein zzso Above this level of zzso zzso zzso cell lines are stable, whereas below this level cell lines will show instability of protein zzso Our studies indicate that absolute levels of expression of zzso zzso zzso for zzso in the zzso expression system offer a potential zzso indicator for the selection of stable cell lines for zzso These studies identify molecular zzso of host cell biology of generic interest for gene regulation and expression and define techniques and approaches for enhancement of zzso protein expression and process zzso
