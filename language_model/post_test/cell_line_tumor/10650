zzso zzso is a chronic inflammatory disorder of the skin, in which zzso of zzso and zzso between zzso and T cells or zzso cells are considered to be involved in the zzso of psoriasis zzso zzso zzso A, an zzso has been used for the treatment of psoriasis zzso but the mechanism of its action on zzso has not been well zzso as its function on T cells is well zzso Previous study indicated that the expression of the unfolded protein response zzso zzso zzso and zzso were poorly expressed in psoriasis zzso To investigate if the zzso in zzso is involved in the zzso of psoriasis zzso we assessed zzso of normal human skin and zzso zzso quantitative zzso of zzso cell line zzso treated with zzso Moreover, to zzso how zzso effects on the zzso in zzso we set out quantitative zzso and western zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso cell lines zzso treated with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso effect of zzso zzso A, zzso B and zzso C on zzso cells were also zzso As a result, the zzso was zzso in zzso from zzso zzso characterized by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced zzso markers in zzso zzso zzso treatment and zzso zzso of zzso B induced the zzso in zzso cells or zzso zzso Altogether, we demonstrate that in psoriasis zzso zzso or reduction in zzso B by zzso interference might induce the zzso in zzso
