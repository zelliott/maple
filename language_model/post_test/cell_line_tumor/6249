Lung cancer is the leading cause of zzso mortality zzso Early detection or prevention strategies are urgently needed to increase zzso zzso is the first zzso change that occurs in the zzso zzso during lung cancer development, followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and invasive zzso This study was designed to determine the molecular mechanisms that control zzso zzso zzso Using primary normal human zzso zzso zzso cells cultured by using the zzso zzso zzso method, we found that the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso induced zzso as determined by cell proliferation and multilayered zzso zzso We also found that zzso induced increased zzso D1 zzso which plays a critical role in zzso zzso this zzso was zzso by zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso completely inhibited zzso zzso Furthermore, a promoter analysis revealed that the zzso zzso zzso factor regulates zzso zzso D1 zzso zzso zzso depletion by using zzso targeting its zzso component completely zzso zzso zzso D1 zzso In conclusion, we showed that zzso zzso can be modeled in zzso by using primary zzso cells maintained in a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso completely blocked zzso zzso zzso suggesting that they have a zzso zzso
