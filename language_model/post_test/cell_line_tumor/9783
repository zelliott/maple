zzso cancer is one of the most common zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is frequently detected in zzso zzso zzso signaling plays a pivotal role in zzso signal zzso pathways involved in cell growth, cellular zzso and zzso To specifically inhibit zzso activity in zzso cancer cells, we constructed a zzso against the zzso regulatory zzso zzso and zzso it into zzso and zzso zzso In the present study, treatment of zzso cancer cells with zzso zzso zzso inhibited cell zzso induced zzso phase cell cycle arrest and zzso zzso cancer cells to zzso zzso Furthermore, depletion of zzso zzso resulted in significant zzso of three zzso box class O zzso zzso factors, which inhibited the expression of zzso zzso zzso and induced expression of zzso zzso of zzso zzso factors also increased the expression of zzso Thus, our results indicate that zzso gene zzso of zzso zzso may be a useful therapeutic strategy for zzso zzso
