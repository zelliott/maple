zzso to zzso transition zzso plays a dual role in tumor zzso It enhances zzso of tumor cells by increasing invasive capacity and promoting survival, and it decreases tumor cell sensitivity to zzso zzso agents such as zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso In order to study zzso in tumor cells, we have characterized 3 new models of zzso zzso the zzso pancreatic tumor model and the zzso and zzso lung tumor zzso We identified a diverse set of zzso that drives zzso in these zzso zzso growth factor and zzso M induced zzso in all models, while transforming growth zzso induced zzso in both lung zzso We observed zzso marker and zzso changes in response to chronic zzso zzso Interestingly, stimulation with 2 zzso resulted in more pronounced zzso compared with zzso treatment, demonstrating a spectrum of zzso states induced by parallel zzso such as the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso changes observed in response to the zzso were reversed upon zzso withdrawal, demonstrating the zzso nature of these zzso To study the impact of zzso on cell zzso and invasion in a zzso setting, we cultured cells in a zzso basement membrane zzso Upon stimulation with zzso zzso the colonies exhibited changes to zzso markers and showed zzso ranging from modest differences in colony architecture zzso to complex branching structures zzso zzso zzso these 3 models offer robust cell systems with which to study the roles that zzso plays in cancer zzso
