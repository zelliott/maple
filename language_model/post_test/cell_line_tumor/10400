zzso are members of the vitamin E family but, unlike zzso possess an zzso zzso side chain that zzso superior zzso zzso The ability of zzso to selectively inhibit the zzso zzso zzso through zzso degradation and to suppress the activity of zzso factor zzso could be the basis for some of these zzso Our studies indicate that zzso and zzso have potent zzso activity in pancreatic cancer cells zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso both zzso induced cell death zzso by the zzso cell viability zzso in all four pancreatic cancer cell zzso We also examined the effects of the zzso on the zzso and the zzso signaling pathways by Western zzso zzso zzso and zzso treatment of cells reduced the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and that of its downstream zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in addition to suppressing the zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso of zzso by zzso led to zzso of zzso and zzso accompanied by nuclear zzso of zzso These effects were zzso by the zzso of zzso at the zzso zzso zzso but not zzso were able to induce the observed zzso Our results suggest that the zzso zzso of vitamin E can induce zzso in pancreatic cancer cells through the suppression of vital cell survival and zzso signaling pathways such as those zzso by the zzso and zzso zzso via zzso of zzso zzso The molecular components for this mechanism are not completely zzso and need further zzso
