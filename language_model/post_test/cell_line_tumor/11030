zzso a zzso zzso isolated from the barks of zzso zzso zzso et zzso has been used as an zzso zzso against zzso for more than fifty years in zzso In the present study, we investigated the growth zzso and zzso effect of zzso on human cancer zzso The result showed that zzso significantly suppressed the proliferation of tested human cancer cell zzso The zzso values were less than zzso zzso zzso M and zzso was the most sensitive cell line with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that treatment of zzso cells with zzso resulted in a zzso and zzso zzso of cells in the S phase with a zzso decrease in cells processing to zzso zzso The growth zzso of zzso cells after exposure to zzso was subsequently associated with the induction of zzso as evidence by the typical condensed and fragmented zzso DNA zzso and exposure of zzso on the outer leaflet of plasma zzso All these results indicated that zzso could serve as a potential candidate for zzso zzso
