zzso zzso zzso zzso mice are resistant to cancer through a mechanism that is zzso entirely by zzso of innate zzso Transfer of zzso from zzso mice can zzso cancer resistance in zzso zzso recipients in both preventative and therapeutic zzso In the current studies, we investigated factors that may impact the efficacy and functionality of zzso donor zzso in zzso 

In zzso zzso functionality of female donor zzso was not affected in male zzso In contrast, male donor zzso were greatly affected in the female zzso In zzso recipients of different zzso backgrounds, or mice of different zzso showed a greater negative impact on donor zzso than zzso The negative effects of zzso and zzso on donor zzso were zzso Old donor zzso performed worse than young donor zzso in all settings including in young zzso Young recipients were not able to revive the declining function of old donor zzso However, the function of young donor zzso declined gradually in old recipients, suggesting that an aged environment may contain factors that are deleterious to cellular zzso The zzso of donor zzso prior to transfers had a profound zzso effect on donor zzso functions, possibly as a result of impaired zzso The zzso of donor zzso in liquid nitrogen had no apparent effect on donor zzso functions, except for a small loss of cell number after revival from zzso 

Despite the functional suppression of donor zzso in zzso and zzso recipients, as well as old recipients, there was a therapeutic time period during the initial few weeks during which donor zzso were functional before their eventual rejection or functional zzso The eventual rejection of donor zzso will likely prevent donor zzso zzso which would help minimize the risk of zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso from healthy donors with high zzso activity may be a feasible therapeutic concept for treating zzso zzso
