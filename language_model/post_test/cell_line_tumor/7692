To study the zzso activity of cell environment the transformed embryonic rat zzso zzso zzso were zzso to zzso mice then the cells of the formed zzso were cultivated zzso zzso The cells before and after transplantation were compared by zzso proliferation activity and gap junction zzso zzso The clone zzso cells proliferated much faster than clone zzso zzso The zzso cells had changed zzso structure and unlike zzso the contract zzso was absent in zzso The number of zzso cells in phase zzso was significantly greater than that of zzso cells, while the number of zzso cells in zzso zzso was much more the number of zzso zzso The activity of gap junction zzso communications in both cell types was near the zzso It was concluded that cell zzso act as a zzso and zzso progression factor in the case of cell transplantation to zzso zzso
