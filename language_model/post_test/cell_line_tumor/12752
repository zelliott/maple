zzso proteins are direct zzso of zzso and zzso that have no sequence zzso to zzso We have characterized the role in zzso progression of a new human member of this protein family referred to as zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso of zzso C results in premature zzso exit with zzso zzso even in the presence of zzso zzso zzso experiments suggest that zzso C is involved in the zzso checkpoint zzso zzso with this idea, zzso cells show impaired recruitment of the zzso components zzso zzso and zzso As the checkpoint is zzso cells display defective zzso zzso which leads to an increased number of zzso and zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso C can associate with the zzso zzso Aurora B, and zzso of zzso C produces zzso of the active form of Aurora B in zzso Taken together, our results indicate a role for zzso C in the zzso checkpoint, which might be zzso by defective recruitment of zzso components and deregulation of the activity of Aurora zzso zzso
