To investigate the effects of zzso zzso zzso on growth zzso and cell cycle of zzso zzso zzso cell line in zzso 

The effects of zzso on cell growth zzso was detected by zzso zzso Cell cycle was analyzed by flow zzso zzso Cell zzso was observed by a light microscope after HE zzso The protein expression of cell cycle components zzso zzso zzso were examined by zzso and Western zzso The zzso expression were examined by zzso zzso 

zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso cells in dose and zzso zzso The zzso rate was about 50% after zzso treatment with 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso induced the mature differentiation and zzso zzso With increasing dose of zzso treatment, the cell number of zzso phase was increased, whereas it decreased at S and zzso zzso There was significant difference between 10, 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso groups and the corresponding group without zzso zzso After treating cells by 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso for 1, 2, 3 days individually, the protein and zzso expression of both zzso and zzso reduced, while the expression of zzso enhanced zzso 

zzso could arrest zzso cells at zzso phase and induce cell differentiation tending to zzso Furthermore, zzso had an effect on expression of cell cycle components zzso zzso and zzso to inhibit zzso cell zzso
