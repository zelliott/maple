zzso zzso is a zzso zzso involved in regulating cell growth, zzso and tumor zzso We investigated the clinical significance of zzso expression including its possible use as a zzso marker or therapeutic target in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso expression was evaluated by zzso in 71 patients with 54 zzso 13 zzso and 4 zzso zzso zzso We assessed the correlation of zzso expression with clinical characteristics including zzso optimal zzso zzso and zzso In zzso zzso was inhibited using zzso to evaluate its role in cell growth and sensitivity to zzso agents in zzso zzso cell zzso 

zzso zzso which was mainly zzso in location, was observed in a majority zzso zzso of the zzso but not in normal zzso zzso zzso High zzso expression in zzso correlated with shorter zzso survival zzso of patients zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso with zzso zzso and zzso showed an enhanced zzso effect compared with control zzso in zzso zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso expression can be a zzso factor for zzso and may be involved in regulating the response to zzso chemotherapy in the treatment of zzso
