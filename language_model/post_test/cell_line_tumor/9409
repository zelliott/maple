The zzso A5 gene zzso plays an important role in modulating zzso zzso zzso of zzso including zzso and zzso zzso have been reported to correlate with zzso zzso In the present study the relationships of 5 single zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso with zzso were zzso 

The study group comprised 95 Japanese patients with zzso and 119 unrelated zzso zzso zzso of the C zzso of zzso zzso and the T zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso patients were significantly higher than in the zzso subjects zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was not observed, and the other 4 zzso sites were in strong linkage zzso Five of the 8 detected zzso with the C zzso of zzso correlated with zzso zzso activities of zzso including that with the zzso zzso were estimated using a zzso zzso Analysis of zzso promoters showed that the zzso zzso alone had no zzso zzso of expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso fluorescent protein zzso in zzso cells showed that zzso was abundant in zzso zzso structures, and zzso zzso expression resembled that of the wild zzso 

The zzso and zzso zzso zzso correlated with zzso in this Japanese population, but neither zzso directly affected zzso zzso
