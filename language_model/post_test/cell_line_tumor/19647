The zzso target of zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso in at least two distinct zzso complexes, zzso and zzso zzso These complexes play important roles in the regulation of cell growth, zzso survival, and zzso zzso is a zzso motif zzso for the zzso protein zzso and, here, we identify zzso as a component of zzso but not zzso zzso is necessary for the assembly of zzso and for its capacity to zzso zzso Alternative zzso generates at least five zzso of the zzso protein , three of which assemble into zzso to generate three distinct zzso Even though all zzso can zzso zzso in zzso insulin regulates the activity of only two of zzso Thus, we propose that cells contain several zzso flavors that may zzso zzso in response to different zzso
