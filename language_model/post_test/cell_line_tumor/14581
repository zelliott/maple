zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso family of zzso zzso known to have tumor zzso activity in diverse human zzso However, zzso gene function and the molecular aspects in gastric zzso remain largely zzso To investigate the effects of zzso on invasion of gastric zzso zzso cell line and the underlying molecular mechanism involved in this process, we cloned short hairpin zzso zzso targeting zzso into zzso zzso zzso expression zzso and then zzso the zzso zzso zzso into gastric zzso zzso cells using zzso zzso After the zzso expression was successfully knocked down, the number of cells invading through zzso was obviously increased ( zzso in the zzso chamber zzso By detection of reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and western zzso analysis, respectively, we found that zzso and protein of zzso zzso were increased significantly, and the protein level of zzso was also increased ( zzso These results suggested that zzso gene could inhibit invasion of gastric zzso zzso cells and this zzso maybe result from the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso or zzso
