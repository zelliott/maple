Based on a previous finding that zzso zzso zzso zzso is a potential serum marker for zzso cancer zzso the aim of this study was to clarify the zzso significance of zzso expression in zzso and to explore the correlation between zzso and zzso in the zzso of zzso related to hypoxic zzso zzso zzso expression was examined in zzso and corresponding normal zzso zzso by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and real-time zzso This experiment confirmed that zzso levels were high in zzso We screened the tissue samples of 143 zzso zzso By zzso we determined that the zzso zzso was significantly correlated with the tumor size, depth of invasion, zzso status, distant zzso and zzso stage, and was an independent zzso factor for disease recurrence and worse survival outcome zzso The zzso of zzso under zzso was investigated, and it was confirmed that zzso expression was induced by zzso and significantly attenuated by small interfering zzso zzso targeting zzso in zzso zzso These results showed that zzso is significantly zzso which is regulated by zzso in zzso patients, and can be used as a potential zzso and a therapeutic target for zzso
