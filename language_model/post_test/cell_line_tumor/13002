zzso zzso is an zzso inhibitor and used to treat the symptoms of Alzheimer's disease zzso Recent studies show that Gal may affect zzso precursor protein zzso metabolism and increase release of zzso zzso zzso However the effect of Gal on zzso zzso zzso release and zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso expression is still zzso zzso we investigated the effect of Gal on the level of zzso and zzso In a differentiated human zzso cell line zzso Gal zzso zzso was found to significantly decrease zzso release and zzso expression following treatment for 6, 12, and zzso zzso Gal to zzso zzso or 10 zzso had no further zzso The effect of Gal zzso zzso for zzso was zzso on zzso expression but not on zzso zzso At higher concentration zzso zzso and 10 zzso Gal had no effect on the level of full-length zzso but could still stimulate further decrease in zzso zzso and release of zzso These observations suggested that zzso zzso Gal exerts its effect on zzso production by zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso or 10 zzso Gal mainly reduces zzso production by stimulating the zzso zzso to decrease the amount of zzso zzso available for zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and multiple second zzso (including zzso zzso and zzso were found to be involved in the regulation of zzso zzso release and zzso zzso
