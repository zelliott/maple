zzso reactions are a major side effect of the administration of therapeutic zzso and are the result of a complex immune zzso In this study, we report that zzso of zzso zzso acids in the zzso zzso zzso reduce its ability to induce infusion reactions in rats and zzso We first showed that zzso administration of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso severe infusion reactions in zzso These zzso express strong zzso zzso zzso and in zzso depletion of complement in rats by zzso with zzso zzso factor zzso the lethal infusion reactions generated by zzso Thus, the infusion reactions appear to be largely driven by the complement zzso To reduce the zzso function of zzso its zzso region was modified by two zzso acid zzso at zzso and zzso The modified zzso was incapable of expressing zzso in zzso and did not induce severe infusion reactions in rats and zzso even at extremely high zzso The modified zzso retained its zzso cellular zzso function as well as its zzso activity in a zzso mouse zzso In zzso complement appears to drive infusion zzso and modifications that eliminate the zzso activity of an zzso also reduce its ability to induce infusion zzso
