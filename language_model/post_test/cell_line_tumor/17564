It remains unclear to what extent drugs targeting zzso zzso complexes affect global gene expression in cells derived from target and zzso human zzso To address this question, we used zzso expression analysis using zzso to analyze the response of three tumor and one normal zzso cell line to treatment with the DNA zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso treatment induced a limited number of genes zzso zzso range, zzso of zzso genes zzso in each cell line zzso The majority of the gene expression changes that followed zzso treatment were zzso in tumor and normal cells, including genes that function in cell zzso zzso immune zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso treatment induced the expression of zzso class tumor zzso only in tumor cell zzso To explain this zzso response, we analyzed the mechanism of zzso regulation of the zzso member of this tumor zzso gene family, zzso Taken from our analysis of zzso gene regulation, we propose that zzso gene zzso has two distinct zzso 1) the reversal of promoter zzso and 2) the presence of zzso zzso competent for the zzso of zzso target zzso This latter requirement for gene zzso by zzso is probably zzso by zzso zzso factors and may account for the limited number of human genes induced by zzso zzso This revised model for gene zzso by zzso has important implications for the use of DNA zzso zzso in clinical zzso
