We have developed a simple yet effective apparatus, based upon negative pressure directed to the tip of a zzso to measure the zzso of single zzso The zzso cell zzso measuring zzso zzso could differentiate between the zzso of strongly versus zzso zzso cancer cells as well as normal zzso zzso was zzso as zzso negative zzso zzso or zzso relative to cell zzso zzso where a noticeable difference in cell size was zzso Thus, for rat and human prostate and human breast cancer cell lines, zzso zzso zzso decreased in line with increased zzso zzso Using the zzso we investigated the effect of zzso zzso a specific blocker of zzso zzso channels zzso on the zzso of rat and human prostate cancer cell lines of markedly different zzso zzso Following zzso with zzso zzso h with 1 zzso the zzso values for the zzso cells increased significantly zzso there was no effect on the zzso zzso For the strongly zzso zzso cells, zzso treatment caused a significant zzso zzso increase in zzso The zzso of zzso zzso cells was not affected by the zzso zzso The zzso increase in the zzso of the strongly zzso cells was consistent with the functional zzso expression in these cells and the proposed role of zzso activity in zzso cell zzso In conclusion, the zzso which can be constructed easily and cheaply, offers a simple and effective method to zzso zzso zzso and its zzso
