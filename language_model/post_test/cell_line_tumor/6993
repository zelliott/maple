A functional relationship between the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso drug zzso was zzso The zzso cell line, zzso exhibited a significant resistance to zzso treatment in comparison to the zzso cell line, zzso While zzso cells zzso their DNA into zzso fragments, zzso cells failed to undergo such fragmentation in response to the zzso zzso of both zzso and DNA fragmentation factor was not sufficient to trigger zzso DNA fragmentation in zzso zzso No correlation was found between expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso or Bad and decreased sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso zzso cells failed to express zzso and zzso expression of this protein significantly zzso the cells to zzso An enhancement of zzso activity and collapse of zzso membrane potential zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells to zzso which may be a direct result of zzso increase in zzso DNA breaks after zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso plays an active role in zzso cell zzso to zzso and that its zzso may constitute a novel mechanism of drug resistance in these zzso
