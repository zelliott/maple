The zzso of zzso zzso in response to zzso tumor zzso is predicted to fail in the absence of zzso zzso However, questions remain regarding the role of zzso signaling and additional zzso T zzso signals in this zzso To address this, we have analyzed the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso in a mouse model of established tumor and tumor zzso following zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso were zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso during tumor growth and that systemic zzso zzso did not alter zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Rather, zzso zzso induced peripheral dissemination of zzso zzso zzso that required continual zzso stimulation to maintain peripheral zzso and tumor zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso enhances the peripheral survival of zzso zzso zzso and that persistent zzso T cell signals are required for their long-term zzso
