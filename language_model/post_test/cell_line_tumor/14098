zzso zzso acids zzso naturally occurring fatty acids in zzso food products, have zzso and zzso properties in animal as well as in zzso models of zzso However, the cellular mechanism has not been fully zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is induced by several dietary compounds and belongs to a zzso zzso gene associated with zzso and zzso zzso The present study was performed to zzso the molecular mechanism by which zzso stimulates zzso activity in human zzso cancer zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso cell proliferation and induced zzso whereas zzso acid or zzso showed no effect on cell proliferation and zzso We also found that zzso induced the expression of a zzso zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression by small interference zzso zzso results in repression of zzso zzso zzso analysis using zzso zzso cells revealed that zzso zzso factor 3 zzso was induced and its expression was confirmed by western zzso The zzso treatment followed by the zzso of zzso increased zzso promoter activity in zzso zzso We further provide the evidence that zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso and the zzso of zzso by zzso abolished zzso zzso and zzso zzso The current study demonstrates that zzso stimulates zzso expression and subsequently zzso zzso in an zzso specific zzso These effects may be through zzso of zzso zzso in human zzso zzso
