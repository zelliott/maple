In the present work it was investigated if a spontaneous zzso of the native zzso zzso melanoma form into zzso form, connected with the tumor zzso is accompanied by changes of zzso surface zzso zzso We also tried to find out if there exists any correlation between changes in zzso expression and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of two zzso zzso melanoma zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The levels of zzso zzso zzso in zzso were determined by the zzso zzso For the detection of zzso expression by flow zzso isolated melanoma cells were stained with the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso The stained cells were also examined using a zzso microscope and a zzso zzso zzso The obtained results indicate that a spontaneous zzso of the native zzso form into zzso form and the associated tumor progression was accompanied by a decrease in zzso zzso expression on the cell surface and a decrease in zzso zzso and especially zzso zzso by zzso melanoma zzso Our observations suggest a relationship between zzso expression and locally zzso zzso in the course of zzso melanoma zzso
