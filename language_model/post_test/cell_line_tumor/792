Although it has been established that formation and functional differentiation of the zzso from embryonic zzso is associated with zzso of many genes controlled by specific sets of zzso factors, the role and zzso sequence of individual zzso factors has not yet been fully zzso This study sought to differentiate a zzso zzso cell line, zzso to zzso cells and, zzso to investigate the effects of regulated expression of zzso factors in zzso zzso 

Following differentiation using zzso acid and zzso zzso zzso resulting zzso cells zzso were zzso with zzso for zzso zzso beta zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or in zzso zzso of these zzso factors was investigated using zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to assess the subsequent effects of expression of these factors on zzso genes related to zzso zzso 

zzso differentiation of zzso cells generated zzso cell zzso Following zzso zzso zzso beta 2, and zzso were expressed in zzso cells, with their proteins localized mainly in cellular zzso zzso of these factors apparently did not affect the zzso expression of zzso zzso beta 2, zzso zzso zzso Sonic zzso and Indian zzso 

This study describes the successful transient expression of zzso factors related to zzso development, following directed differentiation of zzso cells to zzso cells, and shows that treatment of zzso cells with a combination of zzso causes zzso of genes relevant to pancreatic zzso The lack of further effect of regulated zzso factor expression on these genes may suggest that zzso zzso like cells derived from zzso cells is not the optimal lineage from which to develop beta zzso It may be useful to include zzso visceral zzso in future zzso
