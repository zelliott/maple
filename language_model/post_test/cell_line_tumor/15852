Culture of cells as three-dimensional zzso zzso can enhance in zzso tests for basic biological research as well as for zzso zzso Such zzso culture models, however, are often more complicated, zzso and expensive than two-dimensional zzso zzso This paper describes a zzso format hanging drop culture plate that makes zzso formation, culture, and subsequent drug testing on the obtained zzso cellular zzso as straightforward to perform and adapt to existing zzso screening zzso instruments as conventional zzso zzso Using this platform, we show that drugs with different modes of action produce distinct responses in the zzso zzso cell zzso compared to conventional zzso cell zzso Specifically, the zzso drug zzso zzso has higher zzso effects on zzso cultures whereas the zzso activated drug commonly referred to as zzso zzso are more effective against zzso zzso The zzso zzso hanging drop culture and testing plate provides an efficient way to obtain biological insights that are often lost in zzso zzso
