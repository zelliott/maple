The embryonic stem zzso gene expression signature has been shown to be associated with poorly differentiated aggressive human tumors and has attracted great attention as a potential target for future cancer zzso Here, we investigate the potential of the embryonic stem cell signature as molecular target for the therapy and the strategy to suppress the embryonic stem cell zzso The core zzso gene zzso is zzso zzso in human embryonic zzso zzso cells showing gene expression profiles similar to embryonic stem zzso zzso of the gene by either small interfering zzso targeting zzso or zzso zzso inhibitor zzso causes zzso of expression pattern of embryonic stem cell signature including zzso zzso and their target zzso leading to cell cycle arrest, zzso of colony formation in soft zzso and induction of differentiation into all three germ zzso These effects are antagonized by zzso of zzso Interestingly, embryonic zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso exhibit a higher sensitivity to zzso in zzso of zzso compared with embryonic stem zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso expression by zzso is zzso by a coordinated change in recruitment of zzso zzso and zzso factors to the promoter zzso These findings indicate that zzso of zzso gene zzso in zzso cells is associated with maintaining stem zzso zzso and suggest that targeting zzso might be an approach for improved therapy of poorly differentiated zzso
