Previously, using zzso techniques together with zzso expression array analysis, we showed the gene protein zzso C zzso zzso to mediate the zzso zzso of human prostate zzso However, according to zzso the gene has undergone several major zzso zzso to understand the relationship between its structure and biological activities, we have zzso its expressed sequence in prostate cancer cell lines and zzso 

zzso and targeted zzso were used to sequence the zzso transcribed from zzso zzso analysis was employed to zzso the hypothetical protein sequence subsequently translated and to identify an appropriate zzso to generate a specific zzso zzso 

A novel sequence was identified within the zzso domain of human zzso that, in prostate cancer cell lines and zzso is expressed during zzso and thereafter translated into protein zzso zzso independent of conventional zzso The zzso zzso detected expression of this 96 zzso protein only within zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and translation of this gene zzso including previous zzso zzso generates a novel specific zzso of human prostate zzso The presence of zzso zzso characteristic of classic zzso and zzso zzso within zzso provides a potential mechanism for this zzso zzso to zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso normal zzso zzso
