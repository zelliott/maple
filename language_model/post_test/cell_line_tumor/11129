To demonstrate the specific killing of folate zzso zzso tumor cells can be achieved by zzso zzso zzso zzso combined with its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso acid was zzso linked to PGA and folate content value was determined by quantitative zzso zzso The ability of folate zzso PGA to zzso zzso was measured by zzso Visual demonstration of zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells was detected by using zzso labeled zzso and a zzso zzso The zzso of zzso towards the cells in the presence or absence of zzso was zzso by using zzso zzso 

The zzso has a specific activity of zzso 8 U zzso zzso zzso zzso selectivity was confirmed by zzso zzso The combination of zzso zzso with zzso generated higher zzso towards the zzso zzso cells than free zzso The zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso cells, zzso Further, the enhanced zzso reduced greatly with the addition of free zzso zzso 

zzso zzso PGA did not significantly compromise PGA zzso activity and enabled binding zzso zzso PGA to folate zzso expressing cells, and increased the sensitivity of the cells to zzso followed by administration of its zzso zzso
