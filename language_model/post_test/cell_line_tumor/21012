The aim of the present study was to evaluate the zzso efficacy of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso here as zzso using zzso human breast cancer cells and the zzso zzso zzso implanted in zzso mice as experimental zzso The zzso zzso was selected as the best delivery system because it showed greater zzso into cells (35 zzso zzso relative to other zzso After 3 h incubation zzso was partially localized in zzso the compartment that represented its primary zzso zzso The zzso treated cultures also revealed a degree of zzso zzso zzso Indeed, zzso leads to zzso of the cells with different zzso indicating that cell zzso was dependent on both the zzso concentration and the light dose zzso zzso of zzso and nuclear zzso level indicated that some of the cells exposed to zzso therapy were undergoing zzso within zzso after zzso To assess the in zzso effectiveness of S1, animals bearing tumors were treated with zzso zzso followed zzso later by 108 J zzso light at zzso zzso and 60 zzso zzso other animals served as controls (no treatment, light alone, or zzso zzso All zzso treated tumors and none of the controls exhibited complete or partial responses, and these responses continued for the entire observation period of 12 zzso zzso of tumor size showed that the treatment effectively delayed tumor zzso Light zzso investigations of zzso tumor specimens showed that zzso causes an early direct damage of zzso cells, largely via processes leading to random zzso zzso
