zzso cancer is among the top five deadliest zzso in developed zzso Better knowledge of the molecular mechanisms contributing to its zzso is imperative to improve patient zzso Identification of novel tumor zzso genes zzso in pancreatic cancer will reveal new mechanisms of zzso deregulation and will ultimately help improve our understanding of this aggressive zzso According to zzso two-hit model, zzso are classically disrupted by two concerted genetic zzso In this study, we combined DNA zzso profiling with copy number and zzso expression profiling to identify novel zzso in a set of 20 pancreatic cancer cell zzso These data sets were integrated for each of zzso genes in each cell line enabling the zzso of those genes that undergo DNA zzso zzso loss and zzso zzso simultaneously in multiple cell zzso Using this zzso zzso strategy, we identified zzso zzso determining region zzso zzso as a candidate zzso in pancreatic zzso zzso of zzso in pancreatic cancer cell lines with zzso expression resulted in reduced viability of cancer cells both in zzso and in zzso demonstrating its tumor zzso zzso We also found reduced zzso zzso deletion and zzso DNA zzso of zzso in clinical pancreatic tumor data zzso Furthermore, we deduced a novel role for zzso in suppressing the zzso signaling pathway, which we zzso is a zzso through which zzso may exert its tumor zzso effects in pancreatic zzso
