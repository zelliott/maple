To investigate the effect of the dual zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on proliferation and zzso cell survival of zzso human zzso cell zzso in zzso and on tumor growth after zzso zzso in nude zzso 

Cell zzso zzso distribution and zzso cell survival after zzso were zzso with and without zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 30, and 300 zzso in zzso zzso volume and tumor growth delay zzso were determined in tumors growing in zzso zzso nude mice, treated with zzso zzso zzso (20 zzso zzso body weight zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso body weight zzso or carrier until a final tumor diameter of 15 zzso or, zzso 3 days before a zzso zzso zzso or, zzso after a zzso zzso zzso until reaching the final tumor zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso significantly increased the doubling time of zzso cells in zzso A marked zzso zzso effect with blockade of the cells in zzso of the cell cycle was zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso for 3 days marginally increased zzso of zzso cells in zzso For zzso zzso this effect was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso Daily oral application of zzso zzso or zzso zzso in mice bearing zzso zzso tumors showed a marked zzso effect with a significant zzso of tumor growth delay zzso zzso zzso After drug application for 3 days, followed by zzso zzso zzso a slight effect of both drugs on tumor growth delay was zzso For zzso zzso this effect was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso However, this effect disappeared when tumor volumes were zzso to the time point of zzso suggesting that both drugs showed no or only a slight zzso effect in zzso Daily application of zzso zzso or zzso zzso after a zzso zzso showed a clear zzso of tumor growth with a significantly longer tumor growth delay after drug treatment compared to control tumors zzso zzso zzso Enhancement ratios were smaller for zzso than for zzso tumors, suggesting an additive effect for combinations with zzso In all treatment arms, the effects of zzso zzso were not significantly different from zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed a clear zzso effect in zzso whereas zzso was only zzso The present data are the first to show an effect of combined zzso and dual zzso zzso on tumor growth delay in zzso Further zzso investigations using zzso zzso schedules and local tumor control as experimental zzso are needed to evaluate a possible zzso potential for the combination zzso
