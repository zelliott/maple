A series of zzso acid containing zzso as potent zzso of zzso zzso was zzso by the introduction of zzso acid as an zzso functional group into the aromatic ring B of the zzso zzso High zzso zzso was observed with zzso compounds 13 c and 13 zzso in which a zzso group on the aromatic ring B of zzso zzso was replaced with zzso zzso zzso values toward zzso and zzso cell lines are zzso zzso zzso 13 c and 13 d exhibited significant zzso activity toward zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid zzso 17, which can be considered as a mimic of zzso acid 13 zzso did not show significant zzso of cell growth or zzso zzso According to the zzso analysis using zzso cells, zzso was induced after incubation for 8 h with 13 c at a concentration of zzso zzso Growth zzso experiments against a panel of 39 human cancer cell lines revealed 13 c to inhibit growth differently than zzso zzso the correlation zzso zzso between the two compounds was zzso in the zzso zzso
