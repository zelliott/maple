The zzso gene family, whose members zzso zzso channels, belongs to the zzso zzso zzso channel zzso The roles of this gene family have been widely investigated in nerve and muscle zzso In the present study, we investigated several characteristics of zzso which is strongly expressed in the canine zzso cell line, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso channel opener, zzso attenuated cell proliferation by arresting cells in the zzso zzso We also showed that zzso zzso helps zzso cells to zzso In an effort to find an zzso regulator of zzso we used zzso A to reduce the level of the zzso factor zzso and it strongly inhibited the induction of zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso of zzso by zzso may exert an zzso effect in canine zzso zzso zzso is a possible molecular target for canine zzso zzso
