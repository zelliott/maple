zzso is frequently zzso in lung zzso Recent discovery that zzso zzso is tumor zzso in the lung raises a question: how is zzso zzso aggressively zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso might lead to generation of zzso oxygen species zzso and DNA damage, contributing to zzso zzso We zzso zzso human zzso zzso into zzso peripheral mouse lung zzso cells zzso zzso zzso active zzso zzso in E10 cells led to a highly significant zzso zzso zzso increased level of zzso and a corresponding increase in the amount of DNA zzso damage, compared with the parental line E10 and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso were not increased, suggesting a direct source of zzso such as zzso zzso zzso protein and activity measured as zzso zzso level were zzso in cells expressing zzso zzso zzso activity correlated with zzso activity zzso zzso Both zzso generation and DNA single strand breaks were significantly reduced by zzso with zzso inhibitor SC zzso confirming zzso as the source of the zzso zzso has been repeatedly implicated in lung cancer, and is known to be regulated by zzso and to release zzso Our data suggest that zzso of zzso with a zzso increase in zzso and DNA damage, contributes to the dominant zzso of zzso zzso
