Recently, we identified a zzso analog named ARC zzso which has the properties of a general zzso zzso Here, we report the characterization of ARC on a panel of zzso cancer zzso cell zzso Cell death induced by ARC in zzso cells was accompanied by zzso zzso and correlated with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and with the zzso of zzso zzso At the same time, colon cancer cell lines were resistant to the well-known zzso analog zzso zzso which failed to zzso zzso or zzso Overall, ARC could represent an attractive candidate for zzso drug development that targets multiple survival pathways in colon cancer zzso
