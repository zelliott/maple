To observe the cellular zzso of beta zzso protein zzso by cultured human zzso zzso cells and the location of zzso in the zzso zzso 

The time course of cellular zzso of zzso in the zzso cells was observed directly under laser scanning zzso microscope zzso Image analysis was conducted to compare the differences of cellular zzso zzso after treatment of the cells with different zzso of zzso zzso for 24 zzso Multiple zzso zzso was employed to identify the location of zzso in the zzso zzso 

zzso cells showed zzso zzso after incubation with zzso zzso zzso for 1 zzso and the quantity of zzso zzso was zzso A higher concentration of zzso zzso resulted in increased zzso zzso which differed significantly between the 3 groups with treatment at different zzso ( zzso or zzso zzso zzso revealed a zzso of part of the zzso and zzso (a zzso zzso in the zzso 

zzso cells can clear zzso through a zzso and zzso cellular zzso zzso Part of the zzso zzso in the zzso is located in the zzso zzso
