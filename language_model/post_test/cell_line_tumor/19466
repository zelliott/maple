The high zzso zzso and low zzso zzso mice were selectively bred for differences in alcohol preference and zzso Recently, a zzso zzso was identified on zzso zzso The peak for this zzso is near the zzso zzso zzso 2) zzso The present study examined zzso zzso expression differences between the zzso and zzso mice in brain regions important in the zzso pathway, including the nucleus zzso zzso amygdala, and zzso zzso show that zzso zzso mice exhibited lower levels of zzso zzso expression in the nucleus zzso and the zzso compared to zzso zzso No differences were found in the zzso or zzso To determine if a sequence difference might zzso the expression difference, the zzso zzso was zzso in each line and one single zzso zzso zzso was identified in the 3' zzso Both zzso and zzso 3' zzso were cloned in the zzso zzso The zzso in the zzso 3' zzso was assessed to determine its functional significance in modulating zzso In zzso expression analysis using zzso zzso cells resulted in a significant decrease in expression of the zzso 3' zzso zzso construct compared with the zzso 3' zzso zzso This decreased expression is consistent with lower levels of zzso expression in the nucleus zzso and the zzso as evidenced by zzso These results suggest that the zzso may play a role in the differential expression of zzso between the zzso and zzso mice and that the zzso in zzso may contribute to alcohol zzso
