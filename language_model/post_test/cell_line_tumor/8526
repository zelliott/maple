zzso is a novel zzso zzso zzso inhibitor is in Phase II clinical zzso zzso acid zzso an zzso agent has been associated with zzso activity, through the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Here we investigate the effect of the combination of zzso and zzso in zzso lung cancer zzso cell zzso 

Cell growth zzso was studied using the zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell cycle analysis and recovery were detected by flow zzso The expression levels of various proteins were detected by western zzso zzso of colony formation in zzso was checked in zzso In zzso efficacy was studied in zzso zzso zzso 

The combination of zzso and zzso showed synergistic effect on zzso and zzso zzso cell lines in zzso zzso at both constant and zzso ratio with marked decrease in colony forming zzso zzso zzso analysis confirmed a significant time dependent increase in zzso with zzso zzso population at 96 h compared to zzso zzso and zzso zzso alone zzso zzso zzso zzso of the cells after treatment, in fresh medium without drugs, led to the recovery of cells treated with zzso alone but not the cells treated with the combination of both the zzso The combination treatment zzso tumor zzso proteins like zzso zzso and zzso along with zzso of proliferation and survival proteins zzso zzso D1 and zzso This was also associated with the zzso of the zzso protein zzso and significant zzso of zzso zzso in the combination zzso Interestingly, zzso in combination with zzso was much more effective as an zzso agent than alone, in the zzso zzso tumor model in zzso zzso 

This study indicates that the combination of zzso inhibitor zzso with zzso inhibitor zzso is promising novel zzso targeted therapeutic approach for zzso zzso
