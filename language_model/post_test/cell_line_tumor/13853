The aim of this study was to investigate the short-term regulation of the zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso by zzso of a zzso zzso in the zzso cell line and assess its membrane expression by indirect zzso zzso with zzso induced production of zzso with zzso values ranging from zzso zzso in transient and stable zzso zzso zzso with zzso induced a zzso loss of zzso production, from 1 pm up to 10 zzso zzso was also time dependent, with zzso loss of zzso responsiveness occurring after zzso zzso with 10 zzso zzso followed by a plateau up to 60 zzso The decrease in zzso responsiveness was zzso by individual treatment with protein zzso A zzso or protein zzso C zzso zzso and zzso However, when added zzso zzso responsiveness was raised over the zzso zzso activity observed in control zzso zzso loss of zzso production was accompanied by zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein along with zzso treatment revealed that zzso zzso protein and zzso were redistributed in similar zzso zzso through a zzso but zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso and zzso are zzso Moreover, zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso had no zzso In conclusion, the present results indicate that zzso and protein zzso C act zzso to induce zzso zzso but only zzso is essential for zzso zzso highlighting the complex nature of the short-term regulatory pattern of this zzso
