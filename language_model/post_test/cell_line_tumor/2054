Drug combination therapies are commonly used for the treatment of zzso to increase therapeutic zzso reduce zzso and decrease the zzso of drug zzso Although drug combination therapies were originally devised primarily by empirical methods, the increased understanding of drug mechanisms and the pathways they zzso provides a unique opportunity to design combinations that are based on zzso zzso We have identified protein zzso zzso as a promising therapeutic target for combination therapy, because zzso regulates not just one but many zzso pathways and processes that play important roles in drug resistance, including DNA repair, zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso machinery activity, zzso and zzso zzso In this article, we show that zzso a clinical stage selective small zzso inhibitor of zzso blocks the DNA repair response induced by zzso and zzso and zzso with these agents in models of zzso zzso zzso studies show that the enhanced activity is a result of zzso of zzso and zzso two zzso proteins that are essential for DNA repair and that require zzso by zzso for their zzso These data position zzso as a valid zzso target for intelligent drug combinations and support the evaluation of zzso in combination with zzso and zzso zzso in the clinical zzso
