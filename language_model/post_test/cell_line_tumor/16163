zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso is a promising approach to enhance efficiency of zzso delivery for zzso zzso Head and neck zzso zzso zzso cell lines were initially used to generate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso efficiency and release zzso were zzso zzso were adopted to zzso fresh tumor zzso from five patients with advanced zzso To test the hypothesis that zzso enhance zzso zzso zzso cell zzso produced from patient blood zzso precursors were loaded with either the zzso or zzso versions of tumor zzso These were used to stimulate zzso zzso zzso T zzso In four of five patients, zzso zzso T cells showed significantly increased zzso zzso zzso or decreased zzso zzso production zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso The observations represent an enabling step in the production of zzso zzso zzso and personalized zzso zzso for solid organ zzso 

zzso the zzso presentation may be a viable approach to increase the efficiency of tumor cell directed zzso via immune zzso This study presents an example for this using head and neck cancer cell lines and zzso zzso zzso presentation to zzso zzso The observed zzso zzso response was significantly zzso This method may pave the way to a highly efficient cancer cell elimination method with minimal to no zzso
