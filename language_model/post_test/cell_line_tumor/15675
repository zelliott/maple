Industrial and municipal zzso are important sources of zzso zzso compounds zzso discharged into the aquatic zzso This study investigated the zzso potency of wastewater and the cleaning efficiency of two typical urban Danish sewage treatment plants zzso using chemical analysis and a battery of zzso zzso samples, collected at the first zzso zzso and zzso samples, collected after the sewage treatment, were extracted using solid phase zzso zzso were analyzed for the content of a range of industrial chemicals with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso industrial zzso ultraviolet screens, and natural and synthetic steroid zzso The zzso zzso zzso and toxicity of the extracts were analyzed in cell culture zzso for the potency to affect the function of the estrogen, zzso zzso zzso and zzso receptors as well as the steroid hormone zzso The zzso stage zzso development was tested in a marine zzso The zzso of all analyzed chemicals were reduced in zzso compared with zzso and for some to below the detection zzso zzso as well as zzso samples from both zzso were found to interact with all four receptors and to interfere with the steroid hormone synthesis showing the presence of measured zzso Both zzso samples and one of the zzso samples inhibited the development of the zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the presence of zzso was reduced in the zzso but not zzso as verified by the applied zzso that all responded to the extracts of zzso zzso Our data suggest that the wastewater treatment processes are not efficient enough to prevent contamination of environmental surface zzso
