zzso zzso growth factor therapy enhances the activity of zzso in experimental models, and zzso has therapeutic activity in patients with zzso zzso zzso 

Twenty-two patients with locally advanced zzso zzso zzso zzso were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso accelerated zzso zzso equivalent dose, zzso zzso supported with zzso zzso zzso zzso daily, 5 zzso and zzso (5 zzso every 2 weeks, five zzso zzso from nine patients, performed before and 1 week after zzso administration, were analyzed for changes in zzso expression with zzso gene zzso 

No serious grade 3 zzso side effects were zzso There was low acute zzso with moist zzso zzso noted in 2 of 22 patients, zzso grade 2 to 3 in 5 of 22 patients, and severe zzso in 2 of 22 zzso One patient died from zzso zzso before treatment zzso Within a median follow-up of 18 months, two patients with zzso direct involvement of adjacent zzso expressed zzso zzso Out of 19 zzso cases, 13 zzso showed complete response and 4 showed zzso partial zzso Fourteen patients are alive with no evidence of zzso zzso In the gene array analysis, 30 known genes associated with zzso factors, DNA repair, and proliferation were zzso by zzso zzso gene was the most consistently zzso zzso 

The combination of zzso with zzso is feasible and results in a high rate of durable complete responses in patients with zzso zzso may occur through a direct effect on tumor cells followed by a wide scale suppression of zzso factors and genes involved in DNA repair and zzso
