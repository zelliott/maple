zzso zzso zzso channels have been reported to be involved in the proliferation of many types of cells, including tumor zzso The zzso of the zzso channels and related channel activity are involved in the zzso zzso Our previous study has shown the existence of delayed zzso zzso zzso current in gastric cancer cells zzso However, the expression and function of most delayed zzso zzso zzso channel zzso in gastric cancer cells are not completely zzso Here we examine expression of zzso channel zzso in zzso families in immortalized gastric zzso cells GES and various gastric cancer cells (including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and their roles in cell zzso zzso analysis reveals that all cell lines examined express zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, zzso and zzso genes are barely zzso in any given cancer cell zzso zzso zzso high zzso levels in all cell lines zzso is also expressed in some cancer cells lines and more frequently detected in gastric cancer zzso zzso of the expression of zzso in zzso with zzso interference significantly inhibited the proliferation and zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, in zzso rather than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a rapid increase in the concentration of zzso calcium in empty zzso zzso cells that was blocked by zzso Likewise, decrease the expression of zzso with short interfering zzso also blocked the zzso influx of zzso This finding suggests that more than one kind of zzso channel zzso are expressed in various gastric cancer cell zzso zzso may be involved in tumor cells proliferation by controlling zzso entry, and the interference of zzso channels expression and/or activity could provide a novel strategy to reverse the zzso zzso of gastric cancer zzso
