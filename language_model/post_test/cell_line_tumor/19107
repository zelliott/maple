The Mediterranean diet is rich in extra virgin olive oil zzso and associated with a lower zzso of zzso zzso zzso contains zzso extracts with potential zzso zzso 

To assess the zzso properties of zzso zzso extracts using in zzso zzso 

zzso profiles of two different zzso (A and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso (both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso knocked zzso cell lines were treated with zzso extracts and assessed for cell zzso zzso was determined by terminal zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso zzso and changes in zzso transcript zzso Cell cycle analysis was determined by flow zzso and western zzso To confirm the data, analysis of cell viability and cell cycle was performed with zzso zzso 

Chemical characterization showed that zzso is the main zzso in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso Only zzso affected cell zzso which was significantly more pronounced in zzso zzso At a concentration of 200 zzso zzso cells showed increased zzso and zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso proteins were zzso after treatment, with a parallel decrease of zzso zzso zzso results on cell viability and cell cycle were obtained with zzso zzso but this required a higher concentration than in zzso 

Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso extracts have potent zzso properties and specifically zzso the zzso zzso This result was achieved at substantially lower zzso in zzso than with zzso zzso indicating a possible zzso effect between the various zzso in olive zzso
