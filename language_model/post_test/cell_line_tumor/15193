Given the fundamental roles of zzso zzso zzso in the regulation of DNA repair, zzso zzso and zzso structure, it is fitting that therapies targeting zzso activities are now being explored as zzso zzso In fact, two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso approved for zzso treatment of zzso zzso T cell zzso zzso An important target of these zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso regulates processes such as DNA repair, zzso and zzso through the regulation of zzso structure and gene zzso Here we show that zzso zzso using a first in class selective zzso zzso resulted in decreased cell growth in zzso cell lines due to increased zzso that was associated with DNA damage and impaired S phase zzso Through isolation of proteins on nascent DNA zzso we found that zzso was associated with zzso and is present at and around DNA replication zzso DNA fiber labeling analysis showed that zzso of zzso resulted in a significant reduction in DNA replication fork zzso within the first hour of drug zzso These results suggest that selective zzso of zzso could be useful in treatment of zzso by zzso DNA replication of the rapidly cycling tumor cells, ultimately leading to cell zzso
