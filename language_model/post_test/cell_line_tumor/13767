The clinical efficacy of zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso is limited by the development of drug zzso The irreversible zzso zzso inhibitor zzso is effective against the most common mechanism of drug resistance zzso by the zzso zzso zzso Here, we show, in multiple complementary models, that resistance to zzso develops through zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling caused by either an amplification of zzso protein zzso 1 zzso or by zzso of negative regulators of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso restores sensitivity to zzso and prevents the emergence of drug zzso We further identify zzso amplification in an zzso zzso zzso cell lung zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso cells also show an increase both in zzso zzso and a decrease in sensitivity to zzso zzso Our findings provide insights into mechanisms of drug resistance to zzso zzso zzso and highlight rational combination therapies that should be evaluated in clinical zzso
