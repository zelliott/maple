zzso of the zzso protein zzso is lost or reduced in a significant proportion of zzso zzso zzso but the underlying mechanism for this is zzso We have demonstrated absence of zzso zzso expression in 7 of 37 zzso cell lines and shown that all 7 cell lines have a zzso zzso zzso Twenty-five cell lines showed both zzso zzso expression and an zzso zzso zzso The five remaining cell lines had a partially zzso zzso promoter and all expressed zzso zzso when treated with the zzso agent, zzso these five cell lines all showed increased zzso zzso No zzso were found in the promoter and coding regions of zzso One zzso was demonstrated in each of the promoter, zzso zzso and coding region of zzso 1 of zzso but there were no associations between zzso zzso expression and different zzso zzso Similarly, there was no association between zzso zzso expression and loss of zzso at the zzso zzso In conclusion, absence or reduction of zzso expression in zzso seems to be primarily regulated by promoter zzso and is probably selected for because of its impact on the differentiation of zzso
