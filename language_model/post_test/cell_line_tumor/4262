Despite the accumulating knowledge of zzso in pancreatic cancer molecular zzso no substantial improvements in the clinical prognosis have been made and this zzso continues to be a leading cause of cancer death in the Western zzso The orphan nuclear zzso zzso is a regulator of a wide range of biological processes and it may exert a zzso role in cancer zzso interestingly, indirect zzso suggest that the zzso could be involved in pancreatic zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the expression of zzso in human pancreatic tumors and to unveil its role in the regulation of pancreatic tumor zzso We evaluated zzso expression by zzso on primary zzso We analyzed the effect of the nuclear zzso zzso in human pancreatic cancer cells by means of zzso expressing cell zzso We finally confirmed the in zzso results by in zzso experiments on nude zzso zzso is expressed in zzso of tested primary samples and zzso with the zzso and zzso status and clinical zzso zzso and Cox zzso analysis show that it may be an independent zzso factor of worst zzso In zzso zzso of zzso reduces the cell growth and zzso and it strongly zzso zzso an effect zzso by the regulation of zzso In nude mice, zzso zzso reduces tumor growth by zzso Our results suggest that zzso might be an important regulator of the behavior of pancreatic zzso thus representing a possible new target for pancreatic cancer zzso
