A zzso brain tumor model using experimental animals is required to study biological behavior and develop more potent zzso drugs and effective therapeutic zzso In this work, we attempted to establish diffuse zzso zzso in the rat by zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso injection of 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso cells in zzso rats was performed to establish a primary diffuse zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to study the biological behavior of the developed zzso zzso physical findings and zzso features were also zzso 

zzso zzso grew in all zzso rats after the administration of 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso hypertension, weight loss and zzso developed, and the median survival time was zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso mass distributed throughout the zzso the zzso regions in the brain and the zzso with typical pathological features of zzso The zzso zzso showed high zzso labeling index zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso suggested zzso invasion and zzso zzso 

The advantage of the zzso injection route is the absence of an operative zzso in the zzso This established animal model is a novel model of primary diffuse zzso zzso This model probably can be used for zzso testing in the progression of zzso
