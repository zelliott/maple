A highly sensitive and selective liquid zzso tandem mass zzso zzso method has been developed to zzso cellular levels of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Cellular samples were extracted with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso M ammonium zzso pH zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was achieved on a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso column with zzso zzso using a mobile phase of zzso zzso ammonium zzso pH 4 zzso zzso at a flow rate of zzso zzso The zzso were zzso using a triple zzso mass zzso which was operated in zzso mode employing positive zzso zzso The limit of detection and limit of zzso for zzso was determined to be 15 and 31 zzso on column, zzso The limit of detection and zzso for zzso was 3 and 15 zzso on column, zzso The method allowed for sensitive and accurate determination of cellular levels of zzso and zzso In addition, we examined the potential for this method to be zzso to zzso other zzso using zzso zzso zzso and zzso as zzso In principle, these agents were also quantifiable by this method, however, no drug specific validation studies were undertaken with these zzso The data indicates that in the cancer zzso model, zzso significantly more zzso accumulates in cells in comparison to zzso Additionally, zzso of the membrane protein drug zzso zzso zzso a common cancer drug resistance zzso greatly reduces the cellular zzso of zzso but not of zzso
