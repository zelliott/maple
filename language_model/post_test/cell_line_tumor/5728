Following our recent findings on the presence of human zzso zzso in the normal human adrenal zzso and in zzso tumors, especially in zzso tumors, aim of the present study was to investigate the direct effects of zzso infection on human zzso zzso To this aim, both clinical zzso and laboratory strains of zzso were used to assess the early effects of infection on human zzso cell zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso Both clinical and laboratory zzso strains could zzso and replicate in primary human zzso cell cultures and in zzso zzso cell lines, leading to zzso zzso Most importantly, in the first hours zzso zzso zzso cells showed a significant increase of cortisol and zzso production, paralleled by zzso of zzso acute regulatory protein and expression of zzso zzso involved in the last steps of adrenal zzso This effect was probably due to zzso zzso gene zzso since it was most evident in the early zzso zzso and zzso viral particles did not affect hormone zzso Moreover, the effect on zzso was zzso specific, since it was not observed after infection with zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that human zzso cells are zzso to zzso infection and acutely respond to infection with increased cortisol zzso An acute zzso response is typically triggered by infections and is considered to be critical to host defense against zzso although, in the case of zzso infection, it might also enhance viral replication and zzso from zzso
