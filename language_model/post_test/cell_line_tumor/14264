In only two steps and in zzso overall yield, naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso was converted into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This new zzso was then transformed easily in one additional 4 + zzso step into zzso zzso 5, and further modification led to zzso alcohol zzso 7 and its zzso zzso 8 and zzso zzso alcohol zzso 7 is the most zzso active in zzso 10 times more potent than zzso zzso zzso alcohol zzso 7 is approximately zzso times more orally zzso in zzso than the zzso drug sodium zzso and is about 37 times more zzso than sodium zzso via subcutaneous zzso Both zzso 5 and 7 are zzso stable neat even at 60 degrees C for 24 zzso zzso zzso 5 is very highly growth zzso but not zzso toward several human cancer cell zzso both zzso 5 and 7 very efficiently and selectively kill human cervical cancer cells in zzso in a zzso manner with no zzso effects on normal cervical zzso
