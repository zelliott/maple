Five zzso zzso zzso derivatives and a zzso and two zzso and zzso zzso were prepared and characterized as potential zzso zzso zzso The biological effects of all these derivatives were assessed on human melanoma tumor cells, and their cellular zzso and zzso zzso were zzso All zzso except the zzso complex which was not zzso demonstrated comparable zzso in the absence of laser zzso The zzso complexes exhibited excellent zzso toward melanoma cells when exposed to laser light at zzso zzso Cellular zzso and zzso zzso studies of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 5) zzso zzso revealed that they accumulated in the melanoma cell zzso in zzso structures different from zzso The fluorescent zzso zzso and the metal component were localized in similar structures within the zzso Thus, the zzso zzso derivatives represent a promising new class of zzso zzso able to combine zzso activity with zzso therapeutic treatment of zzso
