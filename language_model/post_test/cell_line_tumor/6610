zzso oxide zzso is a zzso important zzso that has been implicated in the zzso of diseases associated with chronic zzso such as zzso While the complicated chemistry of zzso zzso has been extensively study in zzso neither the spectrum of DNA zzso nor their consequences in zzso have been rigorously zzso We have approached this problem by exposing human zzso zzso cells to controlled zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso NO along with 186 zzso zzso in a recently developed reactor that avoids the anomalous zzso chemistry of NO and zzso the conditions at sites of inflammation in zzso The resulting spectrum of zzso zzso products was defined using a recently developed liquid zzso zzso zzso method, and the results were correlated with zzso and zzso A series of control experiments revealed the necessity of using zzso and zzso zzso zzso to avoid zzso formation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, during DNA isolation and zzso Exposure of zzso cells to zzso zzso NO and 186 zzso zzso for 12 h zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso loss of cell viability measured immediately after exposure and zzso zzso after a 24 h recovery zzso The same exposure resulted in zzso zzso and zzso increases in zzso zzso and zzso respectively, to reach the following zzso zzso 7 zzso 1) per zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso zzso per zzso zzso and zzso 40 zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso was not detected above the limit of detection of 6 zzso per zzso zzso in 50 zzso of zzso A 12 h exposure to zzso zzso NO and 190 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso caused zzso zzso and zzso increases in zzso zzso and zzso respectively, accompanied by a approximately zzso zzso zzso reduction in cell viability immediately after zzso Again, zzso was not zzso These results reveal modest increases in the zzso levels of DNA zzso products in cells exposed to relatively zzso levels of zzso This could result from limited zzso chemistry in nuclear DNA in cells exposed to NO or high levels of formation balanced by rapid repair of zzso zzso zzso in zzso
