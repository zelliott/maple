The purposes of this study were to zzso the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso I) on several biological features of lung cancer cells, including growth, proliferation and invasion, to collect experimental evidence for the future biological treatment of human lung zzso The zzso expression zzso zzso was constructed and zzso into the human lung cancer cell line zzso The biological properties of the resulting zzso lung cancer cell line were evaluated using zzso zzso zzso zzso flow zzso and a zzso invasion zzso Additionally, the influence of zzso on the gene expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso Compared to the zzso zzso cells and the cells zzso with the empty zzso zzso the zzso cells displayed significantly reduced growth rates and decreased viability zzso zzso zzso The zzso cells also displayed a significantly higher percentage of cells in zzso phase zzso zzso zzso and a lower percentage of cells in S phase zzso zzso zzso a higher percentage of zzso zzso zzso zzso and finally, a notable reduction in the basement zzso rate in the zzso invasion zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, it was determined that zzso is capable of zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso however, zzso promotes the expression of both zzso and zzso in zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso of zzso gene might be associated with the zzso of lung cancer cell growth, proliferation and invasion, and the promotion of zzso
