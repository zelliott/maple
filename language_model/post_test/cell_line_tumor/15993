zzso zzso melanoma is a lethal disease highly resistant to zzso and zzso zzso the development of new treatment strategies is strongly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is essential for the response to zzso and zzso Although zzso is not frequently zzso in melanoma, it is zzso by zzso zzso zzso as we previously demonstrated 1, which may account, at least zzso for increased zzso resistance of zzso zzso In this study we addressed the question whether functional restoration of zzso by zzso zzso which can reactivate zzso zzso and induce massive zzso in cancer cells, is able to restore the function of inactive zzso in zzso Using a three-dimensional collagen gel zzso to culture melanoma cells carrying zzso zzso we found that zzso treatment resulted in zzso of zzso leading to increased expression of zzso zzso targets zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso 9 and zzso Moreover, zzso triggered melanoma cell zzso that was zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment also suppressed human melanoma zzso tumors in zzso in a zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso may provide a novel approach for zzso melanoma treatment, with zzso as a candidate drug for such a zzso
