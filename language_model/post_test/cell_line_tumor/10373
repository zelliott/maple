zzso zzso leukemia in chronic phase zzso cells that harbor zzso zzso and normal zzso zzso often become resistant to the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso Here, we report that loss of the remaining normal zzso zzso in these tumors, which results from cryptic zzso deletion in zzso in patients who did not achieve a complete zzso zzso zzso during treatment, engenders a novel unexpected mechanism of zzso zzso zzso zzso leukemia cells were zzso to zzso as indicated by persistent zzso zzso zzso lack of zzso protein degradation, increased cell survival, and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso but not a zzso zzso restored the zzso effects of zzso in zzso chronic zzso leukemia zzso cells and in zzso zzso zzso leukemia zzso The zzso concentration of zzso and expression of its zzso were not affected, although proteins involved in zzso degradation were zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, 12 genes associated with zzso resistance were favorably zzso in zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicate that loss of the normal zzso zzso may serve as a key zzso factor that exerts major impact on zzso treatment zzso
