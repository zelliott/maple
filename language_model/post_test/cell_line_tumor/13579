zzso are the most common tumors in the central nervous zzso This study aims to investigate the expressions of transforming growth zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in human brain zzso zzso and the correlation between their expressions with clinical pathological features and clinical zzso The expressions of zzso or protein of zzso and zzso were detected by using reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and Western zzso in these zzso Positive rates of the expression of zzso and zzso were zzso % and zzso % in brain zzso of zzso zzso The expressions of zzso or protein for zzso in brain zzso zzso were significantly higher than that in normal brain zzso zzso zzso zzso Their expressions in zzso zzso brain zzso were lower than those in poorly differentiated zzso brain zzso zzso zzso zzso A negative correlation was found between zzso and zzso in brain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The cell numbers of zzso zzso through zzso chambers were decreased significantly zzso zzso zzso and the expression of zzso was zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso However, the expression of zzso was zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso The expression changes of zzso and zzso may be related to the emergence and the development of zzso zzso of zzso expression using zzso can decrease the invasive capability of zzso zzso zzso
