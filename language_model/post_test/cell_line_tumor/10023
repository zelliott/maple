Generation of zzso is a characteristic of tumor cells, promoting the degradation of zzso zzso tumor progression and zzso The process is accelerated if zzso and zzso zzso are bound to their cell surface zzso 

In this study we show that the zzso zzso that recognizes an zzso on the zzso 8 zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso acts as a binding site for zzso however, by using zzso zzso we demonstrated that it is also zzso with zzso zzso therefore, function also as a zzso for zzso on the cell surface, and the presence of zzso zzso may prevent the binding of zzso to a designated zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso generation resulted in changed cell zzso enhanced cell zzso to zzso reduced invasion potential, and an enhanced zzso zzso Moreover, surface zzso resonance analysis showed that the synthetic zzso corresponding to the zzso sequence zzso binds zzso in the zzso zzso 

These novel findings suggest a model in which zzso together with zzso zzso and zzso constitutes a signaling platform capable of modulating cell zzso signal zzso in breast tumor zzso zzso zzso which competes for the binding site for zzso could be used as an agent to reduce the invasive potential of breast tumor zzso
