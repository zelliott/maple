The high frequency with which the novel tumor zzso zzso is zzso by promoter zzso suggests that it plays a key role in the development of many primary human zzso Yet the mechanism of zzso action remains zzso We now show that zzso associates with zzso and that this association is essential for zzso to mediate its growth zzso zzso zzso of zzso promotes the formation of stable zzso whereas a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein is expressed as two main zzso zzso and zzso The smaller zzso zzso also associates with zzso but is less effective at stabilizing zzso Because zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso zzso we examined their effects upon zzso zzso zzso and zzso block activated zzso zzso zzso However, a point zzso of zzso identified in human tumors, was severely defective for stabilizing zzso and was unable to block the zzso zzso effects of zzso Thus, we identify a role for zzso in the control of zzso zzso and potentially in the maintenance of zzso zzso
