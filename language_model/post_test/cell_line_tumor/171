zzso therapy zzso by zzso acid zzso has been developed as a therapeutic zzso for zzso superficial zzso zzso Here, in experiments using zzso cancer cell lines, we investigated the effects of zzso modulating zzso and degradation pathways for zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso suppressed zzso synthesis and significantly increased zzso zzso IX zzso zzso leading to enhanced zzso in four of five cell zzso zzso zzso zzso is recognized as important for zzso against zzso stress such as zzso zzso zzso of zzso leads to decreased zzso zzso zzso resulting in a failure to enhance zzso effect in four cell zzso zzso of zzso caused marked growth zzso in zzso zzso zzso whereas no zzso effect was observed in zzso lacking zzso zzso Moreover, zzso protein levels and zzso repeat zzso of the zzso gene promoter region were examined with the implication that the zzso expressions of zzso protein were associated with a shorter zzso zzso Our results suggested that zzso zzso zzso improved the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso was associated with shorter zzso repeat of the promoter region, and zzso zzso zzso of zzso could suppress the growth of zzso cancer cells zzso zzso
