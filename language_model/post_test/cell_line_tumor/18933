zzso remains therapy of choice for zzso zzso zzso zzso breast zzso However, resistance and recurrence are serious zzso Our previous work indicated that zzso zzso cell zzso zzso 6 zzso was significantly zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to determine the functional role of zzso in zzso breast cancer and to zzso test whether it was zzso of resistance in a large cohort of breast zzso with long-term zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso was done in zzso cells and effects on zzso and zzso sensitivity were zzso zzso zzso was done on a tissue zzso zzso 108 relapsed primary human breast zzso and 243 zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso reduced both zzso and zzso and zzso growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso restored sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso and zzso response to zzso zzso showed significantly more zzso expression in the relapsed group compared with zzso controls zzso of 108 zzso and 32 of 243 zzso zzso odds ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso zzso Additionally, we derived an outcome predictor model based on zzso expression that zzso patients in the Nottingham zzso index zzso group into either zzso or zzso zzso 

Our data support an important role for zzso in zzso resistance, which can serve as a powerful predictor of future zzso
