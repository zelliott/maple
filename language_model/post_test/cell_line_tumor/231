In this communication, the roles of zzso factor zzso and zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso in zzso zzso were investigated in human zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso Positive zzso and protein expressions of zzso and zzso in these cells were zzso However, no zzso could be zzso zzso of expression zzso zzso into zzso resulted in zzso zzso and peak level zzso was observed 24 h after the zzso disclosed by DNA fragmentation zzso In addition, it was found with Western zzso that zzso and zzso were released into zzso from zzso and zzso was further zzso into nucleus, during the stage of zzso cell zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso by zzso interference could, however, alleviate zzso cell zzso In conclusion, zzso could induce zzso in human zzso zzso cancer zzso cells, through at least releasing zzso and zzso from zzso into zzso and nucleus, where zzso cascade takes zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are important factors in a zzso zzso cell zzso zzso
