zzso zzso zzso have been developed as effective zzso for a wide variety of zzso zzso of zzso by gene transfer provides an option for overcoming the difficulties in zzso production and manufacturing zzso However, for the zzso structure of full-length zzso it is important to design an optimal gene transfer system for zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso promoter zzso zzso were combined to deliver zzso zzso genes in human zzso cell zzso In order to zzso the zzso for zzso generation, four zzso were designed and zzso and the most efficient one was zzso zzso and Western zzso were conducted to evaluate zzso products in the zzso 

Our data showed that all of four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production in zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso It was observed that the zzso zzso construct zzso an zzso zzso zzso situated zzso of a zzso zzso with a zzso disease virus 2A zzso site in the middle, zzso into the zzso zzso zzso zzso could induce the highest level expression of zzso (about zzso zzso in zzso among these four zzso zzso the zzso products by gene transfer methods retained specific zzso zzso 

Our studies gave further evidence that it was feasible to produce active full-length zzso in human zzso cell lines in zzso by a special gene delivery zzso Moreover, we developed an zzso zzso gene transfer system for future gene therapy research, which may also be of use in industrial zzso zzso
