Numerous studies have shown zzso and zzso effects of water and standardized zzso ethanol extracts derived from the medicinal zzso zzso zzso but the biological activity of methanol extracts has not been examined so zzso In the present study we investigated the zzso effect of zzso zzso methanol extract (which contains zzso and zzso on zzso mouse melanoma cells both in zzso and in zzso In zzso treatment of the cells with the methanol extract zzso zzso reduced melanoma cell viability in a zzso zzso Furthermore, in the presence of the methanol extract zzso zzso concentration zzso the proliferation of zzso cells was arrested in the zzso phase of the cell cycle, followed by both zzso and secondary zzso cell zzso In zzso methanol extract treatment zzso 50 zzso for 14 zzso inhibited tumor growth in zzso mice zzso with zzso zzso tumor zzso Moreover, zzso zzso collected 21 days after tumor zzso from methanol zzso animals exerted stronger zzso activity ex zzso than zzso from control zzso zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that zzso zzso methanol extract exerts pronounced zzso activity, both directly through zzso and zzso effects on tumor cells and indirectly through promotion of zzso zzso zzso
