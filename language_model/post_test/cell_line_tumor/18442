zzso zzso is formed by the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso then, the zzso is oxidized to zzso acid zzso by zzso zzso zzso or reduced to zzso zzso by zzso zzso The present work aimed at evaluating the in zzso toxicity of zzso on zzso zzso zzso cells which accumulate zzso zzso synthesis was zzso by zzso cells with zzso and blocking zzso zzso by zzso an irreversible inhibitor of zzso As evidenced by zzso reduction zzso zzso and zzso treatments produced cell losses which increased with zzso zzso zzso reduced by zzso cell viability after a zzso treatment, when its zzso zzso reducing viability by zzso value was zzso zzso zzso M after a 24 h zzso For the same treatment zzso zzso values for zzso were 8 zzso zzso and zzso zzso 10 zzso M, zzso zzso reduction zzso performed after a zzso treatment followed by a zzso incubation in a drug-free medium evidenced that the toxicity of zzso zzso or zzso zzso was zzso by the second zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso was produced at the early stages of the treatment by zzso and zzso This was evidenced by the significant increase in the zzso + zzso ratio observed after a combined zzso treatment by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Total contents in zzso and zzso were greatly reduced at the end of a 15 h treatment, and zzso did not significantly enhanced the zzso + zzso zzso For both treatment zzso zzso and zzso were zzso only in the zzso zzso So, these results suggest that an early production of zzso could produce delayed toxic effects on zzso zzso zzso of zzso and release of zzso could be important means for reducing zzso zzso in zzso zzso
