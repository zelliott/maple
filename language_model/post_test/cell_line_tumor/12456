zzso comparative zzso zzso zzso is being widely used to screen for zzso zzso copy number zzso in zzso with imbalances typically detected through the application of gain and loss zzso Review of array zzso publications for the year 2005 showed that a wide range of thresholds are zzso However, the effect of sample zzso on the sensitivity of these thresholds for single copy zzso zzso has not been zzso Here, we describe a method to evaluate the detection accuracy of thresholds for detecting zzso in cell line array zzso zzso By applying a hidden zzso zzso method, we segmented array zzso data from zzso cell lines and generated zzso zzso zzso from which we identified optimum thresholds relevant to sample zzso We demonstrate that commonly used zzso thresholds are zzso in their ability to call zzso particularly when applied to zzso or zzso cell zzso We conclude that the use of zzso thresholds improves the sensitivity of zzso array zzso for detecting zzso in cell zzso Because zzso is a common feature of cancer cells, the application of zzso thresholds to cell lines (and potentially to clinical zzso may improve the detection sensitivity of zzso of biological zzso
