zzso regulatory T cells zzso are essential for immune zzso and maintenance of zzso They are produced in the zzso and also generated de zzso in the periphery in a zzso zzso zzso zzso are also required to achieve tolerance to transplanted zzso when induced by zzso or zzso zzso Using zzso mice to avoid issues of zzso pathology, we show that zzso expression is both necessary and sufficient for tissue tolerance by zzso zzso Moreover, the known need in tolerance induction for zzso signaling to T cells can wholly be explained by its role in induction of zzso as such signaling proved zzso for the zzso zzso We analyzed the relative contribution of zzso and zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso and showed that zzso zzso a large set of zzso signature zzso The number of genes uniquely modulated due to the influence of zzso alone was surprisingly zzso zzso conditional nuclear expression of zzso proved sufficient to zzso zzso potency on zzso T cells and was lost once nuclear zzso expression was zzso These data support a dual role for zzso and zzso in induced zzso in which zzso stimulates zzso zzso for which sustained expression is then associated with acquisition of zzso
