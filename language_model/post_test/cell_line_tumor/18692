zzso of zzso from human zzso zzso improves its affinity for zzso zzso zzso zzso This is the first case where a zzso modification is shown to improve zzso affinity for the receptors without zzso capacity, suggesting a novel zzso strategy to improve zzso zzso To address the mechanisms of affinity improvement by the zzso zzso we used zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis with surface zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso binding was driven by favorable binding zzso zzso but opposed by zzso binding zzso change zzso zzso depletion from zzso enhanced the favorable zzso leading to the increase in the binding constant of zzso for the zzso by a factor of zzso The increase in the affinity was mainly attributed to an enhanced association zzso A triple zzso acid substitution in zzso zzso is also known to improve zzso affinity for zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso acid substitution attenuated the zzso zzso resulting in a three- to fourfold increase in the binding zzso The affinity enhancement by the zzso acid substitution was due to a reduced zzso zzso These results indicate that the mechanism of affinity improvement by the zzso depletion is quite distinct from that by the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso exhibited higher zzso cellular zzso zzso than zzso showing a correlation between zzso affinity for zzso and zzso We also examined the effect of zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso The zzso to Val substitution increased zzso affinity for zzso in an zzso manner with the reduced zzso zzso These results together highlight the distinctive functional improvement of affinity by zzso zzso and suggest that engineering of zzso zzso can improve zzso affinity for receptors via an zzso and association zzso zzso
