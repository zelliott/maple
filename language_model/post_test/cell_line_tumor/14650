zzso and zzso are the basic zzso factors that control zzso zzso including zzso zzso factor zzso and human zzso zzso zzso Here, we analyzed a role of zzso and zzso in human acute leukemia cell lines, zzso and zzso in association with a modified zzso structure by zzso zzso zzso zzso sodium zzso zzso and vitamin zzso We found that sodium zzso zzso alone and zzso with zzso zzso or zzso before the induction of differentiation with zzso acid in the presence of vitamin B3 effectively accelerated and enhanced differentiation to zzso in zzso but not in zzso cells as detected by zzso test and the expression of zzso and zzso zzso using flow zzso zzso zzso induced a zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in both cell lines with the delay in zzso zzso zzso different induction of zzso and zzso cell differentiation was paralleled by the zzso of zzso and zzso binding to the zzso and the zzso promoters in zzso mobility shift zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso promoter at the zzso binding site in zzso but not in zzso cells under the combined zzso The results indicate that zzso events, such as zzso zzso are involved in the activity zzso of the key zzso factors responsible for the induction of zzso differentiation in zzso leukemia zzso
