The association of zzso zzso zzso is a key step in the initiation of growth zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso of zzso zzso receptors was the central dogma of zzso zzso zzso zzso for decades, the existence of larger zzso is now zzso Both zzso and zzso are of extreme importance in the zzso growth factor zzso zzso family, leading to diverse and robust zzso We present a statistically reliable, zzso zzso resonance energy transfer method for the quantitative characterization of large-scale zzso zzso We assumed that a fraction of a certain protein species is zzso whereas the rest are present in zzso of zzso We measured zzso zzso as a function of the zzso of fluorescent zzso zzso and fitted the model to the zzso data yielding the fraction of zzso and the cluster zzso We found that zzso formed larger zzso than zzso zzso with zzso and zzso led to a decrease in zzso zzso size, whereas zzso zzso became larger after zzso zzso The zzso level of zzso was zzso zzso to its zzso zzso We conclude that zzso of zzso and zzso behave in a fundamentally different zzso Whereas huge zzso clusters serve as a zzso of inactive zzso and zzso upon zzso small zzso zzso form zzso zzso after zzso zzso
