The zzso gene encodes zzso zzso interactive zzso protein zzso which zzso in zzso zzso zzso has been showed to function as a tumor zzso in various cancer zzso In the current study, we investigated the expression and prognosis value of zzso in primary gastric zzso Meanwhile, the biological role of zzso was further investigated using cell model in zzso 

To investigate the role of zzso gene in primary gastric cancer zzso real-time quantitative zzso and western zzso were used to examine the zzso expression in paired zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso expression in most zzso zzso compared with the matched adjacent zzso zzso and in gastric cancer cell zzso To further investigate the zzso and zzso roles of zzso zzso we performed zzso analyses of the 224 zzso gastric cancer tissue zzso Data revealed that the loss of zzso expression was significantly correlated with T stage zzso zzso zzso and grade zzso zzso zzso zzso with these results, we found that loss of zzso expression was significantly correlated with poor survival in gastric cancer patients zzso zzso zzso Cox zzso analyses showed that zzso expression was an independent predictor of overall survival zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the functions of zzso in the proliferation and colony formation of gastric cell lines were analyzed by zzso cells with full-length zzso expression zzso or zzso targeting zzso zzso zzso expression in gastric cancer cells significantly inhibited cell proliferation and colony zzso zzso zzso expression in gastric zzso cell line significantly enhanced cell growth zzso 

Our data suggest that zzso may play an important role in gastric cancer and may serve as a valuable zzso marker and potential target for gene therapy in the treatment of gastric zzso
