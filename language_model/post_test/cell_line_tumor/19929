Seven zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso reactions of zzso derivatives with zzso zzso zzso produced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso was coupled with the appropriate zzso to produce the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso via zzso zzso of an activated zzso zzso with the corresponding zzso All compounds were characterized by zzso analysis, zzso zzso zzso and mass zzso X-ray zzso confirmed the solid-state structure of three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The above compounds, along with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (11) were examined for zzso in cell lines zzso and zzso and for zzso activity in zzso zzso strains zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso In general, the compounds were nontoxic in the human cell line tested zzso and compounds 4, 7, and 9 showed moderate zzso activity in one or more of the zzso zzso zzso
