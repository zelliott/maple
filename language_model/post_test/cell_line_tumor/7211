A novel strategy that targets protein for degradation has recently been developed by exploiting a zzso zzso zzso zzso Typically, the zzso zzso is composed of a zzso zzso zzso on one end and a synthetic zzso on the zzso This zzso is recognized by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso thereby recruiting a small zzso protein zzso to zzso for zzso and zzso Since selective degradation of a cellular protein generates a zzso of zzso zzso this protein zzso strategy may be useful to study the function of a given protein or to evaluate whether a cellular protein is a potential target for drug intervention, in a manner reminiscent of gene zzso or zzso zzso zzso we show that a synthetic zzso is sufficient to interact with zzso zzso zzso and that the zzso zzso efficiently zzso zzso and degradation of target zzso Our results also demonstrate that the zzso zzso can enter cells efficiently to exerts its biological activity zzso These results suggest that the synthetic zzso can be used either directly in the preparation of zzso zzso or as a template to develop zzso or zzso zzso
