zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso the human tumor necrosis factor zzso domain zzso zzso zzso is currently being developed as a treatment for lung zzso and has been shown to reduce zzso lung water and improve lung function in zzso zzso and pig zzso The current paradigm for liquid zzso in the adult zzso lung is that passive zzso zzso of sodium via the zzso zzso zzso channel zzso and zzso zzso zzso channels creates the major driving force for zzso of water through the zzso zzso in addition to other zzso channels such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso can increase zzso current in zzso cells as well as in freshly isolated type II zzso zzso cells from different zzso zzso is expressed zzso in all of these cell zzso zzso this study was undertaken to determine whether zzso is the specific target of zzso The effect of zzso in zzso cells as well as in human embryonic kidney cells and Chinese zzso zzso cells zzso expressing human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was measured in patch clamp zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activated zzso by increasing single-channel open zzso zzso increased current in zzso activated zzso but not zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso was required for zzso zzso No increase in current was observed after zzso of zzso zzso of zzso Thus, our data suggest that the specific interaction of zzso with both zzso and zzso expressed zzso requires precedent binding to zzso zzso zzso
