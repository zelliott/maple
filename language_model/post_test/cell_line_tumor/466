The zzso interaction zzso protein zzso plays a key role in DNA damage response zzso Using zzso and functional analysis, we established that the expression of the zzso gene is regulated in a DNA zzso manner by the master regulator zzso This regulation occurs at the zzso level through a zzso zzso response element in the zzso zzso Although it is zzso by zzso zzso is also able to regulate zzso through an association with both zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso providing zzso enhancement of zzso zzso zzso of zzso by small interfering zzso zzso zzso which, following DNA damage, results in an increased zzso of several zzso target genes as well as greater zzso zzso with these zzso zzso expression of zzso selectively zzso zzso zzso of target genes in an zzso manner in zzso zzso Thus, we identify a new DNA zzso role for zzso It can function in an zzso loop consisting of zzso zzso and the zzso master regulatory network, zzso an important role for this loop in zzso stability and zzso
