zzso possesses zzso effects that were related to various molecular mechanisms beyond zzso zzso The ability of zzso to interfere with the function of zzso receptors in the zzso course appears as a promising therapeutic zzso This refers to numerous findings that zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso We recently demonstrated that zzso interferes with the zzso zzso on zzso melanoma cells binding to zzso To confirm this activity and to obtain further insight into molecular recognition of zzso by zzso we investigated the zzso of zzso zzso binding of human melanoma zzso cells to zzso zzso by different zzso The size of zzso has an important impact on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso zzso representing a mean of about zzso zzso displayed high zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso reduced zzso slightly, while the zzso zzso was without zzso To confirm molecular recognition of zzso by zzso a surface acoustic zzso was zzso A zzso containing membrane preparation of zzso cells was zzso at the sensors to allow for detection of kinetic binding zzso of zzso compared to zzso zzso binds to zzso with affinity in the low zzso range zzso zzso zzso zzso which clearly indicates specific molecular zzso Furthermore, zzso displays a nearly identical zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso which is evident for interference with the zzso zzso The data provide evidence for a direct confirmation of zzso binding to zzso and thus, contribute to understand the zzso activity of zzso
