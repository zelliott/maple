zzso are zzso zzso zzso and therefore their replication completely depends on host cell zzso In case of the zzso C virus zzso a zzso zzso virus that in the majority of infections establishes zzso zzso are considered to play an important role in zzso zzso zzso to the observation that zzso known to zzso zzso by direct zzso profoundly block zzso replication in cultured human zzso cells, conflicting results were obtained as to the particular zzso zzso required for viral zzso replication and the underlying possible mode of zzso By using a set of cell lines with stable zzso of zzso or zzso we demonstrate in the present work that replication of zzso zzso zzso of different zzso is reduced by zzso depletion up to zzso whereas zzso of zzso had no zzso zzso of replication was rescued by zzso of wild type zzso but not by a zzso lacking zzso zzso zzso of zzso full length zzso was even more sensitive to zzso depletion as compared to zzso zzso and virus production was completely zzso These results argue that zzso may target an additional viral factor outside of the minimal zzso contributing to zzso amplification and zzso presumably zzso protein zzso By selecting for resistance against the zzso analogue zzso that targets zzso in a zzso manner, we identified two zzso zzso and zzso close to the zzso site between zzso protein zzso and the zzso zzso zzso in zzso protein zzso that slow down zzso zzso at this site and reduce zzso dependence of viral zzso Further zzso acid zzso at the same zzso site accelerating processing increase zzso zzso Our results thus identify an unexpected correlation between zzso zzso processing and zzso dependence of zzso zzso
