zzso 18 is frequently rearranged in zzso We explored the distribution of zzso affecting zzso 18 by mapping 56 zzso in 26 zzso cell lines by zzso in zzso zzso zzso using bacterial artificial zzso zzso and band zzso The distribution of breaks among 18 intervals of zzso 18 was significantly zzso The zzso spanning the zzso contained the greatest number of breaks and had the highest average copy number of any zzso There was a high density of breaks close to the zzso as well as actually within the zzso A cluster of breaks encompassing zzso was associated with the minimum average copy number, consistent with zzso being a tumor zzso zzso There may be another cluster of breaks around zzso We offer two interpretations of the concentration of breaks near the zzso It may reflect selection for an zzso near the zzso or there may be an underlying bias of breakage toward the zzso We show that the latter is predicted by a simple model that zzso random breakage following zzso of some random point on the zzso or selection of breaks zzso to one of several tumor zzso zzso
