It has been reported that vascular zzso growth factor zzso is a potent zzso factor that also has the ability to increase vascular zzso zzso plays an important role in the development of zzso zzso in various zzso zzso has been prescribed for patients with zzso human pancreatic zzso zzso as a zzso zzso However, the response rates of patients with zzso zzso who were undergoing systemic chemotherapy were extremely zzso In the present study, we investigated the role of zzso and the effects of zzso on zzso zzso of human pancreatic zzso zzso As an in zzso zzso the human pancreatic cancer cell line zzso was incubated in zzso supplemented with serially diluted zzso of zzso for 24 zzso The expression levels of zzso in culture media were zzso using an zzso zzso zzso zzso As an in zzso zzso a cell suspension (1 zzso zzso cells in 100 zzso zzso was injected into the zzso zzso The mice were randomly divided into two groups zzso and treated with zzso The mice were sacrificed four weeks after zzso the zzso volume was measured, and the extent of zzso dissemination was zzso The expression levels of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso were examined by zzso In addition, zzso zzso protein levels were zzso using zzso The results show that zzso levels in the culture medium decreased in response to zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso formation and zzso dissemination within mice were suppressed by the treatment with zzso zzso analysis suggested that expression of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso was suppressed by zzso treatment, and the zzso protein level in zzso was significantly decreased by zzso ( zzso These results suggest that zzso controls zzso zzso and zzso zzso either directly or zzso via zzso Moreover, zzso administration of zzso may be a useful therapeutic approach for patients with zzso zzso in pancreatic zzso
