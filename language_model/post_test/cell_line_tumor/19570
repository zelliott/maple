Lung cancer is the leading cause of zzso deaths in the United zzso Despite improvements in radiation, surgery and chemotherapy the 5 year survival statistics of zzso cell lung cancer zzso have improved little over the past two zzso It has been proposed that zzso is a participant in the zzso against several zzso therapeutic agents including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has become an attractive target for enhancing the efficacy of radiation and zzso Numerous zzso pathways have been proposed as the means through which zzso zzso enhances the efficacy of zzso We zzso that the zzso zzso zzso will improve the efficacy of radiation therapy zzso at least in part, via the suppression of zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study we used the zzso inhibitor zzso to improve the efficacy of zzso when measured by tumor regrowth zzso in zzso and zzso survival in zzso For the in zzso zzso zzso tumor cells representing zzso were zzso injected into the right zzso of female zzso nude mice zzso Mice were given zzso via drinking water at a concentration of 5 zzso body weight zzso and the water was replenished zzso zzso were treated with 30 zzso zzso radiation and measured zzso For our in zzso study, zzso survival zzso were evaluated to determine the effect of zzso radiation, and the zzso The zzso zzso mechanism of zzso was measured by Western zzso analysis of zzso target zzso zzso and zzso In zzso mice that received combined treatments of 5 zzso zzso zzso and 30 zzso radiation (3 zzso 10 daily zzso had significant reduction in tumor size in comparison to the 30 zzso radiation control group ( zzso In zzso zzso alone produced a significant decrease in zzso survival at doses from zzso zzso zzso demonstrated an additive effect in combination with zzso zzso alone reduced zzso and zzso protein levels in a zzso zzso 6 zzso radiation caused an initial zzso of zzso protein levels which was inhibited by prior treatment of zzso suggesting an zzso of radiation induced zzso target zzso These results support the hypothesis that zzso zzso such as zzso can increase the efficacy of radiation zzso In zzso our results suggest that the zzso of zzso tumor cells by zzso is zzso by the suppression of zzso zzso zzso zzso
