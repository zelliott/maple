zzso zzso strain zzso produced two zzso inclusion proteins with a molecular mass of 88 zzso that were converted to zzso toxins when activated by zzso K zzso Both toxins exhibited strong zzso activity against two human cancer cell lines, zzso zzso leukemia zzso and zzso zzso cancer zzso while low or no zzso were observed against 11 human and three zzso cell lines, including four zzso cell zzso The zzso of both toxins on susceptible cells was characterized by rapid cell zzso Gene cloning experiments provided two novel genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso acid sequences of the two proteins contain five block regions commonly zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This is the first report of the occurrence of typical zzso zzso proteins with zzso activity preferential for cancer zzso
