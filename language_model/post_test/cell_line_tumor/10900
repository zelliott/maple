In zzso radiation therapy zzso and zzso zzso using a linear zzso radiation is administered zzso and one treatment session often requires 30 zzso or a longer zzso The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effect of zzso and dose per fraction on cell killing by zzso in intermittent zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells were zzso The cells were zzso to a total dose of 8 zzso in 2, 5, 10, 20 and 40 zzso over 15, 30 and 46 zzso The cells were also given 8 zzso in a single fraction over 15, 30 and 46 zzso using lower dose rates zzso prolonged radiation zzso As compared with the control group receiving a single dose of 8 zzso at zzso zzso the cell surviving fraction generally increased in groups receiving zzso or continuous prolonged zzso There was a general trend for cell survival to increase with the fraction number up to 20 or 40 zzso in both cell zzso The effects of zzso and linear accelerator zzso given over 15 zzso or longer may be less than those of zzso or zzso zzso There was a trend for radiation effect to decrease with fraction zzso
