We isolated peptides that home to mouse zzso root zzso zzso from a zzso library expressing random zzso peptides fused to a minor coat protein zzso of the zzso zzso An in zzso zzso procedure yielded 113 zzso plaques after five cycles of enrichment by incubation with isolated zzso zzso and two cycles of zzso by exposure to irrelevant cell zzso zzso of the sequences of this collection identified three zzso clones that occurred repeatedly during the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the three peptides bound to zzso zzso of different zzso To determine if the peptides would recognize zzso cells in zzso we injected individual zzso proteins into the zzso space of mice and observed the appearance of zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso with a similar size distribution as that observed in zzso indicating that the zzso proteins were recognized and taken up by different zzso zzso in zzso The identification of zzso zzso sequences provides a powerful tool for future studies on zzso zzso function in zzso and in zzso and opens up the possibility of zzso drug and gene delivery in the treatment of diseases affecting zzso zzso
