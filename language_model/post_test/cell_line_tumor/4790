zzso and Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells are frequently used for the production of zzso zzso With increasing interest in producing zzso zzso for protection against infectious agents, it is essential to characterize the zzso produced in these zzso Here we show that while myeloma cells zzso zzso predominantly as zzso zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso in addition to fully assembled zzso When the zzso cells also zzso J chain and zzso component zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in which SC is zzso bonded to the zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso protein by zzso with zzso zzso the zzso bonds between the H and L chains suggesting that the zzso bonds between H and L chains are zzso Taken together our results suggest that the zzso assembly of zzso is different in myeloma and zzso zzso
