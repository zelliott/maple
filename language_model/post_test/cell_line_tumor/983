The zzso locus on zzso 9 is a tumor zzso gene frequently zzso in human zzso In order to study the effects of zzso expression in tumor cells, we constructed a zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso infection of zzso zzso cells which has wild type zzso and zzso zzso revealed high levels of zzso zzso expression within zzso In addition, zzso expressing of zzso zzso was associated with increased levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Growth zzso zzso following zzso infection demonstrated that the growth of zzso cells was inhibited relative to infection with control zzso Furthermore, zzso analysis as well as zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso infection was associated with increased zzso in zzso cell line and that it was associated with zzso induced zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso cell death, indicating that zzso zzso induction of the zzso zzso is associated with increased zzso The finding that zzso infection did not induce zzso expression in zzso and zzso cells suggests that wild type zzso expression may be necessary for zzso induction of zzso The observation that zzso of zzso by zzso infection in zzso does not induce increased zzso protein levels nor zzso cell death suggests that zzso zzso is required but not sufficient enough for zzso These studies suggest there are other mechanisms other than induction of zzso in zzso zzso and gene therapy using zzso may be a promising treatment option for human zzso containing wild type zzso and zzso or deleted zzso zzso
