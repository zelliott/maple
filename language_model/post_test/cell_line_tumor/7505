zzso cells often need to zzso cell body and nucleus to pass through zzso pores in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso signals typically guide zzso but the precise interplay between mechanical constraints and signaling mechanisms during zzso zzso invasion is incompletely understood and may differ between cell zzso Here, we used zzso zzso Writing to zzso zzso cell culture scaffolds with adjustable pore sizes zzso zzso on a zzso carrier membrane for applying zzso chemical zzso Mouse embryonic zzso invade 10 zzso pore scaffolds even in absence of zzso but invasion is significantly enhanced by knockout of zzso zzso a known regulator of cell nucleus zzso Nuclear zzso thus constitutes a major obstacle to zzso invasion for zzso but zzso signals are not zzso In contrast, zzso zzso cells do not enter 10 zzso pores even when zzso zzso levels are reduced, but readily enter scaffolds with pores down to 7 zzso in presence of zzso zzso Nuclear zzso is therefore not a prime regulator of zzso invasion in zzso cells, which instead require zzso zzso zzso scaffolds with adjustable pore size and zzso chemical zzso are thus a valuable tool to dissect zzso specific mechanical and signaling aspects during zzso zzso
