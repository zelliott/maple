zzso is a critical component of the zzso of type 2 diabetes zzso however, the molecular mechanisms of zzso are still not fully zzso We have attempted to determine the protein zzso involved in zzso in pancreatic zzso by the use of a new zzso Using zzso zzso which are capable of detecting a wide variety of protein zzso we analyzed the protein zzso that correlated with insulin synthesis in zzso cells under zzso zzso When expression patterns of protein zzso in zzso cells were analyzed by Western zzso with zzso zzso a zzso of 63 zzso was significantly reduced zzso with the decrease of insulin zzso under zzso zzso To identify the zzso zzso we used a unique zzso gel zzso technique and zzso zzso Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan) zzso From the molecular size of a native zzso zzso zzso and zzso value, the zzso protein zzso was deduced to be zzso This was confirmed by Western zzso analysis using zzso zzso The decreased zzso levels under zzso conditions recovered to original levels after changing the medium to a normal zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in a zzso manner by incubation with cell zzso from zzso cells under zzso conditions, and degradation was protected by zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso was reduced in the pancreatic zzso of diabetic zzso zzso zzso fatty rats, whereas that of zzso zzso zzso zzso rats was zzso This study suggests that the abnormal regulation of zzso is a component of zzso dysfunction caused by high zzso
