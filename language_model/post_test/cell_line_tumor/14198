The water extract of zzso zzso zzso showed a potent tumor zzso activity in zzso mice after subcutaneous transplantation of zzso zzso colon cancer zzso The zzso ratios of mice zzso with zzso zzso for 2 days before tumor zzso and treated further for 12 consecutive days, were zzso and zzso at the oral dose of 50 and 10 zzso per day, zzso Even for the zzso mice, after oral administration of the water extract of zzso zzso for 12 consecutive days, the tumor zzso ratios were still zzso and zzso at doses of 50 and 10 zzso zzso Because the zzso water extract of zzso zzso does not show direct zzso in zzso tumor cells, we observed further that oral administration of the water extract of zzso zzso may activate zzso immune responses, such as stimulating the proliferation of zzso zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso zzso against zzso zzso This study suggests that the zzso activity of zzso zzso may be associated with its potent zzso zzso It is worth further analyzing the zzso component zzso from zzso zzso and evaluating its potential value for the treatment of human zzso
