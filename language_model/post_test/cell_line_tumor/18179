In zzso tooth movement, some zzso released from zzso ligament zzso and zzso bone zzso on the pressure side can alter the normal processes of bone zzso resulting in zzso bone zzso We examined the effect of zzso force and zzso zzso type I zzso zzso zzso on the expression of inflammatory zzso that promote zzso formation, as well as on their zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

The cells were cultured in zzso modified Eagle medium containing zzso fetal bovine serum with or without continuous zzso force zzso zzso and/or zzso for up to zzso The gene expression levels of the zzso and their receptors were estimated by determining zzso levels using real-time zzso the protein levels were determined using zzso or zzso zzso 

The expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso increased depending on the strength and duration of the zzso force, whereas the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not change with the application of zzso zzso The expression of zzso and their receptors produced by zzso zzso of zzso force decreased with the simultaneous addition of zzso and the decrease was remarkable in zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

These results indicate that mechanical stress zzso the production of inflammatory zzso and their receptors in zzso and the phenomenon is enhanced by the zzso action of zzso which is increased in amount by mechanical zzso
