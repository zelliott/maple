In the present study we investigated the in zzso zzso inducing effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso cells and its mechanisms of zzso The results revealed that zzso zzso zzso inhibited the growth of leukemia zzso cells and caused zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso was observed clearly by flow zzso zzso and DNA fragmentation zzso After treatment by zzso for 48 zzso the percentage of disruption of zzso membrane potential zzso was increased in a zzso zzso Western zzso demonstrated the zzso of zzso zzso protein and a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The results also demonstrated that zzso expression was increased zzso when zzso occurred, and that zzso zzso was inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso suggesting a zzso dependent signaling zzso in zzso cell zzso Moreover, zzso treatment remarkably zzso the expression of the zzso inhibitor of zzso protein zzso which was inhibited by zzso Of note, a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the effect of zzso zzso via zzso of zzso 7 and zzso The zzso effects by zzso on fresh zzso cells were also found to be remarkable by using zzso and Wright's zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso play an important role in zzso the zzso cell death induced by zzso in zzso zzso These data provide a novel insight into potential therapeutic strategies for treatment of zzso
