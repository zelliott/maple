Human zzso zzso cells express high levels of breast cancer resistance protein zzso with no functional zzso zzso zzso activity, making them a potential model to study zzso zzso drug zzso However, the original zzso clone zzso available to researchers does not form zzso zzso with tight junctions required by the zzso Our aim was to adapt culture conditions to attempt to generate zzso zzso zzso for drug transport studies using the standard zzso zzso zzso cells zzso American Type Culture collection zzso were cultured in zzso plates or zzso zzso zzso in a number of media zzso growth supplements, and basement membrane zzso zzso were examined for zzso by zzso and zzso electrical resistance zzso was measured zzso zzso zzso was assessed when zzso had zzso zzso growth rates were achieved in culture conditions consisting of zzso 199 zzso supplemented with zzso growth factor zzso zzso vitamin supplements, and zzso fetal calf serum zzso with collagen zzso A zzso of 170 zzso in zzso zzso was achieved 2 weeks after seeding under optimal zzso The zzso diffusion marker zzso zzso zzso had a zzso zzso of zzso zzso indicative of minimal zzso zzso zzso zzso as determined by zzso remained unaffected by zzso In conclusion, we describe culture conditions for the zzso zzso clone that facilitate the formation of zzso with tighter junctions and reduced zzso transport compared to previously published zzso These growth conditions provide a good model of zzso drug transport in a human zzso cell zzso
