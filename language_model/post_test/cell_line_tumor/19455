Current zzso approaches generate zzso profiles that can identify functional gene expression signatures of environmental zzso However, the intricate processes governing zzso are zzso with a complex set of molecular instructions involving zzso zzso These commands regulate both gene expression and zzso organization through coordinated sets of zzso modifications and zzso DNA zzso zzso Although the effects of specific environmental zzso on gene expression are the subject of much study, the zzso effects of such compounds are poorly zzso Here we have used human promoter zzso zzso along with zzso zzso to identify changes in zzso zzso profiles because of chemical zzso zzso from cells exposed to the zzso hydrocarbon zzso was zzso with zzso against zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso were zzso to generate zzso profiles of zzso and zzso zzso localized to gene promoter zzso zzso zzso data mining, and expression studies revealed that treated cells possessed zzso zzso gene promoter regions and zzso expression zzso This zzso zzso approach permits zzso profiling of zzso zzso patterns that can identify zzso signatures of environmental zzso and potentially determine the molecular pathways these changes zzso This approach also has potential applications for profiling zzso modifications and DNA zzso changes during embryonic development, in cancer biology, and in the development and assessment of cancer zzso
