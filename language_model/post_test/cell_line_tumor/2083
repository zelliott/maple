A zzso gene expression signature of zzso expressed zzso including the zzso factor zzso zzso and other zzso transition zzso markers has been found present in samples from publicly available gene expression zzso in multiple cancer types, including zzso zzso The expression levels of the zzso genes vary in a continuous and coordinate manner across the samples, ranging from absence of expression to strong zzso of all zzso These data suggest that tumor cells may pass through an zzso process of zzso transition to varying zzso Here we show that, in zzso zzso zzso this signature is associated with time to recurrence following initial zzso By analyzing data from The Cancer Genome zzso zzso we found that zzso patients who responded to therapy and had long time to recurrence had low levels of the signature in their tumor samples zzso We also found that the signature is strongly correlated in zzso with the putative stem cell marker zzso and is highly enriched among the zzso expressed genes in zzso zzso lower grade zzso Our results suggest that long delay before tumor recurrence is associated with absence of the zzso transition signature, raising the possibility that zzso this transition might improve the durability of therapy in zzso zzso
