zzso zzso cells zzso are a zzso of cells responsible for melanoma tumor growth and zzso They are defined by the expression of the zzso cassette (ABC) zzso B member 5 zzso Here, we identified a critical role for the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and show that zzso zzso zzso melanoma tumor growth zzso by this zzso zzso zzso of zzso led to a significant decrease in zzso protein expression with a zzso decrease in zzso of the zzso and zzso signaling pathways implicated to play an important role in melanoma zzso To confirm that the reduction in zzso zzso zzso expression was dependent on the zzso zzso activity, we showed that zzso effectively silenced by zzso could be rescued by zzso of zzso in cells lacking zzso Furthermore, we provide a mechanism by which zzso promotes zzso unwinding in zzso We also observed using tumor transplantation in zzso zzso combined zzso mice that the zzso zzso in a zzso melanoma cell line displayed a significant decrease in tumor growth and compared with the zzso Our results suggest that the zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso tumor growth through promoting zzso protein expression and that cancer therapies targeting zzso zzso may have broad applications for treating zzso melanoma and potentially other cancer zzso
