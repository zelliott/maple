We evaluated the dose requirements for sustained in zzso activity of zzso a human zzso zzso under development for the treatment of B zzso zzso In a mouse zzso model, a single dose, resulting in an initial plasma zzso concentration of 5 zzso which was expected to result in full target zzso effectively inhibited human zzso zzso zzso zzso growth resumed when plasma zzso dropped below levels that are expected to result in zzso zzso zzso zzso load significantly impacted zzso zzso In zzso initial depletion of circulating and tissue residing B cells required relatively high-dose zzso zzso of zzso zzso however, only became zzso when zzso levels dropped below 10 zzso We conclude that, once zzso of zzso throughout the body has been reached by high initial zzso plasma zzso that maintain target zzso on circulating cells zzso zzso are probably sufficient for sustained biological zzso These observations may provide a rationale for establishing dosing schedules for maintenance zzso following initial depletion of zzso positive zzso zzso
