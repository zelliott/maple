zzso zzso zzso channels play important roles in differentiation and growth of zzso zzso zzso of these channels is also known to suppress proliferation of various cancer zzso Here we examine expression of zzso channel zzso genes in various zzso cancer cells and their roles in cell zzso zzso analysis reveals that cervical zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not cervical zzso zzso and zzso expresses both or either one of the two human zzso genes zzso and 3, or zzso and zzso In addition, zzso for zzso auxiliary zzso zzso are significant in these zzso Moreover, the two cervical zzso cell lines, as well as some of the zzso and zzso cancer cell lines, express zzso for zzso and the silent regulatory zzso for zzso channels, zzso Thus, zzso cancer cells contain zzso channel complexes, whereas zzso channels may be major components of zzso channels in cervical zzso zzso To evaluate the involvement of these channels in cell zzso we used the specific zzso for zzso and zzso channels, zzso and zzso zzso significantly reduced proliferation of zzso zzso and zzso by zzso Similarly, zzso suppressed growth of zzso cells zzso Finally, zzso analysis indicates that zzso of zzso channels reduces a population of cells in the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso channels are selectively involved in proliferation of distinct zzso cancer zzso
