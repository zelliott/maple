Increased metabolism is a requirement for tumor cell zzso To understand the dependence of tumor cells on fatty acid zzso we evaluated various zzso of the fatty acid synthesis zzso Using zzso we have demonstrated that depletion of zzso synthesis zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso in zzso colon cancer cells results in zzso that is zzso by addition of zzso fatty zzso This conditional zzso is most pronounced when zzso is zzso We used this zzso rescue strategy to characterize several zzso zzso of fatty acid zzso including identification of zzso as a potent zzso zzso representing a previously zzso activity for this zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso show zzso that is less pronounced than that of zzso and zzso rescue profiles consistent with their proposed zzso zzso Two reference zzso zzso show zzso zzso that is offset by at least two orders of magnitude by zzso zzso One of these zzso slows growth of zzso zzso zzso Our data outline an effective strategy for interrogation of zzso potency and zzso of fatty acid synthesis zzso establish an zzso link between fatty acid synthesis and cancer cell survival, and point toward zzso as a key target in this zzso
