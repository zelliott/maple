zzso resistance zzso plays a major obstacle to successful gastric cancer zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the zzso reversal effect and mechanisms of zzso in combination with zzso zzso in zzso zzso resistant human zzso gastric cancer zzso The zzso cells were heated at zzso and zzso for 30 zzso alone or combined with 10 zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso Cellular plasma membrane zzso fluidity was detected by zzso polarization zzso zzso zzso of zzso was monitored with high performance liquid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso formation were determined by real-time zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso It was found that different heating methods induced different zzso zzso Water submerged zzso had the strongest zzso of zzso and zzso combined with zzso had a synergistic zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso The water submerged zzso increased the cell membrane zzso Both water submerged zzso and zzso increased the zzso zzso of zzso The water submerged zzso and zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso and zzso The water submerged zzso could damage DNA and increase the zzso expression of zzso zzso The higher temperature was, the worse effect zzso Our results show that combined treatment of zzso with zzso can zzso reverse zzso in human zzso gastric cancer zzso
