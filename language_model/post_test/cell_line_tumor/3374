The protein zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene is the only zzso protein zzso The expression pattern of zzso zzso during the zzso of the viral zzso cycle and the zzso zzso of the protein were analyzed with a zzso zzso raised against a zzso corresponding to the N zzso of zzso zzso Based on previously published data zzso zzso and zzso zzso Pagano, zzso zzso zzso 2002) and the expression pattern described here, we conclude that zzso zzso is an early protein that requires zzso replication for maximum zzso By zzso zzso the protein could be detected mainly in the nuclear fraction 4 h after viral zzso in zzso zzso Nuclear zzso could be zzso by indirect zzso in zzso cells zzso expressing zzso zzso in the absence of other viral zzso zzso expression of zzso deletion zzso of zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso confirming the presence of a nuclear zzso site in the zzso region of the zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso zzso all of the zzso were unable to zzso zzso during zzso or to zzso zzso as measured by an zzso activity zzso Thus, the results demonstrate that the nuclear zzso as well as the zzso activity, of zzso is dependent on an intact zzso zzso
