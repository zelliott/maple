We have previously reported a zzso zzso complex at the zzso zzso upstream region of the human zzso 1 zzso gene that is zzso across several species in respect with sequence motifs and the location of the zzso The zzso and zzso zzso factors have common binding sites for this region across those zzso We have also shown skew in the zzso zzso compartment of this complex in two neurodegenerative disorders, sporadic zzso Alzheimer's disease zzso and multiple sclerosis zzso versus zzso controls ( zzso In the current study, we analyze the functional implication of the disease zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso control zzso zzso zzso in three zzso cell lines, zzso zzso zzso and zzso using dual zzso reporter zzso A significant increase in gene expression was observed in the cell lines with the disease zzso zzso zzso control zzso in the three cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso and 3 zzso zzso zzso We conclude that the human zzso upstream zzso complex zzso gene zzso An additive effect of the zzso in the zzso status is speculated based on the skew in the zzso zzso in neurodegenerative zzso
