zzso resistance zzso is an important obstacle that limits the efficacy of chemotherapy in many types of zzso In this study, 14 novel zzso zzso possessing zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso zzso groups at zzso in addition to a zzso or zzso zzso at C4 position were zzso zzso channel blocking zzso activity was measured in guinea pig zzso zzso smooth zzso zzso was tested on 4 human cancer cell lines, while zzso reversal capacity was examined on zzso zzso zzso resistant zzso and compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso showed different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities zzso zzso to more than 100 zzso Several compounds having zzso zzso at zzso could significantly reverse resistance to zzso at zzso and 1 zzso The most active ones were zzso and zzso containing zzso zzso and zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso activity, which is considered an zzso effect for these agents, of zzso and zzso were 33 and 20 times lower than zzso zzso In conclusion, the newly zzso zzso zzso compounds showed promising zzso reversal and zzso activities with low zzso effects and could be of therapeutic value in drug resistant zzso
