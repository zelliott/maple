zzso cancer cells produce a large amount of zzso zzso zzso which is widely used as a marker for this zzso Even though it is widely used in the diagnosis of prostate cancer, many aspects of the zzso role of zzso in bone zzso remain zzso The zzso zzso of nuclear zzso zzso zzso is essential for the zzso of zzso while zzso zzso zzso the action of zzso Various substances that act on bone have been shown to zzso the production of zzso and zzso by zzso 

In this study, we investigated the effect of zzso on the expression of zzso and zzso zzso and on protein production in human zzso zzso 

After addition of zzso and culture for 72 zzso zzso zzso expression and protein zzso by zzso and zzso cells showed a zzso zzso When zzso were incubated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and protein zzso increased with the passage of zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso the zzso zzso activity of zzso inhibited the increase of zzso zzso expression and protein production in response to zzso and this effect of zzso was also inhibited by zzso growth zzso zzso 

Based on our findings, zzso acts on human zzso cells via its own zzso zzso activity and promotes zzso zzso In addition, zzso stimulates zzso production and zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso bone zzso by zzso suggesting that it contributes to the characteristic zzso features of bone zzso of prostate zzso
