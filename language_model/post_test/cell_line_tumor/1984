Head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso is a major public health zzso The recent identification of the zzso complex 1 zzso signaling zzso as a highly prevalent molecular signature underlying zzso zzso has provided the foundation to search for novel therapeutic approaches to prevent and treat zzso Here, we asked whether zzso the most widely used medication for the treatment of type II diabetes, which acts in part by stimulating the zzso protein zzso zzso signaling zzso thereby reducing zzso activity, may lower the risk of zzso zzso Indeed, we show that zzso reduces the growth of zzso cells and diminishes their zzso activity by both zzso and zzso zzso We also zzso an zzso zzso mouse model that results in the zzso of multiple oral zzso zzso at the end of the zzso exposure, some of which then spontaneously progress into zzso Using this mouse model, we observed that zzso specifically zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso layer of oral zzso zzso zzso zzso prevented the development of zzso by reducing significantly the size and number of zzso oral zzso zzso and by preventing their spontaneous conversion to zzso cell zzso zzso our data underscore the potential clinical benefits of using zzso as a targeted zzso agent in the control of zzso development and zzso
