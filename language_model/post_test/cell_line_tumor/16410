To establish an in zzso model of zzso invasion zzso with zzso of human pancreatic cancer cells and rat root zzso to observe the zzso outgrowth and pancreatic cancer cell proliferation and migration, and to explore the molecular basis of zzso invasion zzso of pancreatic zzso 

Human pancreatic cancer cell line zzso zzso and rat zzso root zzso zzso were zzso in zzso zzso to generate the zzso zzso The zzso zzso pancreatic cancer cell colony formation, zzso contact and retrograde migration were observed under an zzso zzso The data were analyzed with the zzso Plus zzso zzso The zzso index zzso was measured by zzso zzso with the zzso zzso In order to determine the zzso zzso of the pancreatic cancer cells, zzso zzso was zzso The zzso index zzso was evaluated by flow zzso 

zzso outgrowth was zzso in the presence of pancreatic cancer zzso After 72 hours of the zzso zzso zzso colonies zzso with zzso exhibited a significantly larger colony area zzso zzso zzso than that of the control zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso system, the zzso exhibited a trend of growing towards the pancreatic cancer cell zzso However, the pancreatic cancer cells showed a trend of zzso zzso to the zzso along the zzso zzso when zzso zzso colonies touched the zzso The positive rate of zzso nuclear zzso was significantly higher than in the zzso zzso The zzso value was higher in the experimental group zzso than that in the control group zzso P zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed that proliferation of the pancreatic cancer cells was more active than that in the control zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso rate of the pancreatic cancer cell was zzso significantly lower than that of the control group zzso P zzso zzso 

An in zzso zzso model of rat zzso root zzso and human pancreatic cancer cell line is successfully established in this zzso This zzso zzso zzso system demonstrates that the zzso zzso cell interaction is a mutually beneficial process for the growth of zzso and pancreatic zzso zzso The pancreatic cancer cells show a trend of zzso to the zzso along the zzso zzso
