The zzso role of zzso zzso antioxidants has been described but the implicated mechanisms are not yet zzso In addition to zzso zzso zzso found at high zzso in a number of plants, possess zzso zzso The main zzso acids found in foods are derivatives of zzso acid and zzso zzso 

This work concentrates on the zzso action of zzso acid, zzso acid, zzso acid, zzso acid, zzso acid and zzso acid zzso on zzso human breast cancer cells, testing their zzso activity and a number of possible mechanisms involved zzso with membrane and zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso 

The tested compounds showed a zzso and zzso zzso effect on cell growth with the following zzso zzso acid zzso zzso acid zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso were chosen for further zzso The zzso activity of these zzso acids in zzso cells does not coincide with their zzso effect on zzso zzso No interaction was found with steroid and zzso zzso zzso induced an zzso of zzso oxide zzso while zzso acid competes for binding and results in an zzso of zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso zzso Both agents induce zzso via the zzso zzso 

zzso acids exert a direct zzso action, evident at low zzso comparable with those found in biological zzso after zzso of foods rich in zzso zzso Furthermore, the direct interaction with the zzso hydrocarbon zzso the zzso oxide zzso zzso and their zzso effect provide some insights into their biological mode of zzso
