zzso and zzso have both been evaluated clinically for their properties as zzso agents, with zzso being available zzso We previously reported that both compounds cause cell cycle arrest in zzso zzso and multiple myeloma cell lines by increasing the level of zzso zzso In the present study, we unravel the molecular mechanism responsible for zzso zzso using zzso cells as a human zzso zzso We show that the increase of zzso expression is regulated at the zzso level through a mechanism independent of zzso Using a combination of approaches, we show that several zzso binding zzso factors are involved in zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, we report that zzso zzso is associated with a switch from zzso to zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso suggesting that this zzso zzso is involved in the zzso of the zzso zzso Based on our findings, we propose a model in which zzso and zzso modify the zzso structure of the zzso promoter through zzso and zzso of zzso This effect, zzso via zzso provides zzso binding zzso factors better access to DNA, followed by recruitment of zzso zzso II and zzso zzso Taken together, our results provide new insights on the mechanism of action of zzso and zzso in the regulation of gene transcription, imply possible efficacy in zzso zzso and deleted cancer, and suggest new potential clinical uses as an zzso zzso
