To provide proper zzso required for effective cancer zzso zzso zzso fusion proteins were generated for use in zzso zzso 

zzso fusion proteins consisting of the zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso connected with different zzso were genetically engineered and tested for their potency in two zzso solid tumor zzso 

In zzso construct zzso zzso zzso showed the best activity zzso tumor zzso at doses ranging from 5 to 25 zzso and was found to be intact by gel zzso Similar doses used with construct zzso zzso produced good but not as high tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso which was found to be relatively unstable by zzso gel zzso produced zzso tumor zzso and required a higher dose zzso zzso to produce optimal zzso Survival zzso showed that zzso treatment extended the life of zzso of zzso mice to zzso months compared with controls that died by day zzso zzso depletion studies showed that zzso T cells play a major role in zzso zzso and tumors removed from zzso and zzso mice showed a significant influx of zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso Finally, T regulatory zzso cell zzso showed that, unlike other zzso fusion zzso all three zzso zzso profoundly suppressed zzso zzso 

These studies suggest that a stable, intact zzso fusion protein can provide missing zzso for the zzso of solid zzso In addition, zzso may alter zzso activity to enhance its effectiveness for tumor zzso
