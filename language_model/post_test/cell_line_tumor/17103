In order to analyze differential gene expression of putative prostate tumor markers we compared the expression levels of zzso zzso genes using the zzso array technique in a set of prostate tumors and matched normal prostate zzso zzso expression of zzso tumor 8 zzso protein zzso complement component zzso zzso zzso heavy chain zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso protein regulatory zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso F zzso was determined in prostate zzso and confirmed by using quantitative real-time zzso zzso Furthermore, quantitative real time zzso on intact zzso from 11 paired laser zzso zzso tissue samples confirmed zzso zzso expression in 6 out of 11 prostate zzso To determine the function of zzso in zzso human zzso and zzso prostate zzso cells were zzso with small interfering zzso zzso zzso zzso against the zzso gene leading to a specific zzso of zzso zzso In addition, suppression of zzso expression caused a significant decrease in cellular proliferation of both prostate cancer cell lines, whereas invasive capacity and cellular zzso remained zzso Taken together, our results indicate that the human zzso gene contains the potential to serve as a prostate cancer expression marker and that zzso plays an important role in cellular growth of prostate zzso
