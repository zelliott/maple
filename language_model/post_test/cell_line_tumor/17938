The infectious agent in prion diseases is an zzso zzso of the cellular prion protein zzso This zzso prion protein zzso has an increased zzso content, is zzso zzso and zzso K zzso and accumulates in zzso organisms and zzso In zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso However, there is no direct experimental proof for the occurrence of zzso zzso in zzso or in cell zzso zzso atomic force zzso zzso to zzso mouse zzso zzso cells, we discovered growing zzso zzso of zzso zzso structures on the cell zzso zzso and zzso images showed zzso zzso and zzso of zzso in zzso cell zzso The percentage of cells having characteristic zzso on their surface increased with time after zzso zzso These zzso zzso had lengths from zzso to 3 zzso and zzso from the cell surface by 108 zzso 30 zzso and thus resembled the zzso shapes and networks of in zzso prepared zzso zzso
