zzso into zzso with defined structures is a common phenomenon for many peptides at high zzso In this study, we found that when zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso bound to tissue cells and accumulated on cell surfaces, it migrated and zzso into zzso zzso at certain locations on the cell zzso Studies using zzso zzso and scanning electron zzso revealed that zzso zzso induced cell tissue damage through a new cell zzso mechanism that involved zzso zzso on cell surfaces, zzso lipids from cell zzso and transporting peptides into the zzso zzso zzso attributed greatly to zzso interactions and thus the biological activity of a zzso Because zzso zzso was a slow process, zzso cell zzso showed a zzso behavior: a gradual viability decrease was followed by a rapid zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso could be equally as important as charge and secondary structure of a zzso in determining the zzso and zzso activities of therapeutic zzso
