DNA zzso and zzso zzso are zzso mechanisms that play major roles in zzso gene zzso We zzso that many genes in the human zzso cell line zzso are regulated by DNA zzso and zzso zzso Treatment with zzso zzso to inhibit DNA zzso with and/or zzso A zzso to inhibit zzso zzso should allow us to identify genes that are regulated zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso had a much larger effect on gene expression in zzso cells than did zzso as measured using zzso zzso Plus zzso zzso The expression of zzso probe sets was affected by zzso (at p zzso zzso zzso probe sets by zzso and 1929 probe sets by the combination of zzso and zzso zzso treatment turned on the expression of 211 probe sets that were not zzso expressed in its zzso zzso of imprinted genes regulated by DNA zzso such as zzso and zzso was turned on or greatly increased in response to zzso Genes involved in liver processes such as zzso metabolism zzso zzso and zzso and steroid zzso zzso and zzso and genes zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso were affected by zzso or the zzso Many of the genes that fall within these groups are also expressed in the developing fetal liver and adult zzso zzso real-time zzso zzso confirmed selected gene expression changes seen in zzso zzso 

zzso play a role in regulating the expression of several genes involved in essential liver processes such as zzso metabolism and steroid zzso in zzso zzso Many genes whose expression is normally silenced in these zzso cells were zzso by zzso zzso DNA zzso may be a factor in restricting the expression of fetal genes during liver development and in shutting down expression in zzso zzso
