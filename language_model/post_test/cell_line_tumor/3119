The effect of folate status on breast cancer resistance protein zzso drug resistance to zzso growth factor zzso zzso drugs, such as zzso and zzso was investigated in two human colon cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso of which the latter displayed greater sensitivity to these drugs due to high zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, growing under zzso zzso conditions, showed increased zzso protein expression compared with the zzso zzso counterpart, which was associated with zzso resistance to zzso Of note, the zzso inhibitor zzso completely reverted this zzso zzso zzso cells also showed slightly increased zzso expression compared with the zzso cells, but no differences in zzso sensitivity were zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells showed zzso and zzso resistance to zzso respectively, compared with their zzso counterparts, which mechanistically seemed zzso zzso as zzso had no effect on zzso zzso In conclusion, our data suggest that in zzso zzso cells, zzso is one of the zzso of zzso resistance but not of zzso zzso Beyond this, folate depletion can provoke an additional decrease in zzso and zzso activity by mechanisms dependent or independent of zzso zzso
