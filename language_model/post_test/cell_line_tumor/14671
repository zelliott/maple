zzso zzso an zzso zzso derived from zzso reportedly has zzso actions through zzso of the zzso zzso by nuclear zzso B zzso It was suggested that zzso zzso inhibited zzso activity through the zzso modification of zzso However, the interaction of zzso zzso with zzso in zzso has not been zzso In the present study, we confirmed that treatment of cultured zzso zzso cells, zzso cells, with tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso increased the zzso zzso When the nuclear extract of the cells was incubated with zzso zzso the zzso activity was strongly zzso Because we previously found that the zzso complex included zzso and zzso we zzso expressed a deletion zzso of zzso zzso zzso and a full-length form of zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso with zzso zzso induced dramatic changes in mobility in two types of zzso gel zzso zzso mobility shift zzso revealed that incubation of zzso zzso or zzso with zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso cells revealed that zzso zzso inhibited the nuclear association of zzso after zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso interacts with zzso and zzso to inhibit their functions at multiple zzso
