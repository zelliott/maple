zzso E is a newly identified member of the transforming growth zzso zzso To assess the role of zzso E in zzso zzso we investigated the zzso regulation of zzso E in the zzso 

Northern zzso Western zzso quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction zzso reporter zzso and zzso zzso zzso were used in this zzso 

zzso zzso zzso E expression at the zzso and protein level in zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso functional, promoter sequence of human zzso E gene was responsible for the effect of zzso zzso analysis of the promoter revealed that zzso proteins zzso play a key role in regulating zzso E expression and in the zzso effect of insulin on zzso E zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso can bind to the zzso E promoter in zzso zzso The expression of zzso E zzso was zzso in the liver of zzso obese zzso 

These observations suggest that zzso E plays a zzso role in zzso zzso
