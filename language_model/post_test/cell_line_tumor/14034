To evaluate the clinical implications of zzso zzso expression in plasma cell myeloma zzso 

We first evaluated the reliability of zzso in assessing zzso expression by comparing the results with those obtained by flow zzso and gene expression zzso in 22 zzso and in 10 zzso cell zzso zzso results showed a perfect zzso with those of flow zzso likewise, zzso and gene expression data were also zzso in all but one zzso and cell lines zzso Then, we investigated the clinical implications of zzso zzso in bone zzso zzso of 85 zzso patients with a mean follow-up of 41 zzso zzso zzso was detected in 24 zzso of the 85 cases and it was significantly associated with a high zzso density, but not with traditional zzso characteristics or with zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso is a reliable indicator of zzso gene expression and reinforce the notion that approximately one-third of zzso express high levels of zzso The lack of association with traditional zzso parameters and patient survival suggests that zzso expression may not be an adjunct in predicting the clinical course of the zzso
