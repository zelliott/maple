The tendency of prostate cancer to produce zzso bone zzso suggests that cancer cells and zzso interact in ways that contribute to cancer zzso To identify factors that mediate these zzso we compared gene expression patterns between two zzso prostate cancer cell lines that produce zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Both cell lines expressed zzso zzso including zzso a zzso zzso implicated in zzso zzso cells expressed 50 times more zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso than did zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the functional role of these factors (in zzso of prostate cancer cells with primary mouse zzso zzso or in bone organ zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso cells activated zzso zzso signaling in zzso and that zzso blocked zzso proliferation and new bone formation induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells did not induce bone formation in zzso from mice lacking the zzso zzso zzso In human zzso zzso was not expressed in normal prostate but was expressed in areas of high-grade prostate zzso zzso in three of nine primary prostate tumor specimens and in 16 of 38 samples of bone zzso from prostate zzso zzso was not expressed in normal or zzso tissue but was expressed in two of three specimens of zzso bone zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso zzso new bone formation through zzso zzso zzso that zzso mediates this effect, and that zzso is involved in the balance between bone formation and zzso that determines zzso zzso
