zzso evidence indicates that the human zzso zzso zzso channels zzso may represent new valuable membrane therapeutic targets and zzso zzso in various zzso This study is the first to investigate the expression of zzso zzso channel zzso in both primary tumors and zzso cell lines to ascertain its clinical and biological role in tumor zzso Our findings demonstrate that zzso is frequently zzso expressed in a high percentage of primary tumors zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines zzso zzso cell zzso zzso expression increased during zzso progression and was more frequent in advanced zzso zzso zzso expression was also detected in a notable proportion zzso zzso zzso of zzso normal adjacent zzso whereas no expression was detected in normal zzso from zzso patients without exposure to tobacco zzso In an attempt to identify the underlying mechanisms of zzso zzso expression in zzso we found that zzso gene copy gain occurred at a low frequency zzso zzso zzso in primary tumors but was not observed in early stages of zzso zzso Furthermore, this study provides original evidence supporting the involvement of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso expression in zzso In addition, functional studies in zzso cells further revealed that zzso expression is a biologically relevant feature that promotes cell proliferation and invasion, although independently of its zzso zzso Our findings strongly support the notion that zzso may represent a promising candidate as tumor marker and membrane therapeutic target for zzso zzso
