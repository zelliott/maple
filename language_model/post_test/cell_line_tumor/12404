Resistance of tumors to zzso therapy remains a major obstacle in cancer treatment and is often caused by defects in zzso zzso zzso a key zzso of death zzso zzso has previously been reported to be frequently zzso by zzso zzso in many tumors, for example in zzso or zzso Here, we provide for the first time evidence that combined treatment with zzso zzso of the zzso agent zzso zzso and zzso zzso cooperated to zzso zzso expression in zzso and zzso cells lacking zzso zzso zzso of zzso and downstream zzso upon addition of zzso zzso zzso zzso was restored by zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso acted in concert to significantly enhance zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso or by the relatively specific zzso zzso zzso inhibited the increase in zzso provided by zzso and zzso indicating that zzso is a key zzso of this zzso zzso Thus, by demonstrating that zzso and zzso at relatively low individual zzso cooperate to restore zzso expression and sensitize resistant zzso and zzso cells to zzso zzso our findings have important implications for novel strategies targeting defective zzso pathways in zzso zzso
