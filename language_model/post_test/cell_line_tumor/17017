Twenty zzso derivatives were developed by a systematic zzso chemical approach and their chemical structures were confirmed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso screening against zzso zzso and zzso zzso and colon zzso zzso cells indicated that five compounds zzso zzso zzso 11b and zzso displayed high zzso zzso with zzso values below 20 zzso whereas zzso showed zzso values above 100 zzso Moreover, the most promising compound 11g was more active than zzso These results clearly indicated that the modification of the zzso structure could greatly increase its zzso activity in zzso
