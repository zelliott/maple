zzso zzso is emerging as an important tool in cellular zzso We describe for the first time a system to investigate zzso virus zzso diversity at the cellular level utilizing zzso C virus zzso zzso A zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso was developed, and validation using control transcripts of known copy number indicated a detection limit of 3 copies of viral zzso This system was used to determine the cellular diversity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso Each cell contained a unique zzso that was much less diverse than the zzso of the bulk cell population from which the single cells were zzso suggesting the occurrence of independent evolution at the cellular zzso An assessment of the zzso fitness of the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated a modest reduction in fitness compared to the wild zzso zzso zzso methods capable of determining zzso viral loads were developed and indicated an average of 113 copies of zzso zzso per cell, zzso with calculated zzso copy numbers in the bulk cell zzso This study introduces a zzso zzso zzso method with numerous potential applications to explore zzso interactions during zzso zzso zzso diversity varied greatly between cells in zzso suggesting different zzso evolutionary zzso Such divergent zzso in zzso could have implications for the evolution and establishment of zzso zzso and host immune escape zzso
