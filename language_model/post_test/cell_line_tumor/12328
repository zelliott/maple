The protein zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso beta zzso and its zzso zzso zzso are zzso in human zzso Both molecules are involved in zzso cell migration during zzso zzso In addition, zzso can induce zzso cell migration which is at least in part zzso through binding to zzso To study the relevance of this zzso pair for zzso growth in zzso and in zzso we zzso the human zzso cell line zzso with small interfering zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in strong zzso of zzso zzso When injected zzso into nude mice, clones that expressed normal levels of zzso zzso + zzso formed zzso growing zzso whereas zzso growth was almost completely zzso for clones that expressed reduced zzso levels zzso - zzso Similar results were obtained using an zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso - cells in zzso was significantly reduced compared with that of control zzso zzso zzso zzso the proliferation of zzso + cells but not of zzso - zzso zzso migration induced by zzso was reduced for zzso - clones compared with control zzso Our findings suggest that zzso of zzso expression can inhibit zzso growth in zzso and may thus represent a potentially promising treatment zzso
