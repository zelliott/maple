The role of zzso in reducing the risk of multiple zzso has been described in the zzso Although reports have described the zzso and zzso function of zzso by zzso of genes in these zzso information is lacking on the target mechanisms of zzso on specific zzso This study examines whether zzso treatment alters the zzso status of zzso silenced genes in prostate cancer zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and Ras associated family zzso zzso genes was studied using zzso sensitive zzso zzso Gene expression was studied using zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso 

Treatment of prostate cancer cells with zzso did not alter the expression of genes that were silenced by DNA zzso Furthermore, the zzso status of these genes remained zzso after treatment with zzso
