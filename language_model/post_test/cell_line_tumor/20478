zzso in the tumor zzso plays a central role in the evolution of immune escape mechanisms by tumor zzso In this study, we report the definition of zzso as a zzso regulated by zzso in lung cancer and melanoma, documenting its involvement in zzso the zzso of tumor cells to zzso by zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso was induced in hypoxic zones of human tumor zzso Its zzso in hypoxic cells significantly restored zzso to zzso zzso zzso independent of tumor cell recognition and zzso zzso A comprehensive approach using zzso analysis, zzso protein zzso and zzso reporter zzso revealed that the genes zzso zzso and zzso were zzso target genes regulated in hypoxic zzso In support of their primary importance in zzso the zzso effects of zzso coordinate zzso of zzso zzso and zzso dramatically decreased tumor cell zzso to zzso zzso Our findings show how zzso induction links zzso to immune escape from zzso zzso by providing a zzso understanding of how this zzso mediates zzso in zzso regions of tumors where cancer zzso cells and zzso cellular behaviors are known to zzso
