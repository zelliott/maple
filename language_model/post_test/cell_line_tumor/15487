zzso zzso are key regulators of cellular zzso and zzso function is often associated with human zzso zzso zzso represent an important class of therapeutic targets and about 20 zzso zzso zzso are in clinical use zzso zzso knowledge about the selectivity of zzso is important for the correct interpretation of their pharmacological and systems biological zzso Chemical zzso approaches for systematic zzso inhibitor selectivity profiling have emerged as important molecular tools in this regard, but the coverage of the human zzso is still zzso Here, we describe a new affinity probe targeting zzso and many other members of the zzso zzso family that considerably extends the scope of zzso profiling by chemical zzso In combination with the previously published zzso the zzso probe was applied to selectivity profiling of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in human cancer zzso The results confirmed the zzso of all zzso zzso and of a number of known as well as zzso as a novel putative target for zzso This work also established, for the first time, the zzso selectivity profile of the clinical phase I drug zzso and identified zzso as a low zzso zzso target as well as the zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso as a potential new zzso zzso
