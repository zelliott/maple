zzso instability is one of the most common features of prostate cancer zzso especially in advanced zzso Recent studies suggest that defects in zzso checkpoints play a role in zzso Lack of zzso regulation zzso zzso in cancer cells acting thereafter as a driving force for zzso zzso zzso protein zzso of the Aurora genes family play an important throughout the entire cell zzso In that Aurora B regulates zzso segregation by ensuring the orientation of sister zzso As a consequence, the zzso of Aurora B in zzso human cells zzso zzso the appearance of zzso zzso 

zzso samples of normal and zzso prostate zzso and prostate derived cell lines were screened for the expression of Aurora zzso 

zzso analysis showed increased nuclear expression of zzso in high zzso grade PCs respect to low and intermediate grade cases and in all zzso in respect to zzso and normal zzso Furthermore, in the high zzso grade zzso cancer zzso Aurora B expression was accompanied by the zzso of the zzso zzso In zzso to the in zzso situation, Aurora B was vigorously expressed in the zzso independent PC cell lines zzso and zzso while a very modest expression of the zzso was observed in the zzso sensitive zzso cells and in the zzso cells, a line of zzso cells derived from normal prostate zzso In addition, in zzso cells Aurora B expression is accompanied the by the zzso of the zzso zzso The block of Aurora B expression induced by an inhibitor of Aurora zzso activity significantly reduced the growth of prostate zzso cells, but not that of zzso zzso zzso 

Our data are the first demonstration of a role of Aurora B in PC zzso In addition, the observation that Aurora B specific zzso interfere with PC cell proliferation but not with that of zzso prostate zzso cells suggest that Aurora B is a potential therapeutic target for zzso
