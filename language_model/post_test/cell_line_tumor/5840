The zzso of the zzso tract is exposed to a variety of zzso agents, both zzso and zzso that can injure nuclear and zzso zzso DNA damage can be repaired by a series of DNA repair zzso while defects in this system will make these cells once more susceptible to zzso transformation or cell zzso Recent studies suggest that zzso bacteria may contribute to induce inflammation in individuals afflicted by inflammatory zzso disease zzso increasing the risk of developing colon zzso zzso evidence suggests that zzso organisms are linked to zzso as well as to gastric and colon zzso zzso the focus of this study was to evaluate the effect of zzso zzso isolated from zzso on modulating the DNA repair zzso We used an in zzso model represented by two colon zzso cell lines, the DNA zzso zzso and the DNA zzso zzso and zzso with a zzso zzso zzso We observed that zzso by zzso the expression of zzso zzso oxide zzso leads to an increased NO release, demonstrating that zzso is able to interfere with the DNA repair machinery of zzso cells, thus increasing the risk of permanent zzso zzso
