zzso giant cancer cells zzso have been observed by zzso for over a zzso zzso contribute to solid tumor zzso but their functions are largely zzso Little attention has been given to these cells, largely because zzso have been generally thought to originate from repeated failure of zzso and have no capacity for long-term survival or zzso Here we report our successful zzso and culture of zzso from human zzso cancer cell lines and primary zzso zzso These cells are highly resistant to oxygen deprivation and could form through zzso or cell fusion, generating zzso cancer cells quickly through budding or bursting similar to simple organisms like zzso They express normal and cancer stem cell zzso they divide zzso and they cycle zzso They can differentiate into zzso cartilage and zzso A single zzso formed cancer zzso in zzso and generated tumors in zzso zzso These zzso tumors gained a zzso zzso with increased expression of cancer stem cell markers zzso and zzso and become more resistant to treatment with zzso Taken together, our results reveal that zzso represent a resistant form of human cancer using an zzso zzso zzso mechanism in response to zzso zzso they can contribute to the generation of cancer zzso cells, and also play a fundamental role in regulating tumor zzso tumor growth and zzso in human zzso
