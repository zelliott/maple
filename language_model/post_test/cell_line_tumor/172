Cellular cholesterol levels reflect a balance between zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso nuclear liver X zzso zzso helps maintain cholesterol zzso not only through promotion of cholesterol zzso but also through suppression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the LDL zzso zzso zzso through zzso induction of Idol zzso zzso of the zzso an zzso zzso zzso that triggers zzso of the zzso on its zzso domain, thereby targeting it for zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso knockout increases, zzso protein levels in zzso in a zzso zzso Idol zzso in zzso increases zzso protein levels and promotes LDL zzso zzso zzso expression of Idol in mouse liver promotes zzso degradation and zzso plasma LDL zzso The zzso axis defines a complementary zzso to zzso response zzso proteins for zzso regulation of cholesterol zzso
