In contrast to the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso is known to remain at the plasma membrane after zzso binding and zzso However, why zzso is not efficiently zzso has remained zzso Basically, two possibilities zzso zzso is zzso resistant or it is efficiently recycled after zzso By a combination of zzso zzso zzso labeling electron zzso and zzso techniques we show that zzso is zzso associated with membrane zzso Moreover, it is efficiently excluded from zzso pits and is not seen in zzso zzso zzso This pattern is not changed after binding of zzso zzso or zzso The exclusion from coated pits is so pronounced that it cannot just be explained by lack of an zzso zzso Although zzso is a zzso zzso the zzso of zzso to zzso is not a result of raft zzso Also, an intact zzso zzso is not required for keeping zzso away from coated zzso However, after efficient zzso zzso is removed from zzso to occur on the bulk zzso in coated pits, and in zzso These data show that zzso is a remarkably zzso zzso and suggest that the mechanism underlying the firm association of zzso with zzso also is the reason for this zzso
