Although significant variations in the zzso profiles exist among different cells, little is understood in terms of genetic regulations of such cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso While many cancer cells depend on zzso zzso for survival to justify the therapeutic targeting of zzso zzso the mechanisms of zzso dependence and likely response and resistance of such zzso strategies among zzso are largely zzso In this study, we have found a systematic variation in the zzso dependence among breast tumor zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso but not zzso breast cells are more zzso and may be susceptible to zzso zzso zzso independence of zzso cells is associated mechanistically with zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells can also rescue zzso cells in zzso without zzso indicating a potential for zzso zzso within breast zzso The zzso expression of zzso is directly induced by zzso and zzso zzso zzso Such distinct zzso dependency and zzso zzso is coupled with the acquisition of the zzso and zzso independence during the zzso differentiation zzso zzso the genetic zzso governing distinct zzso patterns is relevant to many symbiotic relationships among different cells and zzso In addition, the ability of zzso to predict patterns of zzso metabolism and dependency among tumors is also crucial in the rational design and application of zzso and other zzso zzso targeted zzso
