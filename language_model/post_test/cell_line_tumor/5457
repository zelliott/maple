In spite of the importance of zzso D zzso in cell proliferation and zzso little is known about the molecules regulating zzso zzso Thus, identification of small molecules zzso zzso expression would be an important advance for zzso zzso zzso We examined one such here, zzso zzso which was identified in a chemical screen for zzso of zzso expression using cell zzso system based on measurement of zzso promoter zzso zzso significantly suppressed the expression of both zzso and zzso with zzso potency in zzso breast cancer cells as analyzed by promoter zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso abolished the protein level of zzso in a time and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also observed in all the cancer cells zzso suggesting a general phenomenon detected in various cancer zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso suppressed both zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso inhibited zzso of zzso which increased zzso zzso Ultimately, zzso of zzso by zzso inhibited proliferation of breast cancer zzso Taken together, we demonstrate that zzso suppresses the expression of zzso via zzso of zzso zzso and then decreases cell zzso
