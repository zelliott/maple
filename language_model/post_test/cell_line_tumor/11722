zzso zzso were collected from an zzso zzso high-risk area of China and were used to detect the zzso length and the expression of human zzso reverse zzso zzso by zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and paired normal zzso were obtained from zzso surgical specimens of zzso zzso cell zzso in order to determine zzso activity and expression of zzso and zzso interacting protein zzso zzso by zzso repeat amplification zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso zzso The cell proliferation and zzso of zzso cells were analyzed by zzso and zzso zzso We found that the length of zzso DNA decreased and zzso protein expression increased in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was significantly zzso followed by a decrease of zzso expression in zzso zzso compared with zzso and normal patients, which notably correlated with grade and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso inhibited cell growth, arrested cells at the zzso stage and induced cell zzso in zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso In conclusion, the length zzso of zzso was an important characteristic in the zzso of zzso zzso cells, followed by increase of zzso activity and zzso of zzso zzso of zzso blocked zzso cell proliferation and induced cell zzso by zzso zzso zzso
