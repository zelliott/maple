The presence of zzso and nuclear zzso I zzso in the nucleus suggests a role for these motor proteins in nuclear zzso We have investigated the role of zzso and nuclear zzso I zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso genes zzso Both proteins are associated with zzso and are required for zzso zzso I zzso I) zzso zzso of zzso against zzso or zzso as well as short interfering zzso depletion of zzso decreased Pol I zzso in zzso whereas zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso activated Pol I transcription, and zzso to zzso or zzso inhibited Pol I zzso both on naked DNA and zzso zzso zzso Whereas zzso associated with Pol I, zzso bound to Pol I through the zzso factor zzso The association with Pol I requires zzso of zzso at zzso zzso by zzso zzso indicating a role for zzso in the zzso regulation of zzso zzso
