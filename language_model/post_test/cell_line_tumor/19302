zzso signaling is an emerging function of zzso zzso in the maintenance of zzso zzso targeting of the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso by zzso zzso triggers potent zzso zzso zzso signaling through the associated zzso chain zzso zzso that prevents zzso zzso and zzso zzso It is not known whether zzso zzso signaling controls receptors that do not function through an zzso and whether this zzso requires zzso zzso protein 1 zzso We show in this study that zzso zzso signals depend on zzso zzso protein 1 zzso to target multiple zzso receptors such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We found that zzso zzso treatment in zzso reduced kidney inflammation in models of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by a mechanism that involved decreased inflammatory cell zzso and zzso zzso This treatment also prevented ex zzso zzso zzso of zzso from patients with lupus zzso or zzso as well as zzso zzso through serum zzso complexes from zzso zzso zzso These findings point to a crucial role of zzso zzso signaling in the control of multiple zzso or zzso inflammatory zzso They also identify zzso zzso as a new potential therapeutic tool for preventing progression of zzso inflammatory zzso
