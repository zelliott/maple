zzso family proteins include zzso tumor zzso zzso and zzso Despite the high similarity in structure and function with zzso zzso and zzso function in tumor suppression is still zzso Here, we show that zzso a zzso active zzso zzso is able to zzso zzso tumor zzso function in zzso cancer zzso Indeed, depletion of zzso by small interfering zzso in zzso cancer cells resulted in a reduced zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso in zzso cancer cells resulted in increased zzso and tumor zzso function compared with zzso or zzso alone, as well as in increased zzso protein zzso The enhancing effect of zzso on zzso activity is zzso dependent because it is prevented by zzso depletion by small interfering zzso At least two mechanisms may explain the interference of zzso with zzso zzso First, in zzso cancer cells, zzso zzso the effect of zzso on zzso induction by zzso zzso at the zzso promoter zzso Second, a zzso zzso zzso which is devoid of DNA binding zzso is still able to increase zzso protein levels by competing with zzso for zzso protein zzso Taken together, these results indicate that in zzso cancer cells, zzso is able to increase zzso protein level and function by interfering with zzso zzso zzso These results may be useful for designing gene therapies aimed at restoring a normal zzso function in zzso cancer zzso
