New zzso compounds, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and evaluated against representative human zzso cell zzso zzso derivatives zzso were more active against zzso than leukemia cell zzso The zzso derivatives 7-9 were scarcely active, whereas the corresponding zzso derivatives zzso showed notable zzso against a majority of the tested cell zzso zzso modeling studies indicated that the high potency of 10 and 11, the most zzso compounds of the whole series, could be due to the position of the condensed zzso ring, which favors zzso stacking interactions with zzso and zzso bases in the DNA active zzso Biological studies suggested that zzso have no effect on human zzso I and II and that they induce arrest at the zzso zzso
