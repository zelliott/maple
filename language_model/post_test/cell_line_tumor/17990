Despite major advances in the molecular biology of the cancer cell over the past two decades, the great majority of patients are still treated by conventional zzso zzso The chemotherapy regimens employed frequently include zzso agents, zzso zzso agents and zzso zzso Attempts to predict the therapeutic efficacy of such drugs by molecular profiling zzso have up to the present time had limited zzso Genes responsible for the control of cell division, zzso and zzso whose normal functions become corrupted during zzso might potentially play a part in determining zzso zzso Here we have examined the relationships between the zzso of 18 human in zzso cancer cell lines and zzso expression of zzso zzso B1 and D1 and zzso zzso zzso and zzso When all 18 cell lines were examined as a single group, zzso expression did not provide any helpful zzso zzso Clear relationships between zzso expression and drug efficacy emerged, however, when zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were examined separately in zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso We suggest that the zzso relationships we have detected in zzso may have potential relevance in zzso and should prompt clinical zzso studies which take account of zzso zzso zzso
