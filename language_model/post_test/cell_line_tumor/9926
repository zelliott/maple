zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and G zzso zzso 40 zzso are members of G zzso receptors zzso zzso They are abundantly expressed in zzso beta cells, and mediate effects of zzso and fatty acids in beta zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso are known to be involved in the regulation of beta cell zzso zzso and the potential therapeutic drug for type 2 diabetes, zzso zzso zzso are both known zzso of zzso Here we studied the effects of zzso zzso and zzso on the expression of zzso in zzso beta zzso zzso beta cells were supplemented with different zzso of zzso zzso or zzso The expressions of zzso zzso zzso and a nuclear zzso factor - zzso activated zzso alpha zzso - were analyzed by real-time zzso and zzso The zzso of the zzso degradation of these receptors was also monitored by applying zzso D to zzso We demonstrated that the expressions of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso when zzso cells were treated with zzso while their expressions were zzso when treated with zzso or zzso zzso zzso or zzso treatment had no obvious effect on the expression of zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso and zzso regulated the expressions of zzso receptors and zzso but not zzso in beta zzso Whether zzso is a key regulator of these factors zzso zzso regulation remains to be investigated zzso
