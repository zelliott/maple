zzso zzso a major component of soybean products, has been reported to possess zzso zzso We examined the zzso effects of zzso zzso a novel synthetic zzso zzso on human zzso cancer cells as well as the molecular zzso The zzso effects of zzso and zzso were determined using zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso human zzso cancer zzso zzso activities of zzso were observed using zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso Multiple molecular techniques, such as zzso western zzso analysis, zzso and zzso zzso were used to explore the molecular zzso We demonstrated that nine of the zzso derivatives had a more effective zzso activity than zzso Among the zzso zzso zzso presented with the strongest activity against zzso and zzso cells in zzso zzso and zzso inhibited the growth of zzso and zzso cells, accompanied by cell cycle arrest in the zzso zzso zzso caused zzso cell death with zzso zzso of zzso box protein zzso zzso and its downstream zzso such as zzso zzso zzso B, and increased zzso zzso of zzso by zzso followed by zzso treatment resulted in enhanced cell growth zzso and induction of zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso attenuated zzso cell growth zzso and zzso cell zzso Our results show that the molecular role of zzso in zzso the biological effects of zzso and zzso in human zzso cancer cells suggests that zzso could be a novel target for the treatment of human zzso zzso
