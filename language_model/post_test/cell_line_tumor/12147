The pathways by which viruses enter cells are diverse, but in all cases, infection zzso the transfer of the viral zzso across a cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso after binding to zzso and zzso receptors at the cell surface, are delivered to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The nature and extent of virus zzso in the zzso how the viral zzso is transported to the zzso and subsequently to the nucleus, and whether any cellular proteins are involved are not zzso Here, we identify an zzso zzso zzso a factor implicated in the removal of zzso proteins from the zzso for zzso degradation, as a component of the machinery required for mouse zzso to establish an zzso zzso of zzso function by expression of either a zzso form of zzso or a short hairpin zzso that reduces zzso levels blocks zzso infection by 50 to zzso The block imposed by zzso zzso occurs after the virus reaches the zzso and can be zzso by the introduction of zzso DNA into the zzso These findings suggest a mode of zzso entry that involves zzso access via the quality control machinery in the zzso
