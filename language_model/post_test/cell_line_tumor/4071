The survival and colonization of tumor cells at new locations involve a variety of complex zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was originally named zzso zzso factor zzso zzso which was associated with cellular proliferation and was an zzso in tumor zzso Here we provide the first evidence of the expression profile and zzso significance of zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso was employed to determine the expression level of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso liver zzso zzso zzso level was found in zzso zzso samples zzso zzso with zzso zzso poor differentiation zzso zzso zzso zzso recurrence zzso and shorter zzso survival time zzso Small interfering zzso induced zzso of zzso promoted zzso in zzso cell line zzso Moreover, western zzso analysis revealed that zzso of zzso increased the protein levels of zzso zzso and zzso and decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso and zzso and increased zzso zzso which suggested the involvement of zzso in zzso These results indicated that zzso plays an important role in the zzso of human zzso
