zzso zzso is a complex process that involves a series of interactions between tumor cells and zzso cells zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso cells are known to induce an increase in zzso migration and tube formation by the zzso We have previously shown that in human zzso specimens the zzso zzso of the tumor zzso express the zzso component of zzso zzso and that zzso can be zzso in human zzso by exposing these cells to zzso in zzso Here, we developed a controlled in zzso zzso of tumor zzso in which primary human zzso vascular zzso cells zzso were zzso grafted with or without human zzso cells in zzso mice as zzso zzso We found that primary zzso did not survive in zzso zzso and that zzso zzso had little effect on zzso zzso In the presence of zzso cells, however, the grafted zzso not only survived in zzso implants but developed zzso structures that integrated with zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso enhanced such zzso More importantly, zzso of zzso in zzso completely abolished zzso formation and greatly reduced survival of these cells in the tumor zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso zzso by the zzso is a key requisite for zzso tumor zzso
