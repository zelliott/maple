We have previously shown that broccoli sprouts are a rich source of zzso zzso which zzso induce zzso zzso and inhibit the development of zzso and skin tumors in zzso However, the principal zzso present in broccoli zzso zzso zzso not only zzso zzso zzso but also activates zzso and blocks cell cycle zzso In this article, we show that an zzso extract of broccoli sprouts zzso zzso the growth of human zzso zzso cells in culture and that this zzso is almost exclusively due to the zzso zzso are present in broccoli sprouts as their zzso precursors and blocking their conversion to zzso zzso the zzso activity of the zzso Moreover, the potency of zzso in the extract in zzso cancer cell growth was almost identical to that of synthetic zzso as judged by their zzso values zzso versus zzso zzso suggesting that other zzso in the extract may be biologically similar to zzso and that zzso substances in the extract may not interfere with the zzso activity of the zzso Further study showed that the zzso extract of broccoli sprouts activated the zzso zzso zzso and halted cells in S and M zzso Cell cycle arrest was associated with zzso of zzso and disruption of zzso zzso These data show that broccoli zzso zzso extract is a highly promising substance for cancer zzso and that its zzso activity is exclusively derived from zzso
