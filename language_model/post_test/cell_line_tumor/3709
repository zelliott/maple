zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is the result of an zzso deletion within the zzso domain of zzso zzso and is expressed by breast zzso but not by normal breast zzso zzso is expressed both on the surface and in the zzso of tumor zzso Thus, zzso is a potential zzso target for both zzso and T zzso However, it is not known whether breast cancer patients can raise immune responses to zzso expressed by their zzso The demonstration of zzso immune responses in patients would suggest that zzso of patients with zzso vaccines is zzso because these vaccines may boost a pre-existing immune zzso We have evaluated zzso and cellular immune responses to zzso in 16 breast cancer patients and three healthy zzso Seven of 16 patients developed zzso zzso that bound to isolated zzso protein or the protein expressed by zzso mouse zzso The zzso that bound to zzso did not bind to zzso zzso and zzso zzso were not found in the zzso of healthy zzso Three patients had zzso zzso zzso responses, and two of these patients also had zzso immune zzso zzso and cellular immune responses correlated with zzso expression by patients' tumors in most zzso These studies demonstrate that breast cancer patients specifically recognize zzso with an overall immune response rate of zzso suggesting that patients may benefit from vaccination against zzso boosting pre-existing immune zzso
