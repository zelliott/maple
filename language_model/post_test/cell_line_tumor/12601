This study is to investigate the binding capability of zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso family, to human breast cancer and normal zzso the correlation of zzso binding capability to human breast cancer zzso and the expression of tumor therapeutic targets such as zzso and zzso In this study, the binding capability of zzso to human breast cancer zzso was detected with tissue zzso The correlation study of zzso binding capability to human breast tumor zzso and relevant therapeutic targets was performed on breast cancer tissue zzso zzso examination was used to detect the binding capability of zzso to human breast zzso zzso zzso As a result, tissue zzso showed that zzso zzso of zzso zzso of breast cancer zzso was positive, whereas that of zzso zzso of the adjacent normal breast specimens was zzso The difference between the tumor and normal samples was significant zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso in breast cancer correlated significantly with the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso r zzso zzso and zzso zzso Determined with zzso zzso analysis, zzso showed the binding capability to zzso zzso zzso zzso It is demonstrated that zzso can bind to human breast cancer zzso and there is significant difference between the breast cancer zzso and the corresponding normal zzso zzso the binding zzso shows positive correlation with the expression of zzso and zzso in breast zzso zzso The results imply that zzso may have a potential use as targeting drug carrier in the research and development of new zzso zzso This study may provide reference for drug combination of zzso and other therapeutic zzso
