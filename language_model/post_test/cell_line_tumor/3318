zzso are known as zzso zzso neutral zzso zzso However, zzso is detected in zzso fluid of zzso zzso and is shown to possess the zzso activity in zzso The mechanism of zzso release into the zzso spaces during arthritis has not yet been well zzso In the present study, we have analyzed zzso release from cultured zzso zzso by a zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso The effects of zzso zzso drugs zzso on zzso release were also zzso 

Human zzso zzso cells were zzso by zzso in the presence or absence of an zzso zzso in the cells and culture medium was zzso by Western zzso analysis using an zzso zzso Western blots were subjected to zzso analysis and band zzso were zzso 

zzso (10 zzso zzso zzso release with transient increase in cellular zzso in zzso zzso zzso examined zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso release and production of zzso zzso zzso induced by 10 zzso zzso zzso added zzso accelerated the release of zzso in response to a lower concentration of zzso (1 zzso zzso an zzso zzso but not zzso (an zzso zzso effectively inhibited zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso an zzso zzso accelerated release of zzso by 1 zzso zzso 

These results suggest that zzso stimulates zzso and release of zzso in zzso zzso cells, and that stimulation of zzso zzso by produced zzso is deeply involved in this zzso
