To investigate the zzso effects of zzso zzso expression of zzso an zzso of zzso growth factor zzso on human colon cancer in an zzso mouse model to explore the possibility of applying zzso to cancer gene zzso 

A human colon tumor model was developed by subcutaneous zzso of tumor tissue formed by zzso cells grown in zzso zzso Fifteen zzso mice were zzso into three groups zzso zzso 5 in each zzso at d 3 after tumor zzso and mice were injected zzso with zzso saline (PBS) or with zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso or zzso zzso at a zzso zzso for total 5 injections in each zzso zzso sizes were measured during treatment to draw a tumor growth zzso At d 26 after the first treatment, all animals were sacrificed and the tumors were removed to zzso examine zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso zzso density zzso by zzso and zzso zzso In a separate experiment, 15 additional zzso mice were employed to develop a tumor zzso model by zzso injection zzso of zzso zzso These mice were zzso into 3 groups zzso zzso 5 in each zzso at d 1 after injection and were treated by zzso injection of zzso or zzso or zzso at a zzso zzso for total two injections in each zzso All animals were sacrificed at d 14 and the numbers and weights of zzso tumors within the abdominal cavity were zzso 

Growth of human colon tumors were significantly suppressed in the zzso mice treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to those treated by either PBS zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The tumor growth zzso rate was as high as zzso zzso zzso revealed a similar zzso labeling index zzso zzso zzso in PBS group vs zzso zzso zzso in zzso group vs zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso in all groups, but significantly lower zzso density zzso zzso zzso in zzso group vs zzso zzso zzso in PBS group or zzso zzso zzso in zzso group, P zzso zzso and a markedly higher zzso index zzso zzso zzso in zzso group vs zzso zzso zzso in PBS group or zzso zzso zzso in zzso group, P zzso zzso in the zzso group compared to the two control zzso In the tumor zzso model, the number and weight of zzso tumors of mice treated with zzso were much lower than those of the control groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso group vs zzso zzso zzso in PBS group or zzso zzso zzso in zzso group, P zzso zzso tumor zzso 324 zzso 176 zzso in zzso group vs zzso zzso 382 zzso in PBS group or zzso zzso 484 zzso in zzso group, P zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso can zzso the growth of colon cancer in zzso probably by suppressing zzso and inducing tumor cell zzso but not by direct suppression of tumor cell zzso Moreover, zzso may inhibit zzso dissemination of colon cancer cells in a zzso tumor zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso gene transfer may be an effective tool for the treatment of colon zzso
