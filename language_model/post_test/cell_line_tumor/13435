zzso zzso are a class of small zzso zzso involved in gene zzso zzso half of zzso are located within known genes and called zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso and their corresponding host genes were analyzed for zzso organization and functional zzso Using quantitative real-time zzso the expression levels of a subset of zzso zzso and their host genes were examined in diverse zzso leukemia cell lines, and their regulation in response to pharmacological stimuli was also zzso zzso of zzso strongly correlated with both zzso leukemia zzso and the expression of its host gene zzso zzso The latter was absent in zzso zzso but abundant in zzso and zzso zzso These results demonstrated that the expression signatures of zzso and zzso are associated with zzso lineages and specific leukemia zzso
