zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso that activates zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways through zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been shown to zzso the zzso zzso zzso at zzso and zzso respectively, thereby mimicking the effects of zzso activity such as zzso responsive element zzso zzso In the current study, zzso analysis was performed using two zzso array platforms, zzso zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso and zzso zzso together with array comparative zzso zzso zzso analysis in an effort to identify zzso genes in zzso zzso breast cancer zzso Through application of various threshold settings, zzso zzso zzso and 7 zzso zzso genes were zzso zzso of upstream zzso factors zzso and zzso analysis indicated that zzso of zzso gene regulation may be controlled by the zzso zzso while only zzso of the gene expression is controlled by zzso A comparison with previously reported zzso zzso gene expression data revealed that only 12 common genes were identified between the zzso zzso zzso and 239 zzso zzso gene zzso However, with respect to enriched upstream zzso 4 common zzso were identified in the 14 zzso zzso and 13 zzso zzso gene zzso These results indicated that while zzso and zzso may induce common zzso the regulatory mechanisms that govern zzso and zzso gene expression zzso
