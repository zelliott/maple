This study was aimed to investigate the effect of zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression on cell zzso invasion and migration of human zzso cancer cell line zzso The zzso specific short hairpin zzso zzso zzso zzso was constructed and then zzso into the zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso and protein was detected by real-time zzso and western zzso zzso Cell proliferation was detected by zzso zzso zzso Cell invasion and migration was zzso in zzso zzso invasion zzso The expression level of zzso in zzso cell zzso with zzso was zzso leading to significant decrease in zzso cell zzso invasion and zzso We conclude that zzso is essential for tumor cell proliferation and zzso The zzso zzso is a potential therapeutic target to control zzso cancer cell growth or zzso
