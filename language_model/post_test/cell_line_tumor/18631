zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso is an zzso that promotes tumor cell invasion in zzso Although the zzso activity of zzso is indispensable for invasion, it is also regulated by functions of the zzso zzso In this study we obtained a new human gene whose product binds to the tail sequence in zzso The product, zzso is a zzso protein that belongs to the newly proposed zzso zzso composed of proteins with diverse zzso zzso expressed in cells formed a complex with zzso and zzso at the zzso It was also detected in both the zzso and nucleus, where zzso does not zzso In human tumor cell lines zzso expression was significantly low compared with zzso zzso and enforced expression of zzso inhibited the activity of zzso in promoting cell migration and zzso zzso showed significant zzso to the bacterial zzso zzso which is an zzso in zzso zzso The zzso part of zzso is identical to zzso which is reported to be important for human zzso C virus zzso Thus, zzso may have multiple functions other than the regulation of zzso which presumably depends on the zzso zzso
