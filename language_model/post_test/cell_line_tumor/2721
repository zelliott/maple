The development and the propagation of chronic zzso leukemia zzso has been linked to signaling via the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C beta zzso is an essential signaling element of the zzso and was recently shown to be zzso in human zzso We used the zzso transgenic mouse model to directly target zzso in the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso did restore the zzso zzso population that is absent in zzso zzso However, zzso zzso transgenic mice did not develop a zzso disease, suggesting a role of zzso in the establishment of the zzso zzso Moreover, targeting of zzso with the specific inhibitor zzso led to killing of human zzso samples in zzso We thus propose that zzso may be a relevant target for the treatment of zzso
