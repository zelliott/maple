We zzso a zzso device for the highly selective detection of the zzso released from rat zzso leukemia zzso zzso zzso The device has two thin layer flow channels, each with one working zzso One zzso was modified with zzso based zzso containing zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the other was modified with zzso without any zzso We employed the device for differential measurement by using the zzso modified zzso for detection and the unmodified zzso as a zzso The detection limit was greatly improved from 190 to 25 zzso since the baseline noise level was zzso We used differential measurement to observe the zzso released from zzso cells when zzso with zzso bovine serum zzso zzso as an zzso We injected 5 zzso of zzso solution into our device and it remained stable for more than 8 zzso
