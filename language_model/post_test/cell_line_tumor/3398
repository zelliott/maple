A series of zzso derivatives of zzso zzso that selectively bind to zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The resulting targeting devices strongly and selectively bound to human cancer cells expressing zzso zzso and zzso as analyzed by flow zzso In zzso and in zzso studies revealed that these novel zzso devices efficiently inhibit tumor zzso Thus, the combination of zzso derivatives of zzso zzso that target cell surface zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso through formation of a zzso bond of defined zzso holds promise as a new approach to cancer zzso
