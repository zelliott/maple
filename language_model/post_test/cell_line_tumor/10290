zzso zzso zzso zzso is modulated by interaction with zzso zzso We demonstrate that the unconventional zzso zzso zzso zzso is a new regulator of zzso zzso and is critical for zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso upon zzso treatment, suggesting communication between the zzso and zzso signaling zzso Whereas depletion of zzso enhances zzso gene transcription, zzso of zzso suppresses zzso zzso zzso and zzso prostate cancer cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso is zzso in part, by zzso binding and regulation of zzso zzso trapped clone 27 zzso a previously characterized zzso zzso zzso with this idea, zzso expression profiling in prostate cancer cells upon depletion of zzso or zzso reveals substantially overlapping patterns of gene zzso Further, depletion of zzso increases the expression of the zzso target gene zzso decreases the recruitment of zzso and increases zzso occupancy at the zzso zzso While zzso can bind zzso directly, zzso is bound to zzso prior to zzso recruitment of zzso suggesting a role for zzso in modulating zzso recruitment to target zzso
