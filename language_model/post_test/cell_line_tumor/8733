zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is a major zzso factor involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso can mediate zzso effects by recruiting zzso and inducing zzso differentiation in the tumor zzso It therefore holds strong potential as a therapeutic zzso Here, we armed a zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and evaluated its therapeutic efficacy against neuroendocrine zzso We observed that it could specifically zzso and eradicate a wide range of tumor cells lines from different origin in zzso zzso of zzso zzso did not affect the stability or zzso capacity of the virus and infected tumor cells could efficiently zzso zzso zzso administration of the virus in nude mice zzso with neuroendocrine tumors improved median zzso Evidence of biological zzso activity was observed 24 hours after treatment with zzso zzso in tumors and an increase of zzso zzso such as tumor necrosis factor zzso and zzso in the systemic zzso Furthermore, evidence of zzso immune polarization was observed as a result of increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso 72 hours zzso zzso Our observations suggest that zzso can serve as a potent zzso in promoting zzso immune response in the tumor zzso and enhance the therapeutic effect of zzso zzso
