zzso zzso zzso zzso have been shown to induce cell cycle arrest and zzso in cancer zzso However, the mechanisms of zzso inhibitor induced zzso are incompletely zzso In this study, zzso a novel zzso zzso was shown to be able to induce significant zzso cell death in human lung cancer zzso Further study showed that zzso a zzso zzso zzso was significantly zzso by zzso in cancer cells, and zzso function in zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso of zzso with zzso In addition, we found that zzso expression of zzso was directly dependent on zzso of zzso box class zzso zzso that is zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and indirectly induced by a decreased zzso zzso protein zzso Moreover, our results demonstrated that zzso zzso is required for the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso using zzso with a zzso containing zzso zzso at zzso sites and a zzso reporter zzso These data show for the first time that an zzso inhibitor zzso zzso through the zzso zzso zzso
