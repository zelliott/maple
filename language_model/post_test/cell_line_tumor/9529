zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso which shows frequent recurrence and zzso ultimately with a poor zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso zzso is frequently found and is due to an enhancement of its degradation in zzso In this study, we zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene into zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene was more effective on zzso of cell growth of zzso cells, suggesting that aberration of zzso degradation may be present in zzso As zzso protein zzso zzso protein 2 zzso which is necessary for zzso degradation of zzso is involved in zzso zzso in various zzso we examined the zzso expression and its association with zzso expression in 50 zzso zzso We found zzso expression in zzso of zzso cases and inverse association between the expression of zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso small interfering zzso acid zzso zzso decreased zzso protein and zzso of zzso protein and inhibited the cell growth of zzso cells in zzso These findings, overall, suggest that zzso may play an important role in zzso development through the zzso of zzso and that zzso zzso can be a novel zzso of cancer gene therapy for suppression of zzso zzso in zzso
