zzso zzso are small, zzso zzso of zzso origin, they have been increasingly shown to have zzso expression in many tumor zzso zzso has not been zzso investigated in gastric and zzso zzso 

Total zzso was extracted from zzso of 212 patients with gastric or zzso cancer as well as from seven gastric and zzso cell zzso We determined the expression of zzso by real-time zzso and calculated using the zzso zzso Then, we assessed zzso expression and zzso zzso Finally, we studied the effect of zzso on cell proliferation in zzso cells by zzso 

zzso has significantly low expression in zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso paired zzso zzso and cancer cell lines compared to zzso zzso Moreover, low expression of zzso was correlated with tumor size zzso zzso zzso and zzso stage zzso in zzso zzso Although expression of zzso was not significant in gastric cancer zzso zzso interestingly, zzso was correlated with tumor size zzso zzso type zzso and zzso stage zzso Furthermore, we found zzso can inhibit the cell proliferation in zzso zzso 

zzso may be related to the proliferation and invasion of gastric and zzso zzso
