zzso molecules are a new class of DNA repair zzso triggering false DNA damage signaling in cancer zzso zzso has already been shown to be effective in combination with zzso The aim of this study was to assess the zzso impact of zzso on chemotherapy in zzso and in mouse models of zzso zzso 

We assessed DNA repair efficiency over time, in zzso in human colon zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell lines treated with zzso in combination with zzso and/or zzso zzso engineered mice spontaneously developing zzso tumors in the zzso were selected for the evaluation of treatment zzso 

zzso delayed the repair of DNA damage induced by chemotherapy in zzso In zzso zzso zzso mice, the combination of zzso and chemotherapy decreased tumor size more effectively than chemotherapy alone zzso size: zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In zzso zzso ( zzso ) zzso mice, animals treated with a combination of zzso and chemotherapy survived significantly longer than animals treated by chemotherapy alone zzso zzso 210 zzso zzso days, P zzso zzso A quarter of all the animals treated by chemotherapy alone died as rapidly as zzso animals, whereas the first death was delayed by 29 days by the addition of zzso No increase in toxicity due to zzso was observed in either mouse zzso 

The use of zzso to inhibit DNA repair may be an effective additional treatment for increasing the efficacy of chemotherapy in colon or zzso cancer, independently of zzso zzso
