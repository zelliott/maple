In this study, we examine the sensitivity of a panel of zzso zzso cells, which includes four primary zzso cancer cell samples, and four normal zzso zzso samples to tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso We also examine the zzso regulation of zzso zzso 

The sensitivity to TRAIL was determined by short-term survival zzso on seven zzso zzso cell lines, four primary samples of zzso cancer, and four normal zzso zzso zzso We assessed the zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso and zzso tumor zzso The expression of TRAIL receptors was determined by flow zzso The protein expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined by zzso zzso 

We show that zzso cancer cells display variable sensitivity to zzso zzso although most cell lines have similar sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso zzso samples were mostly sensitive to zzso In sensitive cells, TRAIL induced zzso zzso which subsequently led to zzso of zzso Both sensitive and resistant cells expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso at similar zzso A significant enhancement in cell death was observed in zzso cells when zzso levels were zzso by zzso zzso 

These data suggest that sensitivity to TRAIL and chemotherapy does not necessarily correlate in human zzso cancer zzso zzso cells isolated from patients with zzso cancer show variable sensitivity to TRAIL but most normal zzso zzso cells are zzso In human zzso cancer cells, zzso may participate to the regulation of the TRAIL signaling zzso
