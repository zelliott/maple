zzso expression of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso and/or human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso is a feature of many human tumors and is associated with disease zzso treatment resistance, and poor zzso zzso zzso zzso an important downstream zzso of these zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways that control cancer cell zzso invasion, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso small zzso zzso that bind to the zzso region of target zzso are now recognized to play key roles in the regulation of gene zzso particularly in tumor development and zzso We have shown that zzso zzso and zzso zzso directly regulate expression of zzso and zzso respectively, in zzso and prostate cancer cell zzso As a consequence, zzso and zzso reduce zzso activity and thus have the capacity to regulate a signaling zzso critical to the development and progression of zzso and prostate zzso This chapter provides a detailed approach outlining how to confirm that a putative target of a zzso is a direct target, and subsequent assessment of downstream signaling zzso
