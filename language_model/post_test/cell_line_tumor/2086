We describe the development and clinical translation of a targeted zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso for the treatment of patients with solid zzso zzso is targeted to zzso membrane zzso a clinically validated tumor zzso expressed on prostate cancer cells and on the zzso of most zzso solid zzso zzso was developed from a zzso library of more than 100 zzso zzso varying with respect to particle size, targeting zzso density, surface zzso drug zzso and drug release zzso zzso and tissue distribution studies in rats showed that the zzso had a blood circulation zzso of about 20 hours and minimal liver zzso In zzso mice, zzso exhibited markedly enhanced tumor zzso at 12 hours and prolonged tumor growth suppression compared to a zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso mice, rats, and nonhuman zzso zzso displayed zzso characteristics consistent with prolonged circulation of zzso in the vascular compartment and controlled release of zzso with total zzso plasma zzso remaining at least zzso higher than zzso for more than 24 zzso Finally, initial clinical data in patients with advanced solid tumors indicated that zzso displays a pharmacological profile differentiated from zzso including zzso characteristics consistent with zzso data and cases of tumor shrinkage at doses below the zzso dose typically used in the zzso
