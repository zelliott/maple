The design of targeted therapy, particularly zzso targeted therapy, requires knowledge of the presence and zzso distribution of zzso zzso zzso To determine whether the expression of such receptors is constant or varies between and within individual colon cancer zzso we examined the pattern of expression of the zzso zzso growth factor, vascular zzso growth factor, and zzso growth zzso as well as their respective receptors in human colon cancer surgical specimens and zzso human colon zzso growing in the zzso wall of nude zzso The expression of the zzso growth factor zzso and the vascular zzso growth factor zzso on tumor cells and zzso cells, including zzso zzso cells, was zzso in surgical specimens and zzso zzso In some tumors, the zzso was expressed on both tumor cells and zzso cells, and in other tumors the zzso was expressed only on tumor cells or only on zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso growth factor zzso was expressed only on zzso cells in both surgical specimens and zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression in both individual surgical specimens and zzso tumors revealed that the zzso growth factor zzso was expressed only on zzso cells and that the patterns of zzso growth factor zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso 2 expression differed between tumor zzso This zzso in zzso expression among different tumor cells suggests that targeting a single zzso zzso may not yield zzso of the zzso
