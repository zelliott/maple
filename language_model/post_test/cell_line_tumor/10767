As zzso zzso tumor transforming zzso abundance zzso with adverse outcomes in cancer treatment, we determined mechanisms underlying this observation by assessing the role of zzso in regulating cell response to zzso zzso zzso cells devoid of zzso zzso exhibited enhanced drug sensitivity as assessed by measuring zzso incorporation in zzso zzso zzso catastrophe or DNA damage were not zzso but features of zzso were observed using low doses of zzso and zzso The number of drug-induced zzso zzso cells increased zzso fold as compared to zzso zzso cells ( zzso zzso an important regulator of cell zzso was induced zzso fold in zzso zzso cells upon zzso or zzso A zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso promoter was enhanced in zzso cells after treatment, suggesting zzso regulation of zzso zzso knock down zzso the observed zzso effects of these drugs, indicating that zzso likely suppresses zzso to regulate drug-induced zzso zzso also regulated zzso colon cancer cells response to zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells developed smaller tumors and exhibited enhanced responses to zzso zzso tumor tissue derived from excised tumors exhibited increased zzso zzso As zzso is a zzso of cell responses to zzso treatments, these findings suggest zzso as a tumor cell marker to predict zzso treatment zzso
