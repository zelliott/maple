Current spontaneous zzso models require a long period of observation after establishment of primary tumors to see significant zzso zzso The degree of zzso is not consistent among zzso this is problematic since it requires the use of a large number of animals to obtain reliable zzso Here we report that zzso of animals with zzso media zzso consistently zzso spontaneous zzso in breast zzso An zzso breast tumor model facilitated by zzso showed robust anterior zzso to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and the lungs compared to the zzso media treated zzso The zzso in zzso animals showed enhanced zzso and zzso zzso tumors and lungs in zzso animals showed enhanced zzso with no significant change in zzso zzso animals also showed zzso dissemination to abdomen from the primary injection zzso this would generally enhance zzso to other zzso In sum, the addition of zzso zzso to current zzso models results in accelerated and robust zzso which would enable more efficient evaluation of zzso zzso
