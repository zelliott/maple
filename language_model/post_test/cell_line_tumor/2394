zzso zzso a potent zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso Previous in zzso studies have shown that zzso cancer cells produce zzso 

zzso and its receptors zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were analyzed in zzso cancer cell lines and tumors by Western zzso and zzso Also, zzso levels were measured by zzso in blood samples collected before and after tumor zzso 

zzso was zzso expressed by tumor cells at a variable level in 39 cases zzso The adjacent normal zzso was negative for zzso zzso Strong zzso R expression observed in the deeper zzso areas at the periphery of zzso tissue correlated significantly with tumor zzso zzso R levels were very low or zzso Western zzso analysis in paired zzso zzso zzso samples of zzso zzso and in four colon zzso cell lines confirmed these zzso In addition, lower levels of zzso in the peripheral circulation after the tumor zzso were found by zzso as compared to those observed before zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso zzso are expressed at a higher level in primary and cultured colon zzso cells as compared to normal colon zzso zzso Further functional studies are needed to explore the role of zzso R axis in colon zzso
