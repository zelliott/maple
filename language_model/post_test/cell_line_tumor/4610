zzso zzso is an zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso and plays an important role in tumor zzso zzso and zzso The regulation of zzso expression and function is tightly controlled and the increasing use of the mouse as an animal model to define the role of zzso in many zzso and pathological settings, makes understanding the regulatory mechanisms of zzso in this species of fundamental zzso However, the expression distribution of the mouse zzso gene and the mechanisms that regulate its zzso are poorly zzso In this study, the mouse zzso gene was determined to zzso for two zzso transcripts of zzso and zzso zzso in length with identical open reading frames that showed similar tissue expression distribution to the human zzso The mouse zzso promoter was cloned and a zzso minimal promoter was identified that contained regulatory elements responsible for both zzso promoter activity in mouse tumor cells as well as zzso activity in T zzso zzso and zzso studies identified a functional site in the minimal promoter region for the zzso factor Early growth response gene 1 zzso Interestingly, zzso acted zzso in mouse tumor cells, functioning in an zzso or repressive manner in breast zzso or melanoma cells, zzso Furthermore, the zzso region of the promoter, identified as important in the regulation of zzso transcription, was shown to become accessible in T cells upon cell zzso zzso the zzso accessibility of the promoter occurred at 16 h zzso which correlated with the induction zzso of zzso zzso zzso In zzso this study demonstrates that mouse zzso is expressed and regulated in a similar manner to human zzso and also provides some novel insights into mechanisms of zzso gene regulation that are likely to be relevant to control of the human zzso
