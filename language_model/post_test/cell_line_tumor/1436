The ability of zzso zzso to regulate the proliferation of prostate cancer zzso cells in the absence of zzso is poorly zzso Here, we show the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso specimens and cell lines is zzso Our data indicate that zzso zzso the formation of a complex between zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein 1 zzso in zzso zzso This protein complex is formed on zzso zzso zzso elements on the promoter in response to zzso zzso of this complex enables the zzso of zzso genes in response to zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso blocks the assembly of this complex, blocks zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and blocks zzso proliferation of zzso zzso Overall, this study shows that zzso may enable zzso zzso signaling by forming a protein complex between zzso zzso and zzso on the DNA, leading to the proliferation of zzso cells in the absence of zzso zzso may bridge the signal between zzso bound to zzso and zzso and thus allow for cross talk between these steroid zzso These data suggest a novel mechanism of zzso zzso in the absence of zzso in zzso zzso Our data indicate that disruption of the complex between zzso and zzso may be a viable therapeutic strategy in advanced zzso
