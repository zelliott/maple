In this paper, we have developed a zzso structured zzso zzso zzso with strong zzso and a fast magnetic response for specifically zzso zzso zzso and zzso sorting target tumor cells on a zzso zzso The outer zzso layer not only effectively alleviated the zzso effect of the zzso quantum dots but also provided a convenient and versatile functional interface to readily zzso with the recognizing model molecules of zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso isolation and zzso decoration equipped the zzso zzso with little zzso and zzso zzso leading to the effective and specific profiling of the protein zzso expressed on the target tumor zzso Taking advantage of the magnetic property and specific recognition, the modified zzso was zzso to label and isolate zzso cells from a homogeneous cell mixture of zzso and zzso cells on a zzso zzso Combining with the high zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were readily separated from zzso zzso zzso cells in only 10 zzso with zzso separation efficiency, markedly improved in comparison with conventional zzso This study presents an innovative strategy for developing highly integrated zzso of strong zzso and magnetic zzso opening up a promising zzso avenue for biological imaging and zzso
