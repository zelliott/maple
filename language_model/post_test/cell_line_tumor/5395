zzso zzso is a zzso zzso inhibitor without zzso toxicity derived from a zzso toxic compound zzso which is found in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso commonly used in traditional Chinese zzso The zzso capacity of zzso is apparently through the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to clarify the zzso regulation of zzso gene by zzso in zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso not only zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso but also inhibited zzso activity in a zzso and zzso zzso In zzso cells with zzso of zzso reporter zzso zzso treatment decreased reporter zzso activity from a zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso but this did not occur with an zzso zzso Further zzso with zzso containing zzso or various zzso zzso promoters in zzso cells indicated that zzso but not the others, was required for zzso of zzso promoter zzso More evidence by zzso mobility shift zzso demonstrated that zzso inhibited the zzso activity of zzso In addition, the increase effect of zzso activity by zzso may include the zzso of nuclear zzso and result in competitive suppression of zzso activity in zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso expression by zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso cancer zzso zzso
