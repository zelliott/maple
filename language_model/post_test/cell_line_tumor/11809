In this work a novel zzso platform for cell culture and zzso is zzso On the chip a zzso cell culture region is coupled with dynamic zzso nutrition supply zzso The cell culture unit has a sandwich structure with liquid channels on the top, the cell culture zzso in the middle and gas channels on the zzso zzso can be easily loaded into the zzso and exchange constantly with the external liquid environment by zzso Since the flow direction is perpendicular to the liquid channel on the top of the zzso the cells in the zzso are zzso from zzso By assembling the basic units into an zzso a steady concentration zzso can be zzso Cell culture models both for continuous zzso and one-off zzso were established on the zzso Both adherent and suspended cells were successfully cultured on the chip in zzso and zzso culture zzso After zzso the trapped cells were recovered for use in a later zzso As a competitive candidate for a standard cell culture and zzso platform, this chip is also adaptable for zzso and cell growth zzso
