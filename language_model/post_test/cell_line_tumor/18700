zzso C zzso is a zzso zzso zzso inhibitor that regulates bone zzso zzso zzso and tissue zzso as well as resistance to bacterial and viral zzso zzso is zzso expressed and present in most bodily zzso where it zzso the activities of zzso a family of zzso zzso that can promote cancer cell invasion and zzso zzso growth factor beta zzso is a zzso zzso endowed with both zzso and zzso zzso We show zzso that zzso treatment zzso zzso transcript and protein in zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso expression was zzso in approximately 50% of human zzso particularly zzso of the stomach, zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in human zzso zzso cells antagonized their invasion through synthetic basement zzso in part via a zzso zzso Independent of effects on zzso activity, zzso also reduced zzso cell gene expression zzso by zzso Invasion of zzso cells occurred through both zzso and zzso zzso Both pathways were blocked by zzso but only the zzso zzso was blocked by a zzso zzso zzso zzso that is impaired in its ability to inhibit zzso zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso both inhibited zzso cell gene expression zzso by zzso We further show that zzso antagonized zzso binding to its cell surface zzso doing so by interacting physically with the zzso type II zzso and zzso its binding of zzso zzso our findings have identified zzso as a novel zzso zzso zzso as well as a novel zzso feedback loop that zzso zzso zzso
