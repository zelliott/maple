zzso oxide zzso has been reported to sensitize cancer cells to zzso Since delivery of NO to tumors is limited in zzso by systemic toxicity of zzso we examined the potential of gene delivery of the human zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso gene as a means of achieving high output NO zzso We successfully zzso two zzso cancer cell lines as evidenced by increased zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso We found that zzso of zzso enhanced the effects of radiation on zzso in both cell lines in a zzso zzso Gene transfer of zzso holds much promise as a potential zzso of cancer cells since it increases zzso in an additive manner with zzso
