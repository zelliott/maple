zzso receptors are widely expressed in cells of the immune system with varying zzso This study sought to characterize zzso zzso expression in the zzso human mast cell line and human lung mast cells zzso 

zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and patch clamp studies were used to characterize zzso expression in mast cells using a range of pharmacological zzso 

zzso revealed zzso zzso and zzso transcripts in both cell zzso zzso for zzso was also detected in zzso zzso Under zzso patch clamp conditions, rapid application of zzso zzso zzso to cells clamped at zzso zzso consistently evoked inward currents in both types of zzso zzso application of zzso (1 zzso evoked a rapidly desensitizing zzso current in both cell zzso This current was also zzso by zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso cells, zzso 31) and was antagonized in zzso cells by zzso 449 (1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso current in response to high zzso of zzso zzso zzso was also seen in both cell types zzso zzso zzso 24; zzso zzso zzso 24) which was antagonized by zzso (1 zzso zzso responses were also evoked in zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso A zzso current was evoked by 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10; zzso zzso zzso 29), the zzso and duration of which was zzso by zzso (3 zzso 

Our data confirmed the presence of functional zzso zzso and zzso receptors in zzso cells and zzso
