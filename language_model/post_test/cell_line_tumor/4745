zzso gene therapy could potentially play a role in the treatment of zzso cancer and Barrett's zzso The zzso can be zzso in different zzso The goal of the present study was to investigate the zzso efficacy of different zzso zzso in different models of zzso cancer and Barrett's zzso 

zzso of the zzso zzso 5 backbone and fibers of zzso 5, 16, 35, 40, and 50 were constructed with zzso zzso For zzso cancer, cell lines were used originating from with zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were used as an in zzso model for Barrett's zzso zzso was used as a reporter gene and zzso efficacy was assessed by flow zzso 

zzso zzso was rather efficient in the cancer cell zzso Especially zzso 16 and 50 exhibited an improved zzso compared with the other zzso In the zzso cell lines, we observed a decreased zzso upon differentiation of the zzso All zzso had a very limited zzso and no zzso had an additional value in this zzso 

Some zzso could have an additional value in the development of gene therapy for zzso zzso Especially zzso 16 and 50 exhibited an improved zzso in zzso cancer cells compared with the native zzso zzso In the setting of Barrett's zzso none of the zzso had an improved potency as in differentiated zzso cells all zzso had a very limited zzso
