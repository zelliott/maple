zzso approved by the zzso for the treatment of zzso syndrome zzso is incorporated into the DNA of dividing cells where it specifically zzso DNA zzso by forming zzso complexes with the DNA zzso zzso In an effort to study the correlations between DNA zzso zzso zzso and gene zzso we investigate the integrated zzso events that worked zzso to zzso the zzso and closed promoters back to zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso The zzso results indicate that zzso is deposited at promoter regions by the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso complex following DNA zzso According to our zzso expression and DNA zzso profiles, we find that the complete zzso of silenced genes requires the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which zzso the acquisition of regions fully depleted of zzso as demonstrated by zzso zzso Occupancy zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso deposition is not required for maintaining the active status of zzso expressed zzso By combining zzso II zzso with zzso zzso we show that zzso DNA, which is generated following drug zzso remains occupied by zzso Our data highlight zzso as a novel and essential factor involved in zzso gene zzso Furthermore, we zzso that zzso zzso translates the zzso ability of zzso zzso to their downstream zzso suggesting future therapeutic implications for zzso zzso
