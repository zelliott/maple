To confirm the zzso activity of steroid zzso isolated from the zzso of Paris zzso zzso zzso and evaluate the zzso relationships of these steroid zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso 

Eight known steroid zzso were isolated from the zzso of Paris zzso zzso The zzso lung zzso cell line from mice was chosen to evaluate zzso by means of zzso zzso and to study zzso by means of zzso flow zzso zzso zzso 1), the main steroid zzso of Paris zzso , and zzso zzso the zzso of major steroid zzso were evaluated for zzso activity on zzso lung zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

The steroid zzso showed remarkable zzso and caused typical zzso in a zzso zzso They were evaluated in zzso by their effect on tumor developed in zzso zzso zzso The oral administration to zzso mice bearing zzso lung zzso of compound 1 and zzso significantly inhibited tumor growth, by zzso and zzso zzso HE zzso showed that lungs and zzso of treated mice underwent various levels of zzso zzso It was demonstrated by zzso zzso that zzso rate in tumor cells was increased in comparison to cells in control zzso The zzso zzso and zzso structure played an important role in the zzso activity of steroid zzso and the number and the variety of zzso of compounds strongly influenced on their zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso showed zzso activity against lung zzso cell line, both in zzso and in zzso and their effect was dependent on zzso structure in a certain zzso
