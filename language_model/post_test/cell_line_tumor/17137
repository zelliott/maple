Novel zzso complexes with zzso have been zzso and characterized by infrared and zzso magnetic resonance zzso techniques zzso zzso zzso zzso The complexes are of two zzso zzso and zzso where zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shifts zzso zzso were observed for zzso atom indicating this nitrogen atom as a coordination zzso The molecular structure suggest that zzso zzso has the square zzso geometry with zzso bonded zzso zzso second zzso zzso for zzso or, respectively, zzso for zzso and two zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity in zzso of complexes zzso have been tested against the cells of four human cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lung zzso zzso breast cancer and zzso zzso zzso The results indicate a moderate zzso activity of zzso against the cells of zzso breast and zzso cancer and a marked and selective zzso effect of zzso against the cells of all studied human cancer zzso
