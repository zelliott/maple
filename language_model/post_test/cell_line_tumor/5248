Two forms of zzso zzso zzso consisting of zzso with zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso are involved in DNA replication and damage repair, zzso zzso zzso zzso one of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is a potent zzso inhibitor in clinical trial for cancer zzso In this study, zzso and its 7 derivatives showed zzso higher zzso potency on zzso zzso zzso cells than zzso and were fully active against zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso using two zzso zzso showed that all 8 zzso decreased the activity of both zzso in a zzso manner and the efficiency was compatible with that on cell proliferation zzso Iron has different impact on the behavior of the compounds toward zzso In the absence of iron, the zzso showed more selective zzso for zzso than zzso while addition of iron increased their activity but reduced their selectivity for two zzso zzso binding zzso showed that zzso directly bounded to the small zzso zzso zzso resonance zzso demonstrated that these zzso generated zzso oxygen species with zzso iron, which zzso the zzso radical zzso of the small zzso and hence the zzso zzso While the zzso may be a common zzso responsible for the potent activity of the zzso the different characteristics of the small zzso proteins are probably associated with the zzso of zzso Better understanding of the mechanism of action of zzso zzso may improve design of new potent and zzso zzso zzso for cancer zzso
