Previous studies demonstrated a functional involvement of the zzso zzso factor in zzso cervical zzso Here, we aimed to obtain further insight in expression zzso of zzso family members during zzso transformation and their relationship to potential regulatory zzso zzso and target zzso zzso 

zzso expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Net and zzso were determined by quantitative zzso in primary zzso zzso early zzso and late zzso passages of zzso zzso zzso and in zzso cervical cancer cell lines zzso In a subset of cell lines protein expression and zzso complex composition was zzso 

Starting in zzso stages zzso zzso and zzso expression became up regulated towards zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso Net and zzso became down zzso The onset of zzso expression varied amongst the zzso members and was not directly related to altered zzso Net or zzso zzso Nevertheless, a shift in zzso complex composition from zzso to zzso zzso was only observed in zzso zzso 

zzso transformation is associated with altered zzso zzso Net and zzso zzso Whereas the onset of zzso expression of various zzso family members became already manifest during the zzso state, a shift in zzso complex composition appeared a rather late event associated with zzso
