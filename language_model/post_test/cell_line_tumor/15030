Previous models for predicting tumor cell growth are mostly based on zzso of total cell zzso The purpose of this paper is to provide a new simple mathematical model for calculating tumor cell growth focusing on the fraction of cells that is zzso The zzso cells are considered to be relatively zzso We performed a number of different types of zzso a long-term drug zzso several zzso time experiments and zzso experiments, in which human zzso breast cancer cells were exposed to zzso and the total number of cells were zzso In the latter two types, at every measurement point a zzso efficiency experiment was zzso The final number of colonies formed is equal to the number of zzso cells at the onset of the zzso Based on the zzso drug zzso our model predicts cell culture effects taking zzso ability and growth zzso by neighboring cells into zzso The model fitted well to the experimental zzso The estimated damage zzso which represents the chance of an zzso cell to become zzso per unit time and per unit zzso zzso concentration was found to be zzso zzso The model could be used to calculate the effect of every zzso concentration versus time zzso zzso Although in zzso parameters may well be different from those found in zzso the model can be used to predict trends, zzso by comparing effects of different in zzso zzso zzso
