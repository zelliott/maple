zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso signaling zzso occurs frequently in human cancer cells and may subsequently affect the cell survival towards zzso zzso To zzso the effect of long-term zzso treatment on the zzso of human cancer cells, human zzso zzso zzso cells (AP) were incubated continuously with 50 zzso zzso for 30 weeks and these cells were designated as the zzso zzso The long-term zzso treatment did not alter the zzso level and the zzso protein zzso zzso pattern in the zzso zzso By zzso zzso the zzso cells were shown to be more resistant than the zzso cells to zzso zzso and zzso but not to zzso Among the drug-resistant zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in the zzso cells while there was no apparent change in the levels of zzso zzso or zzso zzso as compared to the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased the sensitivity to zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso from the present study support an idea that long-term treatment with zzso may induce drug resistance in cells through the zzso of zzso
