zzso is an inhibitor of zzso and its over expression is associated with poor prognosis in several zzso several studies have analyzed zzso expression in zzso zzso cell zzso few have focused on zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso The purpose of this study was 1) to determine the degree of zzso up regulation in samples of zzso and zzso 2) to evaluate if zzso expression in zzso and CASE zzso with recurrence and/or death, and 3) to examine the effect of zzso zzso on zzso in zzso zzso 

Fresh frozen samples of zzso and CASE from the same patient were used for zzso and Western zzso analysis, and zzso zzso tissue was used for zzso zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso were zzso with small interfering zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso This was confirmed by zzso for zzso expression and Western zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 and zzso zzso expression data was correlated with clinical zzso 

zzso expression was significantly higher in zzso tumor samples compared to the CASE from the same zzso Patients with high expression of zzso in zzso tumor had an increased risk of zzso zzso expression was also noted in CASE and correlated with increased risk of distant zzso Cell line evaluation demonstrated that zzso of zzso resulted in an increase in zzso 

Higher expression of zzso in tumor tissue was associated with increased risk of zzso while zzso expression in CASE was a superior predictor of zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cell lines further showed increased zzso supporting the potential benefits of therapeutic strategies targeted to this zzso
