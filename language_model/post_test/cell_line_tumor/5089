Although carbon zzso zzso are increasingly used, their biological effects are only incompletely zzso However, experimental evidence suggests that the zzso zzso of zzso causes the formation of zzso zzso and progressive pulmonary zzso in zzso Using human zzso zzso cells as a model of airway zzso in zzso we have recently reported that the exposure to commercial zzso zzso zzso causes a progressive decrease of the zzso electrical resistance zzso pointing to a zzso impairment of the zzso barrier zzso To characterize better this behavior, we compared the effects of two types of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of different lengths on the zzso of zzso zzso All the materials were used at a dose of 100 zzso corresponding to an exposure of 73 zzso of cell zzso Only the longer zzso and zzso cause a significant decrease in zzso To zzso the mechanism underlying the changes in barrier function, the expression of the junction proteins zzso and zzso has been also zzso No significant decrease in the zzso for either protein is zzso after the exposure to any type of zzso It is concluded that the impairment of barrier function in zzso zzso is a peculiar effect of zzso endowed with clear cut fiber properties and is not zzso to marked changes in the expression of junction zzso
