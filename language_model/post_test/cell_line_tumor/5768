zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso mediates DNA replication of terminal repeat zzso DNA to enable viral zzso persistence in zzso infected zzso Southern zzso is routinely used to detect zzso zzso We developed and validated a real-time zzso zzso for zzso DNA and compared it with Southern zzso zzso Both zzso and Southern zzso detected zzso DNA, but the zzso zzso was more rapid and did not require zzso zzso detection at 24 and 72 hours zzso demonstrated rapid loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso and to a lesser extent a moderately deficient zzso zzso reduced the rate of DNA loss through addition of zzso zzso DNA and reduction in the loss of zzso DNA, the latter of which is consistent with zzso nuclear segregation zzso zzso this work develops a zzso sensitive, and quantitative zzso zzso zzso to detect zzso zzso DNA and demonstrates that zzso reduces zzso DNA loss after zzso through replication and nuclear zzso of zzso zzso
