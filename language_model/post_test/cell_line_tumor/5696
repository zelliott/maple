As a primary drug for the treatment of acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso of zzso zzso into red blood cells zzso has been popular to circumvent zzso from the zzso zzso Unlike existing methods that zzso zzso zzso we introduce a novel method of zzso of proteins using the zzso low molecular weight zzso zzso zzso study of zzso zzso as a model protein zzso has shown significant zzso inside zzso Surface zzso by scanning electron zzso of the zzso loaded with zzso was indistinguishable with normal zzso These drug loaded zzso also closely resembled the profile of the native zzso in terms of zzso zzso oxygen zzso and zzso zzso The in zzso zzso of zzso activity after administering 8 units of zzso in zzso mice was prolonged to zzso days whereas that of zzso loaded with zzso via a zzso method was zzso zzso Furthermore, the mean survival time of zzso mice bearing mouse zzso cell zzso was improved by approximately zzso compared to the saline control group after treatment with the zzso loaded zzso From these data, an innovative, novel method for zzso proteins into intact and fully functional zzso was established for potential treatment of zzso
