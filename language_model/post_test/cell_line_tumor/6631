zzso of zzso and gene amplification of zzso are frequently detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso provide a cell survival signal that may zzso resistance to zzso induced by conventional therapies in cancer zzso zzso development of potent zzso that block zzso zzso is an attractive therapeutic strategy for treating zzso zzso 

zzso cancer cell lines, zzso zzso zzso zzso and normal zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso were treated with different doses of a zzso small zzso compound, zzso zzso zzso zzso that potentially inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were examined in treated and zzso cell zzso Further, cells treated with zzso were analyzed for induction of zzso using zzso profile with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso inhibited zzso zzso activity but did not inhibit zzso or zzso zzso activities in zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso did not reduce zzso of other protein zzso in these cell zzso zzso induced zzso and the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso cancer cell lines that express elevated levels of zzso zzso In contrast, in zzso and zzso cell lines, which lack zzso zzso activity, zzso only had minimal effect to induce zzso 

These data suggest that zzso may be a potent agent to target zzso activated zzso zzso in zzso cancer zzso
