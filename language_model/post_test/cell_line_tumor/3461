zzso is associated with tumor aggressiveness and is an important cause of resistance to radiation therapy and zzso zzso of tumor zzso could provide selection tools for zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to develop and characterize a zzso tumor model with a reporter gene construct that would be zzso by the zzso molecular switch, zzso the zzso of zzso 

The reporter gene construct is the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso fused with the enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso under the regulation of an artificial zzso zzso In this model, tumor zzso would zzso zzso and through the zzso promoter zzso the zzso fusion zzso The expression of this reporter gene can be assessed with the zzso reporter zzso zzso zzso which is zzso by the zzso zzso and trapped in the hypoxic zzso Animal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso plate imaging zzso were used in this study to zzso the trapped zzso providing a distribution of the zzso molecular zzso The distribution of zzso was also compared with that of an zzso hypoxic cell marker, zzso zzso 

Our results showed that zzso zzso imaging of the zzso reporter gene expression is zzso and that the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso are zzso In tumor zzso detailed zzso zzso were obtained with zzso which also showed similarity between zzso and zzso 

This reporter system is sufficiently sensitive to detect zzso zzso zzso by zzso imaging and might provide a valuable tool in studying tumor zzso and in zzso existing and future zzso markers for tumor zzso
