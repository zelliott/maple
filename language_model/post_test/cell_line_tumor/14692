zzso zzso and structurally related zzso have zzso zzso properties that appear to be at least partially zzso by zzso zzso zzso that form zzso zzso Based on their structural similarities, we tested the hypothesis that zzso of simple zzso compounds such as zzso might also possess zzso zzso Our results show that the zzso particularly zzso protected rat zzso zzso and a zzso cell line from zzso loss and toxicity induced by zzso an zzso zzso zzso The zzso compounds also provided substantial zzso against toxicity induced by hydrogen zzso in a cellular model of zzso zzso zzso chemical characterization in zzso systems indicated that the zzso compounds acted as surrogate zzso targets that slowed the rate of zzso loss caused by zzso Although the selected zzso zzso did not zzso free zzso metal zzso zzso was a significant property of both zzso and zzso Our data suggest that the zzso zzso represent a new class of zzso that zzso zzso metal zzso and zzso zzso through their zzso zzso zzso As such, these zzso might be rational candidates for treatment of acute or chronic neurodegenerative conditions that have zzso stress as a common molecular zzso
