Comparative zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso is a method for zzso detection of zzso aberrations in DNA zzso Recent advances in zzso technology have improved zzso by replacing zzso zzso with a collection of mapped zzso clones placed on glass zzso However, it is quite expensive and zzso to prepare DNA from the zzso clones for use in constructing zzso zzso Here we used zzso rolling circle amplification zzso to manufacture zzso zzso by using a collection of about 4,500 mapped zzso zzso clones that cover the human zzso at approximately a zzso zzso These zzso zzso detected all major zzso aberrations in cancer cells lines and in cell lines with zzso In this article, we discuss the advantages of using RCA for the manufacturing of large zzso zzso
