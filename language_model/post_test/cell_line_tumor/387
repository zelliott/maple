zzso a zzso zzso zzso containing zzso is in clinical development for the treatment of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in tumor tissue of zzso is investigated by using zzso zzso is modified through the attachment of a zzso acid zzso to bind zzso This modification does not affect the particle size and minimally affects the surface charge of the resulting zzso PET data from zzso zzso are used to zzso the in zzso zzso in mice bearing zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso displays a zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso of the injected dose is rapidly cleared as a zzso fraction through the zzso The remaining material zzso in plasma with a terminal zzso of zzso zzso zzso increasing zzso up to zzso injected dose per zzso are observed in the tumor over 24 zzso higher than any other tissue at that zzso A zzso model is used to determine vascular zzso and zzso retention in tumors, and is able to accurately represent the experimental zzso The calculated tumor vascular zzso indicates that the majority of zzso stay intact in circulation and do not zzso into individual zzso zzso A key assumption to modeling the tumor dynamics is that there is a zzso for the zzso within the zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso show that zzso zzso within tumor cells and provides the sink in the tumor for the zzso
