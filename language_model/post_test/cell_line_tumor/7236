zzso zzso is a zzso protein widely used in the therapy of several zzso such as zzso zzso cell zzso zzso cervical and head and neck zzso and zzso zzso the first zzso to be produced by zzso DNA technology, has emerged as an important regulator of cancer cell growth and zzso affecting cellular communication and signal zzso zzso However, the way by which zzso cell growth is directly suppressed by zzso is not well zzso Wide evidence exists on the possibility that cancer cells undergo zzso after the exposure to the zzso Here we will review the consolidate Signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso mechanism of action of zzso and the supposed mechanism of zzso induction by zzso We will discuss data obtained by us and others on the triggering of the zzso zzso zzso and on the zzso of protein synthesis machinery induced by zzso and their correlations with the zzso zzso Until today, inconsistent data have been obtained regarding the clinical effectiveness of zzso in the therapy of solid zzso In fact, the benefit of zzso treatment is limited to some zzso while others are completely or partially zzso The mechanisms of zzso resistance to zzso have been studied in zzso The zzso of zzso Signal zzso and zzso of zzso components of the zzso zzso can be indeed a mechanism of resistance to zzso and cross talks between zzso and survival signals has been also zzso However, we have recently described a zzso mechanism of protection of zzso cells from the zzso induced by zzso dependent on the zzso growth factor zzso zzso signal regulated zzso zzso zzso The involvement of the zzso zzso in the protection of zzso cells from the zzso induced by zzso is further demonstrated by both Ras zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso signal regulated zzso 1 zzso zzso by exposure to zzso These data strongly suggest that the specific disruption of the latter could be a useful approach to zzso the zzso activity of zzso against human zzso based on the new zzso insights achieved in the last zzso
