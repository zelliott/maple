Secondary zzso of the T cell zzso zzso represent a genetic correction mechanism which changes T cell specificity by zzso zzso zzso in peripheral T zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was employed to investigate whether zzso stimulation induced zzso of zzso genes and altered zzso zzso zzso Following repeated zzso zzso zzso cells were induced to zzso zzso zzso gene zzso and terminal zzso zzso zzso which are generally considered prerequisite to zzso gene zzso zzso with the significant changes in zzso zzso levels over time, it is suggested that secondary zzso may be induced in zzso cells, which represent a mature T cell clone capable of zzso zzso genes and possesses the prerequisite for secondary zzso zzso
