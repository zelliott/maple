zzso 6 zzso is a growth and survival factor for multiple myeloma zzso As we report here, the zzso human myeloma cell line zzso responds with a remarkably rapid and complete zzso to zzso zzso Among the zzso members of the zzso zzso zzso family of zzso regulators, only zzso cell zzso zzso was slightly induced by zzso zzso studies demonstrated, however, that zzso does not exert its survival effect primarily through this zzso The zzso signal zzso pathways required for survival and the target genes controlled by them were analyzed by using zzso zzso zzso The zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso turned out to be obligatory for the survival of zzso zzso The same held true for survival and growth of zzso myeloma zzso Gene expression profiling of zzso cells by using zzso zzso revealed many novel zzso target zzso among them several genes coding for zzso regulators involved in zzso differentiation as well as for growth factors and receptors potentially implicated in zzso or zzso growth zzso zzso of most zzso target genes required the zzso of zzso zzso its central role for zzso signal zzso Taken together, our data provide evidence for the existence of an as yet unknown zzso survival zzso in myeloma zzso
