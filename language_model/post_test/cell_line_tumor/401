Our previous studies revealed that zzso induced zzso inhibitor 1 zzso which was reported to be essential in mouse definitive zzso was related to zzso resistance in gastric cancer cells and that the distribution of zzso in normal human zzso was similar to the distribution of zzso This study aimed to explore whether zzso plays a role in gastric zzso zzso of zzso in normal, inflammatory gastric zzso gastric zzso zzso and gastric zzso was detected by zzso and western zzso and, influence of zzso on the proliferation of gastric cancer cells was investigated by zzso expression of zzso and zzso interference zzso Our zzso results demonstrated that the expression of zzso in gastric zzso zzso was progressively reduced along the sequence of zzso gastric zzso zzso The zzso of zzso in zzso zzso was further confirmed by western zzso No relationship between the expression level of zzso and the zzso parameters such as age, zzso zzso zzso stage and the existence of zzso was found in gastric cancer zzso In in zzso cellular experiments, zzso expression of zzso by zzso zzso resulted in suppression of cell proliferation and zzso of cell cycle progression while zzso of zzso with zzso accelerated cell proliferation and promoted cell cycle progression in zzso and zzso gastric cancer zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso expression may contribute to gastric zzso by accelerating cell proliferation and promoting cell cycle zzso
