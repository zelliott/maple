zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the most common zzso to arise in the zzso zzso yet very little is known of the genetic zzso that are involved in the zzso of this zzso To further examine the genetic changes that zzso zzso we analyzed zzso DNA obtained from 22 primary zzso and two zzso cell lines by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Human zzso zzso zzso zzso calls were analyzed by the zzso Correction version of the zzso zzso Hidden zzso Model to determine loss of zzso using information derived only from tumor zzso zzso of data obtained from matched zzso samples suggested that only deletion calls of zzso zzso were zzso Within these zzso zzso samples revealed a mean of three deletions per zzso and no consensus areas of deletion were observed across the majority of zzso Similarly, copy number analysis of primary zzso data revealed no consensus areas of gene zzso This is in contrast to a much higher rate of zzso zzso detected in a cohort of zzso zzso analyzed by the same zzso Our data show that most zzso have predominantly stable zzso which is consistent with the theory that zzso crisis does not play a significant role in early stages of zzso tumor zzso Our data suggest that gene zzso and/or zzso events that cannot be detected by zzso of gross zzso of zzso structure are likely to zzso the zzso transformation events of this tumor zzso
