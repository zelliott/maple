The function of zzso one of the four ABC zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso is still zzso The finding that zzso zzso partially corrected very zzso fatty acid zzso defects in zzso of zzso zzso patients, has unveiled its potential clinical zzso prompting us to set up a model system to study zzso zzso We used the zzso interference technique, a powerful approach to zzso gene expression analysis, to zzso the zzso gene in the rat zzso zzso cell line, since zzso could represent the target tissue of zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso with a zzso for zzso interference generating small interfering zzso that specifically target the zzso zzso By using a zzso version of the zzso we generated a stable cell line zzso in which we observed a stable decrease of zzso protein expression greater than zzso We thus examined the effect of zzso zzso on zzso and zzso acids zzso and we found that in zzso cells the rate of zzso and zzso zzso activities were both reduced about one-third compared with control zzso The zzso membrane potential, determined by zzso analysis, was also zzso zzso and fatty acid analyses of zzso cells showed an increase of zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso These results add another clue about the overlapping function of zzso and zzso the zzso protein involved in zzso zzso since zzso is the zzso marker of the disease and in the brain zzso it is accumulated in the zzso zzso zzso as a whole, our results indicate that the zzso cell line is a valuable tool to further study the function of zzso and eventually its role in zzso zzso
