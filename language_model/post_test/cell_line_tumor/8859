The zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso pumps that transport zzso across both zzso and plasma zzso Previous studies have implicated zzso in the zzso of various cancer cell zzso In this study, we evaluated the role of zzso in the zzso of two closely matched human breast cancer zzso zzso cells are a zzso immortalized breast zzso cell line, and zzso cells are a highly zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells selected for their zzso zzso Using an in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells showed a much higher invasion than the parental zzso zzso Moreover, this increased invasion was completely sensitive to the specific zzso inhibitor zzso zzso cells expressed much higher levels of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso relative to the parental zzso zzso of zzso a are responsible for zzso zzso of zzso with zzso and zzso targeting zzso to the plasma membrane of specialized zzso zzso of either zzso alone or zzso and zzso together using zzso zzso inhibited invasion by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso but not the other a zzso zzso greatly increased the zzso of the parental zzso zzso Similarly, zzso of zzso significantly increased expression of zzso at the plasma zzso These studies suggest that breast tumor cells employ particular a zzso zzso to target zzso to the plasma zzso where they function in tumor cell zzso
