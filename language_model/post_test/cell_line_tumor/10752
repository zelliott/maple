The Lutheran blood group zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is also known as zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso is a specific zzso for zzso zzso a major component of basement zzso in various zzso Previous reports have shown that zzso binding to zzso zzso contributes to zzso cell zzso However, as there are no useful tools such as zzso zzso or drugs, it is unclear how zzso and zzso red blood cells adhere to zzso zzso via zzso 

In this study, we discovered a zzso zzso that zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso using a unique binding zzso on tissue zzso To characterize the zzso zzso we identified the site on zzso recognized by this zzso The zzso domain of zzso contains five zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was localized to zzso but not to the D3 domain containing the major part of the zzso zzso binding zzso Furthermore, zzso studies showed that zzso the zzso blood group zzso site, was crucial for forming the zzso and the zzso bound sufficiently close to zzso hinder the interaction with zzso Cell zzso zzso using the zzso also showed that zzso serves as a secondary zzso for the zzso of zzso cells to zzso zzso 

This zzso zzso against zzso should be useful for not only investigating cell zzso to zzso zzso but also for developing drugs to inhibit zzso cell zzso
