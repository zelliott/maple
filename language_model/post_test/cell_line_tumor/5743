zzso zzso of zzso zzso often results in tumor recurrence due to zzso tumor zzso zzso new therapeutic strategies are urgently zzso The aim of this study was to establish an zzso human zzso zzso mouse model using the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso and to compare therapeutic efficacy of zzso instilled zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso 

Female Swiss zzso mice were zzso zzso with zzso zzso human zzso zzso cells after the induction of zzso zzso by zzso At different time points after cell zzso mice were treated zzso with zzso zzso C, or zzso zzso zzso development and therapeutic response were evaluated via zzso zzso 

Mice without therapy and those treated with zzso zzso reached a median survival of 41 d and 89 zzso zzso Mice that underwent therapy with zzso zzso of zzso 1 zzso 7 zzso or 14 d after cell zzso survived more than 300 d in zzso zzso and zzso of the cases, zzso zzso with zzso zzso 1 h or 7 d after tumor cell zzso resulted in survival of more than 300 d in zzso and 50% of mice, zzso zzso C treatment after 1 h and 7 d prolonged survival to more than 300 d in zzso and zzso zzso however, treatment turned out to be zzso In contrast, no signs of zzso could be observed after zzso zzso 

The study suggests that zzso using zzso instilled zzso is a promising option for treatment of zzso cancer in zzso
