The expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso differs between zzso and cultured cell lines in that zzso is the major zzso in established cell lines, whereas zzso zzso in liver and most other human zzso zzso is zzso less active than zzso but is a main zzso of zzso insulin action and is selectively zzso by zzso zzso X zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso which displays deficient expression in zzso cell zzso In the present paper, we show that zzso expression is also deficient in zzso cells and in a human brown zzso cell line zzso In transient zzso studies, zzso selectively amplified the zzso zzso from the human zzso promoter in zzso and zzso cells via two zzso elements with extensive similarity to the respective zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the human zzso zzso zzso was essential for zzso of zzso zzso gene zzso by zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells enhanced zzso zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso zzso zzso but only zzso expression was zzso further in an zzso zzso X zzso fashion, thereby inducing zzso abundance levels of zzso target zzso fatty acid zzso and zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso contributes to the regulation of zzso gene zzso and can restore the zzso zzso expression pattern of zzso cells to that of human zzso
