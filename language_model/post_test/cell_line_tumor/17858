zzso class I zzso zzso A zzso is one of the major zzso for zzso zzso zzso which is expressed on zzso cells and zzso T zzso The release and sustained expression of zzso protein can impair zzso zzso activity by reducing zzso zzso on immune zzso zzso The aim of the study was to investigate the expression and release of zzso in human zzso zzso zzso western zzso and flow zzso were used in analyzing the expression of zzso zzso level of soluble zzso was zzso by zzso Our data showed that zzso is zzso expressed in zzso both in zzso and protein zzso zzso of zzso was found in zzso compared with benign tumors and normal bone zzso Higher level of soluble zzso in serum can be detected in zzso zzso In conclusion, prevalent expression of zzso and higher serum level of soluble zzso may suggest a zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso on immune zzso cells may contribute to a therapeutic strategy for human zzso
