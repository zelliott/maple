zzso response element binding protein zzso is a zzso factor that activates liver zzso and zzso zzso genes in response to high zzso zzso Here we report the zzso regulatory mechanisms for the rat zzso zzso zzso we determined the zzso initiation site and the zzso sequences of the rat zzso promoter region encompassing approximately zzso from the zzso initiation zzso zzso gene zzso demonstrated that the major positive regulatory region exists in the zzso sequence between zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso This region contains a cluster of putative zzso factor binding elements that consist of two specificity protein 1 zzso binding sites zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso a zzso regulatory element zzso to zzso and two nuclear zzso zzso binding sites zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso introduced into these sites caused marked reduction of zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso were observed between zzso and zzso regulatory zzso zzso Additionally, zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that these factors bound to these zzso Thus, we conclude that functional zzso between these zzso factors are critical for zzso gene zzso
