zzso 14 zzso has been proposed as a useful zzso marker in prostate cancer, with expression reported to be associated with zzso characteristics such as higher stage and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression has also shown the potential to predict prostate cancer patients at risk of disease recurrence after radical zzso The zzso are a remarkably zzso family of zzso although detailed studies of zzso regulation of zzso in prostate cancer have not been undertaken to zzso Using in zzso studies, we have demonstrated that unlike many other zzso zzso genes that are strictly zzso responsive, zzso is more broadly expressed and zzso zzso regulated in prostate cancer zzso Given these results and evidence that zzso may play a role in prostate cancer zzso we also investigated whether common genetic zzso in the zzso locus are associated with risk and/or aggressiveness of prostate cancer in approximately 1200 prostate cancer cases and zzso male zzso Of 41 single zzso zzso zzso three were associated with higher zzso score zzso zzso and zzso both located upstream of zzso and zzso which encodes a zzso substitution in the zzso signal zzso zzso Our findings provide further support for zzso as a marker of prognosis in prostate zzso
