zzso zzso is reported to be zzso expressed in the mouse brain, but its functional significance is not fully zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso zzso also rich in mouse brain, is zzso during zzso differentiation with involvement in acceleration of zzso zzso To zzso zzso functions of zzso as well as zzso we determined expression during mouse brain development by quantitative zzso zzso was relatively low in the embryonic stage and then rapidly increased at zzso days after birth, whereas zzso demonstrated high levels in the embryonic stage and zzso after zzso zzso zzso was found to possess two zzso differing in expression levels, zzso pattern, and zzso zzso zzso from the human zzso the zzso forms, to a different extent, both zzso the removal of zzso acid from zzso as well as zzso and one zzso seemed to act on zzso zzso zzso despite the low activity toward ordinary zzso In zzso zzso demonstrated zzso zzso to be present mainly in the zzso in which zzso is rich and decreases after zzso During zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in suppression of zzso formation, and its zzso showed the zzso Thin layer zzso of the zzso from zzso cells showed zzso compositions to be only slightly affected, although zzso zzso analysis revealed increased binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of a approximately zzso zzso which decreased with cell zzso These results suggest that mouse zzso plays an important regulatory role in zzso formation, possibly through zzso of zzso
