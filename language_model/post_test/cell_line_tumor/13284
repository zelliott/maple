zzso an extract from zzso zzso exhibits broad zzso of growth and zzso activity in a number of tumor zzso However, the underlying mechanism involved remains zzso To investigate the effects and mechanisms of zzso on zzso zzso zzso we performed experiments on zzso zzso zzso and zzso human zzso and zzso human zzso zzso We observed that zzso significantly inhibited the viability of human zzso cells in a zzso and zzso manner, but did not affect human zzso Due to their highly zzso and zzso nature, we selected zzso cells as a model system to zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso cell growth by causing cell cycle arrest at the zzso phase and the induction of zzso zzso of zzso phase was accompanied by a decrease in zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso and an increase in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso enhanced the zzso of zzso cells with the induction of the zzso of zzso and the zzso of zzso whereas the zzso zzso and zzso remained almost zzso These changes were accompanied by the enhanced zzso zzso of nuclear factor zzso zzso with a zzso decrease in the nuclear zzso zzso zzso also zzso the zzso effects of zzso in zzso and in zzso in part, by restricting the zzso nuclear zzso of zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso may be an important agent against zzso via directly zzso zzso cell growth and enhancing the responsiveness of zzso cells to zzso
