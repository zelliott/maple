zzso is the primary mechanism for the clearance of Group B zzso zzso by the host, and levels of zzso zzso may correlate with protection in zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso can be used to determine the functional activity of zzso zzso zzso The zzso which measures the number of bacterial colonies surviving zzso killing in the presence of specific zzso and complement, is rather expensive, time-consuming and poorly zzso Here we describe a zzso sensitive and zzso fluorescent zzso zzso zzso based on flow zzso analysis zzso which allows zzso bacteria to be distinguished from those associated to the plasma membrane of zzso zzso zzso zzso were labeled with zzso a fluorescent dye which dramatically increases the zzso zzso at the zzso conditions present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria were incubated with zzso cells differentiated to zzso zzso and complement, and then analyzed by zzso A further improvement to our method, allowing to reduce zzso zzso consisted on a step of selection of zzso cells among the zzso zzso Analysis of zzso from mice zzso with different zzso vaccines revealed comparable sensitivity and specificity with the traditional killing zzso zzso zzso and a good correlation between the fluorescent signal of bacteria zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso approach reduced the zzso observed with other zzso zzso The obtained data indicate the proposed zzso as a reliable and useful tool for functional zzso zzso
