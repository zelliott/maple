zzso cellular transport of zzso acid zzso and its zzso product zzso zzso is assured through specific zzso It was shown that vitamin C is taken up as zzso by most cell types, including cancer cells, via the zzso zzso zzso Thus, AA zzso to zzso can be considered a mechanism favoring vitamin C zzso and zzso zzso We have investigated whether such an zzso action might be provided by plasma membrane zzso zzso previously shown to function as an zzso source of zzso The process was studied using two distinct human zzso melanoma zzso It was observed that the zzso zzso expressing high levels of membrane zzso activity, was capable of zzso the zzso of zzso zzso accompanied by a marked increase of zzso AA zzso The phenomenon was not observed with zzso cells, possessing only traces of membrane zzso On the other hand, AA zzso and stimulation of cellular zzso were indeed observed after zzso of zzso cells with zzso coding for zzso The mechanism of zzso AA zzso was investigated in zzso systems, including zzso and its zzso zzso The process was observed in the presence of zzso zzso zzso and of zzso or zzso zzso two zzso iron zzso Thus, membrane zzso zzso expressed at high levels in human zzso zzso zzso AA and promote its zzso zzso
