zzso zzso play an increasingly important role in biological labeling and imaging zzso However, preserving their useful properties in an zzso biological environment remains challenging, even more as zzso zzso have to be long-time stable, zzso and zzso For in zzso applications, size control is crucial in order to route zzso zzso zzso zzso clearance zzso zzso zzso Equally necessary, cellular and tissue specific targeting demands suitable zzso chemistry for surface zzso with affinity zzso like zzso zzso carbohydrates and zzso zzso we report a three stage zzso process for zzso comprised of zzso a partial zzso exchange by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a precisely tuned zzso zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso chains zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso radical zzso of the adjacent zzso zzso As a result, zzso zzso were zzso which virtually maintained their primal physical properties and were exceptionally stable in biological zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with numerous functional groups was mostly straightforward by chain termination of the living zzso zzso zzso with the respective zzso More complex affinity zzso zzso carbohydrates or zzso were introduced in a zzso process, prior to zzso zzso zzso this zzso approach opens up rapid access to precisely tuned zzso zzso just by using zzso of diverse functional zzso zzso in a zzso zzso All zzso showed no toxicity from zzso to 1 zzso zzso zzso in standard zzso and zzso zzso on zzso cells, as well as only marginal unspecific cellular zzso even in zzso zzso
