zzso zzso 2 zzso has been implicated in the zzso of airway zzso We report that zzso zzso stimulation with zzso zzso zzso or an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso h zzso and zzso enhanced zzso zzso to zzso type II zzso cells zzso zzso and that this stimulation also induced the formation of zzso zzso zzso Both responses in zzso zzso and zzso zzso reorganization were reduced by a zzso zzso zzso and by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso adherence was also inhibited by an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso D and a zzso zzso zzso zzso Further, the zzso zzso zzso of focal zzso zzso zzso a major zzso zzso was zzso and this response was inhibited by zzso or zzso These results suggest that zzso stimulation of zzso zzso cells enhances zzso zzso presumably at least in part through zzso zzso zzso zzso reorganization associated with the zzso zzso of zzso
