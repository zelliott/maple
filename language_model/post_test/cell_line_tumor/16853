Aurora zzso are zzso in many zzso and are targets for zzso zzso The zzso zzso of Aurora B zzso zzso was found to be a zzso zzso zzso Given that zzso is a common feature of many zzso we hypothesized zzso also zzso zzso cells to zzso of Aurora zzso Using two models of apparent zzso zzso zzso cell lines (one based on the zzso zzso cell line zzso and another on zzso mouse zzso we found that zzso cells were more sensitive to Aurora B zzso than their zzso zzso zzso could be induced in zzso cells by two different Aurora B zzso Furthermore, zzso cells were sensitive to Aurora B zzso but were not affected by Aurora A zzso Interestingly, the underlying mechanism was due to zzso zzso and the subsequent excessive zzso zzso In support of this, abolition of zzso with zzso B resulted in similar effects on zzso cells as Aurora B zzso These results indicate that zzso of Aurora B or zzso can promote zzso effectively in zzso cancer zzso
