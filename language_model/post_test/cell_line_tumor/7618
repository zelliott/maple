To maintain growth and division, cells require a large-scale production of zzso which occurs in the zzso Recently, we have shown the interaction of zzso zzso zzso zzso with proteins involved in zzso zzso and processing, namely zzso zzso I zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here we extend the study by investigating zzso zzso of zzso in regards to zzso and processing complexes of Pol zzso To achieve this, we used either zzso zzso of zzso during zzso or zzso by treatment the cells with zzso D zzso or zzso zzso We show that zzso is associated with Pol I zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso is dependent on the production of zzso These results indicate that zzso is required not only during zzso production and zzso as we have shown before, but also plays a structural role as an anchor for the Pol I zzso complex during the cell zzso We suggest that throughout zzso zzso together with zzso is involved in forming and maintaining the core platform of the zzso zzso zzso Thus we introduce zzso as a novel component of the zzso complex, which is further engaged in the renewed zzso synthesis upon exit from zzso
