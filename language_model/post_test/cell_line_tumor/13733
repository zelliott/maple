To investigate the possibility of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso interference zzso and its influence on cell zzso in the zzso zzso acute zzso leukemia cell line zzso a zzso zzso zzso a short hairpin zzso zzso targeted against zzso zzso was constructed and zzso into the packaging cells zzso and the viral zzso was collected to zzso zzso zzso zzso real-time fluorescent zzso and western zzso were used to detect the expression levels of zzso zzso zzso and detection of zzso activity of zzso by western zzso were employed to examine cell zzso Our results provide evidence that the zzso zzso zzso was constructed zzso and the zzso zzso and the protein expression zzso rates were zzso and zzso zzso When compared to the control group, the activity of zzso decreased significantly, which showed a zzso zzso and the zzso rate was reduced by zzso ( zzso In conclusion, zzso of the zzso gene may inhibit zzso of zzso cells, and it is speculated that this was at least partly due to the zzso of zzso and zzso may be a novel target for gene therapy for zzso zzso acute zzso zzso
