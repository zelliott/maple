zzso zzso is a zzso member of the zzso gene zzso expressed on zzso cells, zzso and most zzso This report demonstrates by Western zzso and zzso that some human melanoma and zzso cell lines express zzso on the cell zzso The surface expression of zzso was regulated by zzso zzso being higher on sparse and spontaneously detached zzso Indeed, fixing and zzso tumor cells revealed a zzso pool, which was confirmed by zzso zzso Some of the plasma surface zzso is zzso following zzso zzso zzso of zzso on tumor cells via zzso inhibited proliferation by inducing cell zzso On the other hand, zzso does not increase zzso zzso Overall, these results indicate that there is an zzso pool of zzso on some tumor cells, which zzso zzso surface expression and its role in cancer cell growth and zzso Thus, the expression of zzso and its role in cell survival in some tumor cells appears to differ from zzso zzso
