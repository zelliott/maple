zzso zzso is an zzso breast zzso zzso identified by zzso analysis of zzso expression library zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso cells from two breast cancer patients zzso a zzso zzso response to zzso zzso In both patients, an zzso response to zzso was also zzso By contrast, a zzso patient and a zzso zzso patient demonstrated no such zzso zzso Analysis of human breast zzso for zzso zzso and protein expression revealed the presence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso was detected in the zzso and at the cell surface of different human breast zzso cell zzso zzso analysis of zzso archival primary breast zzso showed the expression of zzso in zzso of the zzso When the zzso findings were compared against zzso information associated with each zzso an inverse relationship between zzso and zzso D expression was observed zzso Furthermore, even though long-term survival was similar between zzso and zzso cases, the survival of zzso cases improved when a zzso zzso was present at the zzso zzso Taken together, our findings of an zzso immunity and the improved survival associated with zzso expression in the presence of zzso zzso point to a role of zzso in zzso zzso
