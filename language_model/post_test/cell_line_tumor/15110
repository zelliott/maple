Recent studies have demonstrated that natural water that has zzso of the zzso concentration zzso can exhibit zzso zzso However, the zzso effects of zzso on various zzso zzso zzso cells have not previously been zzso In the present study, zzso cell lines and normal zzso zzso cells were grown in zzso media containing different zzso zzso zzso zzso The effects of zzso on the proliferation and migration of zzso and zzso cells were investigated using the zzso plate colony formation, and zzso zzso as well as zzso chamber zzso flow zzso zzso western zzso and zzso We found that zzso was an effective inhibitor of zzso cell zzso zzso colony formation, migration and zzso In contrast, the growth of normal zzso zzso cells was promoted when they were cultured in the presence of zzso Cell cycle analysis revealed that zzso caused cell cycle arrest in the zzso transition, reduced the number of cells in the S phase and significantly increased the population of cells in the zzso phase in zzso zzso Western zzso analysis revealed that treatment with zzso significantly increased the expression of zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso analysis revealed that treatment with zzso decreased the expression of zzso and zzso zzso 9 zzso in zzso zzso These results demonstrated that zzso is a novel, zzso zzso therapeutic agent that suppresses zzso cell zzso migration, and invasion by inducing the expression of zzso and causing cell cycle arrest, as well as decreasing zzso and zzso zzso
