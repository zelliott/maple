The zzso a zzso complex formed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso functions as the core of the zzso zzso acting as the molecular platform for the assembly of higher order complexes and zzso zzso between various protein zzso Within the zzso there are two zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso They can form zzso that bind to the zzso zzso DNA, an activity that is central for zzso end capping and zzso zzso Through zzso zzso we found that in addition to zzso zzso can associate with another zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso is zzso which plays a critical role in zzso zzso We show here that zzso can zzso to zzso in human cells and bind to zzso zzso DNA in zzso Furthermore, zzso of an zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso in human cells, implicating zzso in zzso length zzso Taken together, our studies suggest that zzso represents a new player in the zzso zzso for zzso zzso
