The zzso characterization and biological activity of the first zzso complexes with potent zzso of zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso are zzso Based on the results following from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mass zzso in the positive zzso zzso zzso zzso data, zzso analysis and X-ray structures, the zzso zzso complexes of the compositions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso have been prepared, where zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso chain structure for zzso zzso as well as the zzso one for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso have been revealed zzso by single crystal X-ray zzso The zzso chain of 1 consists of zzso zzso units in which the zzso zzso is coordinated by two chlorine atoms and one oxygen atom of the zzso group of zzso The next zzso unit is bonded to zzso through the zzso atom of a zzso zzso Thus, each of zzso zzso is zzso coordinated and a zzso zzso occurs in the complex zzso The complexes 3 and 4 are zzso species with a distorted zzso arrangement of donor atoms around the zzso zzso with a zzso zzso The corresponding zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso is coordinated to zzso via the zzso atom of the zzso ring in 3 and zzso The zzso of the zzso complexes against human melanoma, zzso zzso and zzso cell lines has been determined as well as the zzso of the zzso E zzso A relationship between the structure and biological activity of the complexes is also zzso
