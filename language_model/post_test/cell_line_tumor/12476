We studied the zzso status of the zzso and zzso genes in 47 pediatric patients with primary zzso its correlation with zzso and the role of zzso and zzso in the evolution of zzso toward zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene was detected in 15 of 47 patients zzso whereas only four patients demonstrated zzso of the zzso gene zzso The frequency of zzso zzso was significantly higher in zzso and zzso zzso ( zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene was also more frequent in the zzso that characterize advanced stages of the disease ( zzso Evolution of disease was verified in 17 zzso of the 47 zzso The association of zzso and zzso zzso status with evolution of disease was clearly significant ( zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso of the zzso and zzso genes is an zzso zzso of pediatric disease zzso
