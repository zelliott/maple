Cell migration through zzso zzso or cell invasion, is a fundamental zzso process during zzso zzso Cell invasion usually requires cell zzso to the zzso zzso through zzso In some tumors, increased zzso expression is associated with increased zzso and zzso zzso Here, we have studied the invasion of cancer cells with different zzso zzso expression levels into loose and dense zzso collagen fiber zzso Using a cell zzso we isolated from parental zzso breast cancer cells two zzso lines expressing either high or low amounts of zzso zzso zzso or zzso cells, zzso zzso cells showed zzso increased cell zzso compared to zzso zzso Similar results were obtained for zzso kidney and zzso zzso zzso cells, and cells in which the zzso zzso zzso was knocked down using specific zzso zzso of the collagen zzso zzso zzso zzso also reduced zzso but to a lesser degree than zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso transform traction zzso revealed that the zzso cells generated zzso greater zzso forces than zzso zzso Cell zzso was reduced after addition of the zzso light chain zzso inhibitor zzso in zzso cells, but not in zzso cells, suggesting that zzso zzso enhance cell invasion through enhanced transmission and generation of zzso zzso
