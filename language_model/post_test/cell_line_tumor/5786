zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor or zzso acts as a tumor zzso when zzso in aggressive cancer cell zzso However, its role in human cancer is zzso zzso expression has been associated with a poor prognosis in some studies, whereas in others, with favorable zzso The clinical data suggest, however, that zzso zzso is associated with improved zzso We hypothesized that the tumor zzso activity of zzso may require nuclear zzso and that the zzso between clinical and experimental reports is a consequence of the variable zzso distribution of zzso Furthermore, we zzso that nuclear zzso could function as a tumor zzso through the regulation of genes involved in tumor growth and zzso zzso or zzso fused to a nuclear export signal were expressed in zzso human breast and zzso zzso cell zzso We found that zzso localized zzso inhibited in zzso tumor growth and zzso when assessed in zzso chicken zzso and zzso zzso fat pad injection zzso However, when zzso was excluded from the nucleus via a nuclear exclusion zzso it no longer functioned as a zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we show that nuclear zzso was enriched at the promoter of zzso zzso zzso and associated with diminished levels of zzso zzso Our findings demonstrate that the nuclear zzso of zzso is required for its tumor and zzso zzso functions in zzso and suggest that its mechanism of action zzso in part, direct association of zzso with target zzso
