Global gene expression profiling has demonstrated that the zzso cellular response to a range of zzso is a general stress zzso This stereotyped environmental stress response commonly includes repression of protein synthesis and zzso genes and induction of DNA damage and zzso zzso zzso Our laboratory recently characterized the general stress response of breast cell lines derived from zzso and zzso zzso after treatment with zzso zzso or zzso zzso and showed that each cell type has a distinct zzso However, we expected that some of the expression changes induced by zzso and zzso would be unique to each compound and might reflect the underlying mechanisms of action of these zzso zzso we employed supervised analyses zzso analysis of zzso to identify genes that showed differential expression between zzso and zzso cell zzso We then used zzso analyses and identified genes that afforded high zzso accuracy in zzso samples into the two treatment zzso To test whether these gene lists had good zzso accuracy in an independent data set, we treated our panel of cell lines with zzso a compound mechanistically similar to zzso We demonstrated that using expression patterns of 100 genes we were able to obtain zzso zzso accuracy in zzso the zzso samples as being more similar in expression to zzso than to zzso zzso These analyses also showed that zzso gene expression patterns, similar to general stress responses, vary according to cell zzso
