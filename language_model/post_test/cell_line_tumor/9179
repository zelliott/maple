To investigate the effect that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the cell proliferation of zzso 

The cell line zzso of zzso was zzso with different concentration of zzso and then calculated for the rate of cell proliferation inhibited at different zzso The change of cell cycle and the rate of cell zzso at each concentration were detected by zzso 

zzso showed the significant effect on zzso the cell proliferation of zzso especially on the 1200 zzso concentration zzso The highest inhibited rate of zzso cell proliferation could be up to zzso After zzso used to treat the cultured zzso cell for 48 h and 72 zzso the inhibited rates of zzso cell zzso of 1200 zzso 600 zzso zzso zzso zzso 75 zzso and zzso zzso groups were compared to those of control group, and with the statistics result of P zzso zzso Meanwhile the cell cycles were controlled significantly as well, zzso of the cells were detained in stage zzso 

In zzso zzso zzso zzso has the significant proliferation zzso effect to cell lines zzso of zzso
