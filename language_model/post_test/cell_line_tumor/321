zzso and selective zzso zzso zzso zzso such as tamoxifen are known to increase zzso cell zzso zzso evidence suggests that zzso signaling is zzso not only by zzso and zzso nuclear zzso but also by zzso zzso a seven zzso zzso zzso Here, we report that primary human zzso zzso cells express high levels of zzso with no zzso zzso or zzso Using a novel tamoxifen zzso zzso which activates zzso but not zzso significant stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso pathways was observed in zzso cells and in zzso zzso cancer cells expressing zzso a similar effect was observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment also increased cellular pools of zzso zzso zzso a proposed zzso for the nuclear hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso with these findings, zzso zzso and the zzso zzso were able to increase zzso transcription, promote zzso cell zzso and induce the zzso target gene zzso in a zzso zzso Our findings suggest a novel signaling paradigm that is initiated by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with signal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on nuclear hormone receptors zzso to zzso their zzso zzso We propose that this novel zzso zzso increases local zzso of estrogen, and together with classic zzso zzso mediate the zzso effects of synthetic zzso such as zzso in promoting zzso and zzso zzso
