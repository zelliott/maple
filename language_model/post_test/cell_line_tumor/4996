Pathways adopted by developing cancer cells for evasion of cellular surveillance mechanism deserve attention for therapeutic exploitation as well as for better zzso A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso which is zzso in a variety of zzso including zzso zzso has been the focus of our attention with a goal to understand its role in zzso conversion and to examine as a possible new therapeutic target in disparate types of zzso Earlier, we reported that zzso expression was zzso during zzso differentiation of zzso zzso leukemia cells, during zzso growth arrest in zzso phase and that zzso was regulated by cell zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso zzso cells become adapted to zzso DNA damage checkpoint upon zzso expression of a zzso zzso of zzso as indicated by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso entry into the zzso phase by these cells is suggested by the appearance of a zzso zzso marker, zzso We propose that the effect is due to zzso of zzso caused by direct physical interaction with zzso as detected by both a zzso means as well as by zzso zzso zzso Together, our studies provide a plausible explanation for the role of zzso zzso tumor cell growth following transient appearance in different types of zzso cells in zzso as zzso
