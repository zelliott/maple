We showed that resistance to severe zzso defines zzso levels within normal zzso populations and that zzso zzso the balance between generation of zzso and maintenance of zzso stem cells zzso in favor of the zzso This study deals with the effects of zzso zzso zzso in zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, addressing the question of whether a zzso leukemia cell population comprise functionally different cell zzso characterized by different zzso zzso To identify leukemia stem cells zzso we used the Culture zzso zzso zzso zzso we developed to zzso in zzso stem cells capable of short-term zzso zzso zzso strongly inhibited the overall growth of zzso cell population, which, despite its zzso comprised zzso characterized by markedly different zzso These included zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso capable of zzso secondary liquid cultures of zzso zzso confirming what was previously shown for normal zzso zzso zzso were found capable not only of surviving in zzso but also of being mostly in cycle, in contrast with the fact that almost all zzso cells were zzso and with what we previously found for zzso However, zzso zzso were also zzso capable of delayed culture zzso with the same efficiency as zzso zzso The fact that even zzso zzso believed to sustain minimal residual disease in zzso were found within the zzso cells indicates that all main components of leukemia cell populations may be present within zzso cell lines, which are therefore suitable to study the sensitivity of individual components to zzso Disclosure of potential conflicts of interest is found at the end of this zzso
