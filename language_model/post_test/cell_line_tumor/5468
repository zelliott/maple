zzso zzso make up a novel class of gene zzso they function as zzso or tumor zzso by targeting zzso genes or zzso A recent study that zzso a large number of human cancer cell lines showed that zzso is a potential zzso zzso However, the function and molecular mechanism of zzso in determining the aggressiveness of human prostate cancer has not been zzso Here, we show that zzso is significantly lower expressed in human prostate cancer cell lines than in zzso prostate zzso zzso zzso analyses reveal a zzso target site for zzso in the zzso region zzso of zzso at zzso zzso zzso significantly suppressed the activity of a zzso reporter containing the zzso in the zzso This activity could be abolished with the zzso of zzso or zzso zzso In addition, the expression level of zzso and zzso was zzso correlated in cell lines and prostate cancer zzso After zzso of zzso in zzso cells, cell growth was suppressed by reducing zzso zzso zzso and thereby inducing zzso zzso this is the first study to show that zzso is zzso regulated by zzso and also show that zzso zzso zzso in prostate cancer cells through zzso suppression of zzso zzso
