The objectives of the study is to determine clinical signs and distribution of peripheral zzso subsets, B cells and T regulatory cells in patients with zzso zzso tissue disease zzso and during the development toward well-established zzso tissue diseases zzso The methods include 46 patients with zzso were followed and investigated for differentiation into defined zzso for 2 zzso Cell zzso were determined on the basis of cell surface zzso zzso zzso production by flow zzso and serum zzso levels by zzso The results are as zzso zzso of zzso patients developed into a defined zzso The number and percentage of activated T cells, memory T cells and zzso cells were increased in patients compared with zzso In addition, in patients with zzso the percentage of zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher compared with controls and further increased in patients that developed zzso The percentage and absolute number of zzso regulatory T cells zzso were diminished in zzso patients compared with healthy controls, while the number of zzso zzso zzso The conclusions are zzso of zzso gamma and the decrease of natural zzso zzso seem to be characteristic features of zzso zzso The increased zzso production of zzso T cells might be a zzso zzso zzso however, it is probably not able to balance the overproduction of zzso gamma and the observed decrease of zzso zzso The shift toward zzso with increased zzso gamma production in patients with zzso combined with the degree of zzso disturbances characterized by the progressive divergent shifts in natural and induced zzso cell populations signify the transition from zzso to definitive zzso
