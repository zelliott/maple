zzso forms of zzso previously identified in zzso of zzso breast cancer, originate from zzso zzso domain zzso zzso or alternative translation zzso They lack zzso but may retain zzso domain zzso potentially associated with zzso zzso zzso and decreased sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso To study the distribution of truncated zzso in breast cancer, we detected loss of zzso zzso independently of its molecular origin in zzso zzso combining zzso zzso of zzso duplex zzso for zzso zzso and zzso domain with advanced image zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell lines were used as zzso zzso a zzso work flow to whole zzso paired surgical zzso needle biopsy samples, and paired samples from 69 patients of a phase 2 zzso clinical trial, we observed unexpected zzso of zzso loss at the zzso level, and in different areas of individual tumors, indicating that extent and zzso of zzso zzso loss add relevant information to averaging truncated zzso across whole zzso We show acceptable zzso variation zzso of variation, zzso image analysis results in moderate agreement with conventional slide assessment zzso zzso zzso zzso and no obvious interference with previous zzso zzso We conclude that duplex zzso and digital image processing extend current approaches of truncated zzso zzso
