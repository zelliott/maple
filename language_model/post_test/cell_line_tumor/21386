zzso transition zzso in cancer describes the zzso and behavioral changes of cancer cells from zzso to virulent forms with increased zzso invasive and zzso zzso zzso can be induced by soluble proteins like transforming growth factor zzso zzso and zzso factors including Snail and zzso We zzso the zzso prostate cancer progression model and zzso clones zzso zzso Snail to identify novel markers associated with zzso Compared to zzso cells, the highly zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells displayed a higher zzso of bone zzso after zzso administration in zzso zzso zzso and zzso expressed zzso zzso markers of zzso and zzso in addition to elevated levels of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso We observed that both zzso growth factor zzso plus zzso treatment and Snail zzso induced zzso in zzso and zzso cells, and zzso was associated with increased expression of zzso zzso Finally, we determined that the zzso protein was functionally active, promoting zzso in zzso Our results indicate that zzso is a novel marker for zzso during prostate cancer zzso zzso may function as a link between zzso bone zzso and prostate cancer skeletal zzso
