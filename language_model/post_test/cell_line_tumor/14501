zzso from zzso surface zzso such as zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso significantly decreases survival and quality of zzso Given a zzso zzso recurrence rate after surgical zzso for zzso the current study explores the use of zzso zzso specifically engineered to expand and locally deliver zzso agents at zzso zzso for the prevention of progressive zzso zzso efficacy of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was evaluated in zzso and in in zzso zzso models of zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso growth in zzso markedly decreased tumor growth and disease severity in zzso prevented initial zzso tumor zzso and significantly prolonged survival compared to other zzso drug delivery zzso These outcomes suggest that the mechanism of zzso drug delivery and tumor affinity associated with zzso may effectively improve the local control of residual microscopic disease following surgical zzso of zzso aggressive zzso
