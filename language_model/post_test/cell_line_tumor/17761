To study the expression and zzso zzso of zzso gene in gastric cancer zzso and to explore its significance in gastric zzso 

The expression of zzso in tumor zzso from 90 patients with gastric cancer and in normal gastric zzso as control were analyzed by zzso in tissue zzso zzso expression in gastric cancer cell lines and immortalized gastric zzso cell line zzso were detected by quantitative real-time zzso and Western zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was observed by zzso zzso 

The positive expression rate of zzso in gastric cancer was zzso zzso expressed in gastric cancer with well differentiation was higher than that with poor zzso positive rate in normal gastric zzso was zzso (one out of zzso By zzso zzso zzso localized both in zzso and nucleus, especially on the nuclear zzso The zzso and Western zzso results also showed that the expression of zzso in gastric cancer cell lines was higher than that in zzso 

The expression of zzso in gastric cancer is correlated with tumor cell differentiation and tumor Lauren zzso The nuclear zzso of zzso may contribute to its function in gastric cancer formation and zzso
