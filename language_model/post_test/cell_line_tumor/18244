The resistance of zzso cells to zzso is a major contributor to the limited effectiveness of zzso zzso growth factor I zzso has potential to protect cancer cells from variety of zzso zzso This study was carried out to investigate the effect of a novel zzso zzso zzso on zzso in colon cancer zzso 

We have designed and zzso a novel zzso of zzso zzso The effect of this zzso on human colon cancer cell proliferation was examined by a zzso zzso the zzso was revealed by determining the activities of cellular zzso 8 and zzso The zzso pathways were investigated by examining the levels of zzso proteins with Western zzso Following 40 hours treatment with the novel zzso zzso colon cancer cell zzso zzso activities increased zzso times; zzso 8 activities increased zzso times and zzso 9 increased zzso zzso The proliferation of cancer cell was inhibited by zzso The data showed that the zzso induced colon cancer cell zzso and inhibited cancer cell zzso The different changes of zzso zzso 8 and 9 activities suggested that the zzso pathways may play a major role in the zzso zzso zzso 

This is the first report on this novel zzso to induce human colon cancer cell zzso and inhibit cancer cell zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso may have the potential to be developed as a novel therapy for colon zzso in the zzso
