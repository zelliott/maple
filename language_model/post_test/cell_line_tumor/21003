zzso are zzso inclusion bodies that have been proposed to act as staging grounds for the disposal of protein zzso via the zzso zzso To examine whether the composition of an zzso influences its clearance by zzso we zzso expressed a variety of zzso proteins in cultured cells to generate zzso that differ in their protein zzso We found that whereas zzso generated in cells expressing zzso zzso or zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso are amenable to clearance by zzso those produced in zzso zzso or zzso zzso cells are apparently resistant to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inclusions fail to recruit key components of the zzso zzso However, by altering the composition of zzso zzso zzso could be rendered zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that not all zzso are efficiently primed for zzso clearance and highlight a certain degree of selectivity for the supposedly zzso zzso
