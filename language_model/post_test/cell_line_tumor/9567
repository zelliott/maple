zzso and in zzso zzso zzso of new zzso zzso zzso have been performed to assess their zzso potency on the zzso zzso zzso Previous studies showed that the replacement of the aromatic zzso group between nitrogen atoms zzso and zzso in the zzso inhibitor zzso with zzso or zzso chain is optimal for zzso zzso zzso To confirm that zzso the zzso or the zzso zzso arm was replaced with a zzso or an zzso group such as zzso In addition, an zzso group and two zzso groups onto the zzso part were introduced to assess their effect on the anti zzso zzso Five molecules were prepared and evaluated on zzso All new zzso were more potent than zzso most of them exhibited a lower zzso than zzso zzso 5 was the most potent and its zzso activity was similar to zzso Interestingly, in zzso zzso studies of compounds 4 and 5 using human zzso zzso revealed, that zzso to zzso compounds 4 and 5 inhibited zzso an zzso that zzso with zzso in the zzso and contributes to tumor cell zzso by enhancing the zzso of numerous drugs, notably zzso In that context, 5 might be suitable for further drug zzso
