zzso zzso 2 acts on a number of types of immune cells promoting their zzso zzso To replace systemic administration of zzso form of this zzso various genetically modified cells have been used indifferent zzso models for tumor growth zzso In this study, zzso or tumor cells zzso with zzso zzso carrying zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alone or combined with tumor zzso zzso cells zzso zzso were exploited to treat colon zzso zzso zzso After the zzso injection of vaccine cells, the tumor growth delay and the increase in the number of tumor zzso zzso and zzso T zzso were zzso A considerable increase in zzso cell influx into tumor tissue was observed when zzso zzso cells or zzso zzso with zzso zzso cells were zzso The increase in intensity of zzso cell zzso was associated with immune reaction triggered by the same combination of applied cells or zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso The effect observed in zzso was accompanied by zzso cell specific zzso activity of zzso cells in zzso Thus, the application of vaccines, including zzso cells of various origins, was able to induce different zzso responses polarized by zzso zzso and the encountered tumor zzso
