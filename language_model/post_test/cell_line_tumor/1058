zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an early cell surface melanoma progression marker implicated in stimulating tumor cell zzso migration, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in zzso growth factor and zzso signaling zzso zzso cell spreading and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2, implicated in tumor growth and survival, has also been linked to clinical melanoma zzso We have cloned the zzso core protein and expressed it in the zzso melanoma cell line zzso zzso of zzso enhances zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso exhibit extensive zzso zzso on adherent cells, where it also zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso appears to involve independent mechanisms because zzso of zzso zzso had no effect on zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso may facilitate primary melanoma progression by enhancing the zzso of key signaling pathways important for tumor invasion and zzso
