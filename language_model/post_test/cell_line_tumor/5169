zzso zzso stem cells zzso have been derived at low zzso from different cell types through zzso expression of the zzso factors zzso and zzso combined with either zzso and zzso or zzso and zzso In order to generate zzso more zzso it will be crucial to identify zzso cells that are easily accessible and possibly require fewer factors for conversion into zzso Here, we show that both human and mouse zzso give rise to zzso at higher efficiencies than zzso Moreover, we demonstrate that a mouse zzso melanoma cell line, which has previously been zzso into embryonic stem cells by nuclear transfer, remains equally amenable to zzso into zzso by these zzso zzso In contrast to skin zzso zzso and melanoma cells did not require zzso zzso expression for conversion into zzso zzso lines from zzso cells expressed zzso zzso formed zzso and contributed to viable zzso mice with germ line zzso Our results identify skin zzso as an alternative source for zzso zzso zzso at increased efficiency and with fewer genetic zzso In addition, our results suggest that cancer cells remain susceptible to zzso zzso zzso which should facilitate the study of zzso changes in human zzso
