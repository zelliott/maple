zzso zzso and lung zzso are the most common and prevalent types of human zzso with a greater than zzso mortality zzso The poor prognosis of both these zzso are likely due to the absence of valid approaches for early zzso the frequency of its zzso at the time of diagnosis, frequent recurrence after surgery, and poor responsiveness to zzso Most notably, the early development of pancreatic zzso zzso and lung zzso is suggested to be the result of a zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso necrosis zzso zzso has been shown to have great potential for the treatment of most human tumor cells, while leaving normal cells zzso However, some zzso show resistance to TRAIL treatment, leaving a gap in the understanding of its exact zzso 

zzso resistance to cell death was investigated in pancreatic and lung cancer cell zzso Cell survival was determined by zzso and zzso by zzso cell death zzso zzso of bid and zzso were evaluated by Western zzso 

Our study demonstrated that TRAIL significantly suppressed cell survival, by inducing zzso in a zzso manner, in the pancreatic cancer zzso zzso type zzso and lung cancer zzso zzso cell zzso In contrast, zzso pancreatic and zzso lung cancer cell lines, which have a zzso zzso zzso zzso were resistant to the actions of zzso 

This study demonstrates an association between TRAIL resistance to zzso in human pancreatic and lung cancer cell lines and zzso zzso zzso
