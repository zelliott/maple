zzso zzso zzso are essential for the zzso of therapeutic zzso zzso broadly used in cancer zzso The mechanisms responsible for zzso regulation are largely zzso zzso is a zzso signal for chronic zzso leukemia zzso cells and has been shown to zzso resistance to zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate whether zzso is able to zzso the expression and function of the human zzso zzso zzso in primary cultures of zzso cells and, consequently, to affect zzso induced by therapeutic zzso zzso We found that treatment with zzso (20 zzso for 24 zzso increased zzso zzso expression in zzso cells without affecting that of normal B zzso Given that the enhanced zzso levels of zzso in zzso cells did not result in increased transport activity, we examined the possibility that zzso induced by zzso may require zzso modifications to become zzso We found that the acute stimulation of zzso in zzso zzso cells by short-term incubation with zzso significantly increased zzso transport activity and zzso zzso zzso By contrast, and in line with previous reports, zzso plus zzso protected zzso cells from a variety of zzso zzso Our findings indicate that the combined treatment with zzso and zzso enhances zzso activity and specifically zzso zzso cells to undergo zzso induced by zzso
