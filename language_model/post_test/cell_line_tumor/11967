zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso family and forms an zzso complex with zzso and zzso zzso is required for normal mouse embryonic development and cellular zzso and is highly zzso to zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso We determined that zzso in a manner similar to zzso can bind directly to zzso but does not affect zzso zzso We identified a zzso zzso domain in zzso that is zzso in zzso and zzso and is necessary and sufficient for zzso The presence of zzso stabilized expression of this domain and we demonstrate that this zzso domain of zzso contributes to the zzso zzso of zzso The results support the model that zzso plays a role in regulation of zzso zzso
