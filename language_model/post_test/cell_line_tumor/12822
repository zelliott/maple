zzso zzso zzso and zzso comprise a family of zzso zzso proteins first identified as zzso plaque zzso in which they link zzso to the zzso zzso In addition to their role in zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso to the nucleus, where they perform unknown zzso Of the three zzso zzso is most readily detected in the nucleus, where it is localized to the zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso head domain and zzso zzso repeat domain were localized to the nucleus in zzso cells, whereas zzso zzso containing the zzso head domain and zzso zzso repeat domain localized to the zzso and the zzso zzso I zzso of zzso in cultured cells results in loss of nuclear zzso suggesting that zzso associates specifically with nuclear zzso In addition, in zzso zzso revealed that the zzso head zzso of zzso and zzso were sufficient to bind zzso zzso zzso of DNA damage induced a partial zzso of zzso protein to the zzso and depletion of zzso resulted in increased survival in response to DNA zzso These data suggest that in addition to zzso zzso zzso the nuclear pool of zzso can influence cell survival by interactions with zzso
