zzso zzso 7 is a growth factor able to induce the growth and development of certain zzso zzso including zzso and zzso Its effects on solid zzso including breast cancer, are zzso This report concerns the effect of zzso on the growth of breast cancer zzso 

zzso zzso chain reaction, western zzso and zzso were used to detect to detect zzso and its zzso zzso in breast cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso These cells were treated with various zzso of human zzso zzso over specified zzso Changes in growth were assessed using zzso and zzso zzso Selective zzso downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor 1, zzso and AG zzso were use to clarify the pathways through which zzso may affect breast cancer zzso 

zzso significantly accelerated the growth of zzso zzso cells and zzso cells zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso respectively, in zzso The maximum effects were observed after incubation for 72 zzso The zzso effect of zzso on cell growth was completely eliminated in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso versus no inhibitor in zzso zzso and zzso cells, zzso and zzso inhibitor 1 zzso zzso zzso versus no inhibitor in both cell zzso but not in the presence of zzso and AG zzso 

zzso induced the growth of breast cancer cells in zzso through a zzso zzso This may have an important impact on research into breast cancer development and zzso
