To evaluate the status of promoter zzso of Ras association domain family protein zzso zzso zzso in cancer 1 zzso and zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso and to explore the correlation with zzso zzso 

Forty cases of zzso and their corresponding zzso liver zzso other 2 cases of healthy donor zzso were detected using zzso specific zzso chain reaction zzso zzso 

The frequency of promoter zzso of zzso showed zzso and zzso in tumor and corresponding zzso zzso respectively, and there was significant difference between them zzso zzso zzso The frequency of promoter zzso of zzso showed zzso and zzso in tumor and corresponding zzso zzso zzso The frequency of zzso of zzso in zzso liver zzso showed significant correlation between younger and older zzso The frequency of promoter zzso of zzso showed zzso in tumor zzso However, none of zzso of the gene was detected in corresponding zzso liver zzso There was none of zzso of the three genes showed in two cases of healthy donor zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso and zzso genes are common event in zzso and play an important role in the zzso and may be used to develop novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for zzso in the zzso
