zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso membrane lipids with head groups containing zzso zzso of zzso zzso prepared from lipids of zzso zzso with zzso cells in zzso were zzso In zzso zzso was tested on five different cell zzso zzso mouse melanoma cells zzso and Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells, and three human cell zzso zzso zzso cells zzso liver zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso and zzso zzso vein cell line zzso zzso were nontoxic to human zzso zzso zzso and mildly toxic to zzso zzso and zzso cells but showed strong zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso are taken up by zzso The zzso of zzso and the release of loaded zzso are more prominent in zzso cells, which is in line with high toxicity toward these zzso The mechanisms of zzso release and action in these cells as well as in zzso functioning have to be further studied for possible targeted drug zzso
