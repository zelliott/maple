The zzso transition zzso has a crucial role in normal and disease processes including tumor zzso In this study, we first classified zzso and zzso oral zzso cell zzso zzso cell lines based on expression profiles of typical zzso genes using a panel of 18 zzso cell zzso Then, we performed zzso and zzso analyses of components of the zzso signaling pathway, and identified zzso and zzso as genes silenced by zzso DNA zzso in zzso A significant association was revealed between some zzso findings and the DNA zzso status of zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso vs IV, zzso and zzso zzso vs zzso zzso in the advanced stages of zzso Moreover, we found that zzso expression in cancer cells may be positively regulated by zzso whose expression is zzso regulated by zzso DNA zzso or zzso in zzso zzso zzso Our findings indicate that zzso gene zzso through zzso DNA zzso may stabilize the zzso plasticity of cancer cells during zzso
