zzso zzso zzso zzso converts zzso to zzso zzso and is a key zzso in vitamin A zzso zzso activity is robust in the zzso and liver, where zzso gene zzso may be subject to negative feedback by zzso of its zzso zzso Evidence from zzso zzso animals also indicates that zzso zzso may be required for zzso conversion of zzso into vitamin zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the zzso zzso zzso on regulation of zzso in a cell model of human zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso is expressed in human zzso zzso zzso cells and converts zzso into retinal and biologically active zzso acids zzso Exposure to zzso suppresses zzso expression at both zzso and protein zzso zzso but not zzso zzso decreases zzso promoter activity in a zzso and zzso zzso This zzso zzso of zzso expression results from decreased binding of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso X zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso treatment also zzso zzso activity in zzso cells that zzso express zzso zzso but not in cells that express the zzso zzso or zzso zzso These findings have implications for local vitamin A synthesis in the zzso especially during systemic vitamin A zzso and may also help to explain, in part, the mechanism underlying the increased lung cancer risk upon zzso supplementation in zzso
