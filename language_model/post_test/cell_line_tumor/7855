The constant increase of cancer cell resistance to zzso and chemotherapy zzso improvement of patient survival and requires novel targeting zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso as potent zzso cancer zzso On the basis of our previous findings clearly showing that zzso zzso zzso signals in cells exposed to zzso radiation, this study evaluated the impact of the small zzso inhibitor zzso reported as putative zzso zzso on the cellular radiation survival response of human head and neck zzso cell zzso cells zzso 

zzso zzso cells and zzso cells zzso zzso with a zzso active zzso zzso zzso or empty zzso zzso cells, zzso and zzso mouse zzso were zzso zzso grew either zzso zzso on or zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso were treated with zzso alone or in combination with zzso zzso zzso zzso single zzso zzso zzso was achieved by small interfering zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso survival, number of residual DNA double strand breaks zzso zzso zzso zzso cell cycle distribution, protein expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso were zzso Data on zzso zzso activity and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso revealed a broad zzso spectrum of zzso without specificity for zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso cell survival and enhanced the zzso of zzso and zzso cells in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso exerted zzso cell culture zzso effects with regard to zzso zzso and zzso of cells in the zzso cell cycle zzso Relative to corresponding controls, zzso and zzso zzso showed enhanced zzso which failed to be antagonized by zzso A zzso of zzso revealed no change in zzso survival of the tested cell lines as compared to zzso 

Our data clearly show that the small zzso inhibitor zzso has potent zzso and zzso capability in zzso zzso However, zzso is not specific for zzso Further in zzso and in zzso studies are necessary to clarify the potential of zzso as a targeted therapeutic in the zzso
