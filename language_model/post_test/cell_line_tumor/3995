Cancer prevention zzso by using naturally occurring dietary agents has gained immense interest because of the broad safety window of these zzso However, many of these compounds are zzso and poorly soluble in zzso They frequently display low zzso poor systemic delivery, and low zzso To circumvent this problem, we explored a novel approach toward zzso using zzso to deliver zzso a natural compound present in green zzso We formulated zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and studied its zzso activity against lung cancer and head and neck zzso In zzso studies demonstrated that, like zzso zzso inhibited the growth of lung cancer cells zzso cell line) and zzso cell zzso of head and neck zzso cells zzso cell zzso In zzso cells, the zzso value of zzso was zzso zzso and that of zzso was zzso zzso In zzso cells, the zzso of zzso was zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso In zzso studies using a tumor zzso mouse model demonstrated that zzso has a significant zzso effect on the tumor growth of zzso in comparison to zzso Our results suggest that zzso delivery of naturally occurring dietary agents like zzso has many advantages and may have potential application in zzso in clinical zzso
