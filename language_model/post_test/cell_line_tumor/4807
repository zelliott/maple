Many members of the nearly zzso zzso gene family have been implicated in cancer, mostly following zzso zzso In this study we analyzed zzso gene expression in zzso zzso zzso cell zzso Both reverse zzso chain reaction zzso using zzso zzso and zzso profiling identified consistently zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso regulation in zzso cells revealed zzso and zzso as zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso active zzso zzso was identified in all zzso cell lines analyzed as well as primary zzso zzso Our data show that zzso probably mediates zzso expression by zzso zzso In addition, expression analysis of the neighboring zzso gene zzso revealed zzso with zzso zzso analysis of zzso by zzso and zzso zzso indicated their influence on both proliferation and zzso in zzso zzso In zzso we identified zzso of zzso in zzso zzso by zzso active zzso signaling which may represent novel therapeutic targets in zzso
