Ewing tumors zzso are highly zzso localized in bone or soft zzso and are zzso defined by zzso zzso DNA zzso analysis revealed a relationship of zzso to both zzso and fetal neural zzso We identified expression of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso to be increased in zzso zzso activity of zzso maintains zzso in normal and zzso zzso Here, we found zzso bound to the zzso promoter in zzso and induced zzso expression in zzso and zzso stem zzso zzso of zzso by zzso interference in zzso suppressed zzso transformation by zzso zzso in zzso Similarly, tumor development and zzso was suppressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso was shown to be dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso knock down, zzso treatment and confirmation in independent zzso revealed an zzso zzso maintained by zzso in zzso zzso regulated zzso genes such as nerve growth factor zzso zzso as well as genes involved in zzso and zzso differentiation zzso zzso zzso and zzso These data suggest that zzso might have a central role in zzso pathology by shaping the zzso and stem cell zzso of this zzso
