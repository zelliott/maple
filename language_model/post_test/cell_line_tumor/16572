zzso signaling is a critical zzso that plays a key role in the zzso of breast zzso In a previous zzso profiling study, we identified a novel panel of zzso genes in breast zzso One of these genes is zzso carrier family 22 member 5 zzso which encodes a zzso organic zzso zzso (also called zzso In this study, we found that zzso stimulates zzso expression robustly in an zzso zzso zzso manner and that zzso expression is associated with zzso status in breast cancer cell lines and tissue zzso Although the zzso zzso promoter is not responsive to estrogen, a downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso contains a newly identified zzso element zzso zzso and other zzso factor binding sites, such as a half zzso and a nuclear zzso related 1 zzso zzso zzso induction of the zzso reporter was dependent upon both the zzso and the zzso site within the zzso zzso Small interfering zzso against either zzso or zzso inhibited zzso induction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso confirmed the recruitment of both zzso and zzso to this zzso In functional zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso zzso and suppressed the proliferation of breast cancer zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is an zzso gene regulated via a newly identified zzso zzso Since zzso is a critical regulator of zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso zzso may serve as a potential therapeutic target for breast cancer in the zzso
