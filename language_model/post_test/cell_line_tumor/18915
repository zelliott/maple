The effects of zzso on the behavior of breast tumors have not yet been zzso To determine whether this compound is useful in the treatment of breast cancer, we analyzed the impact of zzso on the human breast cancer cell lines zzso and zzso zzso zzso was added to zzso zzso and zzso cells in zzso Following treatment, changes in cell growth characteristics such as zzso cell cycle zzso and the degree of zzso were zzso Following zzso treatment, a zzso reduction in proliferation was observed in both cell lines at differing zzso 20 zzso for zzso and 10 zzso for zzso zzso zzso V zzso showed an increase in zzso in both cell lines of 31 % in zzso and 12 % in zzso cells compared to their respective zzso In addition, 12 % of the zzso cells were arrested at zzso compared to 62 % of control zzso These results demonstrate that treatment with zzso zzso growth in both zzso and zzso zzso In addition, they show that this partly occurs through the induction of zzso in zzso cells, and through both cell cycle arrest and induction of zzso in zzso zzso Thus, zzso may be a novel therapeutic drug for breast zzso
