zzso encodes zzso zzso zzso A zzso and is known to have a zzso zzso activity in many tumor zzso However, it has many other functions as zzso Recent studies have shown that the interacting proteins with zzso which mediate the cell zzso may act as zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The interacting proteins with zzso can be classified into 3 zzso The first group of proteins can be classified as upstream zzso of zzso such as zzso and zzso The second group of proteins acts as downstream zzso for the regulation of specific gene zzso zzso protein functions, and signal zzso in zzso signal zzso The third group of proteins can be classified as zzso influencing binding partners of zzso As a result, the interactions with zzso and binding partners have implications in the zzso characterization involved in zzso and zzso
