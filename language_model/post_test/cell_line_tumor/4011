A major problem in cancer chemotherapy is the existence of primary resistance and/or the acquisition of secondary zzso Many cellular defects contribute to zzso but zzso changes can also be a zzso 

A DNA zzso zzso was used to identify zzso differences in zzso and zzso zzso cancer zzso The candidate gene zzso was validated by zzso DNA zzso and expression zzso zzso and short hairpin experiments were used to assess zzso zzso zzso survival zzso and overall survival zzso in zzso zzso cancer patients were explored with zzso and Cox zzso zzso All statistical tests were zzso 

We found that zzso resistance in zzso cancer cells depends on the DNA zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or depletion gives rise to sensitivity or resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso occurred in primary tumors from a discovery cohort of zzso cancer patients zzso zzso zzso 39 of zzso where it predicted shorter zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso P zzso zzso particularly in zzso case subjects for which zzso surgery was not indicated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso P zzso zzso In a validation cohort of zzso zzso tumors treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also associated with shorter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

These results provide a basis for future clinical studies to validate zzso zzso as a zzso marker for zzso resistance in zzso zzso
