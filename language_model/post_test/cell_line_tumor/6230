zzso mapping studies have identified multiple cancer zzso regions at zzso zzso upstream of the zzso zzso zzso has been widely presumed as the regulated target zzso but definitive evidence functionally linking these cancer regions with zzso has been difficult to zzso Here we examined candidate functional zzso of a zzso block at zzso encompassing the two independent risk zzso for prostate and breast cancer, zzso and zzso We used the mapping of zzso I hypersensitive sites as a tool to zzso regions for further functional zzso This approach identified zzso which is in complete linkage zzso zzso with zzso as a novel functional prostate zzso genetic zzso We demonstrate that the risk zzso zzso of zzso reduces binding of the zzso factor zzso in zzso This factor is known to repress global zzso in prostate cancer and is a candidate zzso zzso Additional experiments showed that the zzso binding site is occupied in zzso in prostate cancer, but not breast cancer cells, consistent with the observed zzso effects of this single zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso capture zzso experiments, we found that the region surrounding zzso interacts with the zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, expression of the zzso zzso in normal prostate tissue increased with the presence of the risk zzso of zzso while expression of zzso was not zzso In conclusion, we identified a new functional prostate cancer risk zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso G, that reduces binding of the zzso protein and is associated with increased expression of zzso located zzso zzso zzso
