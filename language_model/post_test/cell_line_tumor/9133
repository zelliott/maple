zzso cancer zzso zzso to bone, resulting in high zzso Strategies to inhibit prostate cancer zzso include targeting both zzso zzso zzso and underlying zzso zzso We and others have previously shown that blocking zzso zzso of nuclear zzso zzso zzso partially blocks tumor establishment and progression in bone in zzso zzso However, levels of zzso in the cell lines used in these studies were very low, suggesting that soluble factors other than zzso may mediate the zzso zzso zzso To identify these factors, a human zzso zzso array was used to measure zzso expression in zzso medium collected from primary prostate zzso cells zzso prostate cancer zzso and its zzso zzso and zzso zzso All prostate cancer cells produced high amounts of zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso Furthermore, levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were higher in zzso than zzso These results were confirmed by zzso Finally, human bone zzso zzso cells zzso were cultured with zzso zzso zzso Although both zzso human zzso and zzso directly zzso zzso differentiation into zzso cells, zzso but not zzso induced bone zzso on zzso slices with 21 days of culture in the absence of zzso However, the zzso zzso bone zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso and was further zzso inhibited with zzso zzso indicating that zzso in addition to zzso mediates zzso zzso and bone zzso zzso may promote zzso cell fusion, forming zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso This study may provide novel therapeutic targets for treatment of prostate cancer skeletal zzso
