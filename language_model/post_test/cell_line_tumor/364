The objective of this study was to develop a new small molecular zzso zzso zzso zzso as an zzso zzso Our study investigated the effects of zzso on human zzso zzso and zzso and explored its zzso mechanism in zzso zzso effects of zzso on human zzso cell zzso were zzso by the zzso zzso - zzso inner zzso zzso The zzso of tumor cells was observed by electron zzso DNA zzso was used to investigate zzso of zzso zzso The effects of zzso on the cell cycle of zzso cells were determined by flow zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were investigated by real-time zzso and western zzso in zzso zzso zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso cells in zzso induced DNA zzso and changed their zzso zzso resulting in the necrosis and zzso of tumor zzso zzso interrupted cell cycle of tumor cells at zzso and postponed their zzso zzso markedly enhanced the zzso and protein expression of zzso and zzso and decreased the expression of zzso of tumor zzso In conclusion, zzso significantly inhibited the growth of human zzso zzso zzso cells and its zzso effects may result from the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso zzso
