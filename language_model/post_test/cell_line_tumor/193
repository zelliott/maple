A point zzso from zzso zzso to zzso zzso at zzso position zzso in the zzso zzso gene has been associated with zzso of zzso zzso zzso virus zzso This zzso zzso to a zzso acid zzso to zzso zzso change at position 335 in the zzso zzso We have zzso demonstrated that two zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso and zzso differ in zzso zzso zzso affinity and zzso zzso In the present study, we performed a zzso analysis of that zzso acid zzso the structures of zzso protein of both zzso zzso strain zzso were zzso Based on our analysis, the zzso zzso changes the protein surface properties and to a lesser extent their zzso which in turn reflects in activity zzso Our modeling results suggest that this zzso interchange does not affect the structure of the zzso acid binding zzso however, the zzso surface differs drastically due to an exposed short alpha zzso zzso this zzso may affect the accessibility of zzso to zzso and membrane receptors of the host zzso Our findings appear to explain the observed differences in zzso of these vaccine zzso
