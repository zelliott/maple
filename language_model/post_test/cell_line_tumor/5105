Despite the male preponderance for developing zzso tumors and a body of published literature that suggests a female gender advantage for long term survival in both human and animal studies, there have been relatively few rigorous investigations into the hormonal effects on zzso tumor zzso In a previous study, we concluded that zzso played a major role in the female survival bias seen in an zzso nude rat model of zzso zzso Here we explore the potential therapeutic effect of zzso zzso delivery in nude rats with zzso zzso tumors and examine the mechanism of action of zzso on reducing tumor growth in this animal zzso We administered zzso in several dosing regimens, to male, female and zzso nude rats in a survival zzso Brain zzso taken at various time points in tumor zzso were analyzed for zzso zzso zzso zzso index and zzso zzso zzso increased survival of male, female and zzso nude rats with zzso zzso tumors, in a gender specific zzso The zzso zzso effect occurred early in tumor zzso and appeared to be caused zzso by an increase in zzso zzso It remains unclear if zzso effect is direct or indirect and if it is zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso therapy may be beneficial in treating zzso and further study is clearly zzso
