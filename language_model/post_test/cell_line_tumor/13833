zzso zzso are small zzso zzso that regulate genes and contribute to many kinds of human diseases, including zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso were investigated for a possible role in zzso based on predicted binding sites for the zzso zzso by zzso analysis software, and the zzso zzso was constructed to investigate the interaction between zzso and zzso in the zzso cell line zzso Green fluorescent protein zzso expression was estimated by zzso zzso and flow zzso after zzso cells were zzso with zzso (or zzso and zzso zzso The expression of zzso in the zzso and zzso cells was significantly zzso in contrast with the zzso zzso zzso zzso The decreased expression of zzso was further detected after zzso (or zzso treatment by western zzso The zzso test showed zzso of zzso cell proliferation and zzso zzso dual zzso showed increased zzso in the zzso and zzso cells compared to the NC zzso A zzso factor downstream of zzso the zzso protein alpha zzso was expression at higher levels after zzso (or zzso decreasing zzso zzso Our results illustrate that zzso and zzso act as tumor zzso zzso which could suppress zzso cell proliferation in zzso and in zzso by suppressing zzso and further increasing zzso zzso
