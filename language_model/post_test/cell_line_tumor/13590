Our previous report showed that zzso growth factor zzso and related genes were zzso in a Syrian zzso model and could be detected in all human zzso zzso zzso We therefore hoped that zzso could be used as a diagnostic and zzso zzso We analyzed 78 samples of human zzso and adjacent zzso for zzso and related gene zzso and localized zzso protein zzso The mechanism of zzso drugs on zzso and related genes or proteins in zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso was studied through zzso cell viability zzso quantitative real-time zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso coding region was zzso Moreover, the zzso in zzso of zzso patients and healthy controls was zzso zzso was found to be zzso in zzso tissue zzso zzso Positive zzso zzso zzso was significantly correlated with status zzso zzso zzso stage of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and short survival rate zzso zzso zzso and the zzso analysis confirmed that zzso positive zzso had a higher likelihood of the risk of death zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso For DNA point zzso of the zzso zzso silent zzso were found at zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso there was only a zzso zzso in zzso (29 zzso that has significant correlation with the zzso grading zzso zzso zzso and positive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso cell line study by zzso zzso found that zzso zzso had an zzso effect on the zzso zzso by decreasing zzso zzso and zzso zzso The serum level of zzso in zzso patients was significantly higher than those of healthy control by zzso zzso zzso zzso The present results suggest that zzso and zzso may be used for zzso prognosis and/or as diagnostic candidate zzso
