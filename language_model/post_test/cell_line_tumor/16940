The tumor zzso genes zzso and zzso are frequently zzso by promoter zzso in zzso cell lung zzso The proteins they zzso zzso and zzso form a complex in human zzso cells and are involved in zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso and zzso proteins was examined by zzso in 67 primary breast cancer and adjacent zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected by zzso zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso status of the zzso and zzso promoters was determined zzso by zzso treatment followed by zzso 

zzso and zzso protein signals were detected along the cell membrane in normal zzso zzso By contrast, 47 zzso and 49 zzso of 67 primary breast zzso showed zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was more frequently observed in zzso and zzso tumors and for zzso and III zzso and zzso respectively), while zzso zzso zzso was more often observed in tumors with zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso tumors, and for zzso and III zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso and zzso expression was zzso observed in invasive relative to zzso zzso from the same zzso zzso and zzso zzso Finally, zzso of zzso and zzso genes was detected in zzso and zzso of primary breast zzso zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso zzso and zzso expression is involved in progression of breast cancer, especially in invasion into the zzso and zzso
