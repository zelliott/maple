Nuclear zzso of zzso DNA is one of the many cellular barriers that limit the efficiency of zzso gene delivery zzso We have determined the number of plasmids that reach the nucleus of a zzso cell using an internally standardized quantitative zzso zzso zzso We isolated zzso using two different zzso a density zzso technique and a zzso zzso The density zzso procedure yielded zzso with substantially less adhering plasmids on the outside of the zzso Using the density zzso protocol we determined that cells zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso contained between 75 and 50,000 zzso depending on the applied zzso zzso Any increase above zzso zzso resulted in only marginal increases in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso plasmids were more efficiently zzso on the basis of protein expression per zzso number in the nucleus, than zzso zzso This indicates that zzso may remain bound to some plasmids in the zzso Lastly, by sorting zzso cells into zzso and zzso zzso we observe that a zzso of cells contain zzso greater zzso but express nearly zzso more zzso than other cells within a single zzso zzso Taken together these results suggest the importance of considering the processes downstream from nuclear entry for strategies to improve the efficiency of gene transfer zzso
