The major vault protein zzso has been implicated in zzso resistance, cellular zzso and zzso zzso In this study we aimed to identify crucial zzso promoter elements that regulate zzso zzso By zzso as well as deletion analysis a zzso zzso zzso element was demonstrated to be essential for zzso human zzso promoter zzso zzso of zzso zzso factors but not zzso to this element in zzso and in zzso was shown by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso binding by a zzso zzso and by zzso A distinctly attenuated zzso promoter zzso In zzso zzso cells, the silent human zzso promoter was zzso by several human zzso zzso In human cells the zzso promoter was zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A zzso resulting in enhanced zzso zzso This stimulation was substantially decreased by zzso of the single zzso and by application of zzso zzso Treatment with zzso zzso led to a distinct decrease of zzso but increase of zzso binding in zzso to the respective promoter sequence as demonstrated by zzso zzso zzso this study identifies variations in zzso factor binding to a single zzso zzso element as critical for zzso zzso promoter zzso and its stimulation by zzso zzso
