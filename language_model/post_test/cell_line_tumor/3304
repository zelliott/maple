The zzso zzso proteins zzso are an zzso zzso family of proteins with pivotal biological zzso Here we describe the cloning and functional characterization of a novel family member, human zzso protein 4 zzso zzso is expressed in most human zzso and highly expressed in tumor zzso Its expression in tumor cells is further enhanced upon tumor necrosis factor zzso alpha treatment, whereas zzso normally zzso with zzso zzso stimulation triggers its transfer to the cell zzso where it binds to zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso zzso are resistant to both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and in zzso protein binding zzso demonstrated that zzso interacts with zzso and zzso A truncated form of zzso lacking the zzso domain, maintains zzso zzso but has no effect on cellular responses to zzso Given that zzso breast cancer cells expressed zzso at a high level, small interfering zzso was used to silence the expression of zzso We demonstrated that zzso of zzso expression zzso zzso breast cancer cells to zzso zzso zzso appears to promote cellular resistance to zzso zzso by zzso zzso of the zzso pathway, zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso region of zzso domain appears to play a vital role in this biological activity of zzso
