zzso zzso zzso displays a characteristic zzso and depends on zzso for tumor growth, which thus provides a potential target for therapeutic approaches to zzso In this study, through the use of combined zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we investigate if such a combined targeting of vascular zzso growth factor zzso activity and expression might zzso zzso growth in an zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso models were created by zzso vein injection of zzso cell suspensions in severe combined zzso zzso The mice were then treated with zzso zzso zzso a zzso target of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso 

Assessment of zzso progression using CT with zzso and PET with zzso zzso showed that mice treated with zzso had the lowest standardized zzso values zzso At week 2, mice treated with zzso zzso and zzso all showed a marked decrease in the zzso readings with the greatest drop being observed in the zzso group zzso + zzso zzso + zzso zzso + zzso zzso vehicle control zzso + zzso 

Our results, supported by zzso suggest that zzso represents a potential novel zzso therapy for the treatment of zzso
