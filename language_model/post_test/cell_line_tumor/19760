zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso showed significant efficacy against numerous solid tumors in zzso studies and entered clinical development for cancer zzso It is a structural analogue of zzso zzso a clinically used drug in the treatment of acute zzso zzso which has no or very limited efficacy against solid zzso In comparison with zzso the excellent in zzso activity of zzso against solid tumors suggests that, in addition to zzso of DNA zzso zzso may target cellular signaling zzso such as zzso in solid zzso We studied zzso and zzso for their zzso activities in zzso and in zzso Both compounds inhibited human zzso cell proliferation with similar zzso However, only zzso inhibited zzso cell migration and differentiation into zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso a key signaling zzso involved in cellular processes of zzso zzso from chick zzso membrane zzso zzso revealed that zzso significantly inhibited the development of new blood vessels in zzso whereas zzso showed much less zzso The findings of this study show a role of zzso in zzso and suggest that zzso combines zzso and zzso activity in one zzso for a dual mechanism of drug action to achieve the excellent in zzso efficacy against several solid zzso This study also provides important information for zzso dosage and sequence of zzso administration in clinical investigations by considering zzso as both an zzso and an zzso zzso
