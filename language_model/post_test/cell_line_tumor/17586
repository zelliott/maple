zzso zzso zzso zzso is activated by diverse cell zzso including stress, growth factors, and zzso Traditionally, zzso of zzso by stress treatment is thought to induce cell zzso However, our recent data indicate that zzso ability to sensitize cells to zzso may be, in part, cell cycle zzso Here, we show that the majority of both zzso and zzso zzso can be inhibited by the pharmacological zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso does little to reverse zzso zzso in zzso cells or zzso and zzso death in zzso zzso zzso SP treatment causes zzso arrest of three breast cancer cell lines and results in the zzso zzso DNA content zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso These effects on cell cycle and zzso are not significantly altered by the zzso of zzso indicating that zzso is functioning independently of zzso Lastly, zzso of zzso using both SP and zzso zzso targeted to zzso and zzso reduced proliferation of all three breast cancer cell zzso Taken together, these results suggest that the zzso of zzso is important for the induction of zzso following stresses that function at different cell cycle zzso and that zzso zzso activity is necessary to promote proliferation and maintain zzso in breast cancer zzso
