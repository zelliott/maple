To investigate a valuable strategy for further zzso cancer stem cells zzso from zzso cancer cell zzso 

zzso side population zzso and zzso cells were detected and isolated from zzso cancer zzso cell line with SP discrimination and zzso surface marker, assisted by zzso activated cell sorting zzso Freshly sorted zzso and zzso cells were zzso into the subcutaneous space of the right zzso zzso of zzso mice and zzso capacity of the cells from two zzso were zzso Cell cycle zzso of the two cell populations were zzso 

zzso and zzso cells accounted for zzso and zzso in zzso cell line, zzso zzso cells formed tumor zzso in 15 of 16 mice and zzso cells in 7 of 16 mice zzso exact test, zzso The mean weight of zzso tumor zzso was zzso and that of zzso tumor zzso was zzso zzso The difference was significant zzso zzso Cell cycle analysis revealed similar cycle zzso between the two zzso 

zzso cells zzso much more cancer zzso zzso potential in zzso mice than zzso zzso The combination of SP discrimination and surface marker selection helped to purify zzso further from zzso cancer cell zzso
