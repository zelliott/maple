Recent studies provide evidence that the zzso zzso of nuclear zzso B, zzso plays a critical role in enhancing the growth of several types of zzso including head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso 

In this study, we examined the effects of a newly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on growth, induction of zzso gene zzso and zzso in two zzso cell lines zzso and zzso which expressed high levels of nuclear zzso zzso 

zzso showed strong growth zzso effects on these two cell lines, with a 50% cell growth zzso zzso concentration of approximately 20 zzso These growth zzso effects were associated with zzso of the zzso zzso Treatment with zzso induced zzso in a zzso manner accounting, at least in part, for the growth zzso by zzso zzso strongly inhibited zzso D1 and vascular zzso growth factor zzso promoter activity and decreased the levels of zzso D1 protein and zzso zzso in zzso zzso In addition, low zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso enhanced the cellular sensitivity of zzso and zzso cells to zzso which is a key zzso agent in the treatment of zzso 

These results suggest that zzso may be effective when used alone or in combination with other agents in the treatment of zzso
