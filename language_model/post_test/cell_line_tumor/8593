The zzso zzso zzso zzso was chemically investigated to identify zzso efficiently zzso zzso melanoma, zzso zzso and lung zzso cells zzso zzso water and ethanol extracts significantly inhibited the growth of the three cancer cell lines in zzso at 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso ethanol zzso devoid of zzso and zzso enabled the collection of eight zzso four of which strongly inhibited cancer cells growth at 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso two zzso inhibited more than zzso of the melanoma cells growth, one inducing zzso in the three cancer cells zzso The detailed analysis of zzso zzso composition resulted in the discrimination of 17 zzso ten of which were unequivocally identified by high resolution mass zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were the three main zzso or derivatives responsible for the strong zzso of zzso zzso in cancer zzso These data point to zzso zzso as a new zzso source to purify potent zzso zzso and demonstrate for the first time the strong zzso activity of zzso and zzso in melanoma zzso
