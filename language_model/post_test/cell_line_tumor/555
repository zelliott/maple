Our previous studies demonstrated that zzso zzso protection against zzso zzso zzso upon zzso zzso however, the mechanisms responsible for this effect are not zzso The present studies reveal decreased zzso membrane potential and increased generation of zzso oxygen species zzso in zzso zzso cells as well as diminution of zzso generation after zzso of a full-length zzso construct into these zzso They also show that zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso in zzso cells by zzso stress or zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso decreases the zzso zzso content in zzso zzso In addition, decreased de zzso zzso synthesis and increased zzso consumption are observed in zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso regulates cellular handling of zzso to effect a survival response to zzso zzso
