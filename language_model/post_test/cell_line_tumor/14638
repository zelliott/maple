The zzso specific zzso 22 zzso is a positive regulator of the growth of zzso However, little is known about the impact of zzso zzso on the growth of human zzso zzso In the present study, we designed a series of zzso interfering zzso zzso and compared the efficacy of zzso and conventional zzso interfering zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso expression and the growth of human zzso zzso cells in zzso and in zzso In comparison with zzso with the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso was more potent in zzso the zzso expression and zzso zzso cell proliferation in zzso Furthermore, zzso with zzso zzso induced higher frequency of zzso cells arrested at the zzso zzso but did not trigger zzso cell zzso Moreover, zzso with either the zzso or zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso and zzso but zzso the expression of zzso E and zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso expression induced by the specific zzso or zzso was zzso by induction of zzso zzso In addition, treatment with the specific zzso or zzso inhibited the growth of implanted human zzso tumors in mice and the zzso had more potent zzso activity in zzso zzso our data suggest that zzso of zzso expression by the zzso may zzso the expression of zzso and zzso zzso resulting in the zzso expression of zzso and zzso and leading to cell cycling arrest and zzso of human zzso zzso cell zzso Our findings indicate that the zzso zzso may be a novel approach for the intervention of human zzso zzso
