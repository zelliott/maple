zzso receptors zzso may be used in lung zzso zzso for diagnosis and therapy, although additional targets are clearly zzso This study aimed to investigate whether zzso zzso zzso zzso may be a potential target for zzso zzso coding sequence was analyzed in zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso zzso transcript expression was investigated in zzso cell lines and frozen specimens by quantitative real-time zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression was evaluated by zzso on zzso sections of 73 typical zzso zzso 14 zzso zzso zzso and 11 zzso zzso and compared with zzso zzso zzso results were rendered zzso on a scale from 0 to 3, taking into account the cellular zzso zzso vs zzso and the percentage of tumor cells zzso vs zzso Our results showed that zzso zzso transcript was expressed in both zzso cell zzso zzso zzso was expressed in 9 out of 12 zzso and 7 out of 9 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected in 85, 71, 25, and zzso of zzso and in 86, 79, 43, and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso scores were higher or equal than those of zzso in zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso Furthermore, in the zzso cases where all zzso zzso were zzso membrane zzso expression was detected in 10 out of 17 zzso and 1 out of 2 zzso Moreover, higher zzso zzso scores were detected in 5 out of 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso the high expression of zzso in zzso makes it a potential novel diagnostic target in zzso zzso
