In zzso cell lung cancer zzso with zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso acquired resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso can occur through a generation of bypass signals such as zzso or zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso activity of zzso a newly developed drug that targets both zzso and zzso in zzso cells with acquired resistance to zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells and evaluation of zzso efficacy in these cells were also zzso The resistance of zzso was zzso by zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso led to resistance in zzso The combination of zzso or zzso with zzso zzso inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell death in both resistant cell zzso zzso suppression of zzso was noted only in the presence of treatment with both zzso zzso was also effective in zzso mouse models of zzso Although the zzso cell line was reported previously to have zzso and zzso amplification, we discovered that zzso was also activated in this cell zzso There were no zzso effects of zzso or zzso specific for zzso or zzso whereas combined treatment with zzso zzso or zzso and zzso controlled zzso cells, suggesting that zzso is the main signal responsible for zzso In addition, zzso inhibited cell proliferation as well as zzso activity in zzso cells with zzso zzso Our results establish the efficacy of zzso in zzso cells rendered resistant to zzso because of zzso or zzso zzso or zzso zzso
