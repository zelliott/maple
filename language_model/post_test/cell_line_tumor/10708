zzso has been shown to be one of the major events involved in EPO zzso zzso EPO might be expressed by cerebral zzso cells, especially in glioblastoma, known to be highly hypoxic zzso The expression of zzso has been described in zzso zzso However, data from the literature remain descriptive and zzso On the basis of an zzso source of EPO in the brain, we have focused on a potential role of zzso in brain zzso zzso In the present study, with complementary approaches to target zzso zzso we demonstrate the presence of a functional zzso system on zzso cells leading to the zzso of the zzso zzso This zzso system is involved in zzso cell proliferation in zzso In zzso we show that the zzso of zzso expression on zzso cells reduces zzso growth and enhances animal zzso Our results support the hypothesis that zzso zzso in zzso cells is involved in the control of zzso zzso
