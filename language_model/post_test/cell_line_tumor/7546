zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso is a critical regulator of various zzso zzso expression was evaluated by Western zzso in 8 paired fresh zzso lung cancer zzso zzso and zzso zzso on 83 zzso zzso zzso was lowly expressed in zzso and significantly associated with zzso zzso zzso clinical stage, zzso zzso status, and zzso zzso analysis indicated that low zzso expression was an independent zzso factor for zzso patients' low survival zzso In zzso after the release of zzso cell line zzso from serum zzso the expression of zzso was zzso whereas the zzso proteins were zzso In addition, we used zzso interference to knock down zzso zzso then observed its effects on zzso growth in zzso Western zzso analyses indicated that deletion of zzso was positively correlated with zzso zzso The present investigation demonstrated that suppression of zzso expression resulted in significant promotion of proliferation in zzso zzso And flow zzso further indicated that loss of zzso promoted cell proliferation by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Besides, the zzso activity of zzso in zzso cells was remarkably enhanced when zzso was knocked down, which suggested that zzso participated in zzso cell proliferation via zzso zzso signaling zzso Based on these findings, we can provide a potential strategy for zzso zzso
