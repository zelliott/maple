Cell division cycle 25 zzso zzso are zzso regulatory proteins which are zzso in a significant number of human zzso This study evaluated the role of zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso of zzso was observed in human zzso specimens and human zzso cell zzso zzso of expression levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid zzso to zzso labeling index in zzso zzso found that zzso labeling index was significantly correlated with the expression of zzso but not with that of zzso zzso of zzso by small interfering zzso and zzso of zzso suppressed cell proliferation and induced zzso in zzso cell lines, indicating that zzso is a potential target for the development of new therapy for zzso
