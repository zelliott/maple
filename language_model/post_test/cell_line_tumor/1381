zzso zzso zzso a constituent of edible zzso vegetables, zzso growth of breast cancer cells but the mechanisms underlying growth zzso effect of zzso are not fully zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso treatment causes zzso zzso death in cultured human breast cancer zzso The zzso breast cancer cells zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso from zzso mice exhibited several features characteristic of zzso including appearance of zzso zzso zzso electron zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso orange zzso zzso of zzso protein 1 light chain 3 zzso and/or suppression of zzso zzso or zzso 1) zzso On the other hand, a normal human zzso zzso cell line zzso was resistant to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso cell viability was partially but statistically significantly attenuated in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso which was fully protective against zzso zzso only partial protection against zzso zzso zzso treatment decreased zzso of zzso and its downstream targets zzso and zzso in cultured zzso and zzso cells and zzso zzso but zzso of zzso by transient zzso of its positive regulator zzso failed to zzso protection against zzso zzso zzso induction by zzso was associated with increased expression and zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso induction and cell growth zzso resulting from zzso exposure were significantly attenuated by small interfering zzso zzso of zzso In conclusion, the present study provides novel insights into the molecular zzso of zzso cell death involving zzso zzso
