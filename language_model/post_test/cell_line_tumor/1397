To investigate the effects of zzso of zzso by zzso interference on zzso cancer zzso cell growth in zzso and in zzso 

A zzso containing zzso against zzso was constructed and zzso into human zzso cancer cell line zzso zzso included the zzso zzso for viability and zzso zzso zzso for invasion, colony formation zzso for cell zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso for protein zzso zzso was observed in zzso 

In zzso cells zzso by zzso zzso zzso as zzso protein expression of zzso was suppressed by zzso In zzso zzso zzso value of zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was lower than that of zzso cells zzso zzso zzso F zzso zzso P zzso zzso In zzso zzso the average invasive cells per field in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso was less than that in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso F zzso zzso P zzso zzso In colony formation zzso the average colony number of zzso cells zzso zzso zzso was lower than that of zzso cells zzso zzso zzso The average tumor size in zzso group was zzso zzso zzso zzso which was less than zzso cell group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso of zzso decreased the expression of focal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso key regulators in cell zzso and zzso 

The zzso of zzso zzso the growth and zzso of zzso cells in zzso and in zzso which may be a promising therapeutic strategy for zzso
