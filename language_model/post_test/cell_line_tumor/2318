zzso was involved in a series of cellular activities, such as the growth and development of skeletal muscle and the zzso zzso was characterized previously as a zzso expressed gene in sodium zzso zzso neural tube defects zzso in chick zzso via zzso zzso zzso However, the role of zzso in the pathological process of nerve cells remained zzso In this study we found differential expression of zzso in zzso chick zzso by Northern zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso inhibited cell zzso and promoted cell zzso in zzso and zzso cell by using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Further investigation revealed that zzso can interact with zzso region zzso of zzso zzso mimics zzso the zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso inhibitor obviously zzso the expression of zzso These findings indicate that zzso of zzso promotes cell zzso and low expression of zzso zzso cell zzso zzso may play an important role in the process of zzso cell zzso
