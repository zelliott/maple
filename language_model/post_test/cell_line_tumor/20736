The outcome of older zzso 60 zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso patients is poor, and novel treatments are zzso In a phase 2 trial for older zzso patients, zzso (20 zzso per day for 10 zzso zzso a DNA zzso zzso produced zzso complete response rate with an excellent toxicity zzso To assess the zzso activity of zzso we zzso zzso and post treatment zzso zzso 1) zzso of zzso samples from patients zzso zzso zzso participating in the trial using zzso analysis of zzso DNA captured by zzso protein zzso zzso significantly reduced global zzso compared with zzso baseline zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blasts did not correlate with global zzso levels, suggesting that zzso was related to the activity of zzso rather than to a mere decrease in leukemia zzso zzso occurred predominantly in zzso islands and zzso zzso regions zzso ranged from zzso to zzso A significant concentration zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso islands was found in zzso zzso regions, suggesting a differential activity of zzso in distinct zzso zzso zzso occurred much less frequently than zzso and was associated with low zzso content zzso zzso zzso changes were zzso with those previously reported in distinct zzso In zzso our study supports the feasibility of zzso analyses as a zzso zzso for zzso zzso
