Both zzso migration zzso factor zzso and zzso protein have been shown to relate with cell invasion and zzso in zzso However, the role of zzso in invasion and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and its relation to zzso expression in zzso are not fully zzso The aim of present study is to determine whether or not zzso and zzso are correlated with tumor invasion and influence a worse outcome in zzso as well as its related zzso 

125 cases of zzso and 45 normal zzso of zzso were zzso The expression of zzso and zzso in tissue zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso as well as the follow-up data of patients, was analyzed zzso The association of zzso and zzso with cell invasion and migration in zzso cell line were evaluated by small interfering zzso zzso zzso invasion zzso and Western zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso was diffused and strong in tumor cells, whereas they were generally weaker and less common in normal lining zzso of zzso High zzso expression in tumor cells zzso zzso zzso were significantly associated with advanced clinical stage, zzso zzso zzso and worse prognosis of zzso zzso High expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso were closely correlated to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Only zzso high expression zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso emerged as strong independent zzso factors for overall survival of zzso zzso In zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso cell lines by zzso was observed to reduce cell migration and invasion potential, however, zzso zzso promoted cells zzso 

The data provided evidence that increased expression of zzso and zzso induced cell invasion and zzso of zzso supporting the idea that zzso and zzso may play important roles as regulators in the progression of zzso
