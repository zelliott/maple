There is increasing interest in the usefulness of block zzso zzso as drug delivery zzso However, their zzso distribution has not been explored zzso mostly because of the lack of adequately labeled block zzso In a previous study, we showed that zzso labeled block zzso zzso entered living cells and zzso with zzso zzso selectively labeled with fluorescent zzso The details of the observed zzso were, however, limited by the resolution of the zzso approach, which is zzso 500 zzso Using transmission electron zzso zzso we established zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso within human embryonic kidney zzso zzso cells and human lung zzso zzso zzso Gold particles were incorporated into zzso zzso zzso zzso Data from dynamic light scattering zzso and zzso analyses revealed that the sizes of the gold particles ranged from 4 to 8 zzso The cells survived up to 24 h in the presence of low zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but cell death occurred at higher zzso zzso kidney cells are more susceptible than lung zzso Over 24 h periods of equivalent exposure, lung cells zzso significantly more zzso zzso than kidney zzso Although zzso were added to the cell culture media as dispersed zzso zzso the presence of serum in these media caused zzso These zzso occurred mainly close to the cell plasma membrane at early times zzso zzso however, at later times (24 zzso zzso particles were seen inside zzso and zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso can serve as a valuable extension of the zzso approach to visualizing the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso improving the resolution by at least zzso
