The zzso 1 zzso zzso is zzso in most melanoma zzso making it a promising target for imaging of zzso In this study, the expression of zzso in a large fraction of patients with melanoma was confirmed using zzso and tissue zzso Here, we have characterized the in zzso tumor and tissue distribution and zzso zzso of zzso and clearance of a zzso specific zzso zzso zzso to a zzso fluorescent zzso We propose an interdisciplinary framework to bridge the different time and space scales of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso probe zzso at the cellular level, a zzso tumor model for whole body zzso and a zzso zzso model for integration and interpretation of experimental zzso Administration of the probe into mice bearing tumors with high and low zzso expression demonstrated zzso image zzso that correlated with expression levels zzso zzso zzso The zzso study showed high kidney zzso as early as 30 zzso zzso The zzso zzso model predicted the presence of receptors in the zzso with a lower zzso but at higher numbers than in the zzso As the mouse kidney is known to express the zzso this hypothesis was confirmed by both zzso of a zzso with higher zzso affinity compared to zzso and by injection of lower probe zzso zzso 1 zzso both leading to decreased kidney zzso of the zzso zzso In addition, through this interdisciplinary approach we could predict the rates of zzso zzso and clearance into and from zzso and tumors, and the amount of injected zzso required to have maximum specific retention in zzso These predictions have potential to aid in the translation of a targeted agent from lab to the zzso In conclusion, the characterized zzso probe has excellent potential for in zzso detection of melanoma zzso The process of zzso marker zzso targeted imaging probe development, and in zzso in zzso and in zzso characterization described in this study can be generally applied to zzso development of targeted zzso
