We applied zzso analysis of zzso zzso expression libraries zzso to cases of zzso zzso cell zzso zzso to identify tumor zzso One of the clones identified was zzso which is known as calcium signal zzso To evaluate the clinical significance of serum zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso the presence of zzso was analyzed by Western zzso using zzso expressed zzso zzso We found that 23 of 75 zzso patients were positive for zzso zzso in terms of zzso showed a significant association with tumor size but not with other zzso zzso The protein expression levels of zzso were much higher in zzso SCC cell lines as compared to those in normal zzso zzso and its immortalized cells although the zzso expression levels were not necessarily elevated in zzso cell lines and zzso zzso studies showed that the expression of zzso protein in zzso SCC specimens was noticeably higher than that found in mild zzso of zzso zzso Thus, zzso seemed useful in the diagnosis of SCC and may be a candidate for serum tumor zzso
