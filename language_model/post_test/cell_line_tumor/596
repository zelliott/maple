To investigate the zzso effect of liver zzso on colon cancer cells in remnant liver in zzso 

zzso models with liver zzso or zzso zzso of colon cancer were zzso animals underwent 37% or zzso liver zzso and were compared with a sham zzso zzso 25, 15 cases, zzso zzso were performed two weeks before zzso zzso were killed 3 weeks after the zzso Total body weight, liver and tumor weights were zzso The human colon zzso cell line zzso was cultured in the presence of portal serum withdrawn 24 hours and 14 days after partial zzso zzso DNA synthesis was assessed by flow zzso analysis for zzso zzso zzso 

The tumor growth was accelerated in the remnant liver in zzso zzso group, but the tumors in 37% zzso group and zzso site were not influenced by zzso Compared with the control group, after cultured 72 hours with portal serum withdrawn 24 h after zzso a higher zzso incorporation was found in the zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and it reached the peak after 120 hours of culture zzso zzso zzso No difference was found between the groups when cultured with the portal serum withdrawn 14 d after zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso may accelerate the growth of residual microscopic tumor in the liver which contributes to local zzso It has no systemic effect and effects on the cancer cell lines in zzso zzso The zzso extension is related to the stimulating effects on the cancer cell line, and zzso zzso is presumably a major zzso
