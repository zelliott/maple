zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso island zzso strains is associated with more destructive tissue damage and an increased risk of severe zzso The zzso encodes a type IV zzso system zzso that delivers the bacterial zzso molecules zzso and zzso into the host cell zzso thereby inducing responses in host zzso It was previously shown that interactions between zzso present on the zzso zzso and host zzso zzso molecules were critical for zzso zzso and the induction of zzso zzso in zzso zzso As the zzso zzso is found in zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso we hypothesized that these zzso may also be involved in the induction of zzso responses zzso by zzso recognition of zzso zzso zzso Indeed, not only did zzso depletion of cholesterol from cultured zzso cells have a significant effect on the levels of zzso and zzso zzso responses induced by zzso zzso bacteria with an intact zzso zzso zzso zzso but it also zzso with zzso zzso delivery to zzso Both of these effects could be restored by cholesterol zzso of the zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated for the first time the involvement of zzso zzso in the induction of zzso responses by zzso zzso Taking the results together, we propose that zzso zzso which is associated with zzso zzso at the host cell surface, is required for zzso recognition of zzso and subsequent induction of zzso responses to zzso zzso These data zzso zzso zzso as a novel platform for zzso delivery of bacterial products to zzso pathogen recognition zzso
