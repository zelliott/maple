zzso zzso can assemble and generate zzso at the plasma zzso but it is also present in zzso where its role remains incompletely zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso and zzso are transported on zzso zzso positive for zzso a zzso involved in fusion events with the plasma zzso zzso of zzso traffic did not prevent viral zzso However, zzso zzso degradation induced an zzso of zzso in zzso and increased viral production zzso indicating that transport of zzso to zzso zzso regulates zzso This also suggested that zzso zzso complexes could access retrograde pathways to the cell surface and indeed, depleting cells of zzso viral zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso transport prevented the zzso of zzso at sites of cellular zzso zzso zzso could thus generate zzso using two zzso either directly from the plasma membrane or through an zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes may be delivered at specific sites to facilitate zzso viral zzso
