We have applied a functional test for zzso zzso genes based on human zzso 3 zzso zzso A9 zzso that were studied in zzso and after growth as zzso in severe combined zzso zzso zzso Previously, we reported that 9 out of the 36 zzso maintained the transferred zzso zzso zzso but lost the expression of the known human zzso fragile zzso zzso gene zzso in contrast to 14 other zzso zzso Here we report the results of the duplex zzso analysis of 9 zzso zzso and 3 parental zzso We have examined the expression of 34 human zzso from known zzso regions of instability, including 13 genes from zzso defined by us previously at zzso and 10 genes from the zzso region at zzso We have found that in addition to zzso expression of the zzso gene from zzso at zzso was lost in all 9 zzso zzso The transcript of the zzso carrier family 38 member 3 gene zzso gene from zzso region at zzso was not found in 8 and was greatly reduced in 1 out of these 9 zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso cell zzso gene zzso gene at zzso was lost in 7 and down regulated in 2 zzso zzso In the zzso derived cell lines treatment with zzso restored the zzso expression of zzso indicating the integrity of DNA zzso zzso that zzso of the zzso and 2 zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso of the zzso zzso were also impaired in all 5 zzso cell lines zzso Our data indicate these genes as putative zzso zzso zzso
