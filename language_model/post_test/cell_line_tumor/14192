zzso tissue zzso following zzso or traumatic brain injury contributes to zzso brain zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso swelling of zzso cells by zzso zzso and zzso by the zzso zzso and the zzso The present study aimed to zzso whether mechanisms of zzso zzso swelling are dependent on zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were exposed to a zzso of pH zzso in standard or zzso medium and following zzso calcium zzso Cell volume and zzso pH were assessed by flow zzso zzso of pH zzso induced a prompt and sustained swelling of suspended zzso zzso cells reaching a maximum of zzso within 60 zzso zzso of zzso from the suspension medium strongly attenuated cell swelling while zzso of zzso zzso had no zzso zzso zzso was not affected by either zzso The present data show a strong dependency of zzso zzso swelling upon zzso zzso while zzso zzso is not affected by omission of zzso zzso our data suggest that the zzso the only so far known zzso involved in cell volume regulation but not in zzso regulation during zzso is activated in a zzso zzso
