Development of efficient therapies of lung cancer and deep understanding of their zzso mechanism are very zzso The aim of the present study is to investigate the therapeutic effect of zzso zzso on lung cancer using in zzso and in zzso zzso 

zzso level of zzso in lung cancer specimens and relative normal zzso was detected by zzso quantitative real-time zzso zzso Invasion zzso cell counting zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis were performed to test the invasion and proliferation of lung cancer cell after zzso The effect of zzso on lung cancer in zzso was validated by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso detection of zzso in clinical samples showed that the relative expression level of zzso in lung cancer zzso and lung cancer cell lines was lower than that in normal zzso zzso of zzso expression plasmids could significantly inhibit the increased cell numbers and invasion of zzso and zzso lung cancer cell zzso Furthermore, zzso was demonstrated to inhibit the expression of zzso through zzso regulation via binding to zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression zzso could promote the proliferation and invasion of zzso and zzso In zzso experiments using nude mice demonstrated that zzso of zzso could significantly decrease the volume and weight of zzso 

zzso exhibited excellent zzso cancer activity in zzso and in zzso and zzso regulation of zzso might be a potential zzso
