zzso was isolated from the Arctic sponge zzso zzso The structure of the compound has been previously zzso However, only limited zzso data are available and little has been reported about the zzso potential of zzso since its zzso In addition, no study has so far aimed at identifying which cellular mechanisms are affected by zzso to generate zzso 

The zzso of zzso was tested against one zzso and ten zzso cell zzso The effects of zzso on key cell division events were studied in sea zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a panel of 131 zzso were further tested for sensitivity to zzso 

zzso zzso cellular growth in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso formation was found in sea zzso zzso exposed to zzso In addition, zzso migration and zzso were severely zzso No effect on DNA synthesis was zzso zzso did not significantly inhibit zzso but did provoke weak zzso zzso of zzso and zzso It strongly inhibited the activity of 1 out of 131 tested zzso (to residual activity zzso zzso with a zzso zzso of zzso for the degree of selectivity of zzso zzso 

These results demonstrate that zzso is a zzso marine compound, which exerts its zzso effects by several mechanisms that include zzso of zzso zzso formation and zzso of protein zzso zzso
