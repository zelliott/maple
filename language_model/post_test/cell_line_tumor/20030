A key step in zzso cell entry is viral penetration of cellular zzso to gain access to the zzso and deliver the zzso to the zzso Yet little is known about this important event in the zzso life zzso Using the zzso protein zzso zzso as a marker of membrane zzso with both zzso and zzso imaging, we demonstrate that in the majority of instances, exposure of zzso and recruitment of zzso to zzso zzso occur early at or near the cell surface and occur minimally in zzso zzso early zzso or zzso late zzso zzso imaging of zzso zzso from zzso zzso occurs most frequently from zzso zzso While the zzso zzso is observed escaping from zzso zzso zzso appears to remain associated with the zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso membrane zzso and zzso escape appear to be both zzso and temporally distinct zzso
