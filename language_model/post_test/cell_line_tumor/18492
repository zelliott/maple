zzso zzso chemicals are known to cause a range of abnormalities in sexual differentiation and zzso One mechanism underlying such effects may be via zzso of zzso activity, which is responsible for zzso zzso A good screening system for identifying zzso zzso has long been zzso We have recently established a human zzso zzso tumor cell line, zzso which possesses a relatively high level of zzso expression and is considered a useful zzso model for investigating the in zzso effects of various chemicals on zzso zzso In this study we screened 55 different candidate chemicals for zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso Only zzso known as both a zzso zzso and a zzso agent, was found to induce zzso activity in association with increased levels of zzso zzso in zzso zzso The effect of zzso was presumed to be zzso by its zzso zzso because it produced an effect equivalent to that of zzso The mechanism underlying the zzso increase in zzso activity appears independent of the zzso zzso A zzso Treatment with zzso another class of zzso agents, also caused induction of zzso in zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso changed zzso cell zzso including the development of cell zzso and a zzso network of zzso These results indicate that zzso is a potential zzso zzso that provides a novel zzso and operates through a zzso zzso
