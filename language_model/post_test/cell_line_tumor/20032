zzso cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the zzso zzso infectious zzso disease virus zzso strains are known to be very zzso for an array of human tumor cell types in zzso and in zzso but the effects of these and zzso zzso strains on pancreatic zzso are little zzso 

Here, the direct zzso effects of the zzso zzso zzso and Ulster zzso zzso strains on 7 human pancreatic tumor cell lines and 4 normal human cell lines were zzso 

zzso zzso used serially diluted zzso to determine minimum zzso plaque forming unit zzso zzso 

For zzso normal human cells were killed only by relatively high doses zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso killed these cells at low zzso zzso zzso zzso Most pancreatic cancer cell types were killed by much lower zzso doses zzso zzso zzso while zzso killed zzso and zzso cultures at very low doses zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

On average, zzso times more zzso was needed to kill normal cells than most pancreatic tumor cells and zzso times more zzso to kill the two most sensitive pancreatic cancer zzso These zzso zzso viruses may have meaningful potential in treating pancreatic zzso
