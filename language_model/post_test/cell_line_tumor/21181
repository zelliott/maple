zzso incorporating the zzso motif constitute an emerging family of potent zzso zzso Although several small molecules containing this zzso have now been identified, the mechanism of cell death induction for some of these compounds is zzso In an effort to define their mechanism of action, and to distinguish zzso within the group of compounds containing the zzso zzso we have created novel zzso small molecules and have evaluated them in a battery of biological zzso Here we show that several zzso and zzso possessing the zzso motif zzso induce death of multiple cancer cell lines in zzso Further zzso evaluating the ability to cause cell cycle arrest, inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in cancer cells, and inhibit zzso zzso zzso channels indicate that zzso compounds can be placed into at least four distinct categories, each with a different mechanism of zzso
