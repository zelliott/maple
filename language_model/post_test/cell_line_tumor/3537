zzso growth and progression are critically controlled by zzso in the zzso often caused by an zzso expression of growth factors and zzso We demonstrated previously that tumor progression in patients and in the experimental zzso tumor model for skin zzso cell zzso is associated with a zzso zzso of the zzso growth factors zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso causing an zzso stimulation of tumor cell proliferation and migration in zzso To analyze the critical contribution of both factors to tumor zzso zzso or zzso was zzso zzso in zzso benign tumor zzso zzso expression of zzso resulted in invasive growth and enhanced tumor cell proliferation in a three-dimensional culture model in zzso yet tumor growth in zzso remained only zzso zzso expression of zzso however, caused a shift from benign to zzso and strongly zzso zzso Moreover, cells zzso from zzso tumors exhibited enhanced tumor aggressiveness upon zzso zzso earlier onset and faster tumor zzso zzso this further step in tumor progression was again associated with the zzso expression of zzso strongly indicating a synergistic action of both zzso Additionally, expression of zzso in the zzso tumors zzso an earlier recruitment of zzso and zzso to the tumor site, and expression of zzso induced an enhanced and persistent zzso and increased the number of zzso and zzso in the tumor zzso Thus both factors directly stimulate tumor cell growth and, by modulating the tumor zzso induce a zzso that promotes tumor zzso
