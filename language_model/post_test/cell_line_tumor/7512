zzso zzso zzso is one of the main upstream zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso that are zzso activated in various zzso and are associated with cell growth, survival, and zzso Here, we investigated the role of zzso in zzso cancer in order to develop effective therapeutic targets for zzso which is the first zzso inhibitor to be approved by zzso After examining the zzso expression levels of zzso and zzso we measured the effects of zzso on the zzso of zzso using western zzso zzso Cell viability was determined using the zzso blue exclusion zzso The cell death mechanism was identified by the zzso of zzso 3 using western zzso and zzso V zzso The zzso levels of zzso and zzso were cancer cell type zzso zzso cancer cell lines that zzso both zzso and zzso include zzso and zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso in zzso cells but zzso only zzso in zzso zzso Cell death was zzso to the zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso causes zzso cell death, which is prevented by treatment with zzso The zzso of zzso zzso seemed sufficient to allow zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso that is involved in colon cancer cell survival and the zzso of zzso by zzso results in zzso zzso in zzso cancer zzso The use of selective zzso zzso could be an attractive therapy against zzso cancer, but further clinical investigations are needed to test this zzso
