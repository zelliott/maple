In this study, we investigated the effects of zzso acid zzso a zzso fatty acid found in most vegetable oils and certain food products, on the growth of zzso human gastric zzso zzso LA treatment resulted in a zzso growth zzso of zzso cells by inducing zzso as evidenced by the formation of zzso bodies, zzso zzso and the zzso cells in the zzso zzso LA treatment induced zzso zzso inhibitor zzso in a zzso manner; however, this compound did not affect the cell cycle zzso zzso zzso chain reaction and western zzso analyses showed that treating the cells with LA caused the zzso of zzso zzso expression and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso cells by LA was found to be associated with an elevated zzso and zzso zzso expression in a zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso of zzso zzso 8, and zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1 protein were noted in zzso zzso zzso The present results indicate that the zzso zzso zzso might be involved in zzso zzso of zzso zzso
