zzso growth of zzso is based on enhanced cell migration and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso is associated with a poor zzso The activated zzso zzso zzso is considered to be indispensable for conversion of zzso zzso 2 into its active zzso We therefore investigated the expression of activated zzso zzso zzso in 9 zzso zzso cell lines, 105 zzso human brain zzso 248 zzso 98 zzso 35 zzso 10 zzso 10 primitive zzso tumors zzso and 36 zzso by zzso and in selected cases by reverse zzso zzso chain zzso zzso between activated zzso zzso zzso expression and tumor grades and entities, proliferation activity, zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso status, zzso zzso zzso promoter status, or association with patient survival were zzso All zzso were strongly activated zzso zzso zzso zzso Numbers of activated zzso zzso zzso positive tumors were higher in zzso zzso than in diffuse zzso zzso but mean expression intensity was significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited reduced numbers of activated zzso zzso zzso tumors and zzso intensity compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso was independent of zzso activity, zzso status, patient survival, and age, whereas zzso with zzso zzso zzso had significantly higher activated zzso zzso zzso levels than their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited significantly reduced activated zzso zzso zzso expression levels compared with zzso In zzso our findings indicate that activated zzso zzso zzso expression levels in zzso are probably linked to other mechanisms than its supposed role as regulator of zzso zzso zzso
