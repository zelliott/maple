zzso DNA zzso deletion zzso was reported in many human zzso However, its biological significance remains to be evaluated and the molecular mechanism needs to be zzso In this study, we analyzed the frequency of zzso in gastric cancer zzso cell lines and zzso as well as zzso oxygen species zzso contents and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression levels in zzso cell lines to explore its biological significance and molecular zzso 

zzso zzso and real-time zzso were used to detect the zzso of zzso in 13 zzso cell lines and 272 human gastric zzso zzso zzso specimens and the respective adjacent normal zzso and 56 normal gastric zzso from zzso zzso We further identified zzso zzso production by flow zzso and zzso expression by zzso reverse zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso analyses were carried out using the zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso 

Based on our earlier study, we zzso the zzso amplification condition by reducing the cycle zzso In this study, we systematically documented the high zzso of zzso in zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso matched normal zzso zzso zzso and normal gastric zzso of zzso patients zzso zzso A significantly higher zzso of zzso zzso was observed in zzso zzso with respect to the adjacent normal zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso and they were both higher than that in normal controls zzso zzso zzso Most importantly, we linked the zzso zzso with the expression level of zzso and zzso zzso The cell lines containing lower expression level of zzso was found to have generally higher frequent zzso and more zzso 

The decreased zzso ability, which leads to increased zzso zzso is correlated with the zzso damage during gastric zzso
