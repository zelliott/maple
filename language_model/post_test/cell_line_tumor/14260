zzso zzso zzso is a critical target for cancer chemotherapy and is one of the most extensively studied zzso for zzso zzso In addition to its critical role in zzso zzso zzso functions as an zzso binding protein to regulate the expression of its own zzso translation and other cellular zzso such as zzso at the zzso zzso In this study, a comprehensive gene expression analysis at the levels of both zzso and zzso regulation was conducted to identify response markers using human zzso array with zzso human colon cancer zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with the human zzso zzso expression zzso 

A total of 38 genes were found to be significantly affected by zzso based on the expression profiles of steady state zzso zzso However, based on the expression profiles of zzso associated zzso zzso over 149 genes were affected by zzso zzso This indicates that additional zzso controlled genes can be captured with profiling zzso associated zzso zzso This unique approach provides a comprehensive overview of genes affected by zzso Additional novel zzso regulated genes affected by zzso zzso treatment were also discovered via similar zzso 

To our knowledge, this is the first time that a comprehensive gene expression profile regulated by zzso and zzso was analyzed at the multiple steps of gene zzso This study will provide candidate markers that can be potentially used for predicting therapeutic outcomes for zzso cancer zzso
