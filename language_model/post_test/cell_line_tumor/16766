zzso is the major cause of poor prognosis in zzso cancer zzso and increasing evidence supports the contribution of zzso to cancer zzso Here, we found that high expression of zzso and zzso zzso was associated with zzso potential of zzso cell lines and poor prognosis in patients with zzso We showed that zzso targeted the known zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso factor 4 zzso in zzso cells, resulting in increased cell zzso and zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso and zzso marker zzso zzso expression was increased in the presence of zzso thereby zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso In mouse models of zzso zzso zzso zzso local invasion and liver zzso effects, which were suppressed by zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso also enabled the colonization of zzso cells at a zzso zzso zzso the signature of a zzso high, zzso low, and zzso low expression profile correlated with the extent of zzso zzso and distant zzso in patients with zzso and served as a zzso marker for zzso recurrence and poor zzso Our findings therefore indicate that zzso repression of zzso and zzso promotes zzso in zzso and this regulatory circuit may contribute in part to zzso tumor zzso Strategies that disrupt this regulation might be developed to block zzso zzso
