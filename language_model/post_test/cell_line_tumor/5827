zzso cell targeting is an important, yet zzso problem in zzso therapeutic applications, like tumor or gene zzso Here, we describe the construction of a novel, zzso A and B zzso zzso zzso strain zzso which expresses protein A of zzso zzso zzso and anchors zzso in the correct orientation on the bacterial cell zzso 

This zzso strain efficiently binds zzso allowing specific interaction of the zzso with the target recognized by the zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso to zzso two clinically approved zzso zzso directed against zzso and zzso respectively, triggers zzso zzso into zzso cancer cell lines zzso the respective zzso zzso subsequent escape into the host cell zzso and zzso replication of these bacteria are as efficient as of the corresponding zzso zzso parental zzso This specific zzso zzso of zzso is shown in the zzso zzso tumor cell line, the zzso zzso cell line as well as the human cancer cell lines zzso and zzso zzso this targeting approach is zzso in a zzso mouse tumor model after zzso the zzso to zzso on the zzso cell zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso may represent a promising approach to target zzso zzso to host cells expressing specific receptors triggering zzso
