zzso exposure to zzso zzso zzso a class of ubiquitous environmental zzso causes zzso zzso The zzso factor zzso element zzso zzso factor zzso plays a critical role in zzso zzso zzso in both neural zzso cells and zzso zzso Here, we investigated the possible relationship between zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso In these cells, chronic exposure to the zzso mixture zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso caused zzso cell death via the induction of zzso but not zzso zzso this effect was prevented by the zzso inhibitor zzso Furthermore, zzso enhanced zzso zzso and protein expression levels after both 24 and 48 zzso zzso zzso by small interfering zzso prevented zzso cell zzso In addition, zzso enhanced the binding of zzso to the zzso 1 gene promoter, and zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso (10 zzso also increased the expression of the two zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso mixture decreased zzso of the zzso proteins zzso and zzso It is noteworthy that the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso A prevented such decreases and reduced the zzso zzso zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso exerts its toxic effect via zzso by zzso zzso 1 and decreasing zzso and zzso zzso
