The zzso growth factor zzso zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso zzso named zzso of Liver zzso zzso Recently it has been demonstrated that zzso supports cell proliferation acting as an zzso zzso This effect is determined by zzso ability to support the zzso gene expression and to preserve cellular zzso zzso We recently demonstrated that the addition of zzso zzso zzso in the culture medium of zzso zzso cells reduces the lethal effects induced by the hydrogen zzso Similar data have been reported in the zzso liver tissue from partially zzso rats treated with zzso The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of the zzso zzso via the degradation of the complementary zzso by the specific zzso on the zzso of the zzso zzso gene and zzso expression and zzso cell zzso and of the zzso zzso parameters zzso oxygen species zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The results revealed a reduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and an increase of zzso zzso activated zzso zzso zzso cell number and zzso zzso These data confirm the zzso role of zzso and its zzso properties, and shed some light on the molecular pathways through which zzso zzso its biological zzso
