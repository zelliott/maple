zzso Cancer zzso is one of the leading causes of death zzso Numerous cellular events, including zzso expression of zzso zzso specifically the family of zzso consisting of zzso b and zzso is known to regulate the processes of growth and zzso 

We evaluated the expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso human colon cancer tissue specimens compared to normal zzso zzso Moreover, we also assessed the expression of zzso in colon cancer cell lines treated with our newly developed synthetic analogue of zzso referred as zzso zzso zzso compared to well known inhibitor of zzso zzso 

We found that the expression of zzso and zzso was zzso in colon cancer specimens compared to normal zzso zzso and the loss of expression was also consistent with data from colon cancer cell zzso This zzso was attributed to promoter zzso because we found that the treatment of colon cancer cells with zzso a zzso zzso markedly induced the levels of zzso and zzso zzso Likewise, zzso was very effective in the zzso of zzso and zzso which was consistent with zzso of cell growth of both zzso and zzso colon cancer zzso The zzso of zzso led to a marked reduction in the expression of its target zzso zzso 

The loss of expression of zzso in colon cancer is in part due to promoter zzso of zzso which can be zzso with our novel agent zzso suggesting that zzso could be a novel zzso agent for restoring the expression of zzso family, and thus zzso could become a newer therapeutic agent for the treatment of colon zzso
