In this paper, carbon zzso zzso are presented as feasible carriers for zzso a therapeutic agent for cancer zzso The drug was introduced into zzso to demonstrate that they are suited as zzso and zzso and can release the drug to zzso its medical zzso 

The filling was accomplished by a zzso approach after the zzso were zzso The effect on cell proliferation and zzso of the zzso zzso was investigated by using a viability zzso 

Using different analysis methods such as electron energy loss zzso and zzso zzso zzso the structure of zzso incorporated into the zzso was found to be zzso In zzso studies showed that zzso zzso inhibited growth of zzso cancer cells whereas unfilled, opened zzso barely affected cancer cell zzso 

A zzso zzso process could be performed successfully within this zzso This highlights the potential of zzso for applications in the field of drug zzso
