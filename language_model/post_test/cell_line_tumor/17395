In this paper we investigate the zzso response after zzso P zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso SP is a zzso and zzso acts as a neurotransmitter and zzso in the nervous system, but zzso triggers zzso zzso cells, such as zzso zzso to release zzso and increase proliferation zzso In this paper we show that SP increases the proliferation rate of zzso zzso cells and the zzso zzso concentration by zzso zzso only from zzso zzso In fact, zzso entry through zzso calcium entry zzso channels, which was observed after zzso treatment, was not detected after stimulation by zzso The zzso of zzso after SP stimulation must be zzso by protein zzso C zzso because it was not observed in the presence of zzso C (an inhibitor of zzso Moreover, stimulation by zzso membrane potential zzso Our results are consistent with the following sequence of events: zzso SP interacts with zzso zzso zzso fast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso overwhelms the zzso by plasma membrane zzso These results have two important zzso In zzso zzso cells the zzso does not contribute to the zzso response after SP, and is not necessarily involved in promoting cell zzso
