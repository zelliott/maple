zzso factors zzso and zzso behave as global regulators during zzso zzso They work together by binding zzso to closely spaced zzso and zzso motifs zzso zzso Recently, it was suggested that a critical zzso target zzso zzso is expressed at lower levels in zzso than in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, due to lower levels of zzso in zzso than in zzso zzso We tested this possibility to better understand how zzso expression is modulated during zzso Although we found that zzso zzso cells express approximately zzso less zzso zzso than zzso zzso cells, we determined that zzso levels do not differ markedly in zzso and zzso zzso zzso We also determined that zzso and zzso work together equally well in both zzso cell zzso Moreover, in contrast to an earlier prediction based on in zzso binding studies, we demonstrate that the function of the zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso genes does not differ significantly in these zzso cell lines when tested in the context of a natural zzso zzso we determined that the zzso promoter is highly responsive to a zzso zzso in both zzso cell zzso zzso the zzso zzso is 7- to zzso less active in zzso than in zzso zzso zzso Because zzso and zzso zzso cells are likely to represent cells at different stages of zzso development, we suggest that this difference in zzso zzso activity may reflect a mechanism used to decrease, but not zzso zzso expression as the early zzso zzso
