Although development of zzso zzso during tissue zzso is known to be associated with tumor invasion, the mechanism by which zzso become resistant to zzso is zzso We previously demonstrated zzso zzso in the zzso around invasive zzso zzso zzso Because zzso promotes cell survival through binding to zzso we hypothesized that invasive breast cancer cells zzso an zzso zzso on zzso by zzso zzso expression during tissue zzso Here, we demonstrate that invasive breast cancer cells induce zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso to zzso an zzso zzso 

Three types of zzso were isolated from the tumor burden, the fibrosis, and normal tissue of patients with early stage zzso (less than 10 zzso zzso designated zzso zzso zzso interface zzso zzso and normal breast zzso zzso zzso To investigate direct and indirect zzso with tumor cells, zzso were zzso with invasive zzso or zzso zzso cells or in zzso zzso zzso resistance of zzso was measured by cell viability and zzso activity after incubation on zzso coated plates for 72 zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso signaling in zzso resistance was confirmed by treatment with zzso zzso or blocking zzso against zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso cells induced zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso leading to zzso zzso zzso showed a higher zzso level of zzso than did zzso and zzso After stimulation with zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso was dramatically increased and maintained under zzso zzso zzso zzso was also observed in zzso and zzso but at a lower level than in zzso zzso induced zzso zzso zzso by binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso zzso and promoted zzso resistance in zzso approximately twofold more effectively than did zzso regardless of the type of zzso In addition, zzso zzso expression suppressed zzso zzso in conditions of zzso 

zzso breast cancer cells zzso an zzso zzso on zzso during tissue zzso by inducing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso appear to be the primary zzso that interact with invasive tumor cells during tissue zzso
