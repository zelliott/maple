During zzso zzso development, the breaking of the initial bilateral symmetry is translated into zzso gene expression around the zzso and/or in the lateral plate zzso The earliest zzso feature of this zzso gene expression cascade is the zzso expression of zzso which depends on the activity of the zzso zzso zzso Here we present a mathematical model describing the dynamics of the zzso zzso zzso during chick zzso zzso which reveals a complex and highly robust genetic network that locally activates zzso on the left side of zzso zzso We identify the source of the zzso zzso of zzso as a transient zzso of zzso zzso which in turn depends on zzso differences in zzso zzso Our results uncover a mechanism by which the zzso zzso zzso translates asymmetry in zzso factors into zzso gene expression around the zzso
