To test the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso rabbit liver tumors increases the expression of zzso zzso zzso a zzso factor that regulates the expression of zzso zzso 

zzso tumors were implanted in the zzso of eight New Zealand white zzso Once tumor growth was seen at zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging, four of the eight rabbits underwent zzso with zzso zzso alcohol zzso The remaining four rabbits served as zzso zzso The zzso end point was stasis of zzso blood zzso All rabbits were sacrificed for tumor harvest 2 hours after zzso zzso tissue and corresponding normal liver tissue in each rabbit liver were stained with zzso zzso zzso zzso and reviewed with light zzso zzso of stained viable tumor and normal liver cells were compared by using the zzso U test zzso 

In eight rabbits with 24 discrete liver tumors, the mean percentage zzso zzso of positive zzso cells in the zzso group was greater than that in the control group zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso liver tissue in both the zzso and control groups showed no zzso zzso 

Although zzso is not expressed in normal rabbit liver zzso after zzso expression is present in implanted zzso rabbit liver tumors and significantly increased in zzso that have undergone zzso
