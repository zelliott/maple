The present study evaluated the regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso by zzso zzso factor zzso zzso under hypoxic conditions in zzso human cells to explore the feasibility of these three genes as tumor zzso zzso cells were cultured under hypoxic and zzso conditions for 6, 12, 24, 36 and 48 zzso The proliferation of zzso cells was evaluated using an zzso zzso The protein and zzso expression levels of zzso zzso and zzso were detected using the zzso zzso method, western zzso and reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso The results revealed that the expression levels of zzso zzso and zzso protein in zzso cells were significantly elevated under hypoxic conditions compared with those under zzso conditions over 36 zzso Under hypoxic conditions, zzso levels of zzso were stable, while zzso levels of zzso and zzso changed over zzso In conclusion, zzso and zzso were zzso by zzso under hypoxic conditions in a zzso manner in zzso cells and their zzso serves as a tumor zzso
