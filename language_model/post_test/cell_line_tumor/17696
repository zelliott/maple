To investigate the effects of DNA zzso on the expression of zzso genes and the cell cycle in human gastric cancer zzso 

Two gastric cancer cell lines zzso and zzso were treated with DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes zzso were detected by using reverse zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso status of zzso gene promoter was zzso by zzso modification and zzso The cell cycle was analyzed by using flow zzso zzso 

zzso induced the zzso of zzso gene zzso The expression of zzso zzso was obviously zzso by treatment with 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso or 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso for 24 zzso However, zzso treatment failed to regulate the expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes in zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso induced the cell cycle arrest in zzso phase in zzso cell, but not in zzso zzso 

DNA zzso regulates the zzso of zzso but not zzso and zzso in human gastric cancer cell lines zzso and zzso
