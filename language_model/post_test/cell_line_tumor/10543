zzso as a member of inhibitor of growth zzso tumor zzso family has potent zzso effects on a variety of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso also shows zzso and zzso zzso zzso In this report, we constructed an zzso zzso zzso zzso and assessed its combined effect on in zzso and in zzso zzso human zzso cell lung cancer zzso We demonstrated that zzso and zzso combination treatment by zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced additive growth suppression and zzso as well as an overlapping effect on zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 9, 3 and zzso of zzso in in zzso zzso lung zzso zzso Moreover, zzso treatment zzso inhibited in zzso zzso lung zzso subcutaneous zzso zzso tumor growth and reduced zzso and zzso density in zzso zzso tumors in zzso nude zzso The enhanced zzso activity zzso by zzso was closely associated with the coordinate zzso of zzso and intrinsic zzso pathways and additive zzso of tumor zzso Thus, our results indicate that cancer gene therapy combining two or more tumor zzso such as zzso and zzso may constitute a novel and effective therapeutic strategy for lung zzso and other zzso
