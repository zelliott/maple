The purposes of this study were the development and zzso evaluation of clinically zzso zzso ultrasound contrast agents based on a zzso zzso with the recognition sequence zzso 

The zzso zzso was zzso through solid phase zzso synthesis and zzso attached to zzso zzso zzso with an air zzso zzso of the zzso surface coverage with peptides was performed through flow zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was investigated in zzso using parallel plate flow chamber zzso on tumor necrosis zzso human zzso vein zzso zzso In zzso imaging was performed in nude mice bearing human zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by ex zzso zzso validation of zzso zzso 

Success of zzso synthesis was validated through zzso reverse phase zzso liquid zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the flow zzso revealed approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the in zzso experiments demonstrated the specificity of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso bound zzso per cell, before and after competition zzso P zzso zzso The in zzso imaging enabled specific assessment of zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso contrast intensity before and after competition, zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso that were zzso coupled to the short zzso zzso zzso enabled specific imaging of the zzso expression in tumor vessels in zzso
