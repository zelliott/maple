The identification of molecules that are zzso expressed in melanoma cells and involved in their zzso zzso is important for understanding melanoma biology and the development of new diagnostic and therapeutic zzso By comparing the expression profile of a melanoma cell line with those of various normal zzso using zzso and by confirming the actual expression of the selected genes by reverse zzso and Northern and Western zzso zzso fatty zzso protein 7 zzso which is frequently expressed in zzso was zzso zzso examination revealed that zzso was expressed in 11 of 15 melanoma zzso By zzso the zzso expression with zzso small interfering zzso in zzso cell proliferation and zzso invasion were suppressed in two of six melanoma cell zzso zzso of zzso in a zzso embryonic kidney cell line zzso by zzso with the zzso zzso resulted in enhanced cell proliferation and zzso invasion, indicating that zzso plays a role in the zzso zzso of some melanoma cell zzso zzso zzso specific for the zzso or bacterial zzso zzso protein were detected in 14 of 25 zzso or in 8 of 31 zzso zzso from melanoma patients, respectively, but not in zzso from healthy individuals, indicating that zzso is an zzso zzso in melanoma zzso These results showed that zzso is frequently expressed in melanoma, may be involved in cell proliferation and invasion, and may be a potential target for development of diagnostic and therapeutic zzso
