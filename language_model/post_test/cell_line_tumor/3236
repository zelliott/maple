The effect of zzso on the growth of human tumor cell, DNA zzso zzso DNA zzso and direct DNA breakage was zzso zzso inhibited significantly the growth of the human tumor cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso values were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stabilized and increased the zzso zzso DNA zzso complex and inhibited the zzso activity of zzso II in a zzso manner, but it failed to affect the activity of zzso zzso zzso directly broke zzso DNA at high zzso but there was no effect on the zzso of zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso targeted specifically to DNA zzso II and that this is one of the mechanisms of its zzso zzso the direct action of zzso on DNA may partly contribute to its zzso activity at high zzso
