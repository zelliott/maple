zzso are locally aggressive bone tumors known to arise from the remnants of the zzso Because zzso are rare, molecular studies aimed at developing new therapies are scarce and new approaches are zzso zzso cells and cancer zzso cells share similar zzso including zzso zzso and resistance to zzso zzso it seems possible that zzso might contain a zzso of cancer zzso zzso The aim of this study is to determine whether cancer zzso cells might be present in zzso 

In this study, the authors used gene expression analysis for common cancer zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and compared zzso cells and zzso with nucleus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso through agents such as zzso zzso acid and zzso differentiation medium was induced to the zzso zzso Additionally, zzso cells were sorted via magnetic cell sorting for stem cell markers zzso and zzso After zzso positive and negative cells for these markers were grown in a zzso environment, soft zzso to determine whether the presence of these cancer zzso cells might be responsible for initiating zzso The results were compared with those of zzso cells in terms of migration, zzso and gene expression by using reverse zzso zzso chain zzso 

The results indicate that zzso cells might be zzso and committing into an zzso lineage when induced with the zzso differentiation zzso zzso cells that are induced with zzso acid showed slower migration and proliferation rates when compared with the zzso zzso zzso cells that were found to be enriched by cancer zzso cell zzso namely zzso and zzso were able to live in a zzso soft zzso zzso demonstrating a zzso zzso To the zzso knowledge, this is the first time that cancer zzso cell markers were also found to be expressed in zzso cells and zzso 

Cancer zzso cell detection might be an important step in determining the zzso and zzso characteristics of zzso This finding may lead to the development of new approaches toward treatments of zzso
