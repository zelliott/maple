Present paper described the effect of human tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso and beta zzso on zzso induced by zzso radiation in human embryonic lung cell line zzso zzso cells and human lung cancer cell line zzso and zzso zzso The results showed that both zzso and zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso or zzso can increase the sensitivity of tumor cell lines zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso the results suggested that zzso and zzso had potential as a therapeutic agent to protect normal cell from the zzso zzso and to sensitize the zzso cells for the damage effect of zzso zzso
