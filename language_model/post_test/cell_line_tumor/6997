zzso of zzso cellular differentiation contributes to zzso Unfortunately, relatively little is known about how cell differentiation is zzso zzso zzso is a novel zzso zzso acid zzso responsible gene that initially isolated from zzso primary human zzso zzso zzso zzso For the notable performance achieved by zzso in the differentiation induction therapy, we investigated the role of zzso in the induction of differentiation of human zzso leukemia zzso Our results showed that zzso was not only regulated by zzso but also by several other differentiation zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso involved in the mechanisms of differentiation along different lineages of zzso leukemia cells arrested at different stages of zzso Generally, zzso was zzso by these zzso in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso interference decreased the induced cellular zzso However, in zzso cells treated with zzso dissimilar with others, the expression of zzso was zzso and the induced cellular differentiation could be enhanced by zzso of zzso zzso zzso works as a potential critical zzso associated with zzso differentiation of human zzso leukemia zzso In zzso cells, zzso may function as a zzso gene during differentiation along the zzso or zzso zzso
