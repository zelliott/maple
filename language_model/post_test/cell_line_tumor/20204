Cell cycle times are vital parameters in cancer research, and short cell cycle times are often related to poor survival of cancer zzso A method for experimental zzso of cell cycle times, or doubling times of cultured cancer cell zzso based on addition of zzso (an inhibitor of cell zzso has been proposed in zzso We use a mathematical model to investigate relationships between essential parameters of the cell division cycle following zzso of cell zzso The reduction in the number of cells engaged in DNA replication reaches a plateau as the concentration of zzso is zzso this can be determined zzso From our model we have derived a plateau log reduction formula for zzso cells and established that there are linear relationships between the plateau log reduction values and the zzso of doubling times zzso growth rates of the zzso We have therefore provided theoretical justification of an important experimental technique to determine cell doubling zzso Furthermore, we have applied zzso Carlo experiments to justify the suggested linear relationships used to estimate doubling time from zzso cell culture zzso We show that our results are zzso to cancer cell populations with cell loss zzso
