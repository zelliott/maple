zzso zzso zzso zzso active cells in tumors may be an excellent strategy to improve the outcome of radiation zzso On the basis of the reported role of zzso as a zzso inhibitor with zzso activity, we tested the therapeutic efficacy of zzso against zzso in zzso The zzso cancer cell line, developed from zzso cell zzso of the zzso was cultured under hypoxic conditions or in the presence of zzso zzso Both treatments induced nuclear zzso of zzso zzso zzso cultured under zzso or hypoxic conditions with and without zzso treatment were zzso and analyzed using flow zzso and zzso zzso In the absence of zzso treatment, zzso induced a greater zzso effect in zzso cells than in zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso effectively inhibited zzso zzso and enhanced the sensitivity of cells to radiation, decreasing the surviving fraction to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed these results, showing that the zzso fraction was increased in zzso hypoxic cells after zzso Our results suggest that zzso treatment may be an effective therapeutic strategy for overcoming the zzso of zzso hypoxic cancer zzso
