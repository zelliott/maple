zzso zzso magnetic iron oxide zzso provide molecular magnetic resonance imaging contrast agents for improving specificity of the detection of human zzso 

The present study reports the development of a novel targeted iron oxide zzso using a zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to magnetic iron oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso This zzso targets zzso zzso which is zzso in breast cancer zzso 

zzso zzso are able to specifically bind to and be zzso by zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso delivery of zzso zzso into mice bearing zzso and zzso zzso tumors leads to the zzso of the particles in tumors, generating a strong magnetic resonance imaging contrast zzso by a clinical magnetic resonance imaging scanner at a field strength of 3 zzso Target specificity of zzso zzso showed by in zzso magnetic resonance imaging is further confirmed by zzso zzso imaging of the zzso tumors using zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides zzso to iron oxide zzso Furthermore, mice administered zzso zzso exhibit lower zzso of the particles in the liver and zzso compared with those receiving zzso iron oxide zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso have potential as zzso targeted, dual zzso imaging agents for in zzso imaging of breast zzso
