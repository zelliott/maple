The main zzso elements that control infection with zzso zzso virus type 1 include zzso zzso cells, and specific T and B zzso The aim of this study was to determine the influence of zzso cells (B cell immortalized by zzso which produce zzso alpha in large amount on zzso of zzso replication in zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso replication was measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso or zzso cells infected zzso inhibited virus zzso Degree of zzso was connected with amount of added cells and with time of addition zzso infection or after zzso The highest zzso of zzso replication showed zzso cells added one hour before infection zzso for zzso infected zzso and zzso for zzso infected zzso
