Members of the zzso family of zzso factors are thought to drive zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, thereby contributing to zzso zzso One zzso in the zzso of pancreatic zzso zzso zzso cells and a potential target gene of zzso is the cellular zzso zzso zzso Using the human pancreatic zzso zzso cell line zzso and the zzso cell line zzso we could show that along with zzso zzso zzso expression is increased in a zzso but not zzso zzso Two zzso recognition motifs in the zzso promoter upstream of the most zzso zzso start site could be verified by gel shift and zzso zzso to interact with zzso zzso zzso detected an increased interaction of zzso with both recognition motifs of the human zzso promoter in zzso zzso cells, whereas binding of Snail was zzso Moreover, zzso zzso with zzso cells confirmed this interaction of zzso with the human zzso promoter and further detected an interaction of both recognition sites with zzso II in a zzso zzso zzso reporter gene zzso using zzso or zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso promoter confirmed zzso zzso by zzso involving both recognition zzso By demonstrating the direct zzso control of zzso expression through zzso during zzso zzso of zzso cells, our findings point to a novel mechanism by which zzso contributes quite early to zzso Moreover, our study is the first one describing the control of the human zzso promoter in tumor zzso
