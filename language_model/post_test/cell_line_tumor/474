Internal zzso entry site zzso translation of input viral zzso is the initial required step for the replication of the zzso zzso of zzso C virus zzso We have shown previously the importance of the zzso sequence near the zzso zzso within the stem and loop IV zzso region in zzso zzso assembly on zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate selective zzso of zzso translation using short hairpin zzso targeting the same site within the zzso zzso zzso showed significant zzso of viral zzso replication in a human zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso a zzso zzso zzso More importantly, zzso of infectious zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells successfully demonstrated a significant decrease in viral zzso in zzso cell zzso Additionally, we report, for the first time, the targeted delivery of zzso zzso into mice liver using zzso zzso and demonstrate selective zzso of zzso zzso zzso provide the proof of concept that zzso zzso could be used for the efficient delivery of zzso into liver tissue to block zzso zzso
