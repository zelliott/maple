zzso stress plays a vital role in the zzso of neurodegenerative zzso Nerve cells are incessantly exposed to environmental stresses leading to overproduction of some harmful species like zzso oxygen species zzso zzso including hydrogen zzso and zzso zzso are potent zzso of various signaling pathways encompassing zzso and zzso zzso In the current study, we scrutinized the effects of hydrogen zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso pathways to zzso the zzso by which each zzso modulated the zzso pathways leading to zzso cell zzso Our results delineated that hydrogen zzso and zzso zzso radical induced distinct responses as we showed that zzso and zzso were activated in response to hydrogen zzso but not zzso zzso zzso indicating the specificity in zzso signaling pathways zzso and zzso We also observed that zzso induced zzso zzso expression and zzso death in zzso cells while zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso Thus, we declare that zzso type has a key role in selective zzso of zzso and zzso pathways in zzso zzso zzso these differential behaviors and mechanisms of hydrogen zzso and zzso zzso functions illuminates the possible therapeutic targets in the prevention or treatment of zzso neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's zzso
