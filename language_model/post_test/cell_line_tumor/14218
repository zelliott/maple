A zzso is an in zzso zzso zzso that provides a zzso resembling that of normal tissue in zzso Although cell zzso molecules such as zzso and zzso have been implicated in participating in the process of zzso formation, little is known about the timing of their zzso In this study, we have employed an zzso quantitative method to investigate the zzso of cell zzso during zzso zzso formation in a dynamic zzso By modulating zzso and zzso activity with specific blocking zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso we show that these cell zzso molecules mediate the formation of zzso through the establishment of complex zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The dynamics of zzso formation can be separated into three zzso In the first stage, zzso fibers act as a zzso zzso for the attachment of dispersed zzso to form loose zzso through the binding of zzso This is followed by a delay period in which cell zzso pause in zzso presumably because of the zzso of sufficient amounts of zzso In the third stage, strong zzso interaction of zzso is a major factor for the zzso transition from loose cell zzso to compact zzso These findings thus provide comprehensive information on the molecular mechanisms and dynamics of zzso zzso zzso
