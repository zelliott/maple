We examined the role of zzso zzso in zzso of nuclear factor zzso zzso and the biological function of activated zzso in gastric zzso zzso 

Human gastric zzso cell line zzso was used to examine zzso zzso by zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which plays an important role in tumor invasion, was assessed by zzso reverse zzso Western zzso and zzso The invasive ability of zzso cells was measured by zzso invasion zzso In zzso expression of zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso in 10 surgically zzso gastric zzso specimens were examined zzso 

zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso and the invasive ability of zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed both zzso expression and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso did not increase the invasive ability of zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso and nuclear zzso was observed in 3 of 10 gastric zzso zzso zzso producing zzso were zzso zzso in two specimens and gastric zzso cells in one zzso 

One of the molecules that may play a role in zzso zzso in some gastric zzso is zzso The present results suggest that zzso increases the invasive ability of zzso cells through zzso of zzso and the resulting zzso zzso
