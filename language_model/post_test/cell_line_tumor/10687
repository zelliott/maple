zzso is designated as type II programmed cell death and may zzso a zzso zzso Our previous studies have shown that zzso factor 1 zzso induced zzso and inhibited tumor growth in gastric cancer zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of zzso on the induction of zzso in gastric cancer zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso zzso expression markedly induced zzso zzso the level of zzso and inhibited zzso and zzso in gastric cancer zzso The zzso of zzso 1 or zzso treatment suppressed zzso zzso but significantly enhanced zzso zzso A zzso inhibitor prevented zzso zzso but significantly increased zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso induced zzso in zzso tumor and inhibited tumor zzso Our results document that zzso zzso zzso through zzso of zzso 1 expression and zzso of zzso pathway, and reveal a new mechanism of zzso tumor zzso
