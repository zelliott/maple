Earlier studies have demonstrated the promising zzso effect of zzso zzso against a series of zzso However, the poor zzso of zzso limits its application, while its zzso makes zzso a potential model drug for zzso zzso We report on a simple way of preparing zzso zzso formed by zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso as a model zzso The mean diameters of zzso zzso zzso zzso were between 110 zzso and 125 zzso with a negative zzso potential slightly below 0 zzso zzso was incorporated into zzso zzso with high loading zzso Different feeding ratios showed different influences on sizes, zzso zzso and the drug loading efficiencies of zzso An in zzso release study shows the sustained release pattern of zzso It is shown that the zzso of zzso is mainly zzso by the zzso of zzso which is more efficient than the zzso of free zzso Further experiments including zzso activated cell sorting and Western zzso indicated that this Trojan strategy of delivering zzso in zzso zzso via zzso leads to enhanced induction of zzso in the zzso cell lung cancer cell zzso line; enhanced zzso is achieved by zzso the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso more efficiently inhibit the ability of cell migration and invasion than free zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso data from this study not only confirms the potential of zzso in treating lung cancer but also offers an effective way of improving the zzso efficiency of zzso by zzso delivery zzso
