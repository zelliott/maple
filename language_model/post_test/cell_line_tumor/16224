The zzso zzso zzso is expressed in a subset of prostate zzso cells and functional zzso cell zzso is required for normal prostate zzso and influences the growth of prostate zzso Although we are broadly aware of the specifics of the zzso actions of zzso in prostate cancer cells, relatively little is known regarding the gene targets of functional zzso in prostate zzso zzso Here, we describe a novel human prostate zzso cell model that enabled us to study the effects of zzso on gene expression in these zzso The model involves a genetically manipulated zzso of immortalized human zzso prostate zzso cells that zzso zzso zzso zzso at a level comparable to zzso cells and is responsive to zzso zzso zzso Use of zzso cells for gene expression profiling showed that the presence of zzso even in the absence of zzso significantly altered the gene expression pattern of the cells compared to control zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells, but not zzso control cells, with zzso resulted in further changes that affected the expression of 141 genes by zzso or greater compared to vehicle treated zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly zzso more genes than were zzso but many of these changes reversed the initial effects of zzso zzso alone on individual zzso The genes most highly zzso by zzso treatment were zzso based upon their role in cancer pathways or in cell signaling pathways zzso growth zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso thought to be involved in zzso zzso during prostate or prostate cancer zzso zzso treatment of zzso cells was also sufficient to alter their zzso potential for prostate cancer cells as zzso medium from zzso zzso significantly increased growth of zzso cells compared to zzso zzso cell zzso zzso
