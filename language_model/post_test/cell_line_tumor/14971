The zzso interaction between the surface of gold zzso zzso and zzso is a significant problem in zzso zzso In this work, a novel surface modification strategy was performed using zzso oxidized zzso zzso to modify the zzso through robust zzso bond zzso The zzso were stable in zzso solution over a broad range of pH and high zzso strength zzso zzso the zzso coating greatly reduced zzso protein zzso on zzso due to zzso In order to target tumor sites, zzso acid zzso and zzso B zzso dye were zzso to zzso modified zzso through the reaction between the activated zzso group and the zzso zzso The targeting of zzso in human cervical zzso cells zzso zzso with high-level folate zzso expression was confirmed using zzso laser scanning zzso zzso to zzso zzso B dye at zzso zzso The targeting zzso therapy efficacy was monitored in real time with the zzso function of a zzso laser scanning microscope coupled with an zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that the zzso hybrids demonstrate efficient zzso conversion and excellent targeting zzso and are therefore suitable for biomedical zzso
