zzso zzso 1 zzso is an zzso zzso that is a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of bone zzso proteins zzso and zzso activity of the zzso zzso stress and zzso decrease zzso expression whereas voluntary exercise increase zzso gene expression in the mouse zzso Here, we studied the underlying molecular mechanisms by which zzso regulates human zzso gene zzso When cells were subjected to zzso the expression of zzso zzso was zzso in zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed the presence of zzso responsive elements zzso at position 625 that was essential for zzso of zzso expression under hypoxic zzso The binding of zzso factor zzso protein to the zzso was confirmed by gel shift zzso These results indicate that the zzso motif is directly involved in the zzso of the zzso zzso under hypoxic zzso
