zzso laser therapy has become popular in clinical applications including promoting wound healing and pain zzso However, effects of this zzso on human zzso cells are rarely zzso Previously, we found zzso zzso zzso aluminum zzso zzso continuous wave laser had an zzso effect on the proliferation of human zzso cell lines zzso and zzso at the energy density of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible mechanism of action of this zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells were cultured in zzso plates for 24 zzso After zzso by 130 zzso zzso zzso zzso continuous wave laser for different time intervals zzso 30, 60, 90, zzso zzso and 180 zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso were used to examine the expression and distribution of zzso and zzso zzso The cell counts as well as zzso and zzso expression of zzso and zzso cells were reduced by zzso at the energy density of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the architecture of zzso and the distribution of intermediate zzso proteins zzso and zzso were zzso by zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso continuous wave laser at the energy density of zzso and zzso zzso inhibited the survival of human zzso cell zzso The mechanism might reduce synthesis of zzso and zzso zzso zzso synthesis might further reduce the proliferation rate of these zzso zzso zzso synthesis might result in the destruction of the zzso zzso the net effects by this zzso were reduced cell zzso
