Four zzso zzso coded zzso zzso zzso and zzso with different molecular weights were isolated from four kinds of zzso bodies of zzso zzso The four zzso were zzso to obtain derivatives zzso having degrees of substitution zzso from zzso to zzso zzso The structure of the samples was analyzed by infrared zzso zzso analysis, and zzso zzso The zzso molecular weight zzso zzso of zzso zzso and intrinsic zzso zzso of the native zzso and zzso derivatives were measured by zzso zzso combined with laser light scattering zzso zzso and zzso in zzso M zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso containing zzso M zzso at 25 degrees C zzso The zzso values of the zzso derivatives were much lower than those of the native zzso The experimental results indicate that the zzso derivatives are zzso and exist as an expanded flexible chain in zzso solution zzso to zzso hydrogen bonding or interaction between charge zzso The in zzso and in zzso zzso activities of the native zzso and their zzso derivatives against solid tumor zzso 180 cells were evaluated and zzso Interestingly, all of the zzso derivatives exhibited higher zzso activities than those of the native zzso The results reveal that the effect of zzso of the zzso on the improvement of their zzso activities was zzso
