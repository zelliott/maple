zzso an zzso zzso member, has been cloned from a zzso zzso library as a gene product that promoted zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso by membrane type zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso in zzso cells increased the zzso level of zzso zzso with the zzso of the zzso at the zzso site to shed the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with the zzso gene expressed a higher level of zzso and showed more invasive ability in collagen gel than the control zzso zzso was zzso in zzso cells, which was blocked by the administration of zzso inhibitor zzso or zzso of small interfering zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso expression is relatively high in some zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso for zzso into oral zzso zzso zzso cells, which express zzso and zzso genes reduced the expression of not only zzso but also zzso and attenuated invasive growth in the collagen zzso These results suggest that zzso contributes to zzso growth in the collagen zzso by zzso cell surface zzso
