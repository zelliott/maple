The occurrence of zzso is a critical zzso of the prognosis for breast cancer zzso zzso treatment of breast cancer zzso is hampered by a poor understanding of the mechanisms involved in the formation of these secondary tumor zzso To study the processes of zzso valid in zzso tumor zzso models are zzso Here, we show that increased expression of the zzso zzso in the zzso rat zzso tumor zzso is essential for efficient lung zzso formation in the zzso mouse zzso zzso expression resulted in delayed zzso tumor growth but at the same time strongly enhanced zzso and lung zzso Previously, we demonstrated the critical role of zzso cells in a lung zzso model using zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso However, this model is incompatible with human zzso Using the highly zzso zzso zzso zzso we report that only zzso mice, which lack zzso cells, allow efficient lung zzso from primary tumors in the zzso zzso In contrast, in nude and zzso mice, the remaining innate immune cells reduce zzso lung zzso zzso Furthermore, we confirm this finding with the zzso transplantation of the zzso mouse zzso tumor zzso Thus, we have established an improved in zzso model using a zzso zzso mouse strain together with zzso cells that have increased levels of the zzso zzso which enables us to study zzso tumor cell autonomous mechanisms underlying lung zzso zzso This improved model can be used for drug target validation and development of new therapeutic strategies against breast cancer zzso zzso
