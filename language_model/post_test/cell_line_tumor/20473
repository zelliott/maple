zzso zzso is an zzso zzso protein that exerts tumor zzso functions in breast cancer, where its decreased expression is a feature of advanced zzso However, neither its role nor mechanism of action in breast cancer zzso has been zzso Bone zzso proteins zzso which constitute zzso of the zzso zzso are zzso zzso that induce zzso transition, cell invasion, and zzso In this study, we identify a zzso zzso signaling zzso that controls the ability of the zzso zzso zzso to regulate zzso zzso and invasion of breast zzso zzso zzso of zzso in human zzso zzso cells led to zzso zzso as a major response to exposure to the zzso zzso zzso zzso also induced zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in breast cancer cells antagonized zzso zzso zzso and invasive capacity, both by binding zzso protein as well as decreasing zzso protein zzso zzso on zzso and zzso were confirmed in zzso where they correlated with decreased zzso In clinical zzso we found that zzso expression was zzso associated with zzso and zzso levels in zzso of invasive breast zzso zzso consistent with the functional zzso Together our findings identify a novel modifier zzso through which zzso acts to limit breast cancer invasion and zzso
