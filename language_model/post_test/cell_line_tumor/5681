It is known that some zzso show platinum complex resistance and that others show platinum complex sensitivity among zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an active zzso agent consisting of zzso zzso zzso synthesis and results in zzso zzso We investigated the difference between an zzso zzso cancer cell line, zzso and an zzso zzso cancer cell line, zzso using DNA zzso zzso The zzso cell line, zzso was established by using zzso cells derived from human zzso zzso of the zzso Acquisition of platinum resistance in human zzso cancer cells thus appeared to be related mainly to the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso II and zzso zzso zzso and partly to that of zzso I and zzso zzso zzso zzso in addition to a decrease in platinum zzso zzso cells had zzso and zzso higher zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso II genes than zzso cells, while zzso had only a slight increase in the zzso zzso zzso zzso level as compared with zzso In comparison of the gene expressions between zzso and zzso zzso cancer cell lines, zzso zzso E zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso in zzso compared to zzso These genes are zzso in zzso an zzso gastric cancer cell line, compared to zzso an zzso gastric cancer cell zzso zzso is zzso increased in zzso cells compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso is increased zzso in zzso cells compared to zzso zzso The zzso directed to the zzso gene and zzso zzso gene enhanced the zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso cancer cell line zzso These results show that the zzso gene and zzso gene have potential as zzso zzso It is necessary to check the effect of zzso to influx or zzso It has potential to enhance the effect of zzso agents to resistant cancer cells, so we will proceed to develop an inhibitor of these zzso and zzso zzso
