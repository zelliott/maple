zzso zzso zzso zzso is a plant of tropical region used in Indian traditional medicine for the treatment of human ailments including abdominal zzso zzso zzso zzso disorders, zzso This plant also has zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

This study aimed to assess the zzso and zzso properties of methanol extract of zzso zzso zzso in zzso breast cancer cell zzso 

The effective concentration range of zzso on cell viability was analyzed using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was carried out to confirm the competitive binding of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso on the expression of a selected zzso responsive gene zzso was analyzed by zzso The ability of zzso to alter the cell cycle zzso and zzso were studied using zzso zzso 

Treatment with varying zzso of zzso zzso zzso resulted in moderate to very strong growth zzso in zzso cell zzso zzso zzso with zzso for binding to zzso with zzso value of 320 zzso 25 zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso reduced the zzso expression of zzso indicating the zzso action of zzso zzso treatment for 48 h resulted in a remarkable increase in the number of zzso cells in the zzso fraction from zzso to zzso with a zzso decrease of cells in all other zzso indicating cell cycle arrest at zzso zzso 

The results demonstrate that zzso zzso possess zzso and zzso properties and suggest that it may have therapeutic potential in zzso dependent breast zzso
