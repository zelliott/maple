The zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso regulate many biological processes by zzso and converting environmental zzso into zzso zzso Although the mechanisms by which zzso sense cellular signals are zzso little is known regarding how zzso contribute to the regulation of zzso zzso zzso Here we show that these dynamic regulators, unlike other zzso independently direct either zzso zzso selection or zzso zzso depending on the cell type or promoter zzso Moreover, in other scenarios, the zzso zzso zzso regulate zzso and zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso possess distinct functional zzso responsible for regulating either zzso zzso or zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso lacks the zzso domain and is incapable of altering zzso selection despite robustly zzso zzso The differential usage of these distinct zzso allows zzso to selectively mediate multiple zzso of gene regulation, indicating that zzso are not solely restricted to zzso alternative zzso with increase in zzso zzso
