The role of zzso in the genesis of zzso cancer remains unclear although a rather protective zzso has been zzso zzso studies indicate a possible increase in the risk for combined zzso as compared to zzso zzso It is zzso whether a difference exists within the various zzso Apart from sex steroids, growth factors play a crucial role in the genesis of zzso cancer, although as yet little zzso In the present study we have explored the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on the proliferation of human zzso cancer cells alone and in the presence of growth zzso 

For the experiments human zzso cancer cells zzso were zzso The zzso were tested at the zzso of zzso to 10 zzso The growth factor mixture consisted of zzso zzso and zzso each at a concentration of 10 zzso The incubation time was three or seven zzso zzso rate was measured by an zzso 

After three days' incubation the growth factors induced an increase in the proliferation rate of about zzso zzso alone did not show any significant change as compared to the control values, whereas zzso and zzso zzso a significant increase at 1 and 10 zzso and at 1 zzso zzso In the presence of growth factors none of the zzso was able to inhibit the zzso zzso After seven days' incubation the growth factors still showed an increase of about zzso zzso alone had an zzso effect at 10 zzso for zzso and P no effects were zzso Again in the presence of growth factors no zzso was able to show an zzso zzso 

Our results indicate that zzso do not have a protective role on the growth of pre-existing zzso cancer cells, at least in the presence of growth zzso Further investigations are zzso to evaluate possible differences between the effect of the various zzso
