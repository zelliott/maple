zzso therapy zzso employing zzso zzso acid zzso as a precursor of the zzso zzso IX zzso is used for the treatment of non melanoma zzso cancer zzso However, one of the problems of zzso is the apparition of resistant cell zzso The aim of this study was to isolate and characterize zzso zzso cells zzso resistant to zzso with zzso The zzso parental population was submitted to successive cycles of zzso and 10 resistant populations were finally zzso In parental and resistant cells there were analyzed the cell zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso content zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso the capacity of closing wounds zzso wound zzso the expression of zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso and the inhibitor of zzso protein zzso in the activated form as zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso The results obtained indicate that resistant cells showed a more zzso zzso few differences in zzso content of the zzso higher capacity of closing wounds, higher number of stress zzso more expression of zzso zzso proteins and higher expression of zzso than parental zzso These distinctive features of the resistant cells can provide decisive information to enhance the efficacy of zzso applications in clinic zzso
