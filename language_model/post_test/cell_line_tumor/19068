zzso resistance zzso is associated with the overproduction of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso caused by zzso zzso However, the activity of the zzso promoter in response to different doses of zzso radiation has not been zzso In this study, two zzso cell zzso oral cavity cell lines, zzso and zzso were exposed to either a standard clinical dose of 2 zzso or zzso zzso radiation therapy zzso delivered as zzso zzso in four zzso zzso gene expression and degree of cell death were zzso zzso relevant zzso dose of radiation resulted in increased expression of zzso by reverse zzso and zzso reporter zzso in both cell lines zzso and zzso whereas zzso did zzso zzso caused enhanced zzso when compared with the zzso dose in zzso and zzso cells as assessed by terminal zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene is regulated by numerous zzso factors, which include nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor 1), zzso and zzso Interestingly, 2 zzso robustly induced both zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso cells, but did not show induction when exposed to zzso zzso the expression of the DNA binding zzso of zzso zzso by small interfering zzso zzso resulted in a decrease of zzso function by zzso 123 zzso zzso in zzso cells exposed to 2 zzso Together, these results provide evidence for the lack of induction of zzso expression by zzso which has important implications in zzso cancer therapy, including the use of zzso as an zzso for zzso
