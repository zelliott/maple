Due to recent advances in zzso technologies, data on various types of zzso zzso have zzso These data will be zzso helpful for zzso the zzso logic of zzso Although several approaches have been proposed for zzso zzso among multiple factors, most approaches are haunted by the issues of zzso and threshold zzso 

In this article, we propose a zzso zzso statistical test for measuring the effects between two gene zzso This method is free from the issues of zzso and threshold value determination for gene expression zzso Furthermore, we have proposed an efficient zzso chain zzso Carlo method for calculating an approximate significance value of zzso We have applied this approach for detecting synergistic combinations of zzso factor binding motifs and zzso zzso 

C zzso of the method is available from zzso
