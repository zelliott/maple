To investigate zzso induced zzso and its mechanism of action in zzso cell zzso 

zzso cells were cultured in zzso medium and treated with zzso in different zzso zzso zzso was used to detect growth zzso zzso zzso and DNA ladders were used to detect zzso Western zzso was used to observe the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso inhibited proliferation of zzso zzso zzso cells with zzso value of zzso zzso The results of flow zzso showed an zzso of zzso cells in zzso phase in response to zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso resulted in DNA zzso The expression levels of protein zzso and zzso decreased following zzso treatment in zzso cells, whereas zzso and zzso protein expression were unaffected after treatment with zzso 

These results suggest that zzso induced cell cycle arrest at zzso phase and zzso of zzso cells which was associated to zzso zzso
