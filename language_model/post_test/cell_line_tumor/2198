zzso soluble zzso zzso levels are characteristic of melanoma zzso zzso where tumor cells interact intimately with host zzso zzso zzso to the blood vessel wall is promoted by immune cell arrests and zzso zzso a zzso zzso that converts soluble zzso zzso into zzso However, the molecular requirement for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso interactions under zzso flow conditions remain zzso To understand this process, we studied the relative binding capacities of zzso and zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed on melanoma cells, zzso on zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso on zzso Using a zzso flow chamber, highly zzso melanoma cells zzso and zzso and human zzso were zzso over an zzso zzso expressing zzso in the presence of zzso or zzso It was found that both the frequency and lifetime of direct melanoma zzso or zzso melanoma zzso to the zzso in a zzso flow were increased by the presence of zzso in a zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso D and zzso zzso failed to increase melanoma zzso zzso that zzso cell zzso requires zzso zzso zzso Finally, analysis of the respective zzso of zzso binding to zzso zzso and zzso by single bond cell zzso zzso suggested that zzso and zzso are responsible for initial capture and firm zzso of melanoma zzso These results provide evidence that zzso enhances melanoma zzso directly to zzso on the zzso while prolonged zzso melanoma zzso requires interactions with zzso
