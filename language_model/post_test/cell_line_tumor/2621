zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling is a common feature of multiple tumor types, including zzso zzso As such, zzso has emerged as an attractive target for zzso zzso In the present study, we sought to develop an zzso capable of specifically targeting zzso cells and zzso zzso of cell growth and cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was chosen to generate a fusion zzso zzso based upon its potent protein synthesis zzso and small size (5 zzso zzso was fused to the zzso of an zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein was expressed in zzso coli, and zzso and zzso on an immobilized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso and Western zzso analysis revealed that zzso was sufficiently zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso demonstrated that zzso bound specifically to zzso cells zzso as almost no binding to zzso zzso zzso was observed under identical time and dosage zzso Finally, the zzso cell viability zzso showed that zzso zzso obvious zzso toward zzso tumor zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso is biologically active and specific toward zzso tumor cells and may represent an effective zzso cancer zzso
