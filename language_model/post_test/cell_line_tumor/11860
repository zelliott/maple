zzso cancer stem cells zzso offer theoretical explanations to many clinical and biological behaviors of the disease in zzso In contrast to approaches of using side populations and zzso markers to isolate and characterize the putative zzso we zzso that zzso deprivation leads to functional enrichment of putative zzso 

Human prostate cancer lines zzso zzso and zzso were depleted of zzso in cell cultures and in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso in particular in zzso and its zzso cell lines, displayed increased expression of zzso zzso and significantly higher zzso Individual tumor cell clones were isolated from zzso bulk cultures of zzso zzso and tested for zzso in male zzso mice under limiting dilution zzso As few as zzso were able to form spheres in zzso and generate tumors with similar growth zzso as zzso zzso or zzso zzso cells in zzso These putative zzso were zzso zzso and lack the expression of prostate lineage zzso When transplanted into the prostate of an intact male zzso zzso these putative zzso seemed to show limited differentiation into zzso , zzso , zzso zzso , and zzso zzso On the other hand, stable zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso led to zzso resistant growth and zzso of major prostate lineage gene products in zzso 

zzso of zzso of zzso zzso and resistance to zzso deprivation supported the role of putative zzso in the emergence of prostate cancer resistant to zzso zzso
