Recent evidence suggests that zzso therapy is sensitive to zzso status in tumors, implicating a role for zzso in the regulation of zzso Here we show that zzso zzso activates the zzso collagen zzso zzso zzso resulting in the zzso release of zzso fragments of collagen type 4 and zzso zzso media from cells zzso expressing either zzso or zzso selectively inhibited growth of primary human zzso zzso When expressed zzso or zzso delivered, zzso significantly inhibited tumor growth in zzso Our results reveal a genetic and zzso linkage between the zzso tumor zzso zzso and the synthesis of zzso collagen zzso
