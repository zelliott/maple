This study was conducted to measure the levels of 23 zzso zzso and 6 zzso pesticides zzso in human milk and three food types collected from zzso and zzso in Zhejiang Province, zzso An effort was also made to explore the potential health risk for the mothers and zzso infants living in these two zzso zzso was selected as the sampling site because it is the largest place for the zzso of obsolete zzso and electrical waste in zzso zzso located 100 zzso zzso of zzso is not known to be a place for any electronic or electrical waste and hence was chosen as the control zzso Both localities are important agricultural places in the zzso The zzso were measured in the samples using the zzso zzso zzso zzso method was also used as a complement of the chemical analysis to estimate the zzso levels of zzso zzso in human zzso The data showed that the human milk, rice, zzso egg, and fish samples from zzso were more heavily contaminated with zzso than those from zzso suggesting that the mothers and their zzso infants in zzso tended to receive greater exposure to zzso than those living in zzso The zzso levels in the two localities were found comparable, suggesting that the major source of contamination with these pesticides was from their agricultural zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was found between the zzso and chemical analysis method, suggesting that zzso is an effective method for comprehensive determination of zzso levels in human zzso zzso with literature data showed that the zzso levels in milk samples from zzso were significantly higher than those from localities in other Chinese provinces and comparable to those in developed or zzso zzso
