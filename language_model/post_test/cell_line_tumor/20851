Studies in transgenic mice revealed that zzso induced by zzso prion zzso propagation is dependent on zzso expression of the cellular prion protein zzso On the other hand, there is evidence that zzso itself has a zzso zzso Here, we show that the toxic activity of zzso and the protective activity of zzso are zzso With a novel zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso can induce zzso zzso in zzso zzso However, cells expressing zzso zzso with an impaired zzso activity were resistant to zzso zzso We also show that the internal zzso domain promotes zzso formation of zzso and that zzso of zzso is linked to its zzso zzso zzso zzso defective in zzso formation did not zzso enhanced stress zzso Moreover, in chronically zzso zzso cells the amount of zzso zzso zzso correlated with the amount of zzso and the resistance of the cells to various stress zzso Our results provide new insight into the mechanism of zzso zzso and indicate that pathological zzso zzso abuse zzso pathways for zzso zzso
