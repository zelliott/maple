In the present article, we describe a zzso study of a novel zzso of zzso zzso in two human zzso cancer cell lines differing in zzso gene zzso We used a zzso approach based on two-dimensional gel zzso coupled with mass zzso to complement the results obtained by common molecular biology methods for analyzing cell zzso cell cycle, and zzso Tested zzso zzso inhibited colon cancer cell growth, zzso zzso gene status seemed to be critical for its differential response zzso DNA damage and zzso stress are likely to be the common triggers of molecular events underlying its zzso zzso In zzso 116 zzso zzso this compound induced a zzso response resulting in zzso of the zzso and zzso cells and induction of zzso via both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso triggered zzso zzso zzso arrest in zzso zzso cells zzso and succeeding zzso transition, zzso these cells underwent cell death probably due to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso approach used in this study proved to be a valuable tool for investigating cancer cell response to newly zzso compound, as it specifically unraveled some molecular changes that would not have been otherwise detected zzso zzso of the zzso zzso response marker zzso in zzso 116 and impairment in zzso zzso in zzso Finally, zzso effects of tested zzso zzso on zzso cells strongly support its possible role as an zzso agent and encourage further in zzso studies on the zzso potential of this compound against zzso zzso
