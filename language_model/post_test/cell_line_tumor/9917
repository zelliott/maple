zzso is a zzso protein that mediates intrinsic zzso zzso Using a zzso functional screening approach, we identified zzso gamma zzso beta chain zzso as a new zzso zzso zzso is a component of the zzso zzso complex along with the zzso alpha chain zzso Upon zzso zzso a zzso change in the zzso complex occurs that activates the zzso signaling zzso We found that the zzso region zzso acids zzso of zzso zzso contains a novel zzso zzso zzso This portion does not contain the zzso zzso therefore, the zzso function of zzso is independent of zzso zzso zzso rescued human cells from zzso induced by zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso of zzso zzso type and zzso rescued cells from zzso and zzso which are known to induce zzso cell zzso Interestingly, zzso inhibited zzso induced by the zzso protein zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso zzso through a zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso from cell zzso prepared from zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, direct binding of zzso zzso proteins of zzso and zzso was also zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein to cell zzso significantly reduced the interaction of zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso bind a similar domain of zzso We found that the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is expressed in human cancer cell lines of zzso cancer zzso breast cancer zzso and prostate cancer zzso zzso The presence of the zzso zzso of zzso may zzso on cancer cells resistance to zzso zzso Our discovery of the zzso activity of the zzso domain of zzso may shed new light on the mechanism of how cell death is controlled by zzso and zzso
