zzso zzso zzso is a novel zzso modification regulating a diversity of cellular zzso including zzso functions, but the roles of protein zzso zzso zzso in human cancer are not well zzso To address this issue, we first examined expression levels of genes belonging to the zzso family and found significantly higher expression of zzso and zzso both of which are Type I zzso in cancer cells of various zzso than in zzso zzso zzso of the expression of these genes with specific zzso significantly suppressed growth of zzso and lung cancer zzso zzso profile analysis using the cells zzso with the zzso indicated that zzso and zzso interplay in multiple zzso supporting regulatory roles in the cell cycle, zzso processing and also DNA replication that are fundamentally important for cancer cell zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that serum zzso zzso zzso levels of a number of cancer cases are significantly higher than those of zzso control zzso In zzso our results suggest that zzso of zzso and zzso can be involved in human zzso and that these Type I zzso zzso are good therapeutic targets for various types of zzso
