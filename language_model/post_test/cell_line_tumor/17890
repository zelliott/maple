zzso current zzso measurement is used to zzso zzso zzso zzso This technique provides a direct measure of net charge transport across a cell zzso zzso however, lacks chemical zzso zzso resolved zzso zzso may be much greater than zzso and differ in different biological zzso This work describes a novel experimental approach and zzso method to obtain temporally resolved zzso zzso at zzso cell zzso zzso cells, a zzso clone of the human zzso cancer cell line zzso was used as a model cell line to validate this approach in the context of zzso transport zzso This cell line is known to zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso Changes in zzso concentration after stimulation with 1 zzso zzso plus 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso are recorded with a zzso zzso zzso zzso at a short distance zzso 50 zzso from the zzso The recorded zzso are transformed to corresponding zzso flux across the zzso using a zzso zzso for zzso mass transport based on zzso of the shape error function zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso clamp yields the associated net electrical charge flux zzso The dynamics of zzso flux did correlate with that of the electrical zzso but was found to be greater in zzso This suggests that zzso may not be the only zzso zzso The method of simultaneously assessing zzso and electrical zzso with a zzso resolution of seconds provides unique information about the dynamics of zzso zzso across the zzso zzso
