The zzso and zzso zzso zzso are expressed on bone zzso zzso stem cells and have important roles in stem cell regulation and zzso Although the roles of zzso zzso have been thoroughly investigated with respect to zzso function, the role of zzso zzso remains poorly zzso Small zzso fluorescent zzso are useful tools for monitoring biological processes in zzso to determine zzso protein zzso and zzso and to zzso the mechanism of small zzso zzso protein zzso zzso we report the design, synthesis and zzso cell binding properties of a new fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso which was based on a series of zzso zzso zzso and assembled using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso human zzso zzso cells, we show that zzso exhibits high zzso binding affinities to zzso zzso with potent zzso against zzso zzso under zzso mimicking zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed distinct differences in the binding zzso between zzso and zzso zzso which showed faster binding to zzso zzso relative to zzso but more prolonged binding to the zzso Finally, we show that zzso was capable of binding rare populations of bone zzso zzso stem and zzso cells when administered to zzso Thus, zzso represents a useful zzso fluorescent zzso probe that can be used for zzso screening small zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso investigating the zzso properties of zzso and zzso zzso binding and zzso investigating zzso expression and zzso on defined cell zzso in zzso
