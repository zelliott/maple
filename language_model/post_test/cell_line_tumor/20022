zzso is an zzso protein for zzso signaling known to mediate zzso resistance in zzso zzso zzso zzso This study examined the clinical significance of zzso expression in zzso 

zzso and zzso expression were examined by zzso in 109 specimens of zzso zzso zzso zzso (N zzso zzso borderline tumors (N zzso zzso benign zzso (N zzso 9) and normal zzso tissue (N zzso zzso and clinical data collected by a retrospective chart zzso The correlations between zzso expression and zzso factors and outcomes were zzso 

zzso expression was detected frequently in all the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was showed in zzso zzso of 83, zzso zzso in borderline tumors (5 of 9, zzso zzso and in benign zzso (3 of 9, zzso zzso and normal zzso tissue showed no zzso zzso Positive zzso expression significantly correlated with shorter zzso and overall survival for zzso zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso and high zzso expression was significantly correlated with tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso analyses revealed that zzso expression was an independent zzso factor for zzso survival and overall survival for zzso 

Our data indicate that zzso expression is a significantly poor zzso factor for zzso A better understanding of the role of zzso expression in disease progression and outcome may be helpful for development of novel zzso for patients with zzso
