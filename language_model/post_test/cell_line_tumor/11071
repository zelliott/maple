To determine the effects of zzso transfer of zzso and zzso on growth and zzso of human pancreatic zzso cell zzso 

zzso zzso cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells infected with zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso gene zzso showed significant zzso of cell growth compared with control zzso in zzso and in zzso whereas zzso cells zzso zzso did not show such zzso Those three cell lines exhibited growth zzso and zzso zzso after infected with the zzso zzso containing zzso gene zzso in zzso and in zzso 

zzso transfer of zzso and zzso produces significant growth suppression of pancreatic zzso cells in zzso and in zzso The effects of zzso partly depend on the status of zzso gene in those zzso
