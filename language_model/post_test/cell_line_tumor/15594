Human zzso zzso zzso is an zzso factor identical to zzso zzso cell growth factor zzso zzso zzso is also a converting zzso of the zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso in zzso To assess the role of zzso in targeting chemotherapy, we examined the relationship between the expression of zzso and the sensitivity of zzso in cancer cell lines, and also examined whether zzso of zzso zzso enhanced the zzso to zzso with or without zzso in breast cancer zzso Thirteen human cancer cell lines consisting of 4 breast cancer, 6 gastric cancer, and 3 colon cancer cell lines were zzso zzso of zzso was assessed by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso was assessed by zzso zzso and zzso effect in zzso was assessed using nude mouse zzso zzso zzso density was evaluated by zzso zzso to factor VIII related zzso zzso of zzso zzso was performed using zzso expression zzso zzso its zzso by the zzso zzso An inverse relationship between the expression of zzso and the zzso values of zzso was observed zzso zzso in the 13 cancer cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso into zzso breast cancer cells resulted in an approximately zzso and zzso increase of the expression of zzso zzso and its zzso activity, respectively, compared to the control zzso zzso The sensitivity to zzso in the zzso cells was increased approximately zzso compared to the parent cells and control zzso alone, and the sensitivity to zzso was also somewhat zzso In contrast, the sensitivity to zzso zzso and zzso was not different between the zzso and control zzso In nude mice zzso of the zzso cells, treatment with zzso had a significant zzso effect compared to those of the zzso zzso cells and control zzso alone treated with zzso ( zzso zzso zzso density in the zzso cells was not significantly increased with or without treatment with zzso compared to control zzso zzso The high expression of zzso was correlated with an increase in the sensitivity to zzso in gastrointestinal and breast cancer cell zzso The introduction of zzso zzso in breast cancer cells enhanced the sensitivity to zzso without an increase of tumor zzso and targeting chemotherapy of zzso may be a good zzso and personalized therapy for improving the poor prognosis of cancer patients who show high expressions of zzso
