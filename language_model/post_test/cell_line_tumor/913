zzso zzso channels were studied in zzso cells in an attempt to correlate changes in expression with cell proliferation and zzso In this study, we treated zzso cells with zzso for 48 zzso Cell proliferation was markedly zzso and cell zzso changed from round to a zzso differentiated zzso Furthermore, zzso calcium concentration was initially increased during acute treatment with zzso The internal zzso pool was eventually depleted after a zzso zzso zzso We have characterized zzso zzso currents in less differentiated zzso zzso After differentiation of zzso cells induced by zzso zzso zzso currents were selectively zzso These data lend further support to the notion that the expression of zzso zzso channels is intimately associated with the proliferation of zzso cells, and the suppression of zzso zzso channels zzso with the zzso of proliferation and subsequent induction of cell zzso
