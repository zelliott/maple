The nuclear zzso play important roles in the structural organization and function of the zzso cell zzso Recent studies on zzso zzso identified a requirement for zzso B1 zzso in the regulation of cell proliferation in normal zzso zzso In order to further investigate the function of zzso in zzso we disrupted its normal expression in zzso zzso human zzso and other tumor cell zzso zzso zzso expression induced zzso cell cycle arrest without significant zzso The arrested cells are unable to mount a timely and effective response to DNA damage induced by zzso zzso Several proteins involved in the detection and repair of zzso damage by the zzso zzso repair zzso zzso are zzso in zzso silenced cells including zzso zzso and zzso We propose that zzso regulates the DNA damage response to zzso zzso by modulating the expression of specific genes and zzso persistent DNA damage zzso Our findings are relevant to understanding the relationship between the loss of zzso zzso DNA damage zzso and zzso zzso
