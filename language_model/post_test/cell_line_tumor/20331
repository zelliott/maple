Gene zzso by the repressive zzso zzso environment, referred to as zzso position effect zzso has been well characterized in zzso and depends on zzso zzso However, proof of its existence at native human zzso ends has remained zzso mainly zzso to the paucity of genes near zzso The discovery of zzso the zzso zzso zzso transcribed from zzso zzso paved the way to probing for zzso impact on zzso zzso Using cell lines of various origins, we show that zzso zzso consistently zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso by increased zzso zzso density at zzso and by zzso protein zzso with no zzso spreading of the marks beyond the zzso zzso restricting human zzso to zzso zzso Our data further support the existence of a zzso mechanism in which longer zzso molecules repress their own zzso upon zzso zzso
