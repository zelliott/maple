zzso of the viral zzso E6 and zzso and zzso was investigated, using a cell line from a mild zzso zzso zzso containing human zzso zzso type zzso During zzso of the cells, there was a change towards a cancer zzso and a shift from zzso to integrated zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso activity in cells carrying zzso virus seemed constant during zzso During zzso of cells containing integrated zzso however, the levels of zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso and zzso activity increased zzso Thus, in those cells there is no direct correlation between changes of zzso and zzso zzso zzso viral zzso expression might trigger zzso zzso in an early zzso of cells, which during subsequent zzso could be selected zzso
