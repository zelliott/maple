To provide a basis for improved prevention and treatment of zzso B virus zzso zzso after liver zzso variations in the S and P genes of zzso under zzso in zzso and their association with patient prognosis were zzso For the in zzso study, zzso zzso zzso cells zzso producing zzso particles were treated with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at doses found to be zzso by the zzso zzso zzso cell viability zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso DNA expression in zzso cells, while zzso did not, as determined by quantitative real-time zzso zzso By gene sequencing, both zzso and zzso were found to cause variations in zzso zzso zzso and zzso overlapping zzso zzso but not zzso zzso were common in the zzso response element of the P region, while both zzso caused zzso outside the zzso analogue resistance zzso For the in zzso study, 14 patients with zzso zzso liver disease zzso after liver zzso and 20 cases without zzso zzso as controls, were zzso Seventy-five percent of zzso recipients showed zzso zzso acid zzso at different sites besides zzso zzso zzso in the P region, including in the zzso response zzso Fifty percent of zzso recipients had zzso in the zzso zzso region and zzso zzso zzso was associated with negative serum zzso B zzso zzso as measured by a zzso capture zzso zzso zzso zzso in the S region caused zzso or synonymous zzso which caused synonymous zzso in the overlapping P zzso These results showed that effects of zzso on zzso genes in zzso were different from those in clinical zzso Positive zzso DNA and gene zzso zzso were factors affecting zzso zzso Multiple zzso found in the P and S genes suggest that the formation of zzso contributes to zzso zzso after liver zzso
