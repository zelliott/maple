zzso zzso zzso a deficient expression of zzso zzso zzso gene in response to the zzso analog zzso zzso in the zzso human zzso zzso cell line zzso compared with their parental zzso 2008 zzso This zzso gene zzso is correlated with a reduced growth sensitivity to zzso zzso This study was performed to determine whether zzso gene expression of resistant cells was kept suppressed by zzso zzso proteins developed during resistance zzso We show here that zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso affect zzso zzso activity in 2008 and in zzso cells in a zzso manner and allow resistant cells to reach zzso levels comparable to those of the sensitive zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that both zzso and zzso in combination with zzso caused a synergistic zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells, with respect to each drug alone, while in 2008 cells only a slight increase was zzso The more pronounced effect of zzso on the zzso activity induced by zzso in the resistant cells was also the result of a more prolonged stabilization of zzso zzso and zzso zzso By contrast, zzso zzso of zzso and zzso did not significantly stimulate zzso zzso zzso and zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso related to zzso zzso play a regulatory role in zzso gene zzso and further indicate that by overcoming this zzso control it is possible to recover zzso zzso
