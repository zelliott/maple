zzso zzso was recently shown to promote zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso We reported previously that irreversible targeting by zzso zzso or zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso 1) contributes to zzso zzso This effect could possibly be attenuated in cells expressing less zzso zzso zzso zzso or pronounced in cells with higher levels of zzso zzso To test this, we supplemented cells with either zzso or zzso and subsequently determined total as well as specific activities of cellular zzso together with extent of drug-induced cell zzso We found that zzso became less zzso after incubation of zzso or zzso cells with lower zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas higher zzso zzso zzso had pronounced direct zzso zzso zzso cells showed low zzso zzso activity and high zzso to zzso zzso or to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells with zzso however, gave increased cellular zzso activity with zzso decreased dependence on zzso whereas the zzso to zzso zzso The results suggest molecular mechanisms by which the zzso status of cells can affect their zzso dependence while modulating the zzso of drugs that target zzso
