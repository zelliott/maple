We examined 11 prostate cancer zzso and 4 cell lines for zzso 10 zzso Conventional comparative zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed a pattern of loss of zzso zzso gain of zzso zzso and zzso and loss of zzso zzso In addition, array zzso identified 2 high-level zzso in the cell line zzso zzso deletions of zzso in zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and small zzso or zzso deletions around zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis confirmed all zzso losses, 5 of 6 large zzso losses, the zzso zzso and the small regions of one copy zzso zzso zzso and zzso were excluded as important zzso zzso The sizes of zzso deletions around zzso ranged from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 in zzso The regions of small zzso or zzso loss around zzso were all less than zzso zzso The loss of 1 or 2 copies of zzso was always accompanied by loss of the zzso zzso gene zzso and, in most cases, by loss of the zzso zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, differential expression was detected for zzso and zzso Complete deletion or zzso zzso of zzso was found in at least 3 zzso In addition to 4 zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso was detected in zzso In conclusion, our data provide evidence that loss of a small region around zzso is the major zzso 10 zzso in prostate cancer zzso and cell zzso In some of the samples, zzso zzso was accompanied by loss of 1 zzso zzso loss of 1 zzso zzso or low expression of zzso and most frequently by loss of 1 or 2 copies or low expression of zzso
