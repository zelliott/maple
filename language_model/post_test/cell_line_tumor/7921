To be a reliable predictor of response, zzso zzso should reflect changes in the amount of active tumor zzso However, zzso of zzso the most commonly used PET zzso is disturbed by the inflammatory cells that appear early after zzso zzso The first aim of this study was to investigate whether zzso zzso a marker of cellular zzso is a better zzso for response assessment early after zzso zzso A second objective of this study was to investigate whether zzso and zzso responses were comparable early after zzso target of zzso zzso zzso as an example of zzso zzso 

Severe combined zzso mice were zzso zzso with zzso cells, a human cell line derived from a zzso mantle cell zzso Half the mice were treated with zzso and the other half with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was evaluated by zzso PET on day 0 zzso before zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso At each time point, 2 mice of each treatment condition were sacrificed, and tumors were excised for zzso 

After zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with a maximum reduction of zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso at zzso compared with zzso Although zzso zzso increased from zzso on, with a maximum on zzso zzso zzso remained virtually zzso zzso showed an increase in zzso or zzso tumor zzso followed by an influx of inflammatory zzso In zzso mice, zzso zzso dropped until zzso after therapy zzso but increased at zzso zzso to form a plateau on zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased to zzso on zzso followed by an increase with a peak value of zzso on zzso after which zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso D1 expression dropped from zzso until zzso and returned to baseline at zzso 

Because zzso zzso is not significantly influenced by the temporary rise in inflammatory cells early after zzso it more accurately reflects tumor zzso However, a formerly unknown temporary rise in zzso zzso a few days after the administration of zzso zzso was zzso which makes it clear that zzso responses have to be considered when using PET for early treatment zzso
