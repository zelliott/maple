The role played by zzso zzso zzso zzso in modulating the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been extensively investigated using zzso zzso known to exert opposite effects in the zzso We have expressed zzso zzso which has been reported to transmit a zzso zzso and we have analyzed both the zzso level and the activity of this zzso in the presence of zzso zzso to what previous studies suggest, we found that zzso is able to form a complex with the zzso and inactive zzso zzso even in the absence of the zzso We also analyzed the consequences of this interaction on the activity of both zzso The complex strongly reduced the extent of zzso of zzso and preserved zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso exerted a negative effect on the affinity of zzso for zzso suggesting that the zzso levels of this zzso may allow a zzso of the zzso signaling zzso Moreover, we found that the zzso formed by zzso and the strong zzso inhibitor zzso zzso the interaction between zzso and zzso These data confirm and extend at the molecular level previous evidence obtained in tumor cell zzso
