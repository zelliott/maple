zzso zzso is a zzso zzso modification of proteins and plays a key role in regulating gene zzso zzso limitations have so far prevented a global analysis of zzso zzso cellular zzso We used high-resolution mass zzso to identify zzso zzso zzso sites on 1750 proteins and zzso zzso changes in response to the zzso zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso zzso zzso targets large zzso complexes involved in diverse cellular zzso such as zzso zzso cell cycle, zzso nuclear zzso and zzso zzso zzso impaired zzso interactions of zzso and regulated the zzso zzso zzso zzso Our data demonstrate that the regulatory scope of zzso zzso is broad and comparable with that of other major zzso zzso
