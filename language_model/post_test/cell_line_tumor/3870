zzso is an important zzso program supporting the growth of highly aggressive zzso and zzso zzso However, rapid emergence of resistance to zzso therapies, such as zzso greatly limits the clinical utility of these promising zzso The mechanisms of resistance to zzso therapy remain incompletely zzso The tumor zzso has been demonstrated to be a source of broad therapeutic resistance in multiple zzso Much of the interaction between the cells zzso a tumor and their zzso is driven by zzso zzso signaling downstream of zzso in tumor cells promotes fundamental programs vital to aggressive cancer biology, including zzso growth, invasion, and survival zzso These functions then can contribute to zzso zzso including zzso therapy resistance, zzso transition, and zzso zzso we found zzso zzso to be functionally zzso in tumor specimens from patients after zzso failure and in zzso models of zzso zzso zzso of zzso in tumor cells with stable gene zzso or treatment with zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso attenuated aggressive tumor zzso in zzso and blocked growth of zzso tumor zzso in zzso Thus, zzso zzso promote resistance to zzso therapy through zzso of multiple zzso programs facilitated by interactions with the tumor zzso The zzso of this mechanism creates an outstanding opportunity for improving patient outcomes in zzso
