zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso stress response system exerts zzso function and supports tumor cell survival and zzso whereas its more severe zzso may exceed the protective capacity of this system and turn on its zzso zzso In this study, we investigated whether the combination of two zzso agents with known ability to trigger zzso stress via different mechanisms would zzso and lead to enhanced tumor cell zzso We combined the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and the zzso 2 zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and investigated their combined effect on zzso stress and on the viability of breast cancer zzso We found that this drug combination aggravated zzso stress and caused pronounced toxicity in human breast cancer cell lines, inclusive of zzso that were highly resistant to other therapeutic treatments, such as zzso zzso or zzso The zzso effects of zzso were zzso at increased potency by its zzso zzso zzso zzso but were substantially weaker in the case of zzso zzso a zzso with superior zzso zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso effects of zzso can be enhanced by zzso zzso in a zzso independent fashion via the zzso of zzso stress, and such drug combinations should be considered as a beneficial adjunct to the treatment of drug-resistant breast zzso
