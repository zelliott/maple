zzso hollow fiber zzso are a promising class of zzso liver assist device zzso The development of this type of device is currently hindered by limited oxygen transport to cultured zzso due to low zzso of oxygen in zzso zzso In order to increase the oxygen spectrum to cultured zzso housed within a hollow fiber zzso several different engineering strategies were explored in this zzso These zzso supplementing the circulating media stream of the hollow fiber zzso with a zzso oxygen carrier zzso red blood zzso with defined oxygen binding and release zzso and operating the zzso with media flow through the hollow fiber membrane into the zzso space zzso We zzso that these two strategies can be used to improve zzso zzso and possibly attain an in zzso zzso spectrum, similar to that observed in zzso in the liver zzso This work is zzso since provision of an in zzso zzso spectrum should create a fully functional zzso that could potentially bridge thousands of liver failure patients towards native liver zzso of damaged tissue or, if necessary, zzso liver zzso
