In prostate cancer, zzso blockade strategies are commonly used to treat zzso bone zzso However, responses to these therapies are typically brief, and the mechanism underlying zzso progression is not zzso Here, we established what we believe to be the first human zzso zzso prostate cancer zzso whose cells induced an zzso reaction in bone and in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso these cells grew in zzso as well as intact male zzso We identified zzso as being zzso in the zzso relative to other zzso prostate cancer cells and discovered that zzso induced zzso proliferation and new bone formation in a bone organ zzso Mice treated with zzso zzso developed smaller bone tumors and reduced bone zzso Finally, we found positive zzso zzso in prostate cancer cells in 24 of 56 primary tumors derived from human zzso prostate cancer and in 25 of 25 bone zzso cases zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso contributes to prostate zzso new bone formation and may participate in the zzso progression of prostate cancer in zzso zzso zzso cells may contribute to the zzso zzso progression of prostate cancer cells in bone and provide a zzso model for studying therapies that target these zzso
