We exploited the differential zzso of zzso factor zzso gene expression in tumors versus normal tissue for the design of a targeted zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso A gene that is essential for viral zzso infected cell zzso 4 zzso was placed under the regulation of an zzso promoter and then introduced into the zzso zzso locus zzso of zzso zzso which contains partial deletions in the two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated and their derivation from zzso was verified by expression of a zzso zzso form of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso locus was confirmed by loss of zzso zzso expression and resistance to zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso and induced tumor cell zzso at similar levels under zzso and zzso The lack of zzso zzso zzso expression by zzso was due to two factors that have not previously been zzso of the zzso gene region to its zzso zzso and increased zzso activity under zzso when cells were infected with any strain of zzso The findings that an zzso zzso is genetically unstable and can activate a zzso promoter in a zzso manner have important implications for any proposed use of this virus in cancer zzso
