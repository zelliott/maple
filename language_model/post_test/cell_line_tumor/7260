We present a detailed investigation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Fisher rats were zzso with 10 zzso zzso zzso and zzso 24 h later with zzso zzso light at 5 or 100 zzso zzso Fluorescence zzso were collected from the skin throughout treatment, and zzso zzso and fluorescent zzso formation were zzso using spectral zzso zzso zzso was slightly more rapid at the higher zzso under these zzso However, zzso of zzso was significantly enhanced at lower zzso To interpret these unexpected findings, we developed a new mathematical model in which reactions between zzso oxygen zzso and the zzso and reactions between the zzso zzso and biological targets are both allowed to contribute to zzso zzso of this model were tested in experiments performed on zzso zzso zzso with zzso of zzso 10 and 30 zzso zzso zzso and subjected to zzso zzso zzso and zzso formation in these zzso were measured using zzso zzso zzso In qualitative agreement with the zzso model predictions, at the highest drug concentration zzso zzso was more efficient via zzso zzso while at the lowest concentration zzso reactions were more zzso At all zzso zzso zzso was greater under conditions of abundant zzso
