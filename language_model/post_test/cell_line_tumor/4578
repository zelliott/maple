A series of zzso zzso complexes were previously prepared with the aim of obtaining a new class of zzso zzso zzso This series includes compounds of the type zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso The reactions with zzso zzso were studied for complexes zzso the formation of zzso species containing coordinated zzso zzso was demonstrated by zzso experiments and zzso zzso mass zzso In this work, the zzso zzso complexes were tested for their in zzso zzso on a panel of various human cancer cell zzso The results indicate that the zzso complex 8 was the most effective zzso also zzso acquired zzso resistance as demonstrated by zzso tests performed on zzso and zzso cell zzso The studies concerning the cellular DNA damage on both parental zzso and resistant zzso suggest for the new zzso complex a different mechanism of action compared with that exhibited by zzso
