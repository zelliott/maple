This work is concerned with the surface modification of fluorescent zzso zzso by a zzso zzso zzso and the specific zzso of such particles to surfaces containing the PG domain of zzso zzso IX zzso zzso which is a zzso protein specifically expressed on the surfaces of several tumor cell zzso The zzso strength of zzso zzso zzso to zzso surfaces was investigated under zzso flow conditions in a zzso cell and compared to the zzso of unmodified zzso zzso and zzso coupled with an unspecific zzso zzso to cancer cells using flow zzso was also investigated and in all cases the zzso strength of zzso zzso was significantly stronger than for the unmodified or unspecific zzso up to several orders of magnitude in some zzso The specific modification of zzso and zzso by an zzso protein therefore appears to be a feasible approach for the targeting of tumor zzso
