The zzso zzso zzso protein 2 zzso zzso complex zzso zzso a fraction of zzso zzso genes zzso by establishing a zzso structure at the zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso zzso absent on the zzso zzso zzso the largest zzso of zzso at a single zzso zzso zzso adjacent to the zzso zzso domain, and that the zzso zzso zzso zzso removes the zzso group from zzso zzso regulates the interaction of zzso with zzso zzso zzso which in turn affects zzso formation, zzso positioning and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is responsive to the zzso energy status and fluctuates during S zzso zzso of zzso on zzso deprivation leads to zzso of zzso enhanced zzso binding and an increase in zzso zzso zzso These results suggest a mechanism that links the zzso state of zzso to cell metabolism and reveal another layer of zzso control that involves zzso modification of a zzso zzso zzso
