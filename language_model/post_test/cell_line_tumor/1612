zzso and relapses from the zzso used to treat chronic zzso leukemia zzso prompt continued interest in gentle but effective targeted treatment options for the mainly elderly population suffering from this zzso Here, we report the definition of critical zzso cell survival pathways that can be targeted by zzso zzso of the zzso genes zzso and zzso which are widely zzso in zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso by reducing zzso formation, an effect zzso by zzso of the genes zzso and zzso the latter of which is a major component of the zzso zzso zzso In support of the concept of a fundamental connection between zzso zzso and altered zzso flux in this cancer, we showed that zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression was sufficient to reduce zzso in primary or established cultures of zzso zzso Together, our findings show that zzso zzso cell survival programs by regulating zzso zzso and they define roles for zzso and zzso in a regulatory feedback loop that mediates zzso cell zzso
