zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso are zzso scaffolding proteins that comprise zzso complex zzso with nine zzso zzso in higher zzso Among the three zzso zzso is strongly anchored to zzso zzso zzso in the zzso MRS zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and plays an important role in translation zzso It is known that zzso is dispatched to nucleus or nuclear membrane to induce DNA damage response or zzso however, the role of zzso in translation as a component of zzso and the meaning of its interaction with MRS are still zzso zzso we observed that zzso specifically zzso with zzso zzso while it showed little or reduced interaction with zzso or zzso zzso In addition, zzso discriminates zzso from zzso zzso zzso based on zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso and MRS had zzso interaction with zzso initiation factor 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso which is in charge of binding with zzso for the delivery of zzso to zzso zzso recruited active zzso to the zzso complex, and the level of zzso bound to zzso complex was reduced by zzso zzso resulting in reduced protein zzso All these results suggested the novel function of zzso as a critical zzso of zzso transfer from MRS to zzso complex for the accurate and efficient translation zzso
