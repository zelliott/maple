We have reported zzso progression and zzso zzso induction during zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso As zzso acid zzso zzso expression and promotes zzso in the zzso zzso we investigated the effect of zzso acid on the proliferation of zzso cell zzso of the esophagus zzso 

zzso zzso Western zzso analysis of zzso and cell zzso molecules in the zzso phase zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were performed on zzso acid zzso exposure to zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In the presence of zzso zzso acid concentration (up to 100 zzso growth of zzso cell lines was zzso at a low concentration zzso at zzso zzso but suppressed at a higher zzso Only a low dose of zzso acid induced the expression of zzso D1 and zzso and showed high zzso zzso and high zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso acid progressively induced zzso expression in a zzso manner, regardless of its zzso effects on cell zzso and a zzso specific inhibitor zzso did not suppress growth stimulation by a low dose of zzso zzso 

zzso acid at a low dose stimulates the proliferation of zzso by inducing zzso zzso However, zzso zzso which is also induced by zzso acid, does not affect cell zzso Further work is needed to zzso its role in zzso
