Drug resistance is a common cause of failure in cancer chemotherapy zzso In this study, we used a pair of zzso zzso cancer lines, zzso and the zzso zzso as a model system to examine zzso cellular responses and to identify potential therapeutic zzso We used two-dimensional differential gel zzso zzso and zzso laser zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso to examine the global protein expression changes induced by zzso treatment and zzso zzso A zzso study revealed that zzso altered the expression of 87 proteins in zzso cells, while no significant response occurred in similarly treated zzso cells, zzso these proteins with drug specific zzso By contrast, 37 proteins showed differential expression between zzso and zzso indicating baseline zzso Further studies have used zzso zzso cell viability analysis, and analysis of zzso against zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso component 1 zzso zzso to monitor and evaluate their potency on the formation of zzso zzso The zzso approach allowed us to identify numerous zzso including zzso and zzso involved in various zzso zzso Our results provide useful diagnostic markers and therapeutic candidates for the treatment of zzso zzso zzso
