In this study, the effect of novel zzso zzso and zzso on sensitive zzso and resistant zzso human breast cancer cells was zzso 

Cell growth and survival were evaluated after zzso incubation with tested zzso of zzso The effect on the formation of zzso zzso was assessed employing zzso zzso and on the cell cycle employing flow zzso zzso The activity of zzso was assessed employing commercial zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso resulting in 50% of living cells in comparison with the zzso of zzso in sensitive cells was zzso zzso versus 1 zzso for zzso However, the zzso of zzso in resistant cells was zzso zzso versus 300 zzso for zzso Both zzso and zzso at zzso zzso induced the formation of zzso zzso in sensitive as well as resistant zzso Cell death induced in sensitive and resistant cells by zzso was associated with the zzso of cells in the zzso zzso On the contrary, cell death induced by zzso took place without the zzso of cells in the zzso phase but with a decreased number of zzso cells and the zzso of zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso activated zzso zzso zzso and zzso in sensitive as well as resistant zzso 

Cell death induced by both zzso and novel zzso zzso in breast cancer cells is associated with zzso zzso and with the formation of zzso zzso zzso Novel zzso zzso but not zzso seems to be capable of inducing cell death without the zzso of cells in the zzso zzso
