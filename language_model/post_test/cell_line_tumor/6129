To construct and express an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to identify its binding zzso to zzso and zzso 

The gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was designed and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA was zzso into a zzso expression zzso zzso then zzso into Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells and stable expression cell lines were zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso affinity zzso and confirmed by 120 zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso binding activity of the zzso was analyzed by zzso 

The zzso DNA containing zzso zzso fragments were zzso zzso was zzso by zzso into the zzso Six stable expression cell lines were zzso The molecular weight of zzso was correct indicated by zzso and Western zzso The zzso could specifically bind to zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso 

An zzso zzso zzso zzso is successfully constructed and zzso and the zzso has specific binding capacity to zzso and zzso
