During the transformation from a normal to a zzso cell, several zzso are required to bypass the pathways responsible for controlling zzso zzso cells have acquired some, but not all of these zzso and consequently have not yet attained a zzso zzso characterized by tumor formation in zzso zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso can induce zzso in zzso cells while sparing normal ones and is currently being considered as zzso therapy for various human zzso Whether TRAIL is effective in inducing zzso in zzso cells is zzso zzso We studied the effect of TRAIL on two human zzso cell lines the zzso and zzso zzso Both cell lines had been immortalized by the addition of zzso virus 40 large T zzso and the zzso zzso zzso but had not been transformed into zzso zzso TRAIL initiated zzso by zzso both the zzso and zzso zzso pathways in both cell lines at relatively low doses whereas it had no effect on normal human pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells even at high zzso These results suggest that TRAIL can induce zzso in zzso cells and suggests a novel therapy for the treatment of zzso zzso in zzso
