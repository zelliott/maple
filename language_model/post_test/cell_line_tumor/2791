zzso is a highly selective Aurora B zzso inhibitor currently undergoing Phase I and II clinical evaluation in patients with acute zzso leukemia and advanced solid zzso We have established two zzso cell lines from zzso colon and zzso pancreatic zzso lines, which are zzso resistant to the active zzso of zzso zzso zzso and interestingly, zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso analysis and comparative zzso zzso we were able to identify zzso and zzso as the zzso genes that zzso zzso zzso in these zzso Furthermore, the zzso of either of these genes is sufficient to render in zzso tumor growth insensitive to zzso Finally, the zzso of zzso or zzso is zzso of tumor cell sensitivity to this agent, both in zzso and in zzso The data provide a genetic basis for resistance to Aurora zzso zzso which could be zzso to predict clinical response to zzso
