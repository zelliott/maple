zzso zzso of zzso zzso 2) is the zzso zzso of zzso zzso repressive complex zzso which mediates zzso zzso activity and functions as zzso zzso involved in gene zzso zzso is involved in zzso transformation and biological aggressiveness of several human zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso cell lung zzso zzso also zzso zzso and that high expression of zzso zzso with poor zzso Growing evidence indicates that zzso may be an appropriate therapeutic target in zzso including zzso Recently, an zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso has been shown to zzso and inhibit zzso The aim of this study was to determine the effect of zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso resulted in decreased growth of four zzso cell zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso treatment resulted in zzso zzso of proliferation in the zzso cell lines with a half zzso zzso concentration zzso ranging from zzso to zzso zzso zzso but zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines were less sensitive to zzso than the zzso cell zzso Soft zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso growth was also reduced in all three zzso cell lines that were evaluated using this zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso induced zzso and zzso cell cycle arrest in zzso cells, which was partially associated with zzso A decrease and zzso zzso zzso depleted cellular levels of zzso and inhibited the associated zzso zzso zzso 27 zzso These results indicated that an zzso therapy that zzso targets zzso via zzso may constitute a novel approach to treatment of zzso
