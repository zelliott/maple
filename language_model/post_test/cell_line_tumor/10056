The two zzso zzso zzso entities, chronic zzso leukemia zzso and mantle cell zzso zzso show zzso zzso gains of zzso zzso and zzso The zzso affected by these aberrations are not zzso The aim of this study was to identify zzso located within these gained regions, which control cell death and cell survival of zzso and zzso cancer zzso Blood samples collected from 18 patients with zzso and 6 patients with zzso as well as 6 cell lines representing both zzso were analyzed by gene expression zzso By a comparison of zzso DNA and gene zzso 72 candidate genes were zzso We performed a limited zzso interference screening with these candidates to identify genes affecting cell zzso zzso zzso zzso domain containing protein 50), zzso and zzso zzso a reduction of cell viability in primary zzso cells as well as in cell zzso Gene zzso and a nuclear factor zzso B zzso reporter gene zzso revealed that zzso is required for survival in zzso and zzso cells and controls zzso zzso
