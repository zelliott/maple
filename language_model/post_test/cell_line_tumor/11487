zzso zzso zzso is a rare zzso in most parts of the world, but is a common cancer in southern zzso Local zzso disease and distant zzso of zzso are still the zzso zzso Recently, gold zzso zzso have been developed as potential in zzso diagnostic and therapeutic zzso However, their role on zzso cancer remains zzso The object of this study is to investigate if zzso can be used as a new therapeutic agent for zzso by evaluating their zzso effect in zzso 

The zzso were prepared by the reduction of zzso acid to neutral zzso Their size distribution and zzso were characterized by transmission electron zzso zzso To evaluate their zzso effect, zzso cell line zzso and Human zzso zzso zzso zzso were cultured in various zzso of zzso for 3 zzso Cell viability was evaluated by zzso Blue viability zzso while zzso findings were observed via light zzso Terminal zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso zzso was used to detect zzso 

zzso prepared in this study had an average diameter of zzso and they were observed under light zzso as dark material zzso in the cells after zzso zzso to the zzso the zzso reduced cell viability of zzso cell in a zzso manner by zzso Blue zzso especially at high zzso Besides, cell zzso was demonstrated by positive zzso zzso 

The zzso possesses specific imaging properties and is zzso to zzso cells at high zzso
