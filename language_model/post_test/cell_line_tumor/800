zzso DNA breaks zzso are potentially lethal DNA zzso induced by zzso zzso In zzso zzso can be repaired by zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso DNA repair protein zzso zzso in both the zzso and zzso DNA repair zzso zzso has been used clinically as a zzso However, the mechanisms by which zzso is induced by zzso especially moderate zzso (41 degrees zzso are not fully zzso Previous studies suggest that 41 degrees C reduces the nuclear zzso protein level in a manner that zzso with zzso changes in radiation zzso zzso zzso technology was used in the present study to reduce zzso gene expression to determine if reduced zzso protein levels induced zzso and if such zzso is similar to that induced by moderate zzso The results show that zzso the cellular level of the zzso protein was reduced about 60 zzso zzso by a zzso treatment with zzso zzso from the zzso protein turnover zzso showed a zzso of zzso zzso zzso h for the zzso zzso which is consistent with reduction in protein level in 24 h after zzso zzso treatment assuming a delay of zzso h to reduce zzso zzso After 48 h in zzso cellular zzso protein levels increased to approximately zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso to zzso radiation after 24 h of treatment with zzso zzso Two hours at 41 degrees C did not increase the radiation sensitivity of cells with a reduced zzso protein level following a zzso zzso zzso These data support the conclusion that the zzso repair zzso zzso appears to be a target for zzso by moderate zzso
