Patients with zzso zzso often report abdominal pain, which is relatively zzso to zzso It has been considered that a new animal model is required to investigate the mechanism of abdominal pain for the development of optimal treatments for this type of zzso 

To prepare a zzso zzso model, highly zzso gastric cancer cells, zzso were implanted into the abdominal zzso The zzso zzso for zzso behavior was assessed in terms of withdrawal behavior in response to mechanical stimuli and zzso zzso zzso samples from mouse zzso root zzso and spinal zzso were subject to zzso and real-time reverse zzso zzso chain zzso 

Mice with zzso dissemination showed significant hypersensitivity of the abdomen to mechanical stimulation and spontaneous visceral zzso zzso There was a significant increase in zzso cells in the spinal zzso in zzso zzso Those mice exhibited a remarkable increase in substance zzso zzso in the zzso root zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A significant decreases in zzso zzso expression mainly in substance zzso zzso was observed in zzso mice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a relatively higher dose of zzso was required to significantly reverse the abdominal zzso 

Both the zzso of substance P and zzso of zzso zzso seen in the zzso root zzso may be, at least in part, responsible for the abdominal zzso state associated with zzso zzso
