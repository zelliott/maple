zzso zzso zzso a novel zzso protein involved in zzso zzso has been studied extensively in our laboratory, and its zzso has been found in some human zzso To understand the role of zzso in human zzso cancer development, we studied the correlation of zzso expression with zzso parameters and survival in zzso zzso cancer, and the impact of zzso zzso on zzso cancer zzso 

zzso expression in normal, zzso benign and zzso zzso zzso zzso was examined by zzso The correlation between zzso expression and tumor grade, zzso stage and zzso type was also zzso Survival was calculated using zzso zzso Cell proliferation and zzso were zzso after stable zzso of zzso or empty zzso in human zzso cancer cell line zzso 

zzso was positive in 1 of 10 zzso normal zzso zzso 5 of 34 zzso benign tumors, 9 of 26 zzso borderline tumors and 73 of 131 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso intensity significantly correlated with tumor grade, but not with zzso stage or zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso was marginally associated with decreased overall zzso zzso of zzso enhanced proliferation and inhibited zzso induced by zzso in the zzso cell zzso 

zzso of zzso in zzso tumors raises the possibility that zzso may play a role in zzso zzso
