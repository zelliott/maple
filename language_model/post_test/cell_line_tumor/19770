zzso growth factor zzso and its zzso zzso zzso Met play a pivotal role in the tumor zzso zzso and represent attractive therapeutic zzso We investigated the zzso and biological effects of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso on the human lung cancer cell lines zzso and zzso which express zzso active zzso zzso cells showed zzso of Met zzso and zzso zzso of zzso downstream signaling involving zzso signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 and zzso as well as a reduced expression of the zzso factors vascular zzso growth factor and basic zzso growth zzso Cell growth in soft zzso of zzso cells was strongly reduced in the presence of the zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibited both spontaneous and zzso zzso of both zzso and human zzso zzso zzso of Met signaling by alternative methods zzso small interfering zzso and zzso Met zzso zzso zzso produced comparable zzso and biological zzso Using the spontaneously zzso lung zzso zzso zzso daily oral treatment with zzso doses of zzso produced a significant reduction of spontaneous lung zzso zzso P zzso zzso compared with control zzso In addition, a significant zzso of zzso in primary zzso tumors of treated mice was observed, possibly contributing to limit the development of zzso The results provide zzso evidence in support of Met targeting zzso approach as a new option for the control of tumor zzso zzso
