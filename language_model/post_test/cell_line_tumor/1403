zzso evidence has demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso is a bona fide zzso zzso gene in a large fraction of human zzso including zzso zzso A zzso delivery system has been developed to transfer the zzso gene into many types of cancer cells to inhibit growth or even induce zzso However, a zzso replacement strategy for zzso has not been performed in cancer zzso Here, we used zzso zzso of zzso zzso to transfer the zzso zzso protein into zzso zzso zzso cells and determine the biological effect of this fusion protein in inducing zzso zzso zzso was used to purify zzso zzso human zzso zzso protein from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis were performed to identify the expression and zzso of zzso in zzso cells compared with the zzso zzso zzso Our study showed that zzso protein can zzso into cancer cells in 1 h after incubation at zzso Furthermore, the results of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso demonstrated that zzso can robustly inhibit growth and induce zzso of zzso cells in zzso In addition, a zzso study showed that both zzso and intrinsic zzso pathways were involved in zzso zzso and this effect could be attenuated partially by a zzso protector zzso indicating that zzso plays a critical role in zzso zzso effect in cancer zzso Taken together, our study suggests that zzso is a potential zzso zzso in zzso cells and strengthen the hypothesis of its therapeutic application against zzso
