zzso injected neural stem cells zzso can zzso both primary and zzso tumor zzso thus, they are attractive zzso vehicles for delivering zzso zzso However, because the systemic distribution of the injected zzso involves normal zzso and might induce zzso actions leading to unintended side effects, clinical applications of this approach is zzso Given that the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso can promote the formation of zzso zzso to kill cells in a zzso manner, we engineered a pH sensor of zzso and generated a novel zzso zzso that efficiently promotes zzso formation at the tumor zzso pH zzso but not at pH zzso Using zzso zzso derived from induced zzso stem cells zzso the zzso zzso was delivered into mice with zzso breast zzso in the lung through tail vein zzso Compared with the conventional stem zzso gene therapy that uses the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso suicide zzso this treatment did not display toxicity to normal zzso zzso while retaining therapeutic effects in zzso zzso Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of a new approach for achieving zzso killing effects following systemic stem cell zzso Its potential in stem zzso gene therapy for zzso cancer is worthy of further zzso
