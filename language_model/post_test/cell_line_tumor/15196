Fusion of the zzso gene to zzso produces a fusion zzso that drives an zzso gene expression program responsible for the development of Ewing zzso We used a zzso proximity zzso to screen for compounds that disrupt the binding of zzso to its zzso DNA zzso A number of zzso zzso agents were found to zzso disrupt protein binding to zzso In contrast, zzso D was found to zzso disrupt zzso binding by comparison to zzso binding to their respective zzso DNA targets in zzso In zzso zzso low zzso of zzso D zzso blocked zzso binding to zzso and disrupted zzso gene zzso Higher zzso of zzso D globally zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso D zzso zzso zzso binding to DNA at selected zzso Although the window between this preferential effect and global suppression is too narrow to exploit in a therapeutic manner, these results suggest that zzso may be exploited to find zzso compounds that zzso disrupt zzso of zzso zzso
