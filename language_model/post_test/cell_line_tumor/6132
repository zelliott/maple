To study the zzso zzso constituents from zzso zzso 

zzso isolation and zzso was carried by repeated column zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Their structures were zzso on the basis of spectral data zzso The zzso zzso zzso was applied to evaluate the isolated compounds of their zzso 

Ten compounds (1 - 10) were isolated and their structures were identified by comparison of their spectral data with literature values as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, 2, 4, 5, 7 and 9 showed positive zzso zzso zzso compounds 1, 4, and 5 showed significant zzso zzso zzso 

zzso 3 was isolated from this plant for the first zzso zzso 9 and 10 were isolated from zzso zzso for the first zzso zzso 1, 4, and 5 showed significant zzso zzso zzso
