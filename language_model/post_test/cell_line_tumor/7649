A zzso zzso body is an orphan nuclear zzso zzso by zzso of zzso repressive complex 1 zzso zzso However, seemingly contradictory reports have appeared that describe the zzso bodies either as zzso bodies in the zzso compartment or zzso zzso In this respect, molecular crowding is an important factor for the assembly and stability of nuclear zzso In order to settle this contradiction, crowding experiments, that represent a convenient model distinguishing between zzso and zzso zzso were carried zzso 

In zzso induced crowding, we observed in zzso zzso cells that zzso bodies disappeared, but persisted as nuclear zzso zzso by zzso of zzso This phenomenon was also observed in cells zzso treated with zzso and zzso zzso the observed changes were quickly zzso after zzso of cells in normal zzso We found that the zzso zzso disappearance and the zzso of zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso from zzso were associated with their zzso In addition, under zzso and zzso conditions, the zzso of the zzso bodies differed from that of the typical zzso zzso 

zzso proteins zzso do not represent a genuine nuclear zzso The zzso body is a zzso domain, rather than a zzso zzso
