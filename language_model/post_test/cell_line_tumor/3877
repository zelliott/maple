zzso zzso and zzso of high-grade zzso zzso zzso zzso classes can be speculated from clinical zzso suggesting passive tumor dissemination versus active invasion and zzso 

We explored this theme toward tumor zzso through two approaches of gene expression pattern zzso zzso derivation of a core set of zzso genes and zzso resolution of independent weighted correlation zzso Further identification of appropriate cell and zzso models was carried out for resolution of zzso zzso zzso 

Both zzso approaches achieved resolution of three distinct tumor classes, two of which validated in other zzso Networks of enriched gene zzso defined zzso functions of zzso cell zzso commitment, immune zzso and zzso with niche zzso Although zzso from normal zzso mechanisms, these zzso profiles are not totally zzso zzso validation of these suggests that Class 1 tumors survive, zzso in an zzso transition zzso manner, and are associated with a zzso signature, zzso zzso DNA damage, and genetic zzso These features supported by association of zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso led to the speculation of their origin being the zzso zzso tube zzso On the other hand, Class 2 tumors activate zzso zzso invasion programs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and immune zzso which are zzso suggestive of zzso surface zzso associated wound healing zzso Further validation of these zzso could define a new therapeutic framework for disease zzso
