zzso application of zzso agents requires the identification of novel zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso growth factor zzso A panel of breast cancer cell lines was treated with these agents, zzso zzso and zzso therapies and the expression pattern of a specific panel of genes using zzso was investigated as a potential marker of early drug response to zzso zzso 

Treatment of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines with zzso zzso and zzso induced an increase in the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso The response directly correlated with the degree of zzso This expression pattern switched from zzso to zzso in the zzso zzso zzso insensitive cell line zzso zzso of the zzso gene demonstrated an zzso zzso response to drug zzso A similar expression pattern was observed following the treatment with both zzso and zzso These patterns were retained following exposure to zzso and zzso plus zzso In contrast, zzso zzso and zzso treatment resulted in a completely different expression pattern zzso 

In these zzso cell line models, zzso zzso zzso and zzso treatment generated a characteristic and specific gene expression response, zzso to the sensitivity of the cell lines to the zzso zzso of the induced changes in expression levels of these genes may therefore give a valuable, very early predictor of the likely extent and specificity of zzso zzso inhibitor response in patients, potentially guiding more specific use of these zzso
