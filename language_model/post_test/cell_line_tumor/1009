We have previously shown that transforming growth factor zzso a crucial zzso in zzso bone cancer, stimulates zzso expression in the human breast cancer cell line, zzso To understand the molecular mechanisms responsible for zzso response on zzso promoter activity, a functional analysis of the promoter region of the zzso gene was carried out, and we identified the zzso zzso domain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso sites as necessary for full zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso shift, real time reverse zzso and Western zzso analyses showed increased levels of zzso zzso and zzso upon zzso treatment in zzso zzso zzso in zzso studies identified no physical interaction between zzso and zzso whereas zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso experiments confirmed interaction of zzso with zzso and zzso Under zzso conditions, zzso bound to both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In response to zzso zzso was seen only at the zzso zzso site, whereas zzso occupied the zzso zzso zzso An zzso of zzso zzso and zzso at the zzso zzso site of the zzso promoter occurred in response to zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso along with a zzso active zzso type I zzso construct identified functional interaction of these proteins and zzso zzso of the zzso gene by zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso zzso zzso and zzso to bind to their respective DNA consensus sites and that zzso is likely to stabilize their interaction to zzso functional zzso of zzso expression in zzso zzso
