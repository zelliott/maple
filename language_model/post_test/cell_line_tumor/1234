Vitamin D zzso zzso which converts the circulating zzso zzso zzso to the active zzso zzso is present in normal zzso zzso However, prostate cancer cells, both primary cultured cells and cell lines, have greatly decreased activity of zzso and are therefore resistant to the tumor zzso activity of circulating zzso We zzso zzso zzso and protein levels to investigate zzso responsible for decreased zzso zzso activity in prostate zzso zzso cancer cell lines had low zzso zzso zzso zzso prostate cell cultures derived from normal and cancer zzso had equivalent levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein levels were observed in prostate tissue sections containing normal and zzso zzso The protein levels of zzso whose zzso zzso Vitamin D binding protein zzso zzso delivery of zzso to zzso in monkey cells, were equivalent in the normal and cancer zzso zzso activity in normal and cancer cells of Vitamin D zzso a zzso zzso that also uses zzso as a zzso further ruled out lack of access to zzso as a basis for low activity of zzso in cancer zzso We conclude that diminished zzso activity in prostate cancer cell lines is through decreased gene zzso whereas decreased activity in primary cultures and zzso is zzso
