zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that suppresses the zzso activity of the zzso factor zzso complex through zzso of zzso Our previous study showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso human colon cancer cells and that zzso induction presumably requires a mechanism other than the suppression of zzso zzso zzso reporter gene zzso with zzso revealed that zzso could suppress zzso activity of zzso in a zzso zzso However, it appeared that zzso zzso of zzso such as zzso binding protein zzso were likely to be the direct targets of zzso rather than zzso zzso zzso reporter gene analysis of zzso fusion proteins revealed that the zzso region of zzso was critical for zzso suppression by zzso In zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso could zzso the zzso domain of zzso However, zzso activity was not suppressed by the induction of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, we observed that zzso suppressed the zzso activity of zzso zzso and zzso all of which also zzso zzso as a zzso The extent of suppression by zzso was similar among the zzso factors tested zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso may suppress a wide range of gene zzso possibly through zzso
