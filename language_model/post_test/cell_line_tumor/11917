Novel zzso zzso A zzso and zzso B zzso zzso soluble zzso derivatives of the zzso zzso have a strong zzso effect on tumors and zzso However, the mechanisms of tumor cell death induced by zzso and HB are still zzso In this study, we attempt to zzso the zzso effects of zzso and HB compounds in poorly differentiated zzso and moderately differentiated zzso human zzso zzso zzso cells as well as human zzso colon zzso and zzso zzso zzso Using these cell lines we investigated few hall marks of zzso commitments in a drug and light dose dependent zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso and HB showed cell size shrinkage and an increase in the zzso DNA zzso A loss of membrane zzso asymmetry associated with zzso was induced by all tumor cell lines as evidenced by the zzso of zzso Western zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso showed the classical zzso pattern zzso to zzso associated with zzso in zzso and zzso cell zzso In addition, zzso zzso was blocked by using zzso zzso zzso such as zzso or zzso These results demonstrate that tumor cell death induced by HB and zzso is zzso by zzso zzso This study also identifies both colon and zzso cells were more sensitive cell lines than zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso
