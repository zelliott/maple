zzso is a zzso type zzso zzso found exclusively in plants of the family zzso while zzso a zzso zzso that is the major constituent of the bark of some plants of this family, can also be found in zzso and zzso These two compounds are recognized to have different biological effects, including a possible zzso zzso The subject of the present research was to compare their zzso toxicity and also investigate a possible selectivity towards tumor cell zzso zzso rat liver zzso and three distinct cell lines were used to investigate zzso zzso The results indicate that both test compounds are toxic to isolated zzso zzso especially when used at zzso higher than 100 zzso However, zzso presented the highest toxicity including increased zzso leak in the inner zzso zzso increased induction of the zzso zzso transition zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso respiratory zzso Both compounds also inhibited cell zzso regardless of the cell line zzso Up to the zzso concentration tested in cells, no zzso effects were detected by vital zzso imaging, indicating that zzso of cell proliferation may also originate from zzso zzso The results warrant careful assessment of toxicity zzso pharmacology benefits of both zzso
