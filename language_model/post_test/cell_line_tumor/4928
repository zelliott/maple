zzso Growth zzso zzso is known to be a negative regulator of zzso zzso zzso It is not clear whether zzso has any effect on zzso checkpoint zzso We have found that zzso zzso the expression of several zzso checkpoint zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso without causing cell zzso in zzso zzso in two human leukemia cell zzso The zzso was zzso with a zzso zzso being observed by zzso for zzso B1 and zzso and by zzso for zzso The zzso was not a result of zzso arrest but a direct effect of zzso which zzso their expression at zzso zzso In zzso cells, there was a significant formation of zzso complexes, which was decreased to zzso of control levels by zzso after initiating zzso zzso zzso showed a marked zzso activity on zzso protein in zzso cells detected by in zzso zzso zzso which was zzso in response to zzso In addition, zzso caused a rapid and transient zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso for about zzso before a dramatic decrease of both molecules by zzso Taken together, our data suggest that zzso has a direct zzso effect on zzso checkpoint zzso which is regulated at zzso zzso The transient zzso of zzso and zzso and subsequent zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso could amplify zzso zzso arrest and growth zzso
