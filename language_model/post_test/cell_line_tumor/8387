Chemical investigation of the zzso fungus zzso zzso cultured on white beans or on rice led to the isolation of two new zzso (1 and zzso along with zzso known zzso zzso zzso and four known zzso zzso and zzso The structures of the isolated compounds were determined by extensive analysis of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso data, and by comparison with the zzso zzso 13, which had been previously obtained only by chemical zzso was isolated as a natural product for the first time, while compound 6 was zzso reported as a zzso zzso A zzso of zzso A zzso revealed it to be a zzso mixture zzso and zzso whose zzso was proposed for the first time based on zzso zzso All isolated compounds were evaluated for their zzso and zzso zzso zzso 12 and 17 showed significant zzso against the zzso zzso cell line zzso with zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso respectively, while compounds 5, 11, and 15 were moderately active against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 64 zzso
