It is well established that zzso zzso fire spontaneous action zzso zzso which generate zzso signals of sufficient zzso to trigger growth hormone zzso zzso It is also known that zzso and synthetic zzso peptides zzso stimulate zzso zzso though the mechanisms involved remain zzso In the current report, we show that the chronic zzso treatment with zzso and zzso increases the firing frequency of zzso in the zzso zzso cell zzso This action is associated with a significant increase in zzso inward current zzso In addition, long-term application of zzso or zzso zzso current zzso decreases zzso release of zzso indicating that the zzso currents that give rise to zzso play important roles for hormone zzso in the zzso zzso Together, our results suggest that zzso and zzso may increase zzso inward current density thereby enhancing zzso firing frequency and zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso
