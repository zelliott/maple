We have previously evaluated the role of zzso zzso 1 zzso in the zzso metabolism of zzso zzso to the corresponding zzso a more potent zzso heat shock protein zzso zzso Here, we report an extensive study with a series of zzso zzso which includes zzso zzso and zzso The reduction of these zzso zzso by zzso human zzso to the corresponding zzso zzso was monitored by zzso liquid zzso zzso and confirmed by liquid zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was zzso in the presence of zzso and zzso by zzso zzso a zzso inhibitor of zzso showing that the zzso zzso were more potent zzso zzso than their parent zzso An zzso pair of human breast cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso differing in expression of zzso was used, and zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso were formed by the zzso cells, which could be prevented by zzso zzso The zzso cells were more sensitive to growth zzso after treatment with the zzso zzso compared with the zzso zzso this increased sensitivity could be reduced by zzso zzso The increased duration of zzso zzso exposure showed increased potency and zzso zzso in zzso cells relative to the parental zzso zzso zzso molecular modeling studies displayed additional contacts between zzso zzso and the zzso zzso which translated to greater interaction energies compared with the corresponding zzso zzso In conclusion, these studies show that the reduction of this series of zzso zzso by zzso generates the corresponding zzso zzso which exhibit enhanced zzso zzso
