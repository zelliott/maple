We have previously shown that zzso tumors express zzso zzso zzso factor zzso However, the precise role of zzso in the prognosis of zzso cancer is zzso In our study, we report for the first time that expression of zzso in tumor zzso of patients with zzso cancer is associated with favorable zzso zzso of samples from 40 patients with zzso cancer showed that early stage zzso and borderline zzso zzso zzso tumors expressed higher levels of zzso zzso and protein and lower levels of zzso compared to late stage zzso tumors zzso and IV, p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed the highest levels of zzso zzso and protein when compared to tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso test showed that overall survival of patients with zzso and zzso zzso tumors was significantly longer than those with zzso and zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso tumor cells inhibited tumor cell growth, induced zzso zzso zzso expression and its promoter zzso Furthermore, treatment of zzso cancer cells with vitamin D or a zzso compound resulted in zzso of zzso zzso of zzso induction of zzso and zzso of tumor cell growth when compared to zzso controls zzso zzso zzso Together, these observations showed an inverse correlation between zzso and zzso expression and suggested that increased zzso expression along with reduced zzso was associated with prolonged survival of patients with zzso zzso
