The treatment of zzso zzso with current therapies remains a challenge in zzso Our recent work showed that embryonic stem cell zzso zzso zzso expressing genes can be used to induce zzso in zzso zzso cells in zzso The tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso gene has been shown to induce zzso in a variety of tumor cells, including zzso The aim of this study was to assess the zzso effects of transgenic TRAIL delivered by zzso zzso on zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were used to induce zzso zzso in nude zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing TRAIL were injected into the zzso TRAIL expression was documented in the zzso zzso zzso by reverse zzso zzso and zzso after external gene zzso A significant reduction in tumor volume occurred 48 h after a single injection zzso and double injections zzso in the experimental zzso Terminal zzso zzso end labeling zzso revealed abundant zzso tumor cells in the experimental zzso Seven days after injection, the tumor had undergone severe zzso with only scattered residual tumor cells at the zzso Death zzso zzso expression increased significantly in the experimental groups compared with zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso zzso expressing TRAIL should be considered as zzso to deliver gene therapy for zzso zzso
