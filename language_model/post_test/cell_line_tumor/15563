We have developed zzso zzso against the human zzso zzso zzso After zzso of a zzso a fusion was performed to obtain zzso that were selected because they produced zzso positively reacting against the protein used for zzso We isolated one particular zzso that we named zzso using a series of selective zzso The first criteria of the screen for zzso was an zzso zzso Linked zzso zzso zzso performed in zzso plates against the zzso zzso zzso zzso The second was a positive Western zzso against the same zzso zzso The third criteria was a positive western zzso against an zzso cell zzso the selected zzso should detect only one protein zzso at 46 zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso Finally, the zzso had to bind to duplicated zzso and zzso poles in human zzso cultured cells by indirect zzso At this stage several zzso were still zzso We then increased the selectivity by searching for zzso that were able to zzso with the mouse zzso zzso both by western zzso and indirect zzso We selected and cloned the zzso zzso to produce the zzso Further characterization of the zzso zzso revealed that it was able to zzso the zzso that it did not inhibit the zzso zzso activity and consequently could be used to measure the zzso zzso activity in zzso after zzso
