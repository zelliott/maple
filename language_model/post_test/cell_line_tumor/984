Several recent studies by us have shown the strong zzso efficacy of zzso against both ultraviolet B zzso radiation and chemical zzso zzso in mouse skin zzso The molecular mechanisms underlying zzso protective zzso however, are not completely zzso Here, we examined the effect of zzso on zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of cells with different doses of zzso zzso zzso and different time periods zzso resulted in a zzso and zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso however, resulted in an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interestingly, its zzso caused a decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A similar pattern in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was observed with these zzso zzso Further, zzso treatment prior to or immediately after zzso exposure altered zzso zzso zzso and zzso c levels in zzso and zzso in favor of or against zzso zzso zzso treatment prior to zzso also increased the zzso of zzso activated protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as compared to its zzso Together, for the first time, our results demonstrate the role of zzso zzso machinery and zzso signaling cascade in zzso increase as well as protection in zzso zzso in zzso cells, and suggest that similar mechanisms might be involved in preventive efficacy of zzso against zzso skin zzso
