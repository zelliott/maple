The present study was performed to investigate the possible combined use of the zzso inhibitor zzso acid and the zzso zzso zzso and to zzso the mechanisms underlying enhanced zzso by this combination treatment in human lung cancer zzso Combined zzso zzso treatment zzso induced zzso cell death, activated zzso zzso and induced zzso zzso zzso The combination treatment also triggered zzso through zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, combined zzso zzso treatment significantly induced zzso stress responses, and suppression of zzso expression significantly attenuated the combined zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and the subsequent zzso cell death, indicating a role of zzso stress in zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, the zzso effects of combined zzso zzso treatment were realized through zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that sequential zzso stress and zzso zzso are critical in combined zzso zzso zzso zzso in human lung cancer zzso
