Most zzso drugs have their origin in traditional medicinal zzso We describe here a zzso zzso zzso from the leaves of the Thai plant zzso zzso that has zzso and zzso zzso Because the nuclear zzso zzso zzso is linked to inflammation and zzso we investigated the effect of zzso on this zzso We found that zzso suppressed zzso zzso induced by inflammatory agents, tumor zzso and zzso This suppression was not specific to the cell zzso Although zzso did not directly modify the ability of zzso proteins to bind to DNA, it inhibited zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso leading to suppression of zzso and degradation of zzso and suppressed zzso zzso nuclear zzso thus zzso zzso reporter gene zzso zzso of the zzso cell signaling zzso by the zzso led to the zzso of expression of zzso gene products that mediate inflammation zzso survival zzso zzso zzso and zzso proliferation zzso zzso invasion zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso growth zzso zzso of zzso gene products by zzso correlated with the enhancement of zzso induced by tumor necrosis zzso and the zzso agents zzso zzso and zzso Overall, our results indicate that zzso suppresses the zzso of zzso and zzso gene zzso leading to the enhancement of zzso This is the first report to demonstrate that this novel zzso has zzso and zzso effects by targeting the zzso zzso
