zzso is a selective, irreversible inhibitor of the zzso activity of the zzso and is undergoing clinical evaluation in zzso zzso zzso zzso is an orally zzso zzso The activities of zzso and zzso zzso against solid tumor zzso are less well zzso We investigated the impact and mechanisms of action of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso models of head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso 

The effects of zzso and zzso zzso on zzso cell survival and zzso tumor growth were zzso The impact and mechanisms of both agents on zzso and zzso induction were also zzso The contribution of the unfolded protein response zzso to zzso induction and the role of zzso in attenuating zzso cell death were zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso zzso induced zzso in zzso cell lines via zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso by these agents served to dampen their zzso zzso and zzso zzso also induced zzso zzso in part, by zzso of the zzso zzso involving zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso induction served a zzso zzso zzso administration of zzso zzso inhibited the growth of zzso zzso tumors in a zzso zzso 

These results show that zzso and zzso zzso are zzso active against zzso cells, and the activities of these agents can be enhanced via suppression of zzso or zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits in zzso activity against zzso tumors and may represent a useful therapeutic agent for this zzso
