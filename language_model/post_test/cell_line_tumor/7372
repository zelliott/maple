zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso displays a potent zzso activity against a variety of human tumors including zzso zzso zzso and, thus, this agent is being tested in the clinical trial for the treatment of zzso zzso In this study, the authors determined the safety and distribution zzso of zzso zzso when infused zzso by a zzso injection and by zzso delivery zzso in an zzso nude mouse model of zzso 

For the safety studies, zzso nude mice were given zzso infusions of zzso zzso into normal zzso by either a zzso injection or a zzso zzso zzso was assessed by performing a zzso examination of the mouse zzso For the drug distribution studies, nude mice with zzso implanted zzso zzso tumors were given an zzso zzso or a zzso infusion of zzso zzso Brain tumor samples obtained between zzso and 72 hours after the infusion were assessed for drug distribution zzso by performing zzso and Western zzso zzso Based on the zzso changes in the tumor and brain, the maximum tolerated dose of zzso zzso zzso infusion in nude mice was determined to be 4 zzso when delivered by a zzso injection and 10 zzso when zzso was zzso Drug distribution reached the maximum level 1 hour after the zzso injection and the volume of distribution was determined to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was barely zzso 6 hours after the zzso Interestingly, when delivered by zzso injections zzso zzso exhibited superior distribution in larger rather than smaller zzso zzso delivery was superior for drug distribution in the zzso tumors because when zzso was used the drug remained in the tumors 6 hours after the zzso 

These studies provide confirmation of a previous hypothesis that zzso of zzso zzso is superior to zzso injections not only for the safety of the normal brain but also for maintaining drug levels for a prolonged period in infused brain zzso These findings are highly relevant and important for the optimal clinical development of zzso zzso or any other targeted zzso agent for zzso therapy, in which multiple routes of delivery of an agent are being zzso
