zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso acts as an zzso and zzso growth factor, which promotes zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and changes the response to hormones and to zzso We explored zzso mechanisms involved in differential zzso gene expression in breast cancer cells with different zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and weak recruitment of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factors, and zzso is indicative of low zzso accessibility and gene zzso at the zzso gene zzso In highly zzso zzso cells, strong zzso zzso and restriction zzso accessibility, as well potent zzso zzso of the zzso gene promoter, coincide with increased zzso zzso zzso zzso and promoter enrichment of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso factors and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibitor experiments further demonstrate involvement of zzso zzso and zzso zzso members, but not of the alpha zzso zzso in promoting zzso accessibility and zzso across the zzso gene promoter in zzso breast cancer zzso Finally, the natural zzso zzso A was found to repress zzso gene zzso in zzso breast cancer cells upon dual zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso factors and zzso of zzso promoter zzso zzso
