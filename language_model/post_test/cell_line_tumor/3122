zzso zzso zzso zzso associates with zzso proteins and its loss can lead to zzso of zzso zzso It is frequently zzso in cancer, including prostate cancer, but its function in prostate cancer is unclear because it can increase proliferation of prostate zzso zzso We investigated the function of zzso in zzso prostate cancer and found that zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso zzso cells but not of an zzso zzso zzso suggesting a role in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso was unaffected by zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso suggesting it does not involve zzso zzso zzso also inhibited zzso and expression of zzso and zzso together did not further inhibit zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso activate the same zzso to inhibit zzso However, zzso zzso of zzso was unaffected by zzso of zzso involved in zzso and zzso cell polarity zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso domain of zzso zzso with zzso receptors expressed in prostate cancer cells, suggesting that zzso complexes activate a signal that leads to repression of zzso Taken together, these observations highlight the function of zzso zzso zzso in the control of zzso activity and provide one explanation for zzso zzso in prostate zzso
