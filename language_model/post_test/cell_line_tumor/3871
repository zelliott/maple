zzso zzso bone zzso and zzso zzso zzso are incurable due to the inability to eradicate zzso cancer zzso cells zzso that are likely responsible for relapses and drug zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso activity of zzso zzso killer zzso cells against zzso bone zzso and zzso including against putative zzso zzso killing was evaluated both in zzso and within an zzso mouse model of zzso zzso To identify putative zzso zzso bone zzso and zzso cells were engineered with a zzso detector zzso zzso zzso under the control of the human promoter for zzso a stem cell gene activated in putative zzso Using zzso cells expanded from 21 patients, we found that zzso cells efficiently killed zzso and zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso infusion of zzso cells delayed zzso tumor growth in zzso zzso Further in zzso analyses established that zzso cells could zzso tumors and that tumor growth zzso occurred without an enrichment of zzso relative to zzso zzso These results provide zzso zzso for an effective strategy to attack zzso zzso including putative zzso supporting the clinical development of zzso cells as a novel class of zzso for use in settings of zzso zzso zzso
