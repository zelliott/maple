Drug combinations are a promising strategy to overcome the zzso mechanisms and unwanted zzso effects that limit the utility of many potential zzso However, enthusiasm for this approach is tempered by concerns that the therapeutic zzso of a combination will be accompanied by synergistic side zzso Using large scale simulations of bacterial metabolism and zzso zzso experiments relevant to diverse diseases, we provide evidence that synergistic drug combinations are generally more specific to particular cellular contexts than are single agent zzso We highlight six combinations whose selective zzso depends on zzso drug zzso For one zzso example, we show how such selectivity is achieved through differential expression of the drugs' targets in cell types associated with zzso but not toxic, effects and validate its therapeutic relevance in a rat model of zzso The context specificity of synergistic combinations creates many opportunities for zzso relevant selectivity and enables improved control of complex biological zzso
