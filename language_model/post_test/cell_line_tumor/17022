Two zzso zzso and zzso complexes zzso and zzso with combination of zzso and zzso were zzso and fully characterized by zzso zzso mass zzso zzso analysis as well as X-ray zzso In an in zzso zzso zzso toward the zzso cell lung cancer cell lines of zzso and zzso zzso showed the stronger activity than zzso which was confirmed by the zzso zzso zzso studies for zzso showed that zzso of zzso cell growth was zzso by zzso cell cycle arrested without the significant zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso altered the zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso which were known to control zzso phase of the cell zzso Our western zzso analysis also showed that zzso zzso cell cycle arrest was zzso through the decreased expression of zzso zzso zzso E1 and zzso
