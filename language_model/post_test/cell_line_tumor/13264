Conventional zzso therapy zzso is limited by the penetration depth of visible light needed for its zzso Here we used zzso zzso fluorescent zzso zzso as a zzso to convert deeply penetrating zzso light to visible zzso and a carrier of zzso We also used the zzso capability of the zzso at a single zzso wavelength for simultaneous zzso of two zzso for enhanced zzso We showed a greater zzso efficacy with the zzso approach compared to approaches using a single zzso as determined by enhanced generation of zzso oxygen and reduced cell zzso In zzso studies also showed tumor growth zzso in zzso mice by direct injection of zzso into melanoma tumors or intravenous injection of zzso zzso with a zzso agent into zzso zzso As the first demonstration, to the best of our knowledge, of the zzso zzso as an in zzso zzso agent, this finding may serve as a platform for future zzso zzso zzso
