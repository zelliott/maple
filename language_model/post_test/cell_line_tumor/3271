We assessed the in zzso toxicity of various particles on three zzso zzso cell lines, zzso zzso zzso The cells were exposed to zzso suspensions zzso zzso zzso well) of urban particulate matter zzso zzso zzso fine particulate matter zzso titanium dioxide zzso and zzso zzso zzso for 2 h and were then zzso with zzso zzso 100 zzso and zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso After overnight incubation with the particles and zzso zzso oxide production was estimated from culture zzso zzso Cell viability was determined by monitoring the rate of zzso zzso The zzso relationships for zzso and viability were modeled as a power function zzso change zzso zzso where beta represents the slope of the zzso zzso zzso was defined as the rate of change in zzso production corrected for cell viability zzso zzso zzso - zzso Overall, the urban particles decreased zzso oxide production zzso zzso zzso while exposure of the cells to fine particulate matter or zzso increased the production of zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso dioxide zzso was essentially inactive zzso approximately to zzso The decrease in zzso oxide production seen in cells exposed to the urban particles was directly correlated to a decrease in the expression of zzso zzso oxide zzso as determined by Western zzso zzso The results indicate that particles are zzso of zzso oxide production in zzso zzso and may directly disrupt expression of zzso during zzso pathogen zzso Pathways leading to enhanced NO production causing cell injury, and to decreased NO release resulting in lower bacterial zzso may both be relevant to the health effects of ambient zzso
