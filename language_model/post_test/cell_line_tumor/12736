The expression of zzso molecules has been confirmed in many types of cancer cells, including colon cancer cells, and they are considered important zzso zzso Recent studies have revealed the existence of different zzso forms of zzso zzso however, no studies have examined their expression in gastrointestinal zzso In 2004, we reported the existence of the zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso of zzso In this study, we investigated the relationship between human colon cancer and our recently cloned zzso gene with a coding region of 594 zzso In the first examination, zzso expression was analyzed by zzso in human colon cancer and adjacent normal zzso zzso The associations of its expression status with zzso parameters and the prognosis were also zzso zzso zzso expression was observed in 37 zzso of 80 primary colon zzso but not in the adjacent normal zzso zzso zzso The rate of zzso gene expression was significantly higher in colon cancer with zzso zzso The zzso survival rate of patients with zzso zzso primary colon cancer was significantly poorer, at zzso than that zzso of zzso zzso zzso In the second examination, after the introduction of the zzso gene into cells of the colon cancer cell line zzso zzso changes in their invasive capacity was zzso The zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso cells was significantly lower than their empty zzso zzso zzso We speculate that zzso expression in colon cancer is an important factor involved in the invasive capacity of cancer cells in the presence of zzso zzso
