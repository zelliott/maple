zzso belongs to a family of zzso zzso found in organisms ranging from bacteria to zzso zzso zzso zzso is a heat zzso protein that behaves as a zzso at low temperature and as a zzso at high temperature to help remove unfolded proteins during heat zzso In contrast to bacterial zzso little is known about the function of human zzso Here, we report the first evidence that human zzso is a zzso protein and zzso zzso stability and cell zzso zzso zzso is localized to zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso During zzso zzso zzso zzso associates with zzso and newly zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso associates with zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso zzso results in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso Finally, zzso of zzso promotes cell zzso whereas enhanced expression of zzso zzso cell zzso These results offer an original identification of zzso as a zzso protein and provide initial zzso insights into the role of zzso in the regulation of cell zzso by modulating zzso zzso
