T cell zzso zzso 3 zzso has been found to play an important role in zzso zzso and zzso responses, but the function of soluble form of zzso zzso remains to be zzso In this study, we report the zzso effect of zzso on T zzso immune zzso In this study, zzso zzso was found, among different zzso and zzso only in zzso cells, and the zzso of zzso resulted in zzso production of both zzso zzso and zzso We constructed a zzso expression zzso zzso which expresses functional zzso zzso In zzso mice zzso with zzso melanoma cells, the growth of tumor was facilitated by the expression of this zzso in zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibited the responses of T cells to zzso stimulation or zzso zzso plus zzso zzso zzso and the production of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso In tumor rejection model, zzso significantly impaired T cell zzso zzso evidenced by decreased zzso zzso activity and reduced amount of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis of gene expression in tumor zzso revealed the decreased expression of zzso zzso genes and the unchanged profile of the genes related to T regulatory cell function, suggesting that the zzso effect of zzso on the generation of zzso T cells in zzso is dominated by T zzso cells rather than T regulatory zzso Our studies thus define zzso as an zzso zzso that may be involved in the negative regulation of T zzso immune zzso
