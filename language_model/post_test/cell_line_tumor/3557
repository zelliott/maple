zzso natural and synthetic derivatives of vitamin A, are active in cancer therapy and zzso We reported previously that zzso acid zzso treatment prevented zzso transformation of immortalized human zzso zzso zzso zzso To identify cancer zzso mechanisms, immortalized zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells were used to conduct zzso analyses zzso Species increased in zzso as compared with immortalized zzso cells zzso I) and those zzso in zzso as compared with transformed zzso cells zzso zzso included known zzso genes as well as previously zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso both groups were also enriched for zzso zzso One zzso gene of particular interest was zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was also induced after prolonged zzso of immortalized zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown previously as zzso in certain lung cancer cell lines, directly implicating zzso in lung zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was reduced in a subset of zzso as compared with adjacent normal lung zzso that were zzso zzso analyses were performed using a new zzso developed to detect this species using rabbit zzso zzso zzso independently raised against the zzso or zzso of zzso Studies done on zzso and fixed zzso revealed abundant zzso but low levels of zzso D1 expression in the normal human zzso zzso indicating an inverse relationship existed between these zzso To study this further, zzso into zzso cells of zzso or zzso zzso species was zzso In a zzso manner, zzso but not zzso zzso species zzso zzso D1 zzso This implicated zzso in a zzso zzso mechanism involving zzso D1 repression described zzso Taken together, these findings directly zzso zzso as a zzso target for lung cancer zzso These findings also provide a zzso basis for the tumor zzso effects of zzso through zzso D1 zzso
