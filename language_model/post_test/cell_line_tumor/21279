Although systemic zzso deprivation zzso life in advanced prostate cancer, zzso are temporary because patients almost zzso progress to a state of a zzso prostate cancer zzso as indicated by recurring zzso This complex process of progression does not seem to be zzso as the timing and zzso are highly zzso including the observation that most zzso genes are zzso despite zzso levels of serum zzso Recent evidence indicates that zzso levels of zzso remain moderately high following systemic zzso deprivation therapy, whereas the zzso zzso zzso remains functional, and zzso the zzso expression following zzso suppresses tumor growth and blocks the expression of genes known to be regulated by zzso From these zzso we hypothesized that zzso progression is not independent of zzso activity and that zzso may be zzso de zzso in zzso tumors leading to zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso model, we showed that tumor zzso increase during zzso progression in correlation to zzso zzso We show here that all zzso necessary for zzso synthesis are expressed in prostate cancer tumors and some seem to be zzso during zzso zzso Using an ex zzso zzso zzso coupled to zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso we show that tumor zzso isolated from zzso progression are capable of de zzso conversion of zzso acid to zzso and zzso of zzso allows detection of the production of six other steroids upstream of zzso This evidence suggests that de zzso zzso synthesis may be a driving mechanism leading to zzso progression following zzso
