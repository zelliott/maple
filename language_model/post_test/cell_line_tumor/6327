zzso zzso cancer is resistant to conventional zzso A zzso of zzso cancer cells, the zzso zzso cancer stem cells zzso stem zzso have zzso properties, zzso zzso activity, and represent the zzso zzso Currently, there is no effective treatment that targets these zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with tumor initiation and progression and is zzso in numerous zzso The aim of this study is to determine the effect of zzso zzso in zzso stem zzso zzso stem cells were treated with the zzso zzso zzso Cell growth was monitored by zzso real-time imaging system, cell viability was measured using the zzso 96 zzso and zzso levels were zzso using zzso zzso The zzso changes associated with zzso treatment are: zzso zzso and cell cycle zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso and zzso nuclear zzso of zzso Thus, zzso of zzso decreases cell proliferation in the zzso stem cells by inducing cell cycle arrest and affecting the zzso zzso As zzso stem cells represent a source of recurrence and zzso these results suggest that zzso zzso may effectively target the cancer stem cell population in zzso zzso
