Multiple myeloma zzso is an incurable B zzso zzso To date, a comparative analysis of global protein metabolism for the zzso cell line zzso zzso and the zzso B zzso cell line zzso zzso has not been zzso Here, we report that both global protein synthesis and degradation occur at a higher rate in zzso cells and demonstrate that zzso agents can reduce global protein degradation in both cell lines, but the effect is greater in zzso zzso Treatment with zzso plus the zzso inhibitor zzso reduced global protein degradation for zzso cells to roughly zzso of that seen without drugs, but the reduction was approximately three times greater for zzso zzso This drug combination was growth zzso for both cell lines, but zzso zzso was zzso greater than that of the zzso cell zzso Additionally, treatment with zzso plus the zzso inhibitor zzso did not affect growth of zzso cells more than zzso alone, whereas this combination drastically inhibited growth of zzso cells despite protein degradation being maintained at zzso level for both cell zzso This suggests that a zzso function other than protein degradation is required for recovery from zzso damage in zzso zzso In general, zzso cells were affected to a greater extent for both protein degradation and growth zzso with most drug combinations zzso zzso analysis of our data zzso provides evidence that zzso zzso protein degradation zzso with zzso in zzso cells, but that zzso protein degradation does zzso
