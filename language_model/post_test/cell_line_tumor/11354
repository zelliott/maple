zzso zzso zzso zzso which functions in zzso diversification, is also expressed in a variety of germ and zzso zzso Evidence that AID promotes DNA zzso in zzso zzso phenomena, and that it is induced by inflammatory signals, led us to investigate its role in the zzso transition zzso a critical process in normal zzso and tumor zzso We find that expression of AID is induced by inflammatory signals that induce the zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells and in zzso breast cancer zzso zzso zzso of AID blocks induction of the zzso and prevents cells from acquiring invasive zzso zzso of AID suppresses expression of several key zzso zzso regulators and is associated with increased zzso of zzso islands zzso to the promoters of these zzso zzso the DNA zzso agent 5 zzso zzso zzso the effects of AID zzso on the expression of zzso zzso We conclude that AID is necessary for the zzso in this breast cancer cell model and in zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that AID may act near the zzso of a hierarchy of regulatory steps that drive the zzso and are consistent with this effect being zzso by zzso zzso This evidence links our findings to other reports of a role for AID in zzso zzso and control of gene zzso
