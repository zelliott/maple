zzso is a member of a family of zzso proteins that are involved in zzso signal pathways altering cell zzso zzso and zzso Increased expression of zzso has been described in lung cancer and associated with increased tumor zzso zzso zzso are a family of small zzso zzso zzso 21-25 zzso zzso that are capable of targeting genes for either degradation of zzso or zzso of zzso zzso is a predicted putative target gene for zzso zzso of zzso in a lung cancer cell line resulted in a decrease in zzso protein without any zzso in the associated zzso These lung cancer cells exhibit a decrease in zzso migration, and zzso zzso cancer cell invasion was also evident following targeted zzso of zzso zzso alters lung cancer cell zzso by zzso zzso migration, and invasion and the effects on invasion may be partially zzso through zzso zzso
