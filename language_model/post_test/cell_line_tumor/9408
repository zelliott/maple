zzso is a zzso cell surface protein expressed primarily on zzso cells including zzso from chronic zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have generated a series of zzso zzso zzso against zzso and assessed their therapeutic potential for zzso Selective zzso to zzso were further tested in functional zzso zzso zzso and zzso cellular zzso zzso zzso in cell lines and B zzso freshly isolated from zzso zzso While lower levels of zzso were detected in T and natural killer zzso cells, zzso activity was demonstrated primarily in B cells isolated from zzso patients and B zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso by small interfering zzso in target cells results in lower zzso demonstrating the specificity of the zzso Furthermore, anti zzso zzso demonstrated zzso activity against zzso human zzso zzso in nude mice and against zzso zzso zzso human zzso cells in severe combined zzso zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate zzso as a potential new target for zzso of zzso and zzso
