zzso cell survival and proliferation is attributable in part to suppression of zzso zzso yet the mechanisms by which cancer cells resist zzso are not fully zzso Many cancer cells zzso express zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso to generate zzso zzso and carbon monoxide zzso These breakdown products may play a role in the ability of cancer cells to suppress zzso zzso zzso channels also play a crucial role in zzso permitting zzso zzso which is required to initiate zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso is zzso expressed in human zzso zzso and can be induced in the zzso cell line zzso either chemically or by zzso zzso of zzso markedly increases the resistance of zzso cells to zzso zzso This effect was zzso by zzso application of the zzso degradation product zzso zzso we demonstrate the presence of the zzso zzso channel, zzso in both human zzso tissue and zzso zzso CO inhibited the zzso zzso currents in zzso cells, and largely reversed the zzso increase in zzso channel zzso zzso zzso zzso prevented the zzso increase of zzso channel activity in zzso cells, and enhanced their resistance to zzso Our findings suggest that zzso zzso of zzso channels represents an important mechanism by which zzso can increase the resistance to zzso of zzso cells, and support the idea that zzso zzso may enhance the effectiveness of current zzso and zzso
