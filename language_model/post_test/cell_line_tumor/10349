We report a simple expression and zzso procedure for the production of zzso zzso zzso zzso an important protein for the zzso zzso in humans that plays critical roles in the zzso of cardiovascular and neurodegenerative zzso Our approach is based on the expression of a zzso fusion construct in bacterial cells and subsequent removal of the fused zzso using the highly specific zzso zzso avoiding costly and zzso zzso steps used zzso Our approach results in zzso high-yield production of structurally and functionally competent zzso as evidenced by secondary structure zzso zzso and chemical melting profiles and the kinetic profile of zzso of zzso zzso zzso This protocol is appropriate for laboratories with little experience in zzso zzso and will facilitate future studies on the role of zzso in the zzso of cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's zzso
