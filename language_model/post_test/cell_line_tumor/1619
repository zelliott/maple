zzso zzso zzso is a lethal zzso that can develop from the zzso condition, Barrett's esophagus zzso Currently, there are no validated simple methods to predict which patients will progress to zzso A better understanding of the genetic mechanisms driving zzso zzso is needed to identify new therapeutic targets and develop zzso capable of identifying high-risk patients that would benefit from aggressive zzso zzso We employed an zzso zzso approach to identify novel genes involved in zzso biology that may serve as useful clinical zzso 

Whole zzso zzso array comparative zzso zzso was used to identify significant regions of copy number zzso in 20 zzso and 10 matching BE zzso Copy number and gene expression data were integrated to identify candidate zzso within regions of amplification and multiple additional sample zzso were assessed to validate candidate zzso 

We identified zzso as a novel, candidate zzso activated by amplification in approximately zzso of zzso zzso zzso was also amplified in BE from a patient whose zzso zzso amplification and was zzso expressed between zzso and zzso zzso Copy number gains were detected in other cancer types and zzso zzso inhibited proliferation and zzso growth of cancer cells with increased copy number but had little effect on those zzso Moreover, high zzso expression was associated with poor patient outcome in multiple cancer zzso 

zzso is a candidate zzso amplified in zzso zzso DNA amplification is also prevalent in other zzso cancer types and zzso expression could serve as a zzso zzso
