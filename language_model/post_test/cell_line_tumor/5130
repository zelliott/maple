During the last years zzso rates of more than zzso for zzso zzso treatment in relapsed or zzso acute zzso leukemia have been zzso zzso is under clinical investigation for therapy of leukemia and solid zzso Due to the chemical affinity of zzso and zzso we analyzed the potency of zzso zzso to exert zzso zzso Based on the same zzso zzso lower efficacy in zzso induction and zzso decrease of zzso membrane potential was observed for zzso No difference in sensitivity to zzso or zzso was detected in zzso cells when compared to their multiple drug resistant zzso zzso was induced by combining zzso zzso of zzso or zzso with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Other zzso of the cellular zzso system showed this effect to a lower extent and enhancement was not consistent for the different cell lines zzso zzso zzso protected cell lines from zzso and zzso zzso When zzso was added, the zzso lost their protective zzso The ability of zzso of the cellular zzso system in clinically zzso zzso to enhance the zzso effects of the two zzso in a synergistic way may be helpful to reduce their toxicity by zzso their zzso
