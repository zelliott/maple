Because of its potent ability to induce zzso zzso zzso virus zzso is an attractive candidate as an zzso virus for tumor zzso Previous studies have suggested that zzso selectively zzso tumor cells due to defects in their zzso responses making them more susceptible to zzso infection than normal zzso We tested this hypothesis in the prostate tumor system by comparing zzso and zzso prostate tumor cells to benign human zzso zzso cells from patient zzso zzso We compared the cell killing ability of a zzso virus containing a zzso zzso M protein zzso and an zzso M protein zzso virus zzso that zzso zzso zzso in infected cells and should display a greater selectivity for tumor zzso Our results showed that in zzso infection experiments, zzso cells were sensitive to killing by both zzso and zzso zzso while zzso cells were highly resistant to zzso cell zzso zzso and benign prostate cells were similarly susceptible to both zzso indicating that normal prostate cells are not inherently resistant to killing by zzso In each of the cell lines, the zzso virus induced similar levels of zzso to zzso virus, showing that the M protein does not play a significant role in zzso induction by zzso in these zzso In zzso infection experiments, zzso cells were more sensitive than benign zzso zzso cells to zzso cell killing by zzso virus, but not zzso zzso Both viruses were equally effective at reducing zzso tumor volume in zzso following zzso and intravenous zzso in nude mice, while zzso tumors were resistant to zzso zzso None of the mice treated with zzso virus died as a result of virus infection, while zzso of mice treated with zzso virus succumbed to virus zzso Similarly, when zzso by the more sensitive zzso route, the zzso virus was less zzso than the zzso virus from which it was zzso These results indicate that M protein zzso viruses are superior candidates as zzso viruses for therapies of prostate tumors, but future strategies for use of zzso will require testing individual tumors for their zzso to virus zzso
