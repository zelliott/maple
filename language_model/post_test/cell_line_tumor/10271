The zzso protein zzso zzso particularly in its zzso form, is widely recognized for its involvement in Parkinson disease zzso Recent genetic studies reveal that zzso in the gene zzso are the most widespread genetic risk factor for zzso identified to zzso zzso encodes for zzso zzso the zzso deficient in the zzso storage disorder, zzso disease zzso In this work, we investigated the possibility of a physical linkage between zzso and zzso examining both wild type and the zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso and nuclear magnetic resonance zzso we determined that zzso and zzso interact selectively under zzso solution conditions zzso zzso and mapped the interaction site to the zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso complex does not form at pH zzso and is stabilized by zzso with zzso zzso ranging from zzso to 22 zzso in the presence of 25 to 100 zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso form of zzso has a reduced affinity for zzso as does the inhibitor zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies verified this interaction in human tissue and zzso cell culture, zzso Although our data do not zzso zzso interactions in other cellular zzso we suggest that the zzso association is favored in the zzso and that this zzso interaction provides the groundwork to explore molecular mechanisms linking zzso with zzso zzso zzso
