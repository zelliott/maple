zzso zzso is recognized as an important mechanism for controlling numerous cell surface zzso This event contributes not only to regulate signal zzso but also to adjust the amount of cell surface zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso family proteins for zzso zzso Recent studies indicated that zzso is zzso in response to zzso stimulation to activate downstream signaling zzso After zzso it appears that zzso is recycled back to the plasma zzso However, whether zzso zzso is sorted to zzso for protein degradation remains zzso We here report that a coated zzso zzso of 104 zzso zzso selectively zzso zzso degradation of zzso We identify zzso as a novel binding partner of zzso zzso a scaffold protein in the zzso signaling zzso Interestingly, we find that zzso also interacts with zzso but not with zzso or zzso zzso selectively zzso zzso zzso of zzso via the zzso pathway, which is suppressed by zzso of a dominant negative form of zzso zzso is subsequently zzso by a zzso zzso Indeed, zzso of zzso zzso by zzso interference results in an increase in the amount of zzso In contrast, zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso but does not stimulate its zzso zzso or zzso of zzso results in a significant suppression or zzso of the zzso pathway, zzso These results suggest that zzso regulates the amount of zzso by inducing zzso degradation, which probably contributes to the suppression of the zzso signaling zzso
