To assess the effects of external beam zzso zzso on zzso zzso expression in zzso and in zzso and to define an optimal strategy for combining sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso therapy with zzso 

zzso of reporter genes zzso green fluorescent protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso was assessed in tumor cell lines under zzso conditions and following zzso The effects of viral zzso of infection zzso and zzso dose on the magnitude and duration of gene expression were zzso In zzso studies were done with zzso and zzso 

zzso increased zzso zzso and zzso expression in zzso head and neck, and lung cancer zzso zzso dose and zzso were important zzso of response to zzso with greatest effects at higher zzso doses and lower zzso zzso exerted both zzso (through increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso effects, irrespective of promoter sequence zzso zzso zzso or zzso Analysis of the schedule of zzso followed by viral infection revealed zzso zzso at 24 zzso zzso maintained increasing zzso zzso from zzso over 6 days, in direct contrast to reducing levels in zzso zzso The effects of zzso in increasing and maintaining zzso zzso expression were also seen in zzso using zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso increased the magnitude and duration of zzso gene expression from zzso zzso The zzso effect is zzso at 24 hours, but zzso zzso is maintained at an elevated level over 6 days after zzso
