The aim of this study was to determine whether the ethanol extract of roasted licorice zzso could inhibit breast zzso bone zzso zzso treatment reduced the viability of zzso human zzso breast cancer cells but did not show any zzso in zzso human zzso cells and zzso bone zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited expression and zzso of zzso zzso of nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso and protein expression of zzso in zzso cells exposed to the zzso medium of breast cancer zzso zzso dramatically inhibited zzso zzso in zzso thereby reducing zzso pit zzso Moreover, treatment with zzso A and zzso as the active zzso whose contents are increased by the roasting process, remarkably suppressed zzso zzso formation in zzso zzso Furthermore, orally administered zzso substantially blocked tumor growth and bone destruction in mice zzso with breast cancer cells in the zzso zzso levels of zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso of type I collagen and zzso bone zzso parameters were reversed to almost the same levels as the control mice by the zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso may be a beneficial agent for preventing and treating bone destruction in patients with breast zzso
