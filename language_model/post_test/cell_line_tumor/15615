zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso occurs during the formation of new blood vessels that are required for tumor zzso We sought to determine whether zzso zzso in zzso delivery of tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso cells, could suppress zzso and subsequent tumor growth in a zzso zzso zzso zzso volume 28 days after zzso of tumor cells with producer cells generating zzso zzso zzso was zzso that of controls, as was the mean tumor vascular index, a measure of blood vessel zzso When tumors were allowed to reach a mean volume of zzso zzso before treatment, their size 2 weeks later was zzso relative to zzso larger tumors were not significantly zzso When producer cells were injected at surgical sites following zzso of subcutaneous tumors, local recurrence 14 days later was only zzso in zzso producer cell treated mice as compared to zzso in zzso zzso zzso of melanoma cells in zzso another tumor of neural crest origin, resulted in zzso tumor growth, despite the fact that these tumors are susceptible to zzso zzso demonstrating the importance of tumor cell zzso in this zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso in zzso gene transfer of zzso to tumor cells can significantly restrict zzso zzso and tumor zzso This approach may be an effective zzso in the treatment of zzso and other solid tumors zzso to traditional therapy, although it appears to be most effective in smaller tumors or in the setting of minimal residual disease, and the tumor cells must be susceptible to zzso zzso zzso
