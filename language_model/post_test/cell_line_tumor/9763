zzso is a special type of programmed cell death after loss of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Resistance to zzso is likely involved in the process of zzso specifically during the tumor cell migration through zzso or vascular zzso We have previously shown that zzso zzso resistance to other forms of programmed cell death zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso regulates zzso zzso We therefore tested the hypothesis that pancreatic cancer cell lines are resistant to zzso and this resistance is due to zzso of zzso and subsequent zzso of zzso 

zzso cancer cell lines zzso and zzso were examined for cell death following loss of adherence to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso cell line zzso selected in zzso for increased zzso potential zzso or zzso zzso zzso were also examined for induction of zzso following loss of zzso zzso zzso Finally, the effect of the zzso inhibitor zzso on zzso expression and induction of zzso was zzso 

Under conditions of loss of zzso zzso interaction, pancreatic cancer cells undergo varying amounts of zzso zzso levels of activated zzso and zzso paralleled the sensitivity to induction of zzso The highly zzso cell line, zzso was more resistant to zzso than the parental cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and was associated with restoration of sensitivity to zzso 

zzso of a signaling zzso from zzso to zzso of zzso may zzso resistance to zzso a critical step in the development of zzso zzso the zzso zzso may lead to zzso of pancreatic cancer to zzso thereby decreasing the ability of these cells to zzso
