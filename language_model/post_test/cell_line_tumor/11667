Although zzso is widely used as an zzso agent, its use is significantly limited because of its tendency to induce zzso through poorly understood zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is well known to regulate zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate whether zzso zzso zzso zzso failure associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso production in an animal zzso zzso mice were treated with zzso (18 zzso and zzso function, zzso stress, and zzso zzso were zzso zzso mice showed increased blood zzso nitrogen and zzso levels, zzso damage, zzso stress, and zzso In accordance with these results, the cellular zzso ratio and zzso activity were markedly increased in the zzso of zzso mice compared to zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso by zzso treatment significantly improved zzso dysfunction and reduced zzso cell damage, zzso stress, and zzso This study demonstrates that zzso protects cells against zzso failure induced by zzso and that this effect is zzso by decreased zzso activity via cellular zzso zzso These results provide convincing evidence that zzso might be beneficial for zzso zzso failure induced by zzso
