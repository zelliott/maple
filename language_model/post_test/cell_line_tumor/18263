The zzso C virus zzso zzso possesses an open reading frame overlapping the core gene in the zzso frame zzso zzso zzso studies, mainly in rabbit zzso zzso indicated that the zzso zzso zzso is expressed by a zzso zzso at zzso 8-11 during translation zzso of the viral zzso resulting in a protein known as alternative reading frame protein zzso zzso zzso or zzso However, subsequent investigation, based on reporter zzso carrying portions of the zzso ORF, suggested the function of alternative mechanisms for zzso expression in zzso cells, including translation initiation from internal zzso zzso or zzso Because results from these studies have been zzso we sought to re-evaluate expression of the zzso zzso using zzso carrying the complete zzso coding sequence fused to zzso or zzso We showed here that zzso zzso serve as the zzso initiation sites for internal translation initiation of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso cells, which support nuclear or zzso transcription, zzso We also showed that internal translation initiation can occur zzso with the expression of the zzso protein that is produced artificially in zzso or naturally in zzso zzso Furthermore, translation of zzso zzso is not significantly affected by the presence of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein is zzso and exhibits an zzso distribution similar to that of the zzso zzso
