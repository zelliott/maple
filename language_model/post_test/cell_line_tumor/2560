zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in various human zzso zzso the related zzso zzso derived from zzso is essential for the development of specific zzso of zzso zzso In this study, we predicted and identified zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso with computer-based zzso zzso zzso zzso and testing of the induced zzso toward different kinds of zzso zzso The results demonstrated that zzso induced by peptides of zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso could specifically zzso zzso and lyse tumor cell lines of zzso and zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso zzso and zzso peptides are novel zzso restricted zzso zzso and could be zzso in the cancer zzso against a broad spectrum of zzso
