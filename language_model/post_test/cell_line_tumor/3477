The molecular mechanisms by which zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso regulated remain largely zzso Previous genetic and zzso studies indicate that zzso a zzso protein containing zzso repeats and an zzso domain in its zzso region, acts as a feedback negative regulator of zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso zzso Here we tested whether the related human zzso (also called zzso protein can act as a negative regulator of zzso zzso and its relatives, zzso zzso and zzso We observed that in zzso zzso cells, zzso forms a complex with each of the zzso receptors independent of growth factor zzso We further observed that zzso of zzso with zzso zzso suppresses cellular zzso levels, shortens zzso zzso and enhances zzso zzso zzso Finally, we observed that zzso of zzso suppresses zzso transformation of zzso zzso and that the zzso expression of zzso in zzso prostate tumor cells suppresses zzso and zzso cell cycle zzso Our observations indicate that zzso is a negative regulator of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso and suggest that zzso zzso zzso and degradation may contribute to the suppression of zzso zzso zzso
