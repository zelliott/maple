Rapid induction of zzso is known to be zzso by factors which bind DNA following zzso zzso We report here that zzso zzso zzso is involved in a cooperative interaction with zzso and zzso to form a zzso poised complex for zzso gene zzso A double point zzso at a putative zzso binding site, which zzso this composite zzso zzso zzso site located in the zzso and zzso response element zzso inhibited human zzso zzso reporter activity to about 10 percent of the control wild type zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso binding of zzso zzso and zzso at the zzso while binding of zzso beta was activated at an adjacent zzso beta site after zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso was zzso zzso following zzso zzso Supporting the involvement of zzso zzso zzso reporter activity in zzso was enhanced by zzso expression of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of a zzso zzso zzso functioned as a zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso reporter zzso In zzso DNA binding using extracts from zzso zzso confirmed that the zzso zzso zzso binds a zzso complex containing zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies using in zzso proteins revealed that zzso enhanced the binding of zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso an zzso zzso with zzso and zzso enhanced zzso reporter activity in zzso cells, which was dramatically reduced when zzso zzso was zzso These results suggest that the rapid zzso induction of an important inflammatory gene is dependent upon zzso cooperative binding of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complex to the zzso which zzso the gene for immediate induction following zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso factors like zzso may be an important strategy for the rapid zzso zzso of genes involved in innate zzso
