zzso tumor zzso 1 zzso a component of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso complex is routinely zzso in several zzso In the present study, we investigated the potential role of zzso in zzso zzso repression and subsequent zzso zzso zzso complex was found to zzso regulate zzso zzso by physically zzso with an zzso zzso element zzso on the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso complex recruited to the zzso of zzso promoter in an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein levels were enhanced by zzso of either zzso expression or by treatment with the specific zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso strong repressive effects on zzso expression was supported by our observation that cells zzso zzso zzso showed zzso amplification which has been long implicated as a zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in cells zzso over expressing zzso resulted in restoration of normal zzso zzso Together, these findings strongly zzso zzso in the zzso repression of zzso leading to abnormal zzso number and zzso zzso
