Heat shock factor 1 zzso is the master switch for heat shock protein zzso expression in zzso A synthetic chemical library was screened to identify zzso of zzso using a zzso reporter under the control of a heat shock zzso A compound named zzso zzso was identified for its activity in abolishing the heat zzso zzso activity with an zzso of zzso zzso When the cells were exposed to heat shock in the presence of zzso the induction of zzso downstream target proteins such as zzso and zzso was zzso In addition, treatment of zzso cells with zzso induced growth arrest and zzso zzso of zzso such as zzso zzso zzso were detected after zzso zzso zzso was zzso as an affinity probe for the identification of zzso target zzso Using affinity zzso and competition zzso zzso was shown to associate with zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso inhibited zzso recruitment of zzso zzso zzso zzso factor b) to the zzso zzso Finally, zzso treatment of nude mice with zzso at 50 zzso resulted in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of tumor growth without body weight zzso zzso zzso showed that the expression of zzso was lower in zzso tumor tissue than in control zzso Because zzso are expressed at high levels in a wide range of tumors, these results strengthen the rationale for targeting zzso in cancer zzso
