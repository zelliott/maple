The zzso zzso factor has a pivotal role in zzso zzso Multiple transcripts of the zzso gene are generated because of alternative promoter usage and zzso zzso is the zzso zzso of zzso observed during zzso zzso and in human zzso Loss of zzso expression has been shown to promote zzso in a subset of human cancer cell zzso Here, we studied whether the regulation of zzso by zzso controls the zzso of an zzso cancer cell zzso We demonstrate that zzso expression is induced by all zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso protein was observed to bind to the zzso promoter, and zzso of zzso zzso resulted in diminished zzso zzso Although zzso of zzso zzso zzso expression leading to an increase in cell migration, zzso of zzso or zzso results in reduced cell migration as a result of increased zzso zzso zzso it is conceivable that zzso zzso cell invasion by regulating zzso zzso Finally, we observed that expression of zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso mouse skin, but a reduced or complete absence of zzso expression was observed in skin from zzso mice and in zzso mouse embryonic zzso In conclusion, we demonstrate a direct zzso regulation of zzso by zzso Our results highlight a crucial role for zzso in zzso biological zzso
