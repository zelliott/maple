The zzso B virus zzso X gene plays an important role in zzso zzso especially zzso zzso of a stable and zzso zzso expression system will allow study of the function of this zzso Here, we describe the development of a zzso zzso zzso zzso with the full-length zzso X gene and all components of the zzso zzso gene expression zzso This zzso exhibited zzso zzso induction of the zzso protein in zzso and zzso zzso We also observed zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso After zzso zzso cells with the zzso zzso we isolated five zzso cell clones with stable zzso zzso two of which exhibited stable and tight control of zzso expression by zzso This new system has great potential for functional studies of the zzso X zzso
