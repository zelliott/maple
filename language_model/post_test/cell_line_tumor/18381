Most tumor specific zzso characterized to date are restricted by zzso zzso which is the major zzso zzso in many ethnic zzso Cancer cells that express tumor zzso in association with the zzso zzso zzso have been shown to be responsive to various zzso We therefore sought to identify zzso cell lines that also express this zzso zzso and determine whether they had the molecular properties needed for zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was identified with zzso using zzso zzso followed by DNA zzso With this method, we screened 15 zzso cell lines to determine if they were of the zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines that express the zzso zzso zzso were further studied for the expression of zzso class I and zzso zzso molecules by flow zzso and zzso presentation molecules zzso zzso and zzso by zzso We identified six out of zzso cell lines that were of the zzso zzso zzso These cell lines are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso All these six cell lines exhibited high levels of zzso class I and zzso zzso In addition, these cell lines all expressed molecules required for zzso presentation as shown by the presence of zzso zzso molecules zzso zzso and zzso The identification of zzso cell lines that express the zzso zzso zzso along with the necessary molecules for zzso will enable their use in developing new zzso approaches for treating brain zzso The method used to identify zzso zzso zzso cells is rapid and zzso and suitable for screening tumor zzso
