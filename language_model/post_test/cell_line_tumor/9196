zzso zzso are peripheral nerve sheath tumors that arise frequently in zzso type 1 zzso and have a risk of zzso zzso Past efforts to establish zzso models for zzso involved the zzso of tumor fragments or zzso primary cultures, which rarely achieved significant tumor zzso We report a practical and zzso animal model of zzso zzso by zzso of an zzso human zzso zzso zzso cell line into the peripheral nerve of zzso zzso The zzso and zzso positive zzso cell line was shown to possess a normal zzso and have apparent full-length zzso by Western zzso These cells were shown to have a constitutional zzso zzso and elevated zzso activity, however, suggesting loss of normal zzso zzso zzso zzso injection of the cell line zzso produced consistent and slow growing tumors that infiltrated and disrupted the host zzso The zzso tumors resembled zzso zzso with a low rate of zzso abundant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso high zzso and mast cell zzso The zzso features of the developed tumors were particularly consistent with those of human zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells enables the precise initiation of zzso zzso tumors and provides a highly zzso model for the study of zzso zzso zzso This model zzso testing of potential therapeutic interventions, including zzso zzso in a relevant cellular zzso
