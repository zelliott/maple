zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso are two key molecules involved in zzso zzso and cell proliferation during tumor growth and zzso Our previous data showed that zzso zzso in human breast zzso zzso cells induced an zzso of zzso zzso This effect was associated in zzso with accelerated tumor growth and zzso We now provide evidence that zzso zzso specifically affected zzso production and failed to influence that of other zzso family members zzso B, C, D, or zzso or their zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso was related to an increased zzso zzso rather than to a modification of zzso zzso It was blocked by synthetic zzso zzso zzso but not zzso and abolished by a partial deletion of the zzso domain or the zzso tail of zzso Analysis of the signal zzso mechanisms demonstrated that zzso acts through a signaling zzso involving zzso zzso zzso Thus, our results provide new insight into the mechanisms of action of zzso during zzso and suggest that the full zzso activity of zzso is required for a specific zzso of zzso through an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso
