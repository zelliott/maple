zzso of cellular differentiation is an attractive therapeutic strategy against zzso cell proliferation and zzso zzso in zzso studies have indicated that zzso zzso the proliferation of cultured zzso cells and zzso changes in cellular zzso making it potentially useful as a therapeutic agent for zzso The purpose of this work was to expand on the preliminary research by investigating the differentiation effect of zzso in rat zzso zzso cells, using zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso as a reliable marker of differentiation for normal zzso and for tumors of zzso zzso Cell cultures were grown in the absence or presence of 10 zzso zzso zzso for 48 zzso zzso treatment produced changes in cell zzso and zzso expression indicative of cellular zzso These results suggest that zzso is an attractive differentiation agent for the treatment of zzso
