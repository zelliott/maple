zzso zzso tissue 1 zzso which is located in a zzso region that encodes unknown tumor zzso zzso activates nuclear zzso in zzso zzso However, its expression and role in the pathology of zzso tumors of zzso origin is not zzso In the present study, we examined zzso expression and its implications for the pathology of oral zzso zzso localized zzso in the nucleus of normal oral zzso cells, but the expression was absent in zzso of zzso zzso of 109 zzso especially at the invasive zzso The loss of expression was correlated with tumor recurrence zzso zzso zzso and poor patient survival zzso zzso zzso and it was an independent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso instability at the zzso locus and a specific zzso zzso positioned at zzso from the zzso and the expression was recovered by zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso cells showed zzso located at the nucleus independent of its domain structures, and its loss of expression induced the zzso zzso These results show that zzso is expressed in the nucleus of oral zzso cells and that its expression is zzso zzso during tumor zzso suggesting that the detection of zzso expression is a useful zzso and zzso zzso in the clinical management of oral zzso
