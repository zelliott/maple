zzso to two or more objectives simultaneously has been pursued as a strategy to potentially increase the efficiency and selectivity of targeted drugs to certain zzso In this study, an zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso fusion protein zzso consisting of an zzso zzso variable zzso zzso an zzso zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso against zzso was constructed, and then an zzso analog zzso was generated by integration with an zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso The zzso zzso was used as a zzso to connect the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso and also served as a specific zzso for the extremely potent zzso zzso zzso of zzso Compared with its zzso counterparts, zzso and zzso the zzso fusion protein zzso showed higher affinity to zzso tumor zzso Determined by the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso showed highly potent zzso to zzso zzso cells, with an zzso value of zzso zzso whereas for the zzso zzso cells, the zzso value was zzso zzso For zzso cells, the zzso zzso was more potent in zzso than the corresponding zzso energized fusion zzso In zzso mice models, the zzso fusion protein zzso presented stronger zzso activity than the zzso zzso and zzso For the zzso fusion zzso zzso significantly inhibited the growth of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso showed much higher efficacy than its zzso zzso zzso and zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso The results show that zzso zzso effectively improved the zzso zzso Both the zzso fusion protein and its zzso analog are highly effective in zzso mice bearing zzso and the latter exerts more marked zzso Generation of a pair of zzso zzso zzso and its corresponding zzso zzso simultaneously may be a feasible strategy for the development of new targeted drugs for cancer zzso
