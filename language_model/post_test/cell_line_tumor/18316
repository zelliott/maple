zzso has the potential to zzso or be used in the treatment of, zzso transitional cell zzso induced by zzso We evaluated its effectiveness by measuring the amount of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso changes of zzso zzso and the amount of zzso zzso zzso human zzso cancer cells were incubated with 30 zzso zzso with different zzso of zzso for various zzso zzso cells treated with zzso (16 zzso were then harvested and used in 2 zzso zzso zzso cells were incubated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 16 zzso zzso for 6, 12, 18, 24 and 48 zzso zzso zzso cells were incubated with various zzso of zzso and zzso zzso 16 zzso for 24 zzso zzso and zzso were measured by zzso Then in the prepared human zzso cell zzso different zzso of zzso and zzso were added to measure the kinetic zzso of zzso Next, zzso zzso in human zzso cells with or without treatment with zzso were detected and zzso The final two steps included measuring the zzso zzso complex after treatment with and without zzso and evaluating the effect of zzso on the zzso zzso Higher zzso of zzso induced decreasing zzso zzso We found that the longer the culture period, the greater the difference in zzso zzso in the same zzso zzso It was also noted that increase in zzso was zzso to incubation zzso In the presence of 16 zzso of zzso zzso of zzso decreased by up to zzso zzso decreased the amount of zzso production in human zzso cells in all examined zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso values in the zzso zzso decreased after the addition of zzso to the zzso Finally, zzso decreased the amount of zzso production and zzso zzso formation in human zzso cells in all examined zzso zzso The percentage of cells stained by zzso was significantly different after treatment with zzso especially with the higher zzso zzso The zzso zzso level and the zzso ratio decreased significantly with higher zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso affected zzso activity, gene expression zzso zzso zzso zzso formation and formation of zzso zzso in human zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso should be considered as a candidate agent for the prevention or treatment of transitional cell zzso
