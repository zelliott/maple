Human zzso zzso 16 zzso gene product encodes the major transforming activity of the virus so as to induce zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso protein is required for both the establishment and maintenance of the transformed cellular zzso zzso understanding of the molecular and zzso factors leading to the expression of zzso protein is important in relation to zzso zzso Previously, we identified a rare zzso usage and a specific interaction between zzso zzso 7 and zzso zzso zzso as factors modulating zzso zzso zzso In the present study we report that zzso a zzso marker of zzso oral and cervical cancer zzso promotes the expression of zzso zzso zzso by binding to the zzso zzso These findings shed light on the dynamic functionality of the intermediate filament zzso open new perspectives for investigating the role of zzso in controlling zzso zzso zzso and suggest new therapeutic avenues for zzso zzso
