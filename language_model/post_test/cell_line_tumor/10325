The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility and zzso of protocols using zzso iron oxide zzso zzso to label human prostate cancer cell lines zzso in zzso The zzso cells were labeled with different zzso zzso zzso of zzso and increasing incubation time zzso hours), in the presence or absence of a zzso agent zzso zzso The cell labeling efficiency was analyzed by zzso blue stain zzso The cellular viability was evaluated using zzso blue dye exclusion zzso The signal intensity change of the labeled cells was assessed with magnetic resonance imaging zzso The results demonstrated that the iron oxide zzso by zzso cells was dependent on dose and zzso The zzso significantly increased the iron load of cells ( zzso A final concentration of zzso zzso of zzso with zzso hours incubation times could be sufficient to label zzso cells for cellular zzso without impairment of cell zzso This technology may allow for further study into the mechanisms underlying prostate cancer progression as well as permit the real-time imaging of the effectiveness of cancer therapies in zzso
