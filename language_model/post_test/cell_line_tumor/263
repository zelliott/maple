More than 300 zzso compounds have been identified from bee zzso in various regions of the zzso The objective of this study was to examine whether the ethanol extracts of Chinese and Brazilian zzso may exert zzso activities in four human colon zzso cell lines, namely zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso samples were extracted with ethanol, and the crude extracts were dissolved in zzso and used for the zzso In zzso zzso and zzso cell lines, the extracts of both Chinese and Brazilian zzso caused a marked zzso growth zzso with zzso values in the range of zzso zzso In zzso cell line, Chinese zzso extract induced zzso in the cells after 72 h of zzso In addition, Chinese zzso extract caused a zzso increase in the cellular zzso levels of zzso and zzso in the zzso cell zzso These findings indicate that the ethanol extracts of zzso contain components that may have zzso zzso Thus, zzso and related products may provide a novel approach to the zzso and treatment of human colon zzso
