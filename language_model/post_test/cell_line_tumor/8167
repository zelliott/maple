As gene expression signatures may serve as zzso there is a need to develop technologies based on zzso expression patterns that are adaptable for zzso zzso zzso zzso has recently developed a zzso technology, that can zzso for gene expression of a discrete number of genes as a focused zzso The present study has evaluated the zzso of the zzso system as applied to zzso cancer research of genes shown to exhibit distinct expression profiles initially assessed by zzso zzso zzso 

The new zzso zzso gene expression array technology was evaluated for the expression of 93 genes selected based on their zzso zzso profiles as applied to zzso cancer zzso zzso design was based on the zzso target sequence that favors the 3' zzso of transcripts in order to maximize zzso across zzso Gene expression analysis was performed using the zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses were performed to evaluate zzso of both the magnitude of expression and differences between normal and tumor samples by correlation zzso fold change differences and statistical significance zzso 

Expressions of 82 of 93 zzso genes were highly correlated zzso zzso zzso in a comparison of the two zzso Overall, 75 of 93 zzso genes exhibited consistent results in normal versus tumor tissue comparisons for both platforms zzso zzso zzso The fold change differences were zzso for 87 of 93 zzso zzso where there was agreement between the platforms regarding statistical significance for 71 zzso of 87 zzso There was a strong agreement between the two platforms as shown by comparisons of zzso fold differences of gene expression between tumor versus normal samples (R zzso zzso and by zzso analysis, where greater than zzso of expression values fell within the zzso limits of zzso 

zzso zzso of gene expression patterns based on zzso statistical significance between tumor and normal zzso data, and fold changes was consistent between the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso and zzso of the technology suggests that the zzso array is a suitable platform for zzso zzso
