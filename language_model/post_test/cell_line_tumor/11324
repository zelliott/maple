Acute zzso leukemia with high zzso viral integration zzso expression zzso zzso is classified as a zzso type of leukemia with a poor zzso To provide new insights into the prevention and treatment of this disease, we identified the high expression of zzso G zzso zzso 56 zzso and the association of high cell zzso and zzso activities in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression decreased the cellular zzso ability through zzso of zzso zzso resulting in a reduction of cellular growth rates and enhanced zzso Moreover, in zzso mice, the number of zzso stem cells zzso was significantly decreased in the bone zzso zzso and, conversely, was increased in the zzso liver and peripheral zzso The number of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso was significantly reduced and was associated with impaired cellular zzso Finally, the loss of zzso function resulted in a reduction of the in zzso zzso ability of the zzso In conclusion, zzso may represent an important zzso for the maintenance of zzso by acting as a zzso of interactions with the zzso zzso zzso zzso this zzso has the potential to become a novel molecular target in zzso zzso
