zzso zzso zzso from zzso bacteria, such as zzso zzso are zzso factors responsible for zzso formation associated with zzso zzso The underlying cellular mechanism for zzso formation requires T cell zzso zzso zzso formation can be prevented by zzso zzso injection of zzso zzso alone, a process also dependent on T zzso zzso the zzso role of T cells in zzso formation was zzso We show that zzso interact directly with T cells with fast zzso zzso zzso repertoire analysis using zzso demonstrates that zzso have broad zzso zzso zzso zzso responded to a variety of other zzso but not to a zzso zzso indicating zzso between different zzso Furthermore, zzso T cell zzso could effectively transfer protection against zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso capacity of T cells recovered from zzso animals revealed that these T cells are zzso to subsequent stimulation by the different zzso or to zzso in an zzso This zzso response was relieved by addition of zzso Taken together, the data show that this class of zzso interacts directly with T cells in a zzso manner to elicit an zzso zzso response that zzso protection against zzso zzso
