The effects of zzso zzso with an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complementary to the zzso template region were examined on human multiple myeloma zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell lines, primary zzso cells, and tumor zzso zzso treatment reduced zzso levels in all cells and induced more rapid zzso zzso Continuous zzso treatment for 7 to 14 days resulted in zzso arrest, zzso changes, and zzso characteristic of cell crisis in tumor cell lines with short zzso zzso but not long zzso zzso zzso zzso administration of zzso also inhibited the growth of zzso and NHL zzso established from cell lines with short zzso zzso lymphoma, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased tumor zzso However, zzso therapy of NHL zzso established from cells with long zzso zzso zzso had zzso effects on tumor growth and did not induce zzso during this time zzso zzso daily zzso administration of zzso in myeloma zzso with short zzso lengths also decreased tumor zzso levels and reduced tumor zzso These data demonstrate that zzso is important for the replication of mature zzso zzso by stabilizing short zzso and they suggest that zzso zzso represents a novel therapeutic approach to zzso and zzso
