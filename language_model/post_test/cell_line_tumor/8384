zzso cancer zzso the human zzso growth factor 2 zzso protein has a poor outcome, although a combination of chemotherapy and the zzso zzso zzso has been approved for the treatment of advanced gastric zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso expression in gastric cancer is correlated with recurrence and poor zzso however, the zzso zzso zzso has shown limited efficacy against gastric cancer in clinical zzso In this study, we evaluated the zzso effects of zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso and a combination of zzso and zzso in a gastric cancer zzso zzso Although zzso and zzso each moderately inhibited tumor growth, the combination of these agents exerted greater zzso compared with either agent zzso zzso analyses indicated that the reduction in tumor growth was associated with decreased proliferation and increased zzso of tumor cells and decreased tumor vascular zzso The combined treatment resulted in fewer zzso tumor cells, more zzso cells and reduced tumor vascular density compared with treatment with zzso or zzso alone, indicating that zzso and zzso had additive zzso effects on the tumor growth and zzso of the gastric cancer zzso These data suggest that zzso in combination with zzso may represent an effective approach to treating zzso gastric zzso
