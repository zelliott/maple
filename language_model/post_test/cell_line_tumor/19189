Maintenance of zzso stability relies on coordination between various processes that are critical for proper zzso segregation in zzso Here we show that zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso which is essential for the zzso checkpoint, also controls correction of improper zzso zzso We report that zzso a member of the complex that regulates the Aurora B zzso is directly zzso by zzso on zzso that are crucial for Aurora B activity and zzso zzso As a result, cells lacking zzso zzso activity fail to efficiently align zzso due to impaired Aurora B function at zzso leaving improper attachments zzso zzso zzso bearing zzso zzso restores Aurora B activity and alignment in zzso zzso zzso thus coordinates attachment error correction and checkpoint zzso two crucial responses to zzso zzso zzso
