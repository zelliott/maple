zzso cells zzso are critical for zzso zzso immune responses to foreign zzso However, the feasibility of harnessing these cells in zzso to zzso the zzso effects has not been fully zzso The authors investigated a novel therapeutic approach that involves delivering synergistic signals that both recruit and expand DC populations at sites of zzso zzso More specifically, the authors examined whether the zzso of plasmids zzso the zzso zzso inflammatory zzso alpha zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso colony stimulating factor zzso a zzso growth zzso can zzso expand and activate large numbers of DC at sites of zzso zzso It was found that the administration of zzso and zzso resulted in dramatic recruitment and expansion of DC at these sites and in draining zzso zzso Furthermore, treatment with zzso and zzso generated the strongest zzso zzso zzso immune responses in draining zzso zzso and in tumors, produced the greatest zzso effects and enhanced survival rates more than zzso zzso alone and zzso zzso It was also found that zzso plus zzso generated the strongest zzso zzso zzso immune responses in draining zzso zzso and in zzso The findings of the present study suggest that the recruitment and zzso of DC in zzso due to the synergistic actions of zzso and zzso presents a potentially feasible means of controlling zzso zzso and provides a basis for the development of novel zzso zzso
