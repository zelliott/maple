The aim of the present study was to decrease the zzso of false zzso and to better characterize marginally zzso zzso zzso positive peripheral blood samples from patients with early stage breast zzso A new set of highly specific zzso for zzso which avoids amplification of zzso zzso DNA, was designed and evaluated to improve the specificity and sensitivity of the previously described zzso The zzso were specifically designed to avoid amplification of zzso zzso DNA and zzso zzso The breast cancer cell line zzso was used as positive control for the development and zzso evaluation of the zzso while peripheral blood samples from 62 healthy female individuals and 160 patients with early breast cancer were used for the evaluation of the sensitivity and specificity of the new primer zzso The novel designed primer pair was highly sensitive, as it detects up to 1 zzso cell, and specific as none of the healthy individuals had zzso zzso zzso positive cells in their peripheral zzso zzso zzso positive cells were detected in 33 out of 160 zzso patients with early breast zzso zzso obtained by the proposed zzso real-time zzso protocol correlated well with those obtained in the same samples by our previously reported quantitative real-time zzso zzso in zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso The improved method eliminates the zzso of false zzso and is highly sensitive and zzso The method could be used in a clinical setting in the near future for continuous monitoring and zzso of circulating zzso cells in the peripheral blood of patients with zzso breast cancer, provided that a quite larger number of clinical samples with a known follow-up will be zzso
