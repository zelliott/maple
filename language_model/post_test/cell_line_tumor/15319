Multiple myeloma zzso is characterized by zzso zzso zzso zzso identified by its fusion to the zzso locus in zzso zzso is universally zzso in zzso zzso In order to identify cell surface zzso associated with zzso zzso for small zzso or zzso based therapies, we knocked down zzso expression with zzso and generated a cell line pair from zzso a zzso zzso cell zzso We used quantitative mass zzso to identify plasma membrane proteins associated with zzso zzso Using this approach, 50 cell surface proteins were identified as zzso expressed between zzso and zzso Western zzso and flow zzso analysis indicated zzso was zzso in zzso zzso cell lines and zzso by zzso zzso zzso expression was also confirmed in primary zzso zzso samples by flow zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis indicated zzso might regulate the zzso level of zzso and be an important functional element for zzso promoter zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso could induce zzso arrest or zzso and reduce zzso capacity in zzso zzso zzso Overall, these results illustrated zzso might be a novel cell surface protein associated with zzso zzso It is potential to develop zzso zzso targeted therapy by zzso zzso zzso drug zzso
