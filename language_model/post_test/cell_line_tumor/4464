The protection or treatment of several zzso disorders is dependent on the zzso and zzso zzso T zzso However, vaccines aimed at stimulating zzso zzso responses are typically ineffective because vaccine zzso are primarily processed by the zzso zzso and not the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso the latter requires zzso delivery of zzso In order to facilitate targeting of zzso to zzso the zzso was combined with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and administered zzso to zzso The zzso was activated by zzso of the injection zzso This zzso zzso zzso strongly increased the stimulation of zzso zzso responses as measured by zzso proliferation and zzso of zzso zzso Fluorescence zzso showed that delivery to zzso was zzso dependent and occurred by zzso disruption of zzso and zzso zzso zzso vaccination prevented growth of zzso zzso cells as compared with vaccination without zzso In conclusion, zzso represents a potent tool for delivery of zzso to zzso for stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso This study demonstrated a first zzso for zzso zzso with potential application in cancer zzso
