To ascertain the potential for zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment in zzso cell lung cancer zzso we analyzed the zzso effects of zzso A zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso in a panel of 16 zzso cell lines via zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso both displayed strong zzso activities in 50% of zzso cell lines, suggesting the need for the use of zzso markers to select patients receiving this zzso There was a strong correlation between the responsiveness to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso To identify a molecular model of sensitivity to zzso inhibitor treatment in zzso we conducted a gene expression profiling study using zzso zzso on the same set of cell lines and related the zzso activity of zzso to corresponding gene expression pattern using a modified National Cancer Institute zzso In addition, zzso analysis was done with zzso Architect zzso We used nine zzso which were identified by zzso sensitivity correlation and zzso analysis, to build a support zzso machine zzso model by which sensitive cell lines were distinguished from resistant cell zzso The prediction performance of the support zzso machine model was validated by an additional nine cell lines, resulting in a prediction value of zzso with respect to determining response to zzso and zzso Our results suggested that zzso zzso zzso may be promising zzso drugs to zzso and zzso the zzso zzso is useful in predicting drug sensitivity to zzso zzso and may contribute to achieving individualized therapy for zzso zzso
