The expression of zzso zzso zzso 2 and 3) and zzso zzso 2, 3, 4 and zzso was examined in the zzso zzso cell line induced to zzso in zzso and compared to the rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated a zzso decrease in zzso zzso 3 expression in zzso zzso zzso no significant change in zzso zzso 2 expression in zzso cells and zzso zzso 1 was not zzso In zzso zzso cells a zzso increase in zzso 2, a zzso increase in zzso 3, and a zzso increase in zzso 4 expression were observed when compared to zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso expression was not zzso After 5 weeks in zzso culture conditions a zzso increase in total zzso incorporation was observed in cells when compared to 24 h or 5 week control zzso This was made up of a zzso decrease in zzso production, a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso and a zzso increase in zzso incorporation into the zzso zzso A zzso increase in zzso incorporation into zzso zzso zzso was also zzso Thus there is zzso expression of genes that control zzso metabolism such that there is a general decrease in the expression of zzso zzso an increase in the expression of zzso and a corresponding decrease in zzso production by zzso zzso zzso
