There is a need to develop alternative therapeutic strategies to overcome zzso resistance in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso of genes has been implicated in the zzso zzso of tumor zzso genes affecting critical biological activities in cancer cells and may be an important factor in acquired zzso zzso In this report, we tested a combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cancer cells to explore the reversal effect of zzso resistance and changes of gene zzso 

To detect the synergistic effects of zzso between zzso and zzso in zzso cancer cells, we performed a cell viability zzso and a zzso zzso To investigate the differences of gene expression between cells treated by zzso alone and zzso with zzso and zzso a zzso zzso analysis was zzso 

In the presence of zzso zzso the zzso concentration value of zzso for zzso cells was much lower than with zzso treatment zzso Gene expression profiles identified that a total of 354 genes had been significantly zzso and a total of 63 genes been zzso with zzso zzso 

We hypothesized that combination of zzso and zzso can override zzso resistance in zzso cancer zzso These results provide initial evidence for testing this combination in clinical zzso
