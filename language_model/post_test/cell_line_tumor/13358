To investigate the growth zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso against certain human cancer cell lines zzso zzso and colon zzso and to evaluate the optimum zzso prescription, as well as the zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso present in the zzso isolate were identified by gas zzso zzso zzso The cell viability of zzso was assessed with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on the zzso study, phase zzso and stability tests, the optimum prescription of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were determined, followed by zzso zzso and its in zzso zzso study in zzso 

The chemical composition of zzso was mainly zzso zzso and zzso zzso After 72 hours of treatment, both the zzso zzso zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the standard zzso drug, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited strong in zzso zzso activity against zzso cells, with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but the zzso performed poorly against zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The optimal zzso prescription consisted of zzso medium chain zzso zzso ethanol, zzso zzso zzso and zzso water zzso with associated zzso of zzso being zzso zzso zzso zzso as compared to free zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The relative oral zzso zzso values of zzso and zzso showed a zzso and zzso increase, zzso of zzso zzso diameter zzso zzso zzso as against free zzso were greatly zzso 

These results indicate that the zzso could be a potential candidate for the development of an zzso drug and it is readily zzso via zzso zzso
