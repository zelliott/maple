Conventional zzso chain zzso zzso sequencing is the standard zzso for the detection of zzso zzso However, this method is deficient in identifying small numbers of zzso cells, and zzso enrichment methods such as zzso or zzso are labor intensive and not always zzso We applied the recently described zzso at lower zzso temperature zzso chain reaction, which zzso minority zzso zzso to detect zzso zzso directly in 29 zzso zzso pancreatic specimens and compared the results with those of conventional zzso chain zzso To avoid a zzso result from the zzso at lower zzso temperature zzso chain reaction zzso we applied a more sensitive zzso zzso acid zzso chain reaction method as the gold zzso zzso experiments indicated an approximately zzso improvement in sensitivity with zzso at lower zzso temperature zzso chain zzso zzso zzso Conventional zzso chain reaction detected zzso zzso in 11 zzso zzso pancreatic specimens zzso whereas zzso at lower zzso temperature zzso chain reaction could identify all of those zzso as well as zzso in 10 additional samples, for a total of 21 zzso P zzso zzso of zzso Unlike zzso zzso acid zzso chain reaction, zzso at lower zzso temperature zzso chain reaction identified all zzso zzso in specimens in which tumor cells accounted for at least zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso at lower zzso temperature zzso chain reaction is straightforward and requires no additional zzso or zzso The technique is a good strategy to detect zzso zzso selectively in zzso zzso zzso without zzso zzso
