In this study, we investigated the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in breast cancer cell lines and nude mice zzso and observed that zzso expression suppresses tumor growth and zzso zzso zzso and protein expression in zzso but not zzso breast cancer zzso Furthermore, a significant inverse correlation exists between zzso and zzso expression at both protein and zzso transcript levels in zzso breast cancer patient zzso zzso zzso expression resulted in decreased zzso protein and zzso expression only in zzso but not zzso breast zzso cell lines, suggesting that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso through an zzso element located within the zzso promoter region that is also targeted by zzso The direct binding of zzso to the zzso promoter was confirmed by zzso zzso analysis, which also showed that zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso promoted growth suppression in zzso cells, but the zzso effects of zzso could be overridden by zzso of zzso indicating that zzso is an important downstream target of zzso zzso Together, these findings define a key zzso role for zzso in breast cancer development through zzso regulating zzso zzso
