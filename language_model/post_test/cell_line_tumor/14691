zzso zzso zzso zzso has two zzso zzso a long form zzso and short form zzso which have distinct functions in the zzso zzso However, the regulatory mechanism of the alternative zzso of zzso is zzso In this study, we examined which zzso factors regulate the expression of zzso and zzso by zzso several zzso proteins in zzso zzso In a cellular zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso protein 1 zzso reduced the expression of zzso whereas the zzso of zzso increased the expression of zzso We also identified the regions of zzso that are responsive to zzso using zzso zzso and deletion zzso Our results indicate that zzso regulates the alternative zzso of zzso Considering that zzso zzso zzso protein zzso A, which zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso may contribute to the zzso of zzso by regulating the expression of its zzso
