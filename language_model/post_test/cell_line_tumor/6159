Human zzso is stored in zzso zzso of human mast cells as a zzso zzso zzso in solution can be directly processed to the mature zzso by zzso zzso L and zzso and zzso processed by zzso at zzso followed by zzso zzso However, it is uncertain which zzso is involved in zzso processing inside human mast cells, because zzso bone zzso mast cells from zzso mice convert zzso zzso mast cell zzso to mature mouse mast cell zzso This finding suggests that other zzso are important for processing human zzso In the current study, reduction of either zzso or zzso activity inside zzso cells by short hairpin zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso substantially reduced mature zzso zzso Similar reductions of zzso levels in primary zzso mast cells were observed with these zzso zzso In contrast, zzso processing was minimally reduced by short hairpin zzso zzso of zzso A putative zzso inhibitor of zzso markedly reduced zzso levels, suggesting an zzso zzso zzso mast cells contain substantially greater amounts of zzso and zzso than do zzso cells, the opposite being found for zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso zzso compartment of skin mast zzso Thus, zzso and zzso are central to the processing of zzso in human mast cells and are potential targets for attenuating production of mature zzso in zzso
