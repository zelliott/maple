zzso factor 4 zzso is an abundant protein stored in zzso zzso Several patients have been described with zzso zzso zzso including the gray zzso syndrome, characterized by a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso formation and protein targeting are considered to be the zzso zzso We have reported on a patient with zzso and impaired zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso associated with a zzso in the zzso factor zzso zzso expression profiling showed decreased transcript expression of zzso and its zzso zzso zzso 

To understand the mechanism leading to zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso we addressed the hypothesis that zzso is a zzso target of zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso cells revealed zzso binding to zzso consensus sites at zzso and zzso on the zzso zzso In zzso reporter studies in zzso cells, zzso of each site markedly reduced zzso zzso promoter activity and zzso protein level were decreased by small interfering zzso zzso zzso and increased by zzso zzso 

Our results provide the first evidence that zzso is regulated by zzso and that impaired zzso regulation leads to the zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso Because our patient had decreased zzso zzso and zzso (not zzso by zzso levels, we zzso additional defects in zzso genes involved in zzso zzso These studies advance our understanding of the mechanisms in zzso zzso
