We have previously shown that zzso acts as a general zzso zzso and forced expression of zzso exerts an zzso effect on a number of human cancer zzso In this report, we have investigated the role of zzso zzso in cell growth zzso For this, we generated human prostate cancer cells zzso zzso zzso with short hairpin zzso targeting zzso We have observed retarded growth and longer doubling time of zzso zzso zzso cells as compared with control zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso analysis suggested that zzso cells expressing zzso small interfering zzso accumulated during zzso phase of the cell zzso Further analysis suggested that depletion of zzso was associated with reduction of zzso A and zzso B1 expression when compared with that of the control zzso A delayed induction of zzso A and B1 expression was observed in zzso zzso cells zzso upon serum zzso although the level of expression was much lower than that of control zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells restored zzso A and zzso B1 zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso of zzso in prostate cancer cells zzso cell proliferation by zzso zzso A and zzso B1 zzso
