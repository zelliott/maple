zzso evidence has demonstrated that zzso growth zzso zzso is tightly associated with the development and progression of zzso However, its biological functions in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso remain to be zzso In this study, we found that expressions of zzso zzso and protein in zzso zzso and cells were significantly higher than that in normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso further investigation showed that zzso protein level in zzso cells was obviously higher than those in zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso level was closely associated with zzso staging, tumor differentiation and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not related to the patients' age and gender zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso expression markedly inhibited zzso reduced invasion and induced zzso in zzso zzso More importantly, reduced zzso level evoked the zzso of zzso and zzso proteins and zzso of zzso protein of zzso pathway, accompanied with the decreases of zzso and zzso protein expressions and increases of zzso protein level and zzso zzso zzso our data suggest that zzso plays pivotal roles in the development and progression of zzso and combinations with zzso and zzso zzso may be effective and feasible molecular targets for therapy of zzso
