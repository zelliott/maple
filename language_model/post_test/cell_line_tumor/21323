zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso have generated considerable hope for cancer treatment, specifically for lung and breast zzso zzso identification of a natural, nontoxic zzso as an inhibitor of zzso is of considerable zzso zzso an zzso present in pigmented fruits and vegetables, possesses potent zzso and zzso zzso In our study, employing zzso positive breast cancer zzso cells and immortalized zzso cells, we evaluated the effect of zzso on zzso and its downstream signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso treatment of both zzso cells and zzso cells inhibited the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso Further, zzso treatment of zzso cells inhibited zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and cell zzso We then compared the growth zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso 48 zzso and found that it resulted in a decrease in cell growth of zzso and zzso cells but had only minimal effects on normal zzso zzso zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso resulted in zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso with an increase in the expression of zzso In zzso our study identifies a naturally occurring dietary agent zzso as an effective inhibitor of zzso signaling in breast cancer zzso We suggest that zzso could be developed as an agent for the management of zzso positive human zzso
