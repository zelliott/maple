DNA zzso a DNA modification by adding zzso group to zzso has an important role in the regulation of gene zzso DNA zzso is known to be associated with gene zzso by interfering with zzso zzso such as zzso zzso DNA zzso is closely related to zzso and the zzso state of some genes can be used as a zzso for zzso zzso DNA zzso of zzso regions, including zzso islands, zzso zzso and first zzso is related to the altered gene expression pattern characteristics of all human zzso zzso 1 surveys recent developments on DNA zzso and gene expressions in zzso Then we provide analysis of DNA zzso and gene expression in 30 breast cancer cell lines representing different tumor zzso This study conducted an integrated analysis to identify the relationship between DNA zzso in various zzso regions and expression levels of downstream zzso using zzso data zzso zzso followed by next-generation sequencing of zzso zzso and zzso gene expression zzso zzso The goal of this study was to assess zzso zzso profiles associated with different molecular zzso of human breast cancer zzso zzso A, and zzso zzso and to zzso investigate the effect of DNA zzso on gene expression in breast cancer zzso This showed that zzso of zzso regions near zzso start sites, zzso island, zzso zzso and first zzso was strongly associated with gene repression, and the effects of the regions on gene expression patterns were different for different molecular zzso of breast zzso The results further indicated that zzso zzso of specific zzso regions was significantly associated with different breast cancer zzso
