The aim of this study was to investigate the expression of bone zzso protein 7 zzso in human pulmonary cancer zzso and to evaluate the cellular impact of bone zzso proteins on pulmonary cancer zzso zzso expression was determined in human lung cancer cell zzso The zzso and growth of cells zzso with zzso in zzso were evaluated using the in zzso invasion zzso and in zzso zzso zzso Cellular migration was zzso using wounding zzso zzso zzso correlated with the absence of bone zzso zzso In this analysis, we identified that 4 of 4 small cell lung cancer zzso tissue specimens had no zzso zzso which illustrated that zzso may have no role in zzso zzso expression was not correlated with the overall survival time in lung cancer zzso zzso of zzso expression significantly inhibited the zzso of zzso cells ( zzso and zzso of zzso dramatically increased the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells and its zzso in zzso cells did not significantly alter proliferation compared with the control cells zzso zzso In conclusion, we have demonstrated that zzso has an important role in controlling lung cancer cell zzso and zzso without affecting the growth process, cell proliferation and cell zzso A higher zzso expression may be an indicator for bone zzso The therapeutic role of zzso warrants further zzso
