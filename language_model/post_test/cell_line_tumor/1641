Since previous work using a zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso showed promising zzso activity, we zzso that a zzso zzso at high levels that could also replicate would be even more zzso zzso a replication competent, zzso zzso viral zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso responses in two zzso mouse flank models of lung zzso Although zzso had equivalent in zzso efficacy in both zzso tumor models, the mechanisms of tumor killing were completely zzso In zzso tumors, viral replication was minimal and the tumor killing mechanism was due to zzso of immune responses through induction of a local inflammatory response and production of zzso zzso zzso In contrast, in zzso tumors, the zzso zzso well, induced an innate immune response, but zzso activity was primarily due to a direct zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso was able to augment the efficacy of an zzso vaccine in the zzso tumor model in association with increased numbers of zzso zzso zzso These data show the complex relationships between zzso viruses and the immune system which, if understood and harnessed correctly, could potentially be used to enhance the efficacy of zzso
