zzso compounds zzso are emerging compounds of zzso They are widely distributed in the environment, wildlife and zzso Concern has been raised over their possible adverse effects on human zzso This study was designed to determine zzso effects of two important zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in a single and a mixture of them exposure to zzso zzso zzso The results showed that zzso and zzso zzso zzso induced production of zzso oxygen species zzso dissipation of zzso membrane potential and zzso of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, activities of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were increased, whereas activities of zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso content was zzso zzso expression of zzso such as zzso zzso zzso was evident in zzso or zzso exposure zzso The possible mechanism was that they could overwhelm zzso of zzso systems, boost zzso generation, impact zzso and affect genes expression of zzso regulators, which resulted in start-ups of zzso zzso zzso exposed to mixture of zzso and zzso and each of them showed zzso rate significant difference, which indicated that the combined effect of two compounds was zzso effect, but neither synergistic nor zzso zzso
