Met, the zzso for zzso growth factor zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that has recently emerged as an important contributor to human zzso In zzso and pathological conditions, Met triggers various cellular functions related to cell zzso cell migration and the zzso of zzso and also regulates a genetic program leading to zzso Since zzso zzso express high levels of tissue factor zzso the main zzso of blood zzso we therefore examined the link between Met and zzso expression in these pediatric zzso We observed that stimulation of the zzso cell line zzso with zzso led to a marked increase of zzso expression and zzso activity, in agreement with analysis of clinical zzso tumor zzso in which tumors expressing high levels of Met also showed high levels of zzso The zzso increase in zzso expression and activity required zzso family zzso and led to the zzso of zzso to zzso structures at the cell zzso suggesting a role of the protein in cell zzso zzso addition of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso to zzso zzso cells promoted a marked increase in the migratory potential of these zzso Overall, these results suggest that zzso zzso of the Met zzso results in zzso expression by zzso cells and that this event probably contribute to tumor proliferation by enabling the formation of a provisional zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso functions, such as migration toward zzso may also play a central role in zzso zzso
