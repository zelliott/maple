We have developed a zzso approach for the synthesis of zzso zzso iron oxide zzso for zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and drug delivery zzso In this approach, iron oxide core zzso were obtained by zzso of iron zzso in the presence of zzso and provided zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso was highly water zzso which allowed zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso for sustained drug zzso The zzso zzso has exhibited superior zzso effects over time under alternating magnetic field compared to pure magnetic zzso zzso and zzso coated zzso zzso Additionally, the improved zzso characteristics were also observed for the zzso zzso in zzso gel and in zzso resistant zzso cancer cells zzso compared to zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso of zzso exhibited many folds of imaging contrast zzso Due to the zzso capacity of the zzso zzso its zzso zzso zzso exhibited almost equivalent zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cancer cells even though zzso release was only zzso The improved therapeutic effects were verified by examining molecular effects using Western zzso and transmission electron microscopic zzso zzso zzso also exhibited zzso suggesting a zzso agent for cancer zzso
