zzso killer zzso cells may represent a promising zzso for the treatment of children with zzso zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso following zzso stem cell transplantation zzso zzso we investigated the possibility of combining adoptive zzso with zzso cells and human zzso zzso in order to zzso the zzso of zzso cells against zzso 

zzso zzso derived zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso with zzso saline (PBS) or zzso and tested for zzso zzso We tested the zzso and zzso disease zzso effects of zzso cells in a human zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso 

Bulk zzso cells showed very moderate zzso activity while the zzso of zzso zzso cells showed significant zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso significantly zzso the zzso of zzso cells in zzso and induced signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso cells could delay mouse mortality significantly in zzso and this effect was enhanced significantly by zzso zzso Furthermore, unlike CB zzso cells or peripheral blood zzso cells zzso zzso cells, alone or zzso with zzso caused either no zzso or mild zzso respectively, when injected into zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cells are effective zzso agents against human zzso cell lines in zzso and possess zzso activity that is zzso by zzso in an zzso mouse model in zzso These zzso data support the testing of this zzso approach in the clinic for the treatment of zzso
