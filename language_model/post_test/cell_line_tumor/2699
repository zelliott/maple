zzso breast zzso zzso are aggressive tumors with high zzso rates and poor zzso We recently reported that zzso of primary zzso express the zzso zzso factor zzso binding zzso zzso and zzso it with small interfering zzso zzso zzso the growth of zzso cell zzso To understand the basis of these earlier findings, we zzso zzso complexes by zzso zzso zzso Several tumor zzso genes such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso family members were zzso In addition, zzso and zzso are zzso expressed in zzso cell lines, as well as in normal human zzso zzso zzso zzso was confirmed to be a zzso target through traditional zzso and zzso zzso More specifically, zzso binds to zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso decreased zzso promoter activity, zzso as well as protein levels and zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso or a zzso active zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso or zzso attenuated zzso growth of zzso cell zzso Together, these findings zzso zzso as a target of zzso that work in concert to promote zzso zzso
