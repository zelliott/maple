zzso sclerosis complex zzso an inherited tumor predisposition syndrome associated with zzso in zzso or zzso affects zzso in 6,000 zzso Eighty percent of zzso patients develop zzso zzso and zzso involvement is a major contributor to patient morbidity and zzso Recent work has shown that zzso target of zzso complex 1 zzso zzso caused zzso shrinkage but that this treatment may cause zzso not a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stress can develop in zzso cells due to zzso protein zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso cells experience zzso stress that can be leveraged to result in targeted zzso We used immortalized human zzso cells zzso zzso with empty zzso or zzso zzso zzso Using cell number zzso and cell death zzso we found that zzso zzso with zzso suppressed zzso cell proliferation in a zzso zzso zzso cells exhibited enhanced sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso stress compared with zzso zzso After zzso zzso with zzso Western zzso analyses showed greater induction of zzso protein zzso and more zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso supporting zzso zzso zzso Live cell numbers also were decreased and cell death increased by zzso in zzso cells compared with zzso zzso zzso while zzso of zzso cells with zzso attenuated zzso and zzso zzso zzso markers zzso zzso and zzso and zzso translation initiation factor zzso zzso were increased, along with evidence of increased zzso These results suggest that human zzso cells are uniquely susceptible to agents that exacerbate zzso stress and that additional zzso may be achievable with targeted combination zzso
