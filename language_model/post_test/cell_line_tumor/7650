Ewing's zzso zzso is the second most common zzso zzso in children and is driven by the fusion zzso zzso and zzso by rapid growth and early zzso Here, we explored the role of the zzso protein zzso zzso interacting protein 6 zzso in zzso The zzso family comprises seven zzso proteins involved in migration and proliferation of many cell types of which zzso has been described as a zzso zzso in zzso 

By interrogation of published zzso data zzso zzso zzso we observed that of all zzso zzso only zzso is highly zzso in primary zzso compared with normal zzso zzso of published zzso zzso and zzso zzso experiments as well as zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso is not zzso by zzso zzso and subsequent zzso enrichment analyses of zzso cells with and without zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso expression zzso a zzso and zzso zzso signature to zzso zzso While short-term proliferation was not considerably affected by zzso zzso zzso of the protein significantly reduced migration, invasion, long-term proliferation and zzso of zzso cells in zzso as well as zzso in zzso 

Taken together, our data indicate that zzso acts, in contrast to zzso as an zzso that partially accounts for the autonomous zzso invasive and zzso properties of zzso cells independent of zzso
