To decrease zzso expression by zzso zzso and zzso the zzso in zzso cells induced by zzso 

We had designed three zzso zzso and zzso them into zzso zzso The optimal sequence was selected based on the results of cell viability at various zzso zzso and different zzso zzso Fluorescent zzso was used to detect the zzso efficiency, interference efficiency was determined by zzso method, and protein expression was measured with zzso 

The optimal zzso sequence was selected based on the cell zzso The zzso efficiency was above zzso the interference efficiency of zzso gene was zzso and the optimal zzso time was zzso after zzso the optimal zzso concentration was zzso zzso there was a significant decrease in zzso protein content after zzso 

The optimal zzso zzso sequence can effectively inhibit the expression of zzso gene and zzso zzso which may decrease zzso in zzso zzso
