zzso is an zzso four alpha zzso zzso produced by activated T zzso To study the in zzso zzso activities of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were genetically modified to zzso zzso zzso These cells developed small tumors that were subsequently rejected by zzso of zzso injected zzso zzso Five days after injection, zzso tumors showed numerous zzso zzso zzso cells, and to a lesser extent zzso T cells, along with the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso molecules zzso and zzso At day 7, zzso and zzso T cells increased together with zzso and the zzso zzso zzso protein 10, zzso induced by zzso and zzso T cell zzso The zzso tumor displayed a disrupted vascular network with zzso zzso and signs of zzso cell zzso In zzso depletion experiments by specific zzso showed that rejection of zzso cells required zzso T zzso and zzso When injected in zzso mice, zzso cells formed tumors that zzso in only zzso of animals, indicating a role for zzso in zzso zzso response, but also the existence of zzso zzso Most zzso mice rejecting zzso cells developed protective immunity against zzso zzso and against the zzso related zzso colon zzso cells zzso as indicated by zzso zzso A specific zzso response against the zzso protein of an zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso cells was detected in mice rejecting zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso represents a suitable zzso in inducing specific zzso zzso
