zzso processes involve cell zzso The mechanical response of a tissue to active forces is linked to its effective zzso In order to zzso this mechanical response from the complex genetic changes occurring in a developing zzso we perform zzso experiments on zzso zzso which are good models for zzso We observe a cell softening behavior when submitting to zzso As our technique is very sensitive, we were able to get access to the measurement of a yield point above which a creep regime is observed obtained for strains above zzso To explain our zzso zzso we propose a model for the zzso that we represent as a dynamic network of parallel springs, which will break under stress and zzso at zzso zzso Such a simple model is able to reproduce most of the important behavior of cells under zzso We highlight here the importance of considering cells as complex zzso whose properties will vary with time according to the history of applied zzso
