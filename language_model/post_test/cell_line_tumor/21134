zzso is a zzso zzso protein and promotes cancer zzso We found that the zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso strongly zzso zzso cell death in zzso zzso zzso and zzso colon cancer cells and zzso melanoma cells, but not in zzso and zzso normal zzso zzso or zzso of zzso in zzso cells enhanced or decreased the zzso induced cell death, zzso zzso is known to form complex with zzso zzso zzso zzso which is critical for zzso transport and zzso pH zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso and zzso zzso on the cell surface, and zzso inhibited the association of these zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso release, and reduced zzso Further, the induction of zzso was parallel to the decrease of the zzso flux and zzso zzso zzso These effects were not found in the normal zzso As cancer cells depend on zzso for their energy production, zzso zzso might induce cell death specific to cancer zzso
