zzso signaling is increasingly recognized to contribute to invasion and zzso In this study, we discovered that zzso protein zzso interacts with the zzso domain zzso of zzso thus connecting zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso pull-down and zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso specifically and directly binds to zzso zzso but not the other zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso is zzso and uses zzso distinct from those bound by active zzso Interestingly, we found that zzso and zzso can form a complex with active zzso Using zzso zzso we determined that suppression of both zzso and zzso leads to loss of zzso membrane zzso in response to zzso growth factor, an increase in zzso zzso zzso fibers and blocks invasive growth in three-dimensional zzso zzso our data suggest that interaction of zzso and zzso permits zzso to complex with zzso and switch zzso function from stress fiber formation to membrane zzso to zzso an invasive zzso
