We recently reported that zzso suppresses zzso in colon cancer cells and zzso cellular inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso via a zzso element zzso suggesting a mechanism for zzso of colon cancer by zzso zzso zzso In this study, we used zzso human colon cancer cells to define the zzso by which increases in zzso induce zzso zzso Treatment with several different zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso and activated expression of zzso in a zzso zzso Studies with pharmacological zzso revealed that zzso zzso of zzso required zzso of zzso and zzso zzso but was largely independent of protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso reporter zzso using specific zzso as well as expression of zzso active forms of zzso and zzso showed that zzso induction by zzso is regulated predominantly through zzso and zzso zzso and suggested involvement of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso and stress response zzso as zzso zzso with those results, we found that zzso suppression of zzso was blocked by treatment with zzso of zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that zzso can induce zzso expression in colon cancer cells through zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a manner that involves zzso of zzso and zzso zzso These results emphasize that zzso of zzso other than protein zzso A can mediate the actions of agents that increase zzso particularly in the regulation of zzso zzso
