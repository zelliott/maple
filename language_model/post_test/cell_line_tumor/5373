The human zzso zzso complex is part of the zzso zzso II zzso apparatus and regulates multiple steps in gene zzso Further, the zzso zzso of zzso has a role in regulating the expression of a subset of genes involved in the zzso We therefore investigated the role of zzso during progression of the zzso 

zzso we report that the expression of zzso a zzso of the zzso complex, increases with zzso progression and is regulated in a zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically regulates a zzso of genes directly implicated in zzso progression during zzso zzso and zzso In zzso zzso zzso in zzso structures, whereas in zzso it is present within the pole forming a zzso structure, surrounding the zzso Moreover, zzso is zzso during the zzso to zzso zzso In the nucleus, zzso regulates the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, expression of zzso delays DNA replication but favors the zzso transition, in part through zzso assembly and zzso zzso zzso 

Our results identify zzso and the zzso complex as key regulators of zzso zzso zzso or loss of zzso of at least one of the members may potentially lead to cancer zzso
