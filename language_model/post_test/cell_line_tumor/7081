To explore the role of tissue zzso factor zzso zzso complex in human zzso cancer invasion and zzso 

zzso Constructed an expression zzso of zzso zzso and established a human zzso cell line zzso expressing high level zzso by using molecular cloning and gene zzso zzso zzso By zzso chamber zzso to count the numbers of zzso and zzso cells that penetrated the zzso to the back of zzso membrane after zzso zzso zzso zzso nude mice were used to establish experimental model of zzso with zzso or zzso and the lung tissue sections were examined by zzso for cancer zzso 

zzso Compared with their parental zzso cells, zzso cells expressed high level of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso on cell surface zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso After zzso the zzso cell number on the back of zzso membrane increased from zzso level zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which could decreased to zzso level when zzso with zzso zzso zzso Cancer zzso was found in zzso of nude mice transplanted with zzso cells, while in zzso of those transplanted with zzso zzso 

zzso could promote the invasion and zzso of human zzso cancer cells through zzso zzso
