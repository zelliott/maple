This study compared the zzso activity of various parts of zzso zzso zzso and further evaluated the protective effects of zzso against hydrogen zzso zzso zzso injury in human zzso zzso zzso Among four zzso parts, zzso zzso and leaf possessed the best scavenging activities for zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso These two zzso parts also had higher zzso and zzso zzso Following exposure of cells to zzso there was a marked decrease in cell survival, zzso zzso levels, and zzso zzso as well as an increase in zzso zzso zzso DNA fragmentation was also observed, but zzso of the cells with zzso zzso but not leaf prior to zzso exposure blocked these zzso cellular zzso The present findings indicate that zzso zzso exerts protective effects against zzso toxicity via its free radical scavenging activity, which might be due to its total zzso zzso
