We conducted a study on the functional characteristics of zzso in an zzso zzso tumor cell line, which may provide useful clues about zzso cell tumors zzso 

The functional study on zzso tumors with cell zzso zzso cell zzso characterized by zzso zzso was carried out in zzso and zzso an zzso and zzso zzso tumor cell line, zzso 

zzso cell line showed higher activity of zzso respiratory complexes I and II and decreased activity of complex zzso The increased activity of complex I was not matched by increased expression of complex I zzso The zzso cells relied mostly on zzso zzso for energy zzso although their zzso energetic function was less efficient when related to zzso content of the zzso Finally, the zzso cell line produced significantly higher amounts of zzso oxygen species zzso in comparison with zzso cell zzso 

The involvement of zzso in zzso zzso and proliferation as well as in zzso and zzso indicate that differences in activity of respiratory chain components and their zzso may be responsible for development of zzso and functional changes observed in zzso tumors with cell zzso
