We used a combination of spectral zzso array comparative zzso zzso and zzso zzso to gain insights into the structural and functional changes of the zzso in the zzso human breast cancer progression model cell zzso zzso zzso data showed several zzso aberrations and array comparative zzso zzso analysis identified numerous zzso gains and losses that might be involved in the progression toward zzso Analysis of the expression levels of genes located within these zzso regions revealed a lack of correlation between zzso gains and losses and corresponding zzso or zzso for the majority of the approximately 1,000 genes analyzed in this zzso We conclude that other mechanisms of gene regulation that are not directly related to zzso gains and losses play a major role in breast cancer zzso
