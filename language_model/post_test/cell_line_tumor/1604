Ewing's zzso family of tumors zzso refers to aggressive zzso which frequently harbor characteristic zzso or zzso zzso zzso Here, we report that these fusion products interact with the DNA damage response protein and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, primary tumor zzso and tumor zzso were all highly sensitive to zzso zzso zzso of a zzso inhibitor to the zzso zzso agent zzso resulted in complete responses of all treated tumors in an zzso mouse zzso model of zzso zzso investigations revealed that DNA damage induced by expression of zzso or zzso fusion genes was zzso by zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso zzso zzso fusion genes acted in a positive feedback loop to maintain the expression of zzso which was required for zzso transcription, thereby enforcing zzso sensitivity to zzso zzso Together, our findings offer a strong zzso rationale to target the zzso intersection as a therapeutic strategy to improve the treatment of zzso
