To explore the expression of zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso and analyze its relationship with the proliferation of zzso cancer zzso 

Human zzso zzso and zzso cancer cells zzso were cultured in zzso zzso genes and proteins were detected by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and flow zzso before and after the zzso of cell zzso by zzso Also the cell activity and cell cycle were zzso 

zzso gene amplification and zzso of zzso were found in zzso cancer cell while the expression of zzso was negative in normal zzso zzso Under zzso different expressions of zzso genes were found in zzso by zzso The higher the zzso of zzso the lower expressions of zzso zzso By flow zzso it was also found that there were lower expressions of zzso protein in zzso under zzso than without zzso With the rising zzso of zzso the low expressions of zzso protein in zzso were zzso The mean numbers were zzso zzso and zzso the cell zzso rates zzso zzso and zzso and the proliferation index zzso numbers zzso zzso zzso The differences were statistically significant zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso is detected in zzso cancer zzso A positive correlation is found between the lower expressions of zzso and the concentration of zzso There is a close relationship between the expressions of zzso and zzso cancer cell zzso
