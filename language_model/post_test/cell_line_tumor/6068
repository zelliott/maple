zzso Growth zzso zzso exerts cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso the intrinsic effects of zzso on cancer cells in pancreatic zzso zzso zzso is a prerequisite for rationalized clinical zzso of zzso targeting zzso Since the tumor zzso can affect how cancer cell respond to zzso we employed a novel three-dimensional zzso zzso system to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We show here that zzso stimulates growth of human and zzso pancreatic cancer cell lines zzso when embedded in a zzso collagen zzso zzso medium zzso over a solidified layer of soft zzso Moreover, in this novel zzso model, zzso treatment with zzso and zzso growth factor zzso enhanced zzso growth to a greater extent than either growth factor alone, and zzso increased zzso to zzso zzso These cooperative zzso effects were blocked by pharmacological zzso of zzso type I zzso with zzso or the zzso zzso with zzso zzso with zzso and zzso enhanced the efficacy of zzso and zzso in zzso and in primary cell cultures established from zzso of zzso mouse models of zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso of zzso and zzso signaling may represent an effective therapeutic strategy in zzso and that this zzso zzso system could be zzso to test ex zzso the therapeutic response of pancreatic tumor zzso from zzso patients, thereby providing a functional zzso to facilitate personalized targeted zzso
