Several substances widely dispersed in the environment including hormones, industrial zzso and pollutants exert hormone like activity affecting zzso zzso zzso These compounds, named zzso zzso are suspected to affect the zzso zzso zzso However it is still unclear whether these substances are able to elicit zzso like activity at the low zzso encountered in the zzso Here we compare the effects of the zzso zzso zzso with the effects zzso by zzso on gene zzso in the human breast cancer cell line zzso The correlation of the zzso induced gene expression zzso with a reference profile of zzso treated cells shows that zzso at a concentration of 100 zzso exerts a significant effect on zzso responsive gene zzso in zzso zzso Most of the genes regulated by zzso respond to the zzso in the same direction though to a much lesser zzso zzso modeling of the potential interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso shows that zzso is likely to bind to the zzso zzso zzso
