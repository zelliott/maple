Some zzso fatty acids zzso if not all, have been shown to have zzso action, but their exact zzso of action is not zzso In the present study, we observed that zzso zzso zzso acid zzso inhibited tumor cell growth at high zzso (above 300 zzso while low zzso zzso zzso promoted zzso Analysis of cell zzso membrane potential, zzso oxygen species zzso formation, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity suggested that zzso action of LA is due to enhanced zzso generation and decreased cell zzso capacity that resulted in zzso zzso Of the three cell lines tested, zzso zzso cancer cells zzso were most sensitive to the zzso action of zzso followed by zzso zzso cancer cell line zzso while the normal human zzso vein zzso cells zzso were the most resistant (the degree of sensitivity to LA is as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso LA induced cell death was primed by zzso zzso zzso zzso of cancer cells with 100 zzso LA for 24 zzso enhanced sensitivity of differentiated and zzso cells to the subsequent exposure to zzso The relative resistance of zzso cells to the zzso action of LA is due to a reduction in the zzso of zzso Thus, LA induced cancer cell zzso by enhancing cellular zzso status and inducing zzso zzso
