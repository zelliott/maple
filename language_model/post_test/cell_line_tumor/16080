The zzso position of a gene within its zzso territory zzso in the zzso nucleus is thought to depend on the zzso activity of the gene and on zzso activity, gene density, and zzso of the zzso zzso In this study we analyzed the position of the cell cycle regulator gene zzso within the CT of human zzso 6 zzso upon zzso zzso Whereas the majority of active zzso genes is located in the interior of the CT of zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso with increased variation of gene zzso within the CT and with a higher percentage of zzso genes located at the periphery of the zzso zzso it demonstrates once more that zzso can take place throughout zzso zzso of the zzso locus with two zzso regions on zzso showed that both zzso sequences are located more frequently in the interior of the CT than zzso genes although they are situated in zzso neighborhoods with widely differing gene density and regional zzso zzso Thus our data support models describing an influence of the zzso activity of a gene on the zzso within its zzso However, our data also indicate that additional factors such as zzso zzso are implicated in the positioning of genes within the respective zzso zzso
