zzso regulates zzso development at least partly through its zzso effect on zzso gene zzso Here, we characterize the gene for zzso zzso zzso as the second direct zzso target in zzso arguing for the existence of zzso functions in zzso that are independent of its zzso relationship to zzso zzso responsiveness was zzso by multiple binding sites within the zzso zzso promoter which display varying affinities and bind zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso appears mechanistically complex and requires both direct binding of zzso to the promoter and the zzso zzso zzso
