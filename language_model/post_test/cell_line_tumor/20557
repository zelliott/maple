zzso evidence supports the view that the detection of circulating tumor cells zzso predicts outcomes of zzso breast cancer zzso zzso differ genetically from the primary tumor and may contribute to variations in prognosis and response to zzso As we start to understand more about the biology of zzso we can begin to address how best to treat this form of zzso 

zzso zzso breast cancer patients were included in this zzso zzso were isolated by zzso techniques using magnetic beads zzso with a zzso zzso zzso and zzso detection through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso were evaluated by zzso experiments and zzso and zzso by zzso in zzso zzso We aimed to characterize this set of zzso in zzso and correlate it with zzso zzso 

zzso detection rate was zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were more frequent in zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso In patients younger than 50 years old, zzso and zzso tumors had a higher possibility of being zzso zzso zzso expression of hormonal receptors zzso in samples from the same patients was zzso zzso between zzso zzso zzso and zzso status in zzso and their primary tumor were found in the sequential blood zzso Less that zzso of patients switched their zzso status after receiving zzso zzso zzso were associated with zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso 

This is the largest exploratory zzso zzso analysis in zzso BC zzso Our study suggests that zzso zzso profiles might be useful as a surrogate marker for therapeutic selection and monitoring since zzso of the zzso distribution in zzso and the lack of correlation with the primary tumor zzso status were zzso Further exploration of the association between zzso zzso and zzso tumors is zzso
