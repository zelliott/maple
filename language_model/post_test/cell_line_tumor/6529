The zzso zzso expression system is frequently used for zzso zzso expression in zzso and in zzso Here, we describe a strong zzso effect of zzso zzso in the human colon zzso cell line zzso which is in contrast to published data that zzso do not influence zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso A occurs at the level of zzso zzso and is neutralized by zzso protein zzso C and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso Northern and Western zzso analysis revealed that incubation of zzso cells with zzso A leads to changes in gene expression levels, including an zzso of zzso zzso and protein zzso Our data imply that zzso and zzso mimics can induce and/or repress gene zzso in zzso and other zzso cells, thereby influencing the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso expression system may not be suitable for the analysis of zzso zzso
