The aim of this work was to compare the effect of gamma radiation with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso low zzso zzso zzso zzso and high zzso zzso zzso zzso on human zzso cell lines with differing zzso status zzso zzso deficient and zzso zzso zzso and to zzso the importance of zzso phase cell cycle arrest during zzso zzso of zzso and zzso cells was determined by test of zzso zzso of zzso had no effect on zzso of zzso cells zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and for zzso zzso zzso In contrast, a significant increase of zzso after zzso zzso was observed for zzso negative zzso cells zzso for zzso zzso zzso and for zzso zzso zzso After an additional decrease of zzso zzso zzso value zzso zzso was not significantly different from zzso zzso Considering the fact that during zzso the cells are zzso in all zzso of the cell cycle and during zzso mainly in the zzso phase, we have been unable to prove that the zzso phase is the most zzso phase of the cell cycle of zzso zzso On the contrary, zzso of cells in this phase induced damage zzso and increased zzso When the zzso was zzso approximately to zzso zzso an opposite effect was zzso zzso zzso value decreased to zzso zzso We have proved that during zzso at first zzso up to zzso zzso the cells accumulated in zzso phase, but then they entered zzso or, if the cell damage was not sufficiently zzso the cells entered zzso The entry into zzso has a zzso zzso
