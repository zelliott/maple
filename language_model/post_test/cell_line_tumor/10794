To build a zzso B virus zzso human zzso cell model in zzso and determine the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso from zzso zzso patients containing zzso DNA zzso was drawn, subsequently zzso into human zzso cells in zzso zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso zzso viral load of zzso cells were tested by real-time zzso and zzso DNA was determined by Southern zzso 

From zzso of the 1st passage zzso cells, the zzso viral load of the 1st passage was seen increasing over time, which peaked at 120 zzso whereas the zzso viral load was seen decreasing gradually in subsequent passages, and tested negative after the 6th zzso In addition, infected cells of zzso DNA were tested by Southern zzso and showed continual expression in the subsequent cell passages zzso while passage 6 was zzso zzso was tested as positive from different passages zzso and its concentration was also seen decreasing with each subsequent passage cultured until the 6th passage when it tested zzso 

zzso could zzso human zzso cells zzso in zzso and it showed continual expression in subsequent cell passages zzso
