zzso deprivation constitutes the principal therapy for advanced and zzso prostate zzso However, this therapeutic intervention usually results in the transition to a more aggressive zzso prostate zzso The zzso of molecular zzso during the progression to zzso independence is an integral step toward discovering more effective targeted zzso With respect to identifying crucial zzso of this transition, we compared the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and/or normal prostate zzso zzso cell lines using mass zzso We identified more than 100 proteins that were zzso zzso in the zzso cell zzso Of these, zzso S zzso was elevated in the zzso of all of the zzso prostate cancer cell lines, with no zzso zzso in normal and zzso cell zzso Using quantitative zzso we observed significantly higher zzso zzso zzso tissue expression levels of zzso in prostate cancer samples, further indicating its importance in prostate cancer zzso Similarly, zzso analysis revealed zzso of zzso in high grade prostate cancer zzso grade zzso zzso and further zzso in zzso zzso prostate cancer zzso We also observed its significant zzso zzso zzso zzso in high grade prostate cancer seminal plasma zzso Taken together, these results show that zzso is elevated in high grade and zzso prostate cancer and could serve as a potential zzso of aggressive zzso
