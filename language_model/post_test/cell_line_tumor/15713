In this study, we aimed to evaluate the relationship between zzso and zzso gene expression patterns induced by zzso zzso in zzso and zzso breast zzso cell zzso The effects of zzso zzso on zzso and zzso zzso expression were studied using the real-time zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso levels were observed in zzso cells, upon treatment with zzso and tumor necrosis zzso whereas zzso cells did not significantly respond to the zzso The results also show that in comparison to zzso cell line the zzso zzso expression level of zzso was higher in the zzso cell zzso In conclusion, zzso and tumor necrosis zzso induced zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso breast cancer cell line; no significant changes on expression of the same genes in zzso cells were zzso This differential effect of the zzso on two different cell lines seems to be influenced by zzso levels of the zzso which are very high in zzso zzso Similar patterns of induction in zzso and zzso genes suggest a probable relationship between these two zzso
