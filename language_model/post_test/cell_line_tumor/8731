The development and growth of prostate cancer is dependent on zzso thus, the identification of zzso genes in prostate cancer cells is vital for defining the mechanisms of prostate cancer development and progression and developing new markers and targets for prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that has been recently identified as a novel zzso gene in prostate cancer zzso Although the importance of this protein in prostate cancer progression has been extensively zzso little is known about the mechanism of its zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso expression is zzso by zzso in zzso zzso zzso expressing cells and that the stimulation occurs at the zzso and protein zzso We have identified an zzso response element within the first zzso of the zzso gene and demonstrated that zzso binds to this element in zzso and in zzso Together, these studies identify zzso as a direct zzso target of the zzso As this is an zzso zzso regulatory element, this highlights zzso regulation as an important feature of zzso zzso
