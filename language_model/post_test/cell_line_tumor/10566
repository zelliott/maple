A prominent feature of most zzso including Barrett's zzso zzso is genetic instability, which is associated with development and progression of zzso In this study, we investigated the role of zzso zzso a key component of zzso zzso zzso in evolving zzso changes and growth of zzso zzso We show that the expression of zzso is elevated in zzso cell lines and tissue zzso relative to normal zzso zzso activity is also elevated and significantly zzso with zzso expression in zzso zzso The suppression of zzso zzso by short hairpin zzso zzso specifically targeting this zzso significantly prevented zzso cells from acquiring zzso changes to either copy number or zzso ( zzso in several independent experiments employing zzso zzso zzso The reduction in zzso changes, following zzso treatment, was confirmed by Comparative Genome zzso analyses of the same DNA zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso of zzso correlated strongly with zzso and locations of zzso zzso repetitive elements on individual zzso We conclude that the zzso protein level is systematically elevated in zzso contributes significantly to zzso evolution during serial propagation of these cells and zzso with disease zzso zzso sequences may serve as zzso for elevated zzso during cell proliferation in zzso as they have been reported to do during the evolution of species, and thus may provide additional targets for prevention or treatment of this zzso
