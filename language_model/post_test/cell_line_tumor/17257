Resistance to zzso zzso frequently appears during treatment of zzso zzso This study investigates the zzso zzso observed in human myeloma cell zzso resistant to zzso Using the zzso cell line, the zzso efficiencies of four zzso and the zzso of isolated resistant zzso were zzso zzso and zzso exhibited the higher toxic effects on zzso zzso All zzso were able to induce zzso zzso zzso showed an increased expression of the zzso of the zzso receptors zzso and specific zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus, zzso resistance in zzso cells is accompanied by significant zzso zzso that could be implicated in survival enhancement to therapy and/or tumor zzso
