zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are widely used for the treatment of zzso however, chronic use results in the development of tolerance and zzso It has been demonstrated that zzso of a zzso zzso with a delta zzso zzso zzso zzso maintains the analgesia associated with zzso zzso but with reduced negative zzso Using our newly refined zzso zzso models for zzso zzso design, we have zzso several zzso with tailored affinity and efficacy zzso In particular, we have obtained zzso 8, zzso and 12, zzso which demonstrates high affinity and full zzso behavior at zzso high affinity but very low efficacy for zzso and minimal affinity for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso properties of these peptides as zzso zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso activity make them promising candidates for future in zzso studies of zzso zzso zzso structural variation of 12, by substituting zzso for zzso generated analog 13, which maintains low zzso zzso and zzso zzso but which displays no efficacy at either zzso These results demonstrate the power and utility of accurate zzso models for zzso zzso design, as well as the profound sensitivity of zzso function on its zzso
