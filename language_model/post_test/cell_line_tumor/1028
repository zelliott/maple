zzso is beneficial to patients with Alzheimer's disease zzso but has a limited clinical use due to its zzso and zzso effects on zzso cells responsive to zzso In an attempt to find an zzso substitute that retains the beneficial effects of zzso with minimal side effects, we compared the zzso and zzso effects of zzso a selective zzso zzso zzso zzso with those of zzso zzso and zzso showed comparable levels of protection against zzso deaths of cultured zzso human zzso cells, which were blocked by an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso but not zzso induced proliferation of zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso is a potential alternative to zzso in the treatment of Alzheimer's zzso
