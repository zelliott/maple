An increasing number of studies suggest that disturbances in cholesterol zzso may promote the formation and deposition of zzso (A zzso and the progression of Alzheimer's disease zzso In this paper, we have analyzed the effect of the zzso compound zzso on zzso and zzso activity in human zzso zzso zzso Exposure of zzso cells to A zzso alone resulted in a significantly increased zzso activity approximately by zzso zzso zzso and decreased zzso activity by zzso zzso zzso compared to the controls zzso zzso alone decreased zzso activity by zzso zzso zzso compared to the controls and by 50% to cells exposed to A beta alone ( zzso zzso exposed to zzso alone had a higher zzso activity compared to cells exposed to A beta zzso zzso but a slightly lower activity compared to the controls zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso prior to incubation with A zzso resulted in decreased zzso activity by approximately zzso compared to the controls and by approximately zzso zzso zzso compared to cells treated with A zzso zzso Also, zzso activity was increased by approximately 50% compared to the controls and by zzso zzso zzso compared to cells treated with A zzso zzso zzso zzso the effect of zzso in zzso To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that the zzso compound zzso decreases zzso activity and increases zzso activity in human zzso zzso cells exposed to A beta in zzso These effects are essential for zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso in zzso
