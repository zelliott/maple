The zzso family of protein zzso zzso plays an important role in T cell zzso zzso the zzso member of this zzso family, can interact with zzso which is a zzso zzso However, the regulation of zzso upon zzso stimulation remains poorly zzso Here we show that zzso interactions are likely involved in the zzso of zzso at the contact zone between T cells and zzso Upon zzso zzso with specific zzso or natural zzso zzso zzso to the plasma membrane where it zzso with the zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain of zzso and the two zzso motifs of zzso are involved in this zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso signaling requires the zzso domain of zzso as well as zzso zzso present in the zzso tail of zzso These results should provide new insights into the complex regulation of zzso zzso in T zzso
