A zzso zzso zzso is a key factor involved in the tumor development and progression in some tumor zzso and zzso Its zzso and as gene target in zzso colon zzso cells was confirmed in our previous zzso To seek a more potent way to treat colon zzso using a gene therapy method, zzso we constructed a multiple short hairpin zzso zzso expression zzso containing four zzso against the zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso expression levels and cell biological behavior were detected after zzso with different kinds of zzso As expected, we found that our multiple zzso zzso produced a more significant zzso effect of zzso than the zzso containing only one zzso zzso Furthermore, our findings indicate that zzso zzso expression in zzso cells decreased their zzso by reducing zzso invasion and zzso as well as inducing zzso Based on our findings, zzso containing multiple zzso to silence the expression of zzso may be exploited as a novel therapeutic strategy for zzso
