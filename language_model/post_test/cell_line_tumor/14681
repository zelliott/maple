zzso de zzso and acquired resistance to zzso drugs that target signaling networks is a formidable challenge for drug design and effective cancer zzso zzso the mechanisms by which this resistance arises may offer a route to addressing the zzso of signaling networks to drug intervention and restore the efficacy of zzso zzso zzso our recent work identifying zzso as a key regulator of zzso sensitivity, we present an integrated theoretical and experimental approach to study the zzso mechanisms within the zzso signaling network that afford resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso In a zzso model representing the dynamics of the signaling network, we define a single control zzso that encapsulates the balance of activities of the zzso involved in the zzso zzso By varying this control zzso we are able to demonstrate both distinct dynamic regimes of behavior of the signaling network and the transitions between those zzso We demonstrate resistance, sensitivity, and suppression of zzso signals by the signaling zzso Through model analysis we link the zzso transition to specific zzso mechanisms within the signaling zzso We study this transition in detail theoretically by variation of activities of zzso zzso zzso zzso and use the results to inform experiments that zzso the signaling network using zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in human zzso zzso cell zzso We find good alignment between theoretical predictions and experimental zzso We discuss the application of the results to the challenges of hypersensitivity of the signaling network to zzso signals, suppression of drug resistance, and efficacy of drug combinations in zzso zzso
