zzso resistance to tamoxifen zzso is a serious therapeutic problem among breast cancer zzso Previously, we have reported that zzso zzso cells zzso zzso showed increased zzso intensity through zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso Among six zzso tested in the current study, zzso gene zzso in zzso cells with stable zzso zzso was inhibited most effectively by zzso zzso gene zzso using minimal reporters containing zzso response elements and zzso zzso zzso elements revealed that the activities of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso key zzso factors for zzso gene transcription, were suppressed by zzso Western zzso analyses confirmed that the increased nuclear levels of zzso and zzso in zzso cells were blocked by zzso Moreover, zzso inhibited the enhanced zzso zzso and zzso expression in zzso cells, which was dependent on its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Chick zzso membrane zzso demonstrated that the enhanced zzso intensity of zzso cells was also suppressed significantly by zzso These results demonstrate that zzso may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of zzso breast cancer via zzso zzso
