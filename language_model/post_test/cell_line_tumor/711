zzso cancer is an aggressive zzso that is generally zzso to chemotherapy, thus posing experimental and clinical zzso In this study, the zzso effect of the zzso compound zzso B was tested in zzso and in zzso against human pancreatic cancer zzso zzso studies showed that the drug inhibited 50% growth of seven pancreatic cancer cell lines at zzso zzso whereas zzso growth was significantly inhibited at 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso B caused zzso and zzso zzso arrest and zzso of pancreatic cancer zzso This was associated with zzso of activated zzso zzso and zzso increased level of zzso even in cells with zzso zzso and decrease of expression of zzso A, zzso zzso and zzso with subsequent zzso of the zzso zzso Interestingly, the combination of zzso B and zzso zzso zzso the zzso effects of zzso on pancreatic cancer zzso Moreover, zzso B decreased the volume of pancreatic tumor zzso in zzso nude mice by zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with controls without noticeable drug zzso In zzso zzso of zzso was inhibited and expression of zzso was zzso whereas zzso and zzso were zzso in tumors of zzso zzso In conclusion, we showed for the first time that zzso B has profound in zzso and in zzso zzso effects against human pancreatic cancer cells, and the compound may potentate the zzso effect of the zzso agent zzso Further clinical studies are necessary to confirm our findings in patients with pancreatic zzso
