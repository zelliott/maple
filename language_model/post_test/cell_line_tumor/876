High mobility zzso zzso enhances the DNA interactions and possesses a zzso zzso potential for several families of zzso zzso zzso In order to examine the effect of zzso on the cell cycle progression in zzso cells, the zzso expression zzso was zzso into synchronized zzso cells, and the effect of zzso zzso on the cell cycle was zzso The zzso protein level in the zzso cells increased zzso compared to the zzso zzso There were few changes in the cell cycle phase distribution after zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Following the zzso treatment, the cell cycle progressed in both the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso However, a larger proportion of zzso zzso zzso cells progressed to the either S or zzso phase than the zzso zzso The zzso levels of the cell cycle regulators changed after being treated with zzso in both the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso cells, but the changes in the expression level of the cell cycle regulator genes were more prominent in the zzso zzso zzso cells than in the zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso itself does not alter the zzso cell cycle zzso but the addition of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso cells appears to accelerate the cell cycle zzso
