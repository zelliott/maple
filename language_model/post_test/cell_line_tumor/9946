Resistance to zzso zzso remains a major obstacle for the successful treatment of zzso zzso This study was to determine the reversal effect of zzso zzso zzso on zzso of zzso zzso cell line zzso and to explore its correlation with zzso zzso 

zzso cells were divided into the zzso group, the zzso group, the combination zzso plus zzso group, and the control zzso Cell proliferation was determined by zzso zzso Cell zzso was analyzed by flow zzso zzso zzso zzso level was detected by zzso coupled plasma atomic zzso zzso zzso The expressions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso 

zzso reversed zzso of zzso cells by zzso zzso The cell zzso rate and the zzso zzso level were significantly higher in the combination group than in the zzso group ( zzso Moreover, the zzso levels of zzso and zzso were significantly lower in the combination group than in the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso can reverse the zzso resistance of zzso zzso zzso cells, and the effect may be ascribed to the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso
