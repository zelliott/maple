In the present study, increased levels of zzso zzso and protein expression in leukemia cell lines are reported, as compared with normal zzso zzso Furthermore, a higher expression of zzso zzso was detected in primary acute leukemia samples than in normal zzso cells zzso zzso was detected in the zzso and membrane fraction of cells and was zzso with zzso in protein extracts of zzso and zzso cell zzso These findings suggest a role for zzso as a scaffolding protein that may be associated with the abnormal zzso of leukemia zzso
