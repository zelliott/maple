The development of zzso cell zzso fusion vaccines is a promising approach in cancer zzso Using fusion vaccines allows a broad spectrum of known and unidentified zzso zzso to be presented in the context of zzso class I and class II zzso with potent zzso provided by the zzso Although zzso fusion cells are zzso zzso studies have shown that effective zzso requires a third zzso which can be provided by zzso zzso 12 zzso Unfortunately, systemic administration of zzso zzso severe toxicity in cancer patients, potentially zzso clinical use of this zzso to augment fusion vaccine zzso To overcome this zzso we developed a novel approach in which zzso fusion cells locally zzso zzso then evaluated the effectiveness of this approach in a zzso zzso melanoma zzso 

zzso cells were zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso These tumor cells were then zzso to DC to form zzso zzso These cells were used to treat established zzso pulmonary zzso zzso of these zzso was performed and compared between experimental groups using zzso rank sum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso spot zzso was performed on zzso from treated zzso 

We show that vaccination with zzso fused to zzso melanoma cells that zzso express zzso zzso significantly reduces counts of established lung zzso in treated animals when compared with zzso alone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso spot zzso suggest that this zzso response is zzso by zzso T cells, in the absence of a zzso zzso T cell response, and that the zzso induction of zzso zzso and zzso T cell responses required zzso zzso 

This study is, to the best of our knowledge, the first report that investigates the impact of local zzso of zzso on zzso immunity induced by a zzso fusion cell vaccine in a melanoma model and may aid the rational design of future clinical zzso
