zzso previously named zzso is a novel candidate tumor zzso zzso zzso was cloned from zzso zzso cell cancer zzso and has been found to be zzso in zzso however, the regulatory details have not been fully zzso 

Here, we sought to investigate the zzso status of the zzso islands of zzso and zzso levels by zzso zzso zzso based on sequencing restriction zzso zzso reverse zzso and real-time quantitative zzso chain reaction zzso The function of specific sites in the zzso promoter of zzso in zzso was measured by transient zzso zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The results suggested zzso of 12 zzso sites of the promoter in both zzso cancer zzso and the zzso cancer line zzso zzso The zzso of the site zzso zzso to zzso which has been identified as the zzso binding site, was identified in zzso cancer zzso zzso compared to paired zzso zzso in addition, statistical analysis revealed that the zzso status of this site significantly correlated with cancer cell zzso zzso The zzso level of zzso increased in zzso cells treated with zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly reduced compared with the wild type zzso zzso while the zzso activity from wild zzso zzso zzso rose after zzso treatment in zzso zzso Finally, zzso and zzso confirmed that the zzso of the zzso zzso to zzso site prevented zzso from binding of the site and zzso treatment of the zzso zzso region of zzso by zzso induced the increased occupation of the core promoter by zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso this study concluded that zzso contributed to the zzso zzso of zzso and could inhibit cancer cell differentiation in zzso DNA zzso of the zzso site zzso to zzso of zzso altered the promoter activity by interfering with its binding to zzso in zzso zzso therapy of zzso zzso by zzso should be further evaluated in clinical trails of zzso
