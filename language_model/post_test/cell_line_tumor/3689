zzso are the major protein component of zzso and de zzso zzso synthesis is essential for packaging newly zzso DNA into zzso As a result, zzso gene expression is exquisitely and functionally coupled with DNA zzso zzso divergent organisms such as zzso fly and human all demonstrate the zzso zzso propensity to maintain zzso of zzso genes at one or more zzso zzso Although specific mechanisms are zzso zzso is presumed to be important for common stringent zzso control of these genes at the zzso phase zzso In this study, we describe a zzso zzso of the human zzso gene cluster located at zzso zzso which effectively doubles the previously known size and gene number of that zzso The zzso persists in all examined zzso and cell lines, and the duplicated genes are zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso for duplicated zzso zzso genes are high relative to those for zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso robust zzso zzso genes may have been zzso duplicated during zzso
