Cellular DNA damage triggers the DNA damage response zzso and leads to enforcement of cell cycle zzso which are essential for the maintenance of zzso integrity and are activated in early stages of zzso A special feature of prostate cancer is its high zzso and zzso To address the functionality of DNA damage checkpoints in the zzso we analyzed the responses of human primary prostate zzso cells zzso and freshly isolated human prostate zzso to zzso We find that zzso activates the zzso zzso zzso DNA damage response zzso in the zzso but that the clearance of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso were unable to enforce cell cycle checkpoint arrest and had sustained zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso activity because of a lack of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso We further show that zzso express low levels of zzso and that zzso zzso efficiently zzso the zzso We zzso the absence of checkpoint responses in zzso of ex zzso zzso human prostate tissue despite robust induction of zzso The findings show that prostate zzso has a surprising inability to control checkpoint arrest, the lack of which may zzso to zzso of DNA zzso
