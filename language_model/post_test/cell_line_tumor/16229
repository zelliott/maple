The importance of the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso in the development and progression of zzso cell lung zzso zzso is widely zzso Gene sequencing studies revealed that a majority of tumors responding to zzso zzso zzso harbor zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso This underscores the need for novel zzso and diagnostic imaging approaches to identify patients who may benefit from particular therapeutic agents and approaches with improved efficacy and safety zzso To this goal, we developed zzso zzso a zzso with increased selectivity and irreversible binding to the active zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that PET with zzso in zzso mice discriminates zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso expressing zzso or zzso zzso with zzso dual zzso in zzso zzso domain, which zzso resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso the zzso from irreversible binding to zzso These results suggest that PET with zzso could be used for the selection of zzso patients for individualized therapy with small molecular zzso of zzso zzso that are currently used in the clinic and have a similar structure zzso zzso zzso and zzso
