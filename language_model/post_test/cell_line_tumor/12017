zzso damage induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso has been proposed to have a zzso role in the selective zzso of zzso in zzso lateral sclerosis zzso In order to investigate the basis of the tissue specificity of zzso zzso we compared the effect of the continuous expression of zzso or zzso zzso human zzso on zzso zzso in the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso were observed in zzso expressing the zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso whereas a zzso greater level of total expression of the zzso had no effect on zzso of zzso cell zzso zzso network, swelling and zzso zzso but not zzso of zzso or other zzso zzso were observed only in zzso zzso The zzso zzso were not explained by a preferential zzso of the zzso within zzso zzso as a higher amount of the zzso zzso was found in zzso of zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso vulnerability of zzso to zzso is zzso in zzso cells, and that peculiar features in network dynamics may account for the selective zzso of zzso zzso
