In the course of our survey of natural compounds zzso zzso zzso release and/or zzso zzso zzso stimulation via zzso a central regulator of inflammatory zzso from natural resources, we found zzso B, a zzso from callus tissue culture of zzso zzso as a compound with such pharmacological activities, that is a zzso of zzso which zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities to reduce zzso release from zzso rat zzso cells, and zzso zzso activity to prevent zzso zzso gene zzso zzso B, to a lesser extent, reduced zzso increase in zzso zzso release than zzso and its structurally related compound, zzso in zzso zzso This compound also prevented zzso stimulation of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso B becomes a unique pharmacological tool to investigate zzso signaling pathways involved in zzso
