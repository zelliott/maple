We analyzed the effects of zzso on zzso membrane zzso zzso generation of zzso oxygen species zzso and zzso in a human zzso cell line, zzso and a zzso zzso cell line, zzso The cell lines were cultured in the presence or absence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso for up to 1 zzso zzso treatment increased zzso zzso generation, and zzso in zzso zzso zzso Treatment with zzso attenuated zzso generation and zzso but not zzso The increase in zzso seemed to be the primary effect of zzso on zzso zzso cells, which is probably zzso by zzso zzso In differentiated zzso cells, but not differentiated zzso cells, zzso treatment showed a delayed effect of interfering with the zzso and increasing zzso generation and zzso Since these changes disappeared in the presence of zzso zzso primarily induced zzso generation, resulting in zzso We speculate that this mechanism provides the basis of a zzso model of zzso zzso
