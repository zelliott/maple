Since zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso has been reported to have a zzso site at zzso and therefore its functions may be linked to zzso raft membrane zzso The present study tested a hypothesis that zzso zzso may serve as a signaling platform to mediate the zzso of zzso We found that destruction of zzso zzso with zzso zzso in zzso cells almost completely blocked the zzso of zzso as did an zzso zzso Although a proportion of zzso was zzso with zzso zzso either the replacement of zzso at zzso by Ala, zzso its possible zzso zzso site or the displacement of its zzso domain by the zzso sequence zzso of zzso making all zzso target to zzso zzso had no effect on zzso zzso The data suggest that the zzso of zzso is not associated with its zzso zzso zzso zzso to decreased zzso moreover, zzso significantly increased zzso expression on the cell surface, and these increased zzso molecules were capable of binding to zzso To further explore the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso of zzso we demonstrated that zzso led to a marked decrease in zzso of zzso cells to zzso cells, which was due to zzso of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso participate in the zzso of zzso through zzso zzso and zzso enhancement of the zzso zzso The data suggest that zzso zzso are essential for the killing of zzso through the zzso contact zzso by zzso However, zzso zzso may limit exposure of zzso to the cell zzso
