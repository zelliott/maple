We previously found that selective restriction of zzso acids zzso invasion of two zzso human prostate cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso Here we show that the restriction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso the activity of G proteins and affects the balance between two zzso zzso zzso and zzso in these two cell zzso Selective zzso acid restriction zzso reduces G protein binding to zzso in zzso zzso zzso deprivation reduces the amount of zzso and zzso Met deprivation reduces the amount of zzso and zzso and zzso deprivation decreases zzso zzso and zzso zzso of these zzso acids increases the amount of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso Increased zzso expression and zzso of zzso and zzso are consistent with the increased zzso of zzso In zzso cells, zzso or zzso deprivation reduces the amount of zzso and all of the examined zzso acid restrictions reduce the amount of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are not significantly zzso These data reveal that specific zzso acid deprivation zzso affects zzso dynamics in zzso and zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso likely alter the balance between zzso and zzso in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso is inhibited in zzso zzso These effects zzso zzso and zzso to inhibit zzso
