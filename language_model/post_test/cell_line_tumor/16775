zzso I (also known as zzso zzso is a zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso Although zzso I exhibits zzso and zzso activities, its molecular zzso in human lung cancer cells are poorly zzso zzso in the present study, we investigated the usefulness of zzso I as a potential zzso zzso agent using human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells as in zzso zzso The zzso induced by zzso I in zzso cells was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso double zzso cell cycle analysis and zzso zzso end zzso Further research revealed that zzso I accelerated zzso through the zzso zzso pathway, involving the zzso of zzso ratio, dissipation of zzso membrane potential, zzso of zzso zzso zzso 3 and zzso 9 zzso degradation of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso oxygen species zzso A zzso zzso zzso only partially prevented zzso induced by zzso I, while zzso a scavenger of zzso diminished its effect more zzso In addition, the zzso effect of zzso I was dependent on the zzso of zzso downstream zzso zzso and zzso which could be almost zzso by using zzso zzso (an inhibitor of zzso and zzso (an inhibitor of zzso These findings suggested that zzso I might exert its zzso effect via the zzso zzso
