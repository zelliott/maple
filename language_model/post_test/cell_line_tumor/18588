In multiple myeloma zzso bone zzso zzso has an important role for the survival and growth of plasma zzso We previously showed that a high bone zzso induced by zzso increased zzso cells growth in the zzso zzso The present study characterized a new plasma cell line zzso which was isolated from zzso mice previously zzso zzso were zzso unchanged in normal zzso mice during six zzso zzso was compared to the original zzso zzso zzso was detected 6 weeks post injection in zzso mice and after 8 weeks in zzso zzso All zzso mice developed a zzso paralysis after 10 zzso zzso mice were zzso at 16 weeks, due to a more progressive development of the zzso In zzso mice, zzso zzso were observed after 8 weeks and severe bone destruction was evidenced at 10 zzso In zzso mice, minimal zzso were observed only after 10 zzso Like in zzso mice, no extra zzso zzso were observed in zzso zzso The zzso zzso model closely mimics human myeloma with higher and faster bone zzso This new aggressive cell line, with a preserved zzso was selected by an altered zzso due to an increased bone zzso
