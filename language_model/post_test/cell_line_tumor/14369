zzso type 2 zzso also known as zzso is a zzso protein involved in diverse cellular zzso It has two well characterized zzso activities: zzso signaling that requires zzso binding and zzso zzso or zzso that is inhibited by zzso In addition to the zzso binding zzso identified from the human zzso crystal structure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (2002) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 99, zzso we have previously implicated zzso in zzso zzso as binding is lost with zzso substitution zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Church, zzso zzso and Graham, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we have shown that zzso substitution of zzso zzso in rat zzso zzso in the core domain or zzso zzso or zzso in barrel 1) does not affect zzso activity but reduces or zzso zzso binding and zzso zzso of zzso activity in zzso indicating that these zzso are important in zzso zzso zzso substitution of zzso does not impair zzso zzso indicating this zzso does not interact directly with zzso zzso is particularly important for zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a zzso reduction in zzso binding affinity by the zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso or its zzso or zzso zzso which are sensitive to both zzso and zzso zzso zzso is inherently more resistant to zzso but not zzso zzso indicating reduced accessibility and/or flexibility of this zzso in the region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity of intact zzso stable zzso zzso cell zzso was slightly increased relative to zzso zzso and, in contrast to the zzso activity of the latter, was further zzso by zzso zzso calcium zzso Thus, loss of zzso binding zzso zzso to zzso calcium zzso These findings are consistent with the notion that zzso under zzso conditions, zzso is maintained largely as a zzso zzso its zzso zzso activity being suppressed zzso by zzso zzso zzso
