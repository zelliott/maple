zzso ( zzso and other zzso zzso are zzso to their corresponding fatty acids and zzso This zzso is mostly attributed to zzso by zzso zzso acid zzso zzso which exhibits an alkaline pH zzso In addition, we have identified another zzso which zzso the same reaction exclusively at zzso pH values zzso zzso and Yamamoto (2001) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In attempts to find selective zzso of this acid zzso we screened various derivatives of zzso acid, zzso and zzso with zzso as zzso Here we show that zzso zzso the acid zzso from rat lung with an zzso of zzso zzso without zzso zzso at zzso up to 100 zzso The zzso was zzso and zzso This compound also inhibited the acid zzso in intact zzso zzso With the aid of this zzso it was revealed that rat zzso zzso cells possess the acid zzso as well as zzso Thus the inhibitor may be a useful tool to distinguish the acid zzso from zzso in various zzso and cells and to zzso the zzso role of the zzso
