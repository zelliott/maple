The purpose of this study was to develop an efficient way to zzso zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso and evaluate its potential in breast cancer gamma zzso zzso zzso was zzso using a zzso zzso and its total synthesis yield was zzso It was successfully labeled with zzso with high zzso purity zzso Cellular zzso of zzso was much higher than that of zzso and the clinical gold standard zzso zzso in rat breast tumor cells in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in normal rats revealed that zzso could be safely administered to zzso zzso in breast zzso rats showed that although zzso appeared to be inferior to zzso in distinguishing breast tumor tissue from zzso inflammatory zzso it had high zzso zzso ratios and could detect breast tumors clearly by zzso zzso zzso zzso could thus be a useful zzso for use in breast tumor diagnostic zzso
