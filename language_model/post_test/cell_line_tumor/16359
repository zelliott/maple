Recently, a zzso zzso component of the zzso agent tamoxifen zzso has been identified that predominantly triggers zzso zzso The present study zzso the zzso fate of zzso and studies its interaction with a spectrum of cell zzso zzso primarily relevant to zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was assessed by zzso zzso zzso The effect of the zzso on zzso zzso was assessed by standard zzso zzso Our findings show that in zzso zzso positive zzso breast zzso cells and zzso human prostate cancer cells, zzso largely accumulates in the zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso Our results further demonstrate that in zzso but not in zzso cells, zzso electron transport chain complex I and III zzso exacerbate zzso toxicity with an order of potency of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A, suggesting a zzso zzso interplay between zzso complex I and III function and zzso zzso
