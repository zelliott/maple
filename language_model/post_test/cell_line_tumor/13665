In the present study we demonstrate the in zzso and in zzso comparison of the zzso and zzso labeled zzso zzso is a zzso zzso with a half life of zzso zzso Hence it could be used for PET imaging with zzso requiring longer observation time than in the case of zzso 

The binding affinity of zzso and zzso to zzso receptors was studied in competition to zzso in the human prostate cancer cell line zzso A preliminary zzso in normal rats was performed, while first zzso images were assessed in male Copenhagen rats bearing the zzso zzso zzso prostate cancer zzso 

The affinity to zzso receptors in the zzso cell line was higher for zzso zzso zzso zzso than that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso rate of zzso labeled zzso was slower than that of zzso but their final zzso zzso were zzso zzso was zzso faster than zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso in normal rats revealed a higher zzso in target zzso and zzso of the first one while both zzso mainly through urinary zzso In zzso images both zzso were accumulated in the tumor with similar zzso zzso 

Despite the differences in the zzso affinity both the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso showed comparable distribution and similar time zzso of zzso and zzso zzso no differences in tumor zzso zzso in the overall zzso nor in the zzso were observed from the zzso zzso From that perspective the use of either zzso or zzso for detecting tumors with zzso receptors is zzso
