The zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso reorganization to form cell surface extensions zzso required for cell zzso during cancer zzso zzso zzso and zzso are associated with aggressive zzso thus, interference of the interaction of zzso with its direct upstream zzso zzso zzso exchange factors zzso is a viable strategy for zzso zzso zzso We zzso zzso a novel inhibitor of zzso activity, based on the structure of the established zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso activity in the zzso zzso cancer cells that zzso zzso and exhibits high zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso for zzso zzso by zzso is zzso lower than for zzso zzso is specific for zzso and zzso at zzso of zzso zzso At higher zzso zzso zzso the close zzso zzso In zzso cells that demonstrate high active levels of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the association of zzso with a zzso zzso which has a high affinity for activated zzso zzso also zzso the zzso activity of zzso zzso breast cancer cells and reduces zzso zzso formation in both cell zzso zzso decreases zzso downstream effects of zzso zzso zzso 1) activity and directed migration of zzso cancer zzso Moreover, at effective zzso zzso zzso zzso does not affect the viability of transformed zzso zzso cells zzso and reduces viability of zzso cells by only zzso zzso zzso holds promise as a targeted therapeutic agent for the treatment of zzso zzso with high zzso zzso
