zzso zzso zzso is closely associated with zzso virus zzso infection and exposure to environmental zzso In this study, an zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso cell line, zzso was used to investigate the impact of zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment and zzso zzso on zzso abnormalities utilizing zzso comparative zzso zzso zzso It was observed that most zzso aberrations zzso were progressively zzso clustered on zzso 3, 8, and 9, as the frequency of zzso treatment and zzso zzso zzso All of the prominent zzso detected (including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were located on zzso 3, with multiple zzso assigned to these zzso The amplification patterns of zzso and zzso were validated using zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction detected increasing expression of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells harboring higher frequency of zzso treatment and zzso zzso consistent with zzso amplification of these zzso These findings demonstrate that a high zzso of zzso zzso zzso has a profound influence on the zzso of zzso through altered DNA copy zzso
