zzso of zzso has been implicated in human zzso but the underlying mechanisms remain poorly zzso Here we report the presence of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso promoter in zzso of the central nervous system zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and skin zzso zzso In zzso zzso the presence of zzso promoter zzso (when occurring together with zzso zzso is significantly associated with higher zzso zzso zzso and in zzso we find a trend for increased zzso expression in cases zzso zzso promoter zzso Both in zzso zzso and glioblastoma, zzso promoter zzso are significantly associated with older age of the zzso Our results show that zzso promoter zzso are relatively frequent in specific types of human zzso where they lead to enhanced expression of zzso
