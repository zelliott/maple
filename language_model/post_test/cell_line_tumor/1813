It is now well accepted that zzso exhibits zzso and zzso activity in many human tumors through zzso stabilization and induction of zzso cell cycle arrest with final extensive cell zzso Since many zzso agents exert their zzso effects through zzso oxygen species zzso we were interested to evaluate whether zzso stress is involved in zzso zzso among human leukemia zzso zzso Our results showed that induction of zzso was associated with generation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The increase in zzso production and zzso were both suppressed by zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso caused an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities, two of the well known zzso of the stress zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression in the presence of zzso might indicate the zzso of the level of zzso activity by zzso Furthermore, our data indicated that zzso was zzso in zzso cells and its expression was modulated by zzso and zzso zzso The activities of zzso and zzso were also increased upon treatment with zzso however, zzso of cells with zzso or zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells, suggesting that zzso acts upstream of the zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso zzso zzso in chronic zzso leukemia cells by inducing zzso zzso stress and zzso zzso zzso
