zzso is a zzso factor with divergent functions in different zzso We analyzed zzso expression and DNA zzso and their clinical relevance and biological function in zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso were done to detect the expression and promoter zzso of zzso in zzso cancer zzso The association of the recurrence-free survival rate and decreased zzso or zzso zzso status was analyzed by the zzso method, Cox zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso based zzso over expression and zzso zzso zzso were used to detect zzso functions in zzso cancer in zzso and in zzso 

zzso was zzso in zzso cancer due to promoter zzso Each correlated with recurrence-free survival in patients with zzso invasive zzso cancer after zzso zzso of zzso cancer, which zzso them as valuable zzso zzso for early zzso Moreover, in and ex zzso experiments showed that zzso suppressed zzso cancer cell growth, migration and invasion inhibited the zzso zzso 

zzso may function as a tumor zzso gene in zzso cancer since zzso of zzso by promoter zzso would promote cancer zzso In addition, decreased expression of zzso or its promoter zzso may have zzso value for early recurrence in patients with zzso invasive zzso zzso
