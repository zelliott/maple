zzso zzso zzso is capable of infecting a range of human zzso cell types with high efficiency and the viral zzso persists as high copy number, zzso zzso zzso which segregate to progeny upon cell zzso This allows zzso zzso to zzso zzso a dividing cell population and provide sustained zzso expression for an extended period of time both in zzso and in zzso Moreover, the zzso of a bacterial artificial zzso cassette into the zzso zzso zzso the incorporation of large amounts of zzso DNA for gene zzso zzso we have produced a zzso zzso zzso containing full-length human TRAIL under the control of the zzso promoter, and subsequently challenged a variety of cancer cell lines with this zzso The TRAIL zzso was expressed in infected zzso zzso cells, causing considerable zzso zzso zzso was also observed when several other cancer cell lines derived from different zzso were zzso Moreover, zzso with zzso inhibitor zzso led to the disruption of zzso cultures grown from the melanoma zzso zzso These data suggest that an zzso gene therapy zzso expressing TRAIL could be an effective treatment against zzso
