The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed by bone zzso zzso zzso cells and plays key roles in cell zzso to and retention into the bone zzso In multiple zzso zzso zzso plasma cells home to the zzso and accumulate in contact with zzso cells, implicating myeloma cell migration across zzso zzso cells express the zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso which mediates their attachment to zzso zzso We show here that zzso promotes zzso migration of zzso zzso myeloma cells and zzso zzso cells, involving a transient zzso of zzso cell zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso signaling pathways involved in the zzso by zzso of zzso myeloma cell zzso revealed that zzso zzso amounts associated with the zzso of protein zzso A play key roles in this zzso Furthermore, a functional link between zzso actions on the dynamics of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso in response to zzso has been zzso The regulation of zzso myeloma cell zzso by zzso could play key roles during myeloma cell zzso into and trafficking inside the zzso and characterization of the molecular events involved in zzso zzso of this zzso will contribute to a better understanding of mechanisms participating in cell zzso
