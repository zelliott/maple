We have investigated gene expression patterns underlying zzso and irreversible zzso growth zzso zzso to identify more sensitive markers of cell transformation for studies directed at interrogating zzso zzso In zzso mouse zzso cells, basic zzso growth factor zzso zzso an unusually efficient and zzso zzso response, relative to zzso zzso zzso zzso which is zzso The zzso and irreversible zzso zzso are characterized by largely zzso global gene expression zzso However, a subset of zzso expressed genes were identified as common to zzso and irreversible zzso zzso including genes regulated in a zzso zzso zzso leukemia factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso were increased in both zzso and zzso soft zzso colonies and selected for functional zzso zzso expression of human zzso and zzso in zzso cells resulted in a marked increase in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression were increased in soft zzso colonies arising from zzso cells exposed to gamma radiation and in a human zzso cell zzso tumor zzso relative to paired zzso zzso zzso biological network analysis suggests that many of the zzso expressed genes that are common to zzso and zzso zzso are regulated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso we have identified a potential molecular switch that mediates the transition from zzso to irreversible zzso
