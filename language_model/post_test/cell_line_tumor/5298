zzso zzso couple the zzso of zzso to the zzso of zzso Apart from the zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso there are important zzso mechanisms involving both zzso and zzso zzso zzso How zzso that is trapped within the zzso zzso regulates the zzso calcium increases that drive zzso remains a zzso Here we have investigated whether the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is the zzso linking zzso of zzso made by zzso zzso zzso to an zzso zzso producing zzso zzso Although zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso message and protein were detected in zzso zzso cells, rat zzso and mouse zzso zzso zzso activity is half that of primary zzso and is localized exclusively to the zzso Novel zzso strategies in zzso zzso cells and zzso measured substantial contribution of zzso to the synthesis of zzso As high as zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells and zzso of zzso in rat zzso came from zzso The contribution of zzso to overall zzso synthesis more than tripled with zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene completely inhibited zzso zzso its central role in zzso zzso insulin zzso Given that zzso zzso by zzso is an indicator of zzso flux that is crucial for zzso zzso is a strong candidate to link zzso synthesis with insulin release through zzso zzso zzso
