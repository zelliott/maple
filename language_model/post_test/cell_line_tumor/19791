zzso target zzso zzso the human zzso of a protein required for brain development in zzso is expressed primarily in neural cells but is also detected in zzso zzso Although zzso has been proposed to play a role in zzso outgrowth and process zzso during zzso the function of zzso has not been defined in neural zzso In this study we have investigated the possible role of zzso in zzso cells and zzso cells using an zzso zzso zzso of zzso in human zzso zzso cells and monkey kidney zzso cells led to an zzso of zzso on the zzso surface of the zzso zzso and zzso of cell zzso In particular, high levels of zzso arrested zzso cells at zzso stage yet was not associated with arrest at a particular phase of the cell cycle in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso did not induce zzso in two kinds of cell lines as assessed by flow zzso These results suggest that the role of zzso zzso in cell proliferation is associated with different mechanisms in different zzso
