In breast cancer cells, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso alpha zzso regulates zzso S phase zzso We identified a nuclear export sequence zzso in zzso and show that its export is dependent on both zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso region maintenance 1 zzso A zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction and prevents nuclear export of zzso and zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso do not exit the nucleus and inhibit zzso S phase zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso is associated with zzso proteins in the nucleus, and zzso stimulates nuclear exit of both zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso prevent zzso and zzso nuclear zzso A zzso of zzso in zzso zzso which cannot be zzso by zzso zzso does not associate with zzso and is trapped in the nucleus, blocking S phase zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso zzso of zzso drives its association with zzso thereby triggering complex export from the nucleus necessary for initiation of DNA synthesis and S phase zzso
