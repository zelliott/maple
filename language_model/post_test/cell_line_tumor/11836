Like many solid tumors, zzso are characterized by zzso zzso zzso that may contribute to a variable distribution of drugs and their associated zzso responses, such that the standard zzso approaches based on analysis of zzso zzso may be zzso To address this aspect of tumor zzso we analyzed zzso zzso characteristics of the zzso inhibitor zzso in mice with zzso tumors and developed corresponding mathematical zzso Following a single oral dose of zzso zzso or 150 zzso tumors were processed at selected times according to a novel brain tumor zzso protocol that generated serial samples to measure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in 4 different regions of zzso zzso we observed up to zzso variations in zzso zzso of zzso but only up to half this zzso in zzso zzso As we observed a similar degree of variation in the zzso index termed the zzso zzso index zzso a measure of zzso in the zzso barrier, we used zzso in a hybrid zzso zzso zzso model to account for regional changes in drug distribution that were zzso zzso the zzso models were linked to a zzso model that could account for the zzso observed in zzso zzso Together, our tumor zzso protocol enabled integration of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso followed by the construction of a zzso zzso zzso These types of models offer a zzso basis to understand tumor zzso as it impacts the activity of zzso zzso
