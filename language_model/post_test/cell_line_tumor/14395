We have previously generated zzso zzso zzso fused to zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso fusion proteins zzso or fused to zzso and zzso or zzso and zzso zzso fusion proteins zzso These zzso retained zzso and zzso zzso We have now further characterized the zzso and determined the zzso activity of the fused zzso their ability to trigger zzso zzso and natural killer zzso zzso and their direct zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso activity in the zzso containing zzso and zzso although this activity seems to be decreased in the zzso However, both zzso retained the capacity to stimulate zzso zzso zzso in the zzso cell line zzso and zzso zzso induced zzso activity in zzso The zzso effectiveness of zzso and zzso combinations was studied in mice challenged zzso with three different human zzso zzso zzso models zzso zzso and zzso Although a significant zzso in the profile of zzso response was observed in the different tumor models, the combination of zzso and zzso zzso protected zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso protected less than the combination of zzso and, in some models, even less than zzso zzso However, in all cases, most of long-term survivors showed protection after zzso zzso with the tumors and later with the parental tumors not expressing zzso These results show that, although the pattern of protection is tumor model dependent, treatments with zzso can effectively generate high levels of protection against zzso tumors expressing zzso which may be relevant in patients with primary or zzso zzso zzso that may be observed in zzso zzso stomach, zzso zzso and breast zzso
