zzso zzso 3 zzso a member of the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso is known to be involved in cell survival and zzso zzso zzso In this study, we show that zzso plasma cells and T zzso from multiple myeloma zzso bone disease patients, as well as zzso zzso a human myeloma cell line, directly produce zzso By interacting with zzso this zzso could inhibit OC zzso In fact, the use of a zzso zzso zzso zzso a reduction of cell viability with a zzso increase of zzso cell number, the zzso of zzso and zzso and DNA zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso supports OC formation in samples from zzso patients through the zzso of zzso and zzso by T zzso and only zzso by zzso zzso In conclusion, our data provide the first evidence of the expression of zzso in zzso and the involvement of this zzso in supporting the survival and formation of zzso from zzso bone disease zzso The production of zzso by T zzso zzso these cells a role in the zzso of bone disease associated with zzso
