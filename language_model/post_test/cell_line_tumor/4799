Mouse cells are zzso to human zzso virus type 1 zzso in that there is a pronounced zzso block to viral zzso We have recently demonstrated that zzso zzso cell hybrids that contain human zzso 2 increase both zzso zzso zzso production and infectious virus zzso Here we report on the isolation of three zzso zzso hybrids zzso that behave similarly, starting from a pool of 500 zzso zzso zzso of virus was specific to zzso and cell zzso that no longer contained any human zzso fragments did not release CA or infectious zzso Two of the three cell clones were identical as judged by zzso zzso content and zzso in zzso zzso zzso and contained a single zzso human zzso zzso The third cell clone only contained human zzso 12, as determined by zzso zzso and zzso zzso There were no consistent differences in zzso protein and zzso viral zzso levels between mouse cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had no effect on infectious zzso release from these mouse cells, despite allowing zzso targeting and increasing CA zzso These zzso zzso zzso and their corresponding zzso zzso may prove useful for zzso studies and also for identifying the responsible zzso or zzso involved in the production of zzso
