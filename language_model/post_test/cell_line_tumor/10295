zzso zzso 2 zzso couples zzso zzso of cell surface zzso receptors to the regulation of cellular functions including cell cycle zzso differentiation and zzso It thereby coordinates biological programs such as development and zzso zzso zzso of zzso by point zzso or zzso zzso can induce zzso and zzso zzso Typical signal zzso by the zzso zzso zzso comprises zzso of zzso zzso zzso In this study, we describe the identification of the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso as a novel zzso zzso zzso can directly bind and zzso zzso Both, the zzso zzso domain and its zzso domain bind to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 88 zzso of zzso We previously reported that zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso its zzso zzso zzso zzso we now find that active zzso zzso reduces zzso stability and protein levels in zzso cell lines harboring the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of zzso is impaired and zzso expression is restored upon zzso zzso by small hairpin zzso zzso or by the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that direct zzso of zzso can contribute to zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso thus unveiling a novel link between zzso signaling and cell cycle control in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could use this novel zzso to promote zzso in tumor zzso
