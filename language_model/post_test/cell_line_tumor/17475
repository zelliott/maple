The targeted zzso zzso analogue zzso consisting of zzso zzso linked to carrier zzso zzso is scheduled for clinical zzso To extend previous findings we tested zzso on human zzso sensitive zzso prostate zzso grown zzso and zzso independent zzso derived zzso prostate zzso zzso into the zzso of nude zzso 

Changes in serum prostate specific zzso zzso levels were monitored by zzso zzso receptors in tumor samples were zzso 

Three intravenous injections of zzso at 150 zzso doses inhibited the growth of subcutaneous zzso tumors by zzso vs controls zzso zzso and were more effective than zzso doses of the radical zzso zzso zzso zzso also decreased serum zzso levels by zzso vs controls zzso zzso In nude mice bearing zzso implanted zzso prostate zzso zzso decreased serum zzso levels by zzso compared with controls after 5 weeks of therapy zzso zzso while zzso was zzso All zzso treated mice were alive at the termination of the experiment, while only 50% of controls and zzso of animals treated with zzso survived zzso zzso zzso evaluation of zzso zzso tumors showed that zzso induced a significant increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso tumors showed high affinity binding for zzso and the expression of zzso for zzso zzso zzso 1, 2A and zzso 

The current study demonstrates the efficacy of the zzso analogue zzso for subcutaneous zzso as well as for zzso zzso prostate zzso zzso into nude zzso This targeted zzso analogue could represent a new therapy for patients with advanced zzso prostate zzso
