Previous research has suggested a putative utility of pancreatic zzso in cancer zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate the in zzso effects of a mixture of two pancreatic zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso on three human cancer cell lines, zzso zzso zzso from an zzso zzso zzso zzso from a pancreatic zzso and zzso zzso from a colon zzso 

After treatment of the three cancer cell lines with different doses of the zzso for up to 7 days, we observed zzso growth zzso in a zzso manner, zzso enhanced expression of zzso and zzso and decreased expression of several zzso transition zzso zzso such as zzso Snail and zzso zzso differentiation of zzso cells, including the appearance of zzso differentiated structures such as zzso and tight zzso the acquisition of a more regular zzso zzso and an increased expression of the zzso differentiation markers alkaline zzso and zzso 8, and zzso differentiation of zzso cells, including the formation of cell zzso an zzso on zzso bodies and an increased expression of the pancreatic differentiation markers zzso and zzso 

Our results show that the treatment of three different human cancer cell lines with pancreatic zzso results in an enhancement of cell zzso an zzso of several zzso zzso and an increase in the expression of several zzso zzso suggesting the acquisition of a less zzso zzso and a decrease in zzso capacity due to zzso cellular zzso
