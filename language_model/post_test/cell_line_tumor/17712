The zzso zzso family of proteins and its zzso zzso have recently been implicated in human skeletal zzso zzso zzso zzso cell fate and cell proliferation during embryonic development and zzso through zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso tumor of zzso origin whose growth control has been linked to zzso or zzso stimulation by several growth factor zzso We examined 4 zzso cell lines for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso In addition, zzso for zzso expression was performed in 44 zzso patient samples and the findings were correlated with clinical zzso zzso profiling of zzso and their receptors revealed the presence of several zzso in zzso cell zzso Overall, zzso zzso of zzso patient samples showed evidence of zzso zzso zzso of zzso correlated significantly with tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, patients whose tumors were positive for zzso showed a trend toward decreased zzso survival zzso zzso zzso No significant association was found between zzso expression and age, zzso site of disease, site of zzso or degree of zzso tumor zzso zzso of zzso 3 of zzso in 10 zzso zzso cell cultures showed no zzso zzso of zzso These results showed that expression of zzso is a common event in zzso and strongly suggest a role for zzso and zzso signaling in the zzso and progression of this zzso
