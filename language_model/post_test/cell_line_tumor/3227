zzso zzso cancer zzso is the zzso disease with the highest death zzso We applied an automatic class discovery procedure based on gene expression profiling to stages zzso tumors to search for molecular signatures associated with the biological properties and progression of zzso Using a complementary DNA zzso containing zzso zzso zzso features, we identified a subset of zzso characterized by the expression of numerous genes related to the zzso zzso zzso and its zzso along with elements of the zzso growth factor 2 zzso signaling zzso A total of 10 genes were validated by quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction, and zzso of zzso and zzso growth factor zzso 4 in tumor cells was revealed by zzso confirming the reliability of gene expression by zzso zzso Since the functional relationships among these genes clearly suggested involvement of the identified molecular signature in processes related to zzso interactions and/or zzso cellular zzso we applied supervised learning analysis on zzso cell lines showing distinct cellular zzso in zzso This procedure enabled construction of a gene zzso able to discriminate zzso from zzso zzso Genes zzso in zzso cells proved to match the zzso signaling and zzso molecular signature, as identified by zzso class discovery on advanced tumor zzso In zzso functional analysis of the cell plasticity zzso was carried out using two zzso and immortalized cell lines derived from zzso surface zzso and displaying zzso and zzso zzso zzso The results indicated the zzso but not zzso stimulation of zzso conversion and zzso migration of cells by zzso suggesting a central role for zzso signaling in the maintenance of cellular plasticity of zzso cells throughout the zzso zzso These findings raise zzso hypotheses on zzso zzso and progression that might provide a rational underpinning for new therapeutic zzso
