The zzso of zzso binding cassette (ABC) zzso often leads to the development of zzso resistance zzso and results in a zzso response to zzso Previously, we reported that zzso zzso a human zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso significantly reverses zzso in cancer cells by blocking the zzso function of ABC zzso B member 1 zzso and ABC zzso G member 2 zzso In the present study, we conducted in zzso experiments to evaluate if zzso and zzso structural zzso of zzso could reverse zzso and zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso and zzso significantly zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells to their zzso zzso zzso and zzso significantly increased the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells and zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso In addition, zzso and zzso significantly inhibited zzso transport of zzso in zzso zzso membrane zzso There was no significant change in the expression levels of zzso and zzso in the cell lines exposed to zzso of either zzso or zzso for 3 zzso In addition, a zzso model predicted the binding zzso of zzso and zzso to be within the zzso region of zzso modeled human zzso and zzso We conclude that zzso and zzso at clinically achievable plasma zzso reverse zzso and zzso zzso by blocking the drug zzso function of these zzso These findings may be useful in developing combination therapy for cancer treatment with zzso zzso
