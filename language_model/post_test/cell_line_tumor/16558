zzso zzso receptors zzso are implicated in the regulation zzso zzso processes in cells both in normal and pathological states, zzso isolated from zzso snails zzso are a valuable tool for the study of pharmacological properties and functional role of zzso In the present study the zzso zzso analogue with the additional zzso attached to the N zzso zzso was zzso Also we zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso labeled with the zzso Hunter zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Fluorescence zzso studies of the zzso zzso cells loaded with zzso indicator zzso or with zzso and zzso indicators zzso and zzso were performed to examine effect of zzso modification on its ability to inhibit zzso increases in zzso free zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Monitoring of individual cell zzso and zzso signals revealed different zzso of zzso and zzso rise and zzso in responses to brief nicotine zzso applications zzso zzso 3-5 zzso which indicates to different mechanisms of zzso and zzso zzso control in zzso zzso zzso inhibited in zzso manner the both zzso and zzso increase induced by zzso Additional zzso in the zzso or, especially, more zzso label in zzso significantly reduced the zzso effect of zzso Whereas the efficiency of the zzso response zzso by zzso was found to be close to the efficiency of its zzso by natural zzso zzso zzso derivatives zzso can be used in zzso zzso
