The potential gender differences in lung cancer development have been proposed on the basis of hormonal zzso We aimed to evaluate whether zzso receptors zzso in zzso cell zzso zzso patients may primarily depend upon zzso zzso produced via zzso zzso 

We evaluated zzso beta zzso and zzso status in 169 Japanese zzso patients through zzso analysis zzso zzso of zzso was further confirmed in zzso cell lines via in zzso zzso 

zzso analysis of zzso patients demonstrated that both zzso and zzso were highly zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso survival in males was significantly worse than that in zzso female among double positive zzso patients zzso but not in zzso positive zzso In addition, among double positive cases, overall survival of males was significantly worse than that of zzso females in those with higher zzso zzso score zzso zzso but not in those with lower zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated zzso activity on testosterone treatment, which resulted in in zzso zzso production ( zzso and increased proliferation of zzso zzso zzso cells ( zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso this proliferation and also enhanced the zzso activity ( zzso zzso treatment resulted in zzso responsive elements zzso ( zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells whereas zzso blocker zzso zzso zzso this effect, ( zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso of Japanese males may result in tumor progression and potential zzso therapy may zzso therapeutic benefits to these zzso
