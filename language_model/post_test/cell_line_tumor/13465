zzso titanium scaffolds were zzso by zzso of compressed zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and irregular shaped space holders were used to investigate the effect of pore shape on cellular zzso After removal of the space holder, the shape of the zzso was zzso to the zzso Average diameter of the pores was in the range of zzso zzso zzso images showed that titanium hydride resulted in higher surface zzso and larger zzso zzso than pure zzso In zzso evaluations were carried out by using zzso zzso measuring alkaline zzso activity and zzso red zzso in flow zzso zzso for cell zzso Observations revealed excellent attachment and proliferation of zzso cells to the highly porous scaffolds zzso with titanium hydride and zzso of this zzso
