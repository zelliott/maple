Less than half of breast cancer patients respond to zzso chemotherapy with zzso after failing treatment with zzso such as zzso A recent clinical trial by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 18 : zzso zzso examined whether patients may derive a better clinical benefit if zzso was administered before zzso While overall survival was similar regardless of the order of drug administration, a zzso reduction in the response rate to zzso was observed after late crossover from zzso compared to the response rate to zzso after late crossover from zzso This may be related to differences in the ability of the drugs to induce zzso to each zzso To test this hypothesis, we examined whether zzso breast tumor cells selected for resistance to zzso exhibit greater zzso to zzso and other drugs than identical cells selected for resistance to zzso We found that cells selected for resistance to zzso showed strong resistance zzso to zzso and zzso with little zzso zzso to zzso In contrast, cells selected for resistance to zzso exhibited zzso resistance to zzso and a dramatic zzso and zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells exhibited higher zzso and breast cancer resistance protein zzso levels than zzso zzso In addition, zzso was strongly zzso in zzso cells but not in zzso zzso These differences may account for the contrasting zzso profiles observed for the two cell lines and may help to explain why treatment of breast cancer patients with zzso appears to be zzso by prior zzso zzso
