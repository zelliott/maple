The zzso association between zzso use and decreased risk of advanced prostate cancer suggests that statins may inhibit prostate cancer development and/or zzso Studies were performed to determine the effects of a model zzso zzso zzso on the proliferation and differentiation of prostate cancer cells, and to identify possible mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso inhibited the in zzso proliferation of both zzso and zzso human prostate cancer cells in a zzso and zzso zzso The greater zzso activity of zzso in zzso cells was associated with induction of zzso in that cell line, as demonstrated by increased expression of zzso zzso was consistently zzso by zzso in zzso cells, but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells was zzso and was reversed by zzso zzso of zzso zzso decreased expression of zzso by zzso and attenuated the zzso activity of zzso zzso expression in zzso cells was also increased in response to stress induced by serum withdrawal, suggesting that zzso zzso can occur due to nutritional zzso zzso and zzso were identified to be potential target genes of zzso in zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso was zzso in zzso cells exposed to zzso These data suggest that zzso may be a zzso zzso that mediates zzso action in prostate cancer zzso
