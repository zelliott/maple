Treatment of human cervical zzso zzso cells with zzso or with the zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a zzso transient increase, followed by a late decrease, in zzso resistance zzso zzso cells express two zzso forms of zzso 65 and 50 zzso zzso with zzso and zzso decreased the density of the zzso form and increased the density of the zzso zzso zzso also decreased zzso zzso of the zzso form and increased zzso zzso of the zzso form and zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso decreased acutely zzso and zzso zzso of the two zzso and in cells zzso with zzso zzso increased acutely the density of the zzso form and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Treatment with zzso increased the zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso attenuated the late decreases in zzso induced by zzso and zzso and the decrease in the zzso and increase in the zzso forms induced by zzso zzso analyses showed that high levels of zzso correlated with the zzso form, whereas low levels of zzso correlated zzso with the zzso form and positively with the zzso zzso The results suggest that in zzso cells 1) zzso determines gating of the tight zzso 2) changes in zzso zzso status and composition regulate the zzso 3) protein zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso form increases the resistance of assembled tight zzso 4) the early stage of tight junction zzso involves zzso breakdown of zzso zzso form to the zzso form, and 5) increased levels of the zzso form interfere with zzso gating of the tight zzso
