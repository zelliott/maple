It is well known that blood zzso level affects the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso Thus, the action of steroids on zzso metabolism may alter blood zzso levels and may affect zzso zzso in zzso in patients treated with zzso To clarify this point, we determined the effects of steroids on zzso zzso in zzso in a rat model of a zzso zzso 

zzso were zzso with zzso zzso cells zzso into the left calf zzso They were zzso overnight and divided into three groups zzso in each zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso body weight, zzso injection 4 h before zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (8 zzso body weight, zzso injection 20 h before zzso zzso zzso and zzso control zzso zzso zzso in zzso was determined 1 h after zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso was expressed as the percentage of injected dose per gram of tissue after zzso to zzso weight zzso zzso body zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso significantly increased the blood zzso levels to zzso and zzso of the control zzso The levels of zzso zzso in the zzso were not significantly affected by zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the control value, zzso zzso 

These results demonstrate that zzso zzso in the zzso was not affected by zzso with steroids, in spite of a slight zzso in blood zzso zzso
