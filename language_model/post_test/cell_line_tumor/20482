zzso viral integration site 1 zzso a zzso factor frequently zzso in zzso zzso has been implicated in the generation of zzso zzso aberrations and zzso zzso Here, we sought to investigate the underlying cause of zzso amplification in zzso zzso We found that zzso of zzso in zzso cells induced zzso zzso which were consistently associated with enlarged zzso or zzso zzso Live cell imaging experiments identified zzso failure as the underlying cause of this zzso In accordance with previous reports, zzso zzso induced a partial cell cycle arrest in zzso phase, accompanied by elevated zzso D1 and zzso levels, reduced zzso activity and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso predominantly occurred in resting cells, as identified by low levels of the proliferation marker zzso leading to the conclusion that they result from zzso after zzso failure and are confined to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso using zzso revealed that further zzso of these cells was inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso
