zzso zzso activity increases when it zzso either into zzso in the presence of zzso templates or into rings in the presence of zzso domain zzso zzso is a zzso inhibitor of moderate potency zzso zzso zzso in zzso We show that zzso binds zzso to zzso used for in zzso drug zzso drastically reducing its potency zzso zzso zzso and research tool zzso We zzso a focused set of zzso and zzso zzso zzso called the zzso compounds, five of which had improved zzso reduced zzso binding and reduced zzso zzso by changes in the position and/or number of zzso zzso The zzso compound zzso was the most potent compound, exhibiting a zzso improvement in potency over zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, while zzso about equally inhibited zzso assembled in its zzso or ring states, zzso and zzso exhibited zzso reduced activity against rings, suggesting that they can discriminate between zzso or ring zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso of zzso in multiple cell types zzso of zzso and zzso respectively), at least zzso more zzso than zzso but had no effect on zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso also reduced synaptic zzso zzso and zzso bulk zzso in cultured zzso and zzso Overall, zzso and zzso are improved and versatile zzso zzso and zzso zzso in terms of zzso zzso binding and zzso The data further suggest that the ring zzso state of zzso is not required for zzso zzso
