Platinum zzso in zzso zzso zzso by zzso proteins such as zzso is a major factor contributing to the zzso resistance of zzso zzso zzso concurrent zzso of zzso in combination with chemotherapy may improve treatment outcomes for zzso Here, we develop a mathematical model to investigate the potential of combination therapy with zzso a small zzso inhibitor of zzso and zzso a zzso drug, on a simulated tumor zzso The model is zzso against in zzso experimental data, wherein zzso established in mice were treated with zzso and/or zzso on a fixed periodic zzso The validated model is used to predict the minimum drug load that will achieve a predetermined level of tumor growth zzso thereby maximizing the zzso between the two zzso Our simulations suggest that the zzso of each zzso dose is a critical zzso with an zzso infusion of zzso given weekly combined with a daily zzso dose of zzso predicted to minimize residual zzso The potential of combination therapy to prevent or delay the onset of zzso is also zzso When resistance is acquired as a result of zzso zzso repair in cells treated with zzso drug delivery schedules that induce tumor zzso with even low doses of combination therapy can be zzso zzso resistance due to pre-existing zzso of resistant cells zzso tumor regression, but dosing strategies that extend zzso survival periods can still be zzso These results highlight the potential of our model to accelerate the development of novel zzso such as zzso zzso
