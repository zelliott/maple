DNA copy number zzso zzso are known to be related to genetic diseases, including zzso The unlimited zzso zzso model, in which zzso occurs zzso with a simple zzso zzso has been proposed to investigate long-term effects of zzso on gene expression zzso zzso theory was applied, and the zzso relationship has been shown to be generally zzso in the zzso zzso However, the dynamic effects of zzso on zzso and the underlying disorders related to diseases remain greatly zzso Since most genes in a single cell are zzso transcribed in short periods of time zzso by long periods of limited transcription, an alternative model for zzso in the restrictive state is needed for unraveling the effects of zzso on gene expression levels with zzso To address these issues, zzso a single zzso zzso model is proposed, in which bound zzso are assumed to be unloaded immediately after stimulating a zzso Using the zzso transform and zzso analysis, the relationship between DNA copy number and gene expression level is zzso Dynamic modeling reveals that zzso would potentially zzso or even reverse, the zzso gene expression modifications while shifting from the ST model to the zzso zzso Moreover, functional disorders in zzso zzso due to zzso are shown via zzso This paper demonstrates how mathematical theories could be helpful to interpret statistical findings from real data and achieve a better understanding of cancer zzso
