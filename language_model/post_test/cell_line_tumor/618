Two novel imaging agents zzso and zzso bearing both a zzso zzso zzso for zzso metallic zzso zzso or zzso and the near infrared dye zzso were prepared by a novel modular synthetic strategy as examples of zzso zzso imaging probe zzso Fluorescent zzso illustrated that 1 and 2 strongly bind to zzso cancer cells zzso zzso zzso and to zzso cancer cells zzso zzso respectively, thereby demonstrating that the functionality of the targeting zzso is zzso zzso the described novel synthesis strategy can be applied to engineer other zzso zzso zzso based zzso for zzso zzso
