To investigate the impact of zzso zzso protein 53, zzso on zzso stability of zzso zzso 

In first instance, we expressed in zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso a wild type zzso zzso zzso whose protein zzso nuclear import and zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso we investigated zzso imbalances zzso and deletions at genes or DNA regions most frequently altered in human zzso associated with zzso relative to zzso expression by mean of an zzso comparative zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally we investigated a putative marker of zzso zzso stress, a zzso zzso deletion at zzso zzso DNA usually referred to as zzso zzso by mean of a zzso chain reaction zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso generated from zzso zzso zzso cells DNA deletions were remarkably reduced and the zzso of zzso deletion at zzso zzso may let the persistence of zzso damage by zzso zzso from zzso oxygen species zzso completely zzso 

The results of our study confirm that zzso zzso has a role in protection of zzso cell DNA zzso Multiple mechanisms involved in zzso safeguard of zzso integrity and prevention of deletion outcome are zzso
