The human zzso is an important site for contact between the host and pathogens ascending the zzso zzso and thus plays an important role in female zzso tract zzso Previous work in our laboratory has suggested that zzso receptors zzso are involved in zzso zzso recognition of pathogens and that zzso of zzso zzso results in the production of zzso and zzso important for both immune and zzso functions of the zzso We have also demonstrated zzso regulation of zzso zzso and protein expression in human zzso suggesting that steroid hormones might play a role in the expression and function of zzso In this study, the effects of zzso zzso and zzso zzso on zzso expression and function in zzso cell lines were zzso 

zzso zzso cell lines were cultured and examined for the presence of zzso and hormone receptors by zzso zzso For hormonal studies, cells were zzso with ethanol vehicle, zzso M zzso and/or zzso M zzso For zzso zzso cells were treated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso for two hours prior to treatment with zzso Following hormone or zzso zzso cells were zzso with vehicle, the synthetic zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso a negative zzso control, or a positive zzso zzso and zzso production zzso was measured by zzso The effects of zzso and P on zzso zzso and protein expression were measured using Real Time zzso and zzso analysis, zzso 

zzso of zzso cells with the synthetic zzso zzso Poly zzso resulted in the production of zzso and zzso important for zzso function and zzso zzso of Poly zzso zzso and zzso production by cells treated with zzso M zzso but not cells treated with zzso M zzso was observed in zzso zzso cell lines expressing zzso and zzso zzso alpha zzso The effects of zzso were not observed on cells which did not express zzso or in cells zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Treatment with zzso did not affect zzso zzso or protein zzso However, treatment with zzso did suppress zzso and zzso production resulting from zzso stimulation with Poly zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The data presented in this study are the first indication that zzso can markedly alter the innate immune response to zzso providing a previously zzso process by which zzso can alter immune zzso
