zzso transfer zzso of T cells forced to express zzso zzso zzso zzso genes is an attractive strategy to direct zzso zzso immunity against zzso zzso However, clinical effectiveness has been hampered by limited in zzso zzso We investigated whether the use of major zzso zzso T cells would prolong the in zzso persistence of zzso zzso gene expressing T cells by continuous zzso proliferation via the zzso potentially zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells engineered to express a zzso against a zzso zzso zzso strong zzso zzso effects with reduced zzso disease zzso severity when given early after zzso AT later after transplantation resulted in a complete loss of zzso Loss of function was associated with reduced expansion of zzso T cells as assessed by zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso on T cells in zzso zzso zzso blockade in zzso transplant recipients largely restored the zzso efficacy without triggering zzso whereas no significant zzso effects of zzso blockade were observed in zzso zzso These data suggest a clinical approach in which the AT of zzso zzso T cells early after transplantation can provide a potent zzso effect without zzso whereas later AT is effective only with concurrent zzso zzso
