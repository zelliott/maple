zzso is a zzso protein that plays multiple roles in regulating cell growth, cell zzso and zzso Here, we have demonstrated that a complex mechanism involving multiple regulatory elements is involved in the zzso zzso or zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso utilizing various zzso and zzso zzso promoter fragments, revealed roles for the ORE zzso stress responsive zzso ARE zzso responsive zzso three zzso zzso protein zzso sites and the zzso box in the zzso of the zzso gene by zzso The ORE required the presence of the ARE to elicit its response, whereas the independent removal of three zzso sites and the zzso box also decreased zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso of the zzso box having the greatest zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis also revealed varying roles for two zzso zzso start zzso in the zzso of the zzso gene by zzso zzso was initiated from both zzso however, different response rates and fold zzso were zzso Together, these results suggest that the zzso gene is controlled by a novel arrangement of two overlapping core promoter regions, one containing a zzso box and the other zzso zzso the zzso levels of zzso in a breast cancer cell line also influenced the induction of zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso produced zzso times higher induction levels of zzso zzso compared with control cells, indicating an intrinsic form of control of promoter activity by the zzso system zzso
