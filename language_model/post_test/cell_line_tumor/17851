This study dealt with the preparation and characterization of zzso loaded zzso grafted zzso zzso zzso zzso and evaluation of cellular zzso by using human gastric cancer cell line zzso in zzso The potential application of these zzso zzso for sustained drug delivery was evaluated by the zzso and zzso of the cellular zzso of fluorescent zzso zzso zzso loaded zzso zzso were prepared by a modified zzso emulsion technique and characterized by various zzso methods such as, laser light scattering for particle size and size distribution, atomic force zzso zzso zzso and zzso to identify the release of fluorescent molecules from the zzso zzso was used to measure the cellular zzso of fluorescent zzso zzso zzso laser scanning microscopic images clearly showed the zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso Cell viability was assessed by treating the zzso cells with zzso zzso for 48 zzso The results zzso that these zzso zzso zzso holds promise in biomedical field as a zzso
