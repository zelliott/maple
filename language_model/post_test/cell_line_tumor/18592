The zzso zzso gene is responsible for variations in plasma zzso high levels of which are a risk factor for zzso and zzso zzso The zzso promoter stimulates the expression of reporter genes in zzso cells, but not in zzso zzso In the present study, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso promoter comprises two composite regulatory zzso a zzso negative regulatory module zzso zzso to zzso and a zzso zzso module zzso to zzso The zzso negative regulatory module contains two strong negative regulatory regions zzso zzso zzso repeat zzso and zzso zzso regulatory element zzso which sandwich the zzso regulatory region zzso zzso regulatory element zzso The zzso was shown to bind to zzso factors in a zzso manner, whereas the ubiquitous zzso factors zzso nuclear factor zzso and zzso binding protein 4 bound to zzso to repress gene zzso The zzso zzso module contains two regulatory zzso an zzso region zzso that activates zzso in zzso cells, and zzso which is responsible for zzso the zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso binds to a zzso zzso These multiple regulatory elements might work zzso to finely regulate zzso gene zzso Although the zzso module is required for zzso gene zzso and repression in a zzso manner, the zzso interplay of the zzso and zzso regulators might define the complex zzso of zzso gene zzso
