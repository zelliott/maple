zzso is a key zzso zzso of the zzso cell surface that is zzso in many cancer zzso Typically, zzso is thought to be anchored to the plasma membrane via the zzso sites of its binding partner, zzso zzso Here, using the potent and highly zzso mechanism of zzso interference zzso we have zzso silenced the expression of the zzso gene in zzso zzso cancer zzso We show that zzso expression zzso by the zzso zzso causes efficient, stable, and specific zzso of zzso gene zzso The zzso zzso of zzso gene expression resulted in a major decrease in the appearance of zzso zzso protein and correlated with a zzso loss of zzso zzso a zzso loss in cellular zzso generation and a complete loss in zzso cellular zzso We also observed that the zzso cells do not express zzso zzso on their zzso zzso Thus, the data show that zzso zzso is not required by zzso for its association with the plasma zzso for its zzso with zzso or for its binding and zzso of zzso
