Cell zzso zzso 1 zzso a putative tumor zzso involving in cell zzso proliferation and zzso is frequently zzso in several zzso due to promoter zzso But zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and clinical significance have not been zzso zzso The aim of this study was to determine the role of functional zzso of zzso gene in zzso zzso and its potential as a novel zzso marker for clinical assessment of patients with zzso zzso We measured zzso expression levels in 8 zzso cancer cell lines, 54 primary zzso zzso and their corresponding zzso zzso by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction, western zzso analysis and zzso We analyzed zzso promoter zzso status by zzso zzso sequencing and the zzso special zzso chain reaction, and evaluated its correlation with zzso zzso All statistical tests were zzso zzso of zzso expression was observed in 7 of 8 zzso zzso cancer cell lines and in 39 of 54 zzso primary zzso zzso zzso of zzso promoter region occurred in 6 of 8 zzso zzso cancer cell lines and 32 of 54 zzso primary zzso zzso and was correlated with advanced zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene is a frequent zzso in development of zzso cancer and can be a potential zzso for molecular staging of patients with zzso zzso
