zzso levels of the zzso zzso zzso are associated with poor outcome of several types of zzso including zzso We have previously reported an important involvement of zzso a member of zzso protein 40 zzso family, in zzso zzso tumor zzso The current study was prompted by our observations reported here which revealed a zzso relationship between zzso and zzso in melanoma zzso The zzso zzso is the most zzso domain of zzso family of zzso zzso we assessed the functional role of the J domain in activities of zzso We report that the J domain of zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the J domain renders zzso incapable of zzso zzso and suppressing zzso Our zzso investigations reveal that zzso binds zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and causes zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso 9 by recruiting protein zzso zzso This zzso activates zzso leading to degradation of zzso and subsequent loss of zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the J domain abrogates assembly of this zzso complex and renders zzso zzso thus, stabilizing zzso a zzso zzso for zzso zzso Our zzso and zzso functional analyses show that zzso zzso expression in the background of deletion of the J domain renders the zzso tumor cells less zzso despite the presence of stabilized zzso Thus, we have uncovered a new mechanism for regulation of zzso activity leading to zzso of zzso zzso
