We present evidence that zzso zzso zzso zzso growth of zzso pancreatic zzso cell lines via cell cycle arrest in the zzso while it has no effect on primary zzso zzso Growth zzso of cancer cells is dependent on zzso and zzso induction as indicated by a significantly reduced zzso growth zzso by the free radical scavenger zzso zzso or the zzso inhibitor zzso Moreover, zzso induction is dependent on zzso production as demonstrated by a complete removal of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso has a central role in growth zzso by zzso as revealed by zzso zzso experiments with zzso zzso and occurs via increased zzso stability largely zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso does not affect zzso gene expression in primary zzso although it is able to activate zzso and the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the resistance of zzso to the zzso action of zzso may be related to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Finally, in zzso studies on zzso cells zzso zzso in nude mice show that treatment with 100 or 200 zzso zzso reduces of zzso or zzso the zzso volume, respectively, and does not cause any apparent form of zzso
