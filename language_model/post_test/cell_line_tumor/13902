zzso a zzso complex of zzso zzso with zinc salt, is widely used in agriculture as zzso Literature data indicate that zzso zzso may have zzso effects in zzso We have recently found in agricultural workers zzso exposed to the zzso zzso a statistically significant decrease in zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso production in zzso zzso is an essential zzso zzso whose production is normally zzso during an zzso The purpose of this work was to establish an in zzso model reflecting in zzso data and to characterize the molecular mechanism of action of zzso The human zzso cell line zzso was used as in zzso model to study the effects of zzso and its main zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso release, reflecting in zzso zzso The zzso effect observed was not limited to zzso but also other zzso namely zzso and zzso showed similar zzso zzso zzso must be added before or simultaneously to zzso in order to observe the effect, indicating that it acts on early events triggered by zzso It is known that nuclear zzso zzso tightly regulates zzso zzso We could demonstrate that zzso modulating zzso zzso oxygen species generation, prevented zzso degradation and zzso nuclear zzso which in turn resulted in decreased zzso zzso To further understand the mechanism of the effect of zzso on zzso transcription, zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso zzso and the effect of zzso on zzso activity was zzso zzso zzso with promoter zzso containing zzso site showed decreased zzso zzso activity relative to control after zzso treatment, confirming zzso binding as an zzso target of zzso Overall, this study contributes to our understanding of the mechanism underlying zzso zzso
