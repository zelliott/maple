Here we determined which zzso genes were altered in zzso zzso and zzso zzso which showed higher resistance to zzso than parental human leukemia zzso and mouse zzso zzso zzso cells, respectively and studied if zzso observed after zzso could be restored by zzso of protein zzso zzso The expressions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes that related to DNA damage repair, and zzso and zzso genes that related to zzso were zzso but the expression of zzso zzso gene was zzso in the zzso cells as compared to each parental zzso We also revealed that the combined treatment of radiation and the inhibitor of protein zzso A zzso to these zzso cells resulted in synergistic zzso of zzso zzso and zzso expressions of the cells, and consequently restored zzso of the zzso Our results propose that combined treatment with zzso and zzso inhibitor can be a novel therapeutic strategy to zzso zzso
