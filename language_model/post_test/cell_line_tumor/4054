We describe a highly sensitive method for the detection of zzso zzso the zzso precursor of cholesterol, based on its zzso with zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso of biological zzso and zzso with added zzso internal standards were zzso with zzso and analyzed by zzso This protocol permits fast processing of samples, short zzso times, and high zzso We applied this method to the analysis of cells, blood, and zzso from several sources, including human zzso Another innovative aspect of this study is that it provides a reliable and highly zzso measurement of zzso in zzso zzso zzso mouse (a model for zzso zzso samples, showing regional differences in the brain zzso We found that the levels of zzso are consistently higher in zzso mice than in controls, with the spinal zzso and peripheral nerve showing the biggest zzso In addition to zzso sensitive analysis of zzso in zzso and blood was also accomplished with this zzso method by zzso zzso formed from the zzso zzso zzso The method reported here may provide a highly sensitive and high zzso way to identify zzso populations having errors in cholesterol zzso
