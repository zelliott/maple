The zzso receptors are a family of zzso partners capable of driving transformation and zzso While the therapeutic targeting of single receptors has proven zzso optimal targeting of this zzso family should target all zzso members zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso are highly zzso and control various aspects of zzso zzso In an effort to block those functions, we have targeted this domain with decoy peptides zzso in tandem with a zzso zzso termed zzso Treatment with zzso zzso cell death, promotes the formation of inactive zzso zzso and results in simultaneous reduction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Treatment also results in the zzso of zzso light zzso cell zzso while zzso zzso zzso zzso with the induction of cell zzso zzso also directly zzso to zzso zzso with a loss of zzso membrane potential and production of zzso oxygen zzso Finally, treatment of a mouse model of breast cancer with zzso results in the zzso of tumor growth and zzso without associated zzso in normal zzso Overall, these data demonstrate that a portion of the zzso zzso domain, when used as an zzso decoy, can inhibit tumor growth and zzso representing a novel zzso zzso
