Two human melanoma cell lines, zzso and zzso were used for in zzso studies of the mechanisms underlying heat resistance of human zzso cells adapted to growth in zzso zzso zzso to growth at low pH was characterized by resistance to 42 degrees C zzso and accompanied by an increase in zzso levels of zzso and/or zzso Acute zzso zzso to levels below pH zzso was required to sensitize the melanoma cells to 42 degrees zzso Furthermore, cells grown at low pH were more resistant to zzso by acute zzso than cells grown at pH zzso The zzso pH zzso of cells grown at pH zzso was less than the zzso of cells grown at pH zzso both before and after acute zzso A zzso threshold existed for melanoma cells growing at pH zzso below which they became zzso to 42 degrees zzso This zzso threshold differed between the zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, a zzso threshold for heat zzso did not exist for cells growing at pH zzso any reduction in zzso before heating resulted in increased cell zzso Since cells grown at low pH lack a zzso threshold for heat zzso they are zzso more to 42 degrees C per unit decrease in zzso than cells grown at pH zzso Acute zzso zzso the 42 degrees zzso of zzso and zzso in the melanoma zzso The zzso thresholds for zzso of these zzso are slightly higher than or comparable with the thresholds for zzso for each cell line grown at pH zzso but zzso occurred over a zzso range of zzso compared with zzso zzso of zzso expression of these zzso zzso with zzso in both cell lines with the exception of zzso expression in zzso zzso In conclusion, strategies that reduce zzso in melanoma cells growing at low zzso such as in zzso regions of zzso could selectively sensitize them to zzso because they lack a zzso threshold for heat zzso
