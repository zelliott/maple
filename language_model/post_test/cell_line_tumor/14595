Recent studies have identified zzso zzso zzso type 9 zzso and Idol as negative regulators of low density zzso zzso zzso protein zzso While the induction of zzso zzso has been recognized as a limitation to the zzso cholesterol-lowering efficacy at higher doses, it is unknown whether Idol is involved in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Here we report that statins exert opposite effects on zzso and Idol gene expression in human zzso cell lines and primary zzso isolated from zzso and zzso While zzso expression was zzso the level of Idol zzso rapidly declined in zzso cells in a zzso zzso This differs from the effect of the liver X zzso zzso zzso which increased the expression of both zzso and zzso We further show that cellular depletion of Idol by zzso zzso did not change zzso expression levels in control and zzso zzso however, the zzso level of zzso protein increased by zzso in Idol zzso zzso zzso zzso More importantly, the increase in zzso protein abundance by zzso and zzso treatment was compromised by Idol zzso zzso zzso our present findings suggest that the suppression of Idol gene expression in liver cells is an additional mechanism underlying the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso This may contribute to the zzso effects of statins observed in clinical zzso
