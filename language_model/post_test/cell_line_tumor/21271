zzso breast cancer may emerge from zzso tumor cells that remain dormant at zzso sites for many zzso zzso mechanisms regulating the switch from dormancy to zzso zzso growth has been elusive due to the lack of experimental models of tumor cell zzso We characterized the in zzso growth characteristics of cells that exhibit either dormant zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso behavior in zzso Although these cells zzso readily in two-dimensional culture, we show that when grown in three-dimensional zzso distinct growth properties of the cells were revealed that correlate to their dormant or zzso behavior at zzso sites in zzso In three-dimensional culture, cells with dormant behavior in zzso remained cell cycle arrested with elevated nuclear expression of zzso and zzso The transition from zzso to proliferation of zzso cells was dependent on zzso production and signaling through zzso zzso leading to zzso reorganization with zzso zzso zzso stress fiber zzso We show that zzso of zzso light chain zzso by zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso is required for zzso stress fiber formation and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso prevents transition from a zzso to zzso state in zzso zzso of zzso significantly reduces zzso outgrowth in zzso These studies show that the switch from dormancy to zzso growth may be zzso in part, through zzso signaling from the zzso leading to changes in the zzso architecture of dormant zzso zzso this process may provide therapeutic strategies for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
