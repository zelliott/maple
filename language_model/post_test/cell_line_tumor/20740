The zzso zzso is a member of the zzso necrosis factor zzso family and is widely expressed on various cell zzso The zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso has been observed in zzso zzso but its activity on zzso cancer remains zzso However, in this paper, we first confirmed that the zzso zzso zzso could inhibit the growth of zzso cancer cells and induce zzso This study investigated the expression of zzso by zzso zzso zzso and cell lines, at the same time, we evaluated the effect of a zzso soluble human zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso on cell growth and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso was expressed on zzso zzso cell lines and primary zzso zzso cells derived from zzso as well as on zzso zzso zzso The growth zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso cells was examined by zzso zzso and the proportion of zzso zzso cells was zzso by flow zzso and zzso zzso Our study showed that zzso was expressed on all zzso zzso cell lines and was examined in zzso zzso of zzso cancer tissue samples, but not in normal zzso zzso zzso Treatment with zzso or zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso cell growth and induced zzso zzso results suggest that zzso is expressed on zzso zzso cells, moreover, that zzso and zzso zzso zzso have therapeutic potential to inhibit human zzso cancer zzso
