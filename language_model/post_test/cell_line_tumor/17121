To enhance the therapeutic efficacy of zzso agents and to reduce systemic side effects, it was decided to study the effect of zzso zzso directly on solid tumors to observe the zzso effect of zzso on tumors and the distribution of zzso in tumors and other zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso in severe combined zzso zzso mice in both zzso of the abdominal zzso When both lateral tumors had grown to approximately zzso zzso zzso mice were used for 2 zzso The right tumors were treated with zzso injection of zzso in 1, 5 and 10 zzso g per day for 10 days zzso The left tumors were treated with zzso buffer solution as zzso To explore the distribution of zzso remaining in tumor and some zzso a single zzso injection of zzso was studied with quantitative measurement of zzso by means of atomic zzso zzso The results revealed that on the 17th day after the 1st injection zzso tumors were suppressed markedly compared to that of the zzso lateral tumor accompanied by marked zzso and necrosis in tumor zzso The tumor growth zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso in 1, 5 and 10 zzso g group, zzso There were no pathological changes in heart, zzso zzso liver, kidney or brain after zzso zzso Distribution of zzso revealed that zzso remained at higher concentration in zzso tumor tissue than in other zzso Our data suggest that zzso delivery of zzso efficiently suppresses growth of transplanted zzso zzso without systemic side zzso The protocol of zzso zzso injection will be its potential clinical utility for therapy of solid zzso
