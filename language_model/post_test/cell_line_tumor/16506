Multiple myeloma is a zzso characterized by the expansion of a plasma cell clone that zzso to the human bone zzso zzso cells and bone zzso zzso cells produce soluble factors that promote the survival and progression of multiple zzso zzso 16 zzso is involved in regulating the migration and proliferation of normal zzso However, the role of zzso in human zzso including multiple zzso is zzso 

We investigated zzso expression in cell lines zzso zzso 10) and in the bone zzso of myeloma patients zzso zzso zzso and healthy bone zzso donors zzso zzso zzso by quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction, zzso analysis, zzso zzso zzso flow zzso and zzso zzso of two human multiple myeloma cell lines with small interfering zzso was used to examine the effect of zzso gene zzso on zzso by flow zzso on proliferation by zzso zzso and on colony zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed by treating multiple myeloma cells with a zzso zzso against the zzso zzso of zzso All statistical tests were zzso 

zzso was strongly zzso in the bone zzso of myeloma patients compared with healthy zzso zzso cell lines as well as primary tumor cells from myeloma patients zzso expressed zzso and its receptors zzso and/or zzso and spontaneously zzso soluble zzso zzso of zzso reduced the zzso activity of myeloma cells by approximately zzso compared with zzso cells zzso relative zzso activity zzso zzso vs zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso and addition of a zzso zzso zzso zzso reversed that zzso A zzso zzso directed against zzso or its receptors had a comparably strong zzso effect on the tumor zzso 

zzso is an important zzso factor in multiple myeloma and a candidate for novel zzso zzso and therapeutic applications for this incurable human zzso
