zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso supports growth of many tumors including those of breast, zzso and zzso Resistance of breast cancer cells to targeted zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso has been linked to persistent zzso activity, which may in part be due to increased membrane expression of zzso growth factor zzso receptors zzso and zzso Recently we found that proteins of the zzso zzso of G protein zzso family suppress zzso activity downstream of the zzso by zzso its zzso zzso from signaling zzso Because a substantial percentage of breast tumors have zzso zzso and reduced zzso protein zzso we investigated the link between regulation of zzso activity by zzso and breast cancer cell zzso zzso zzso in zzso breast cancer cells inhibited zzso proliferation and zzso zzso whereas zzso extinction of zzso zzso cell growth and resistance to zzso zzso Exposure to zzso also reduced zzso expression in zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso bound the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and inhibited its interaction with the zzso zzso adapter protein zzso These results suggest that the loss of zzso in some breast tumors enhances zzso signaling zzso by growth factors and thereby promotes proliferation and zzso evasion downstream of zzso zzso
