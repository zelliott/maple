zzso channels are implicated in cellular survival, zzso and zzso However, a profile of zzso activity in a specific cell type has not been determined from embryonic to terminally differentiated zzso Here, we characterized zzso expression in a spectrum of rat liver cells at different zzso zzso Using the zzso patch clamp technique, zzso zzso currents were identified in zzso cells, a zzso zzso zzso line derived from day 17 embryonic rat zzso zzso were zzso zzso enhanced in zzso solutions, and inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso revealed that zzso cells express both zzso and zzso However, mean currents were reduced almost zzso by zzso zzso zzso and were abolished in zzso cells zzso expressing a dominant negative zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is the major current carrier in these zzso zzso comparison showed that relative to terminally differentiated adult rat zzso currents were zzso and zzso times higher in, respectively, zzso and zzso cells, a rat zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that plasma membrane zzso channels are more highly expressed in zzso cells as compared with terminally differentiated and zzso rat zzso and suggest that zzso of this channel is associated with zzso zzso
