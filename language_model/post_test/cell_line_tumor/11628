zzso is one of the most aggressive zzso and its zzso is increasing zzso So far there are no zzso therapies especially after zzso Due to frequent zzso in members of the zzso protein zzso zzso signaling pathway, this zzso is zzso active in zzso It has been shown that the SONIC zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso regulate cell growth in many tumors including melanoma and interact with each other in the regulation of cell proliferation and zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso is active in human melanoma cell lines as they express downstream target of this zzso zzso zzso of zzso was significantly higher in human primary melanoma zzso harboring zzso zzso than those with wild type zzso zzso zzso of zzso in human melanoma cell lines resulted in decreased expression of zzso thus demonstrating interaction of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by the novel small zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso was followed by zzso of cell growth and induction of zzso in human melanoma cell lines, interestingly with both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was potent in reducing cell proliferation and inducing tumor growth arrest in zzso and in zzso respectively and these effects were superior to the natural compound zzso Finally, we conclude that zzso of zzso signaling zzso in human melanoma by the specific zzso inhibitor zzso could have potential therapeutic application in human melanoma even in the absence of zzso zzso and warrants further zzso
