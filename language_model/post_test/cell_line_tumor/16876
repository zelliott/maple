zzso between organic and conventional zzso zzso zzso and zzso which was done by four radical scavenging zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed significant differences between the zzso Such results were not estimated in zzso growing under organic and conventional zzso The extraction of zzso compounds was done by two different zzso sequential extraction with zzso zzso followed by methanol and zzso with methanol and zzso zzso The highest yield of zzso was found in the new zzso zzso in comparison with the classic zzso by direct extraction with zzso This is the first investigation of zzso zzso zzso grown under organic conditions and compared with zzso zzso High contents of zzso compounds and zzso and zzso properties of the two zzso zzso justify their use as sources of valuable zzso It is necessary to continue this study as a long-term experiment to eliminate the influence of zzso
