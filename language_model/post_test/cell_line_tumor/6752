We report the feasibility of monitoring both zzso oxygen zzso and zzso concentration in the superficial layer of tissue using zzso elastic zzso zzso We detail our analysis technique, the experimental validation of our analysis, and the detection of an early increase in blood supply to the superficial layer of colon tissue in human patients with zzso zzso as well as in an animal model of colon zzso To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first evidence that polarization gating can be used as a zzso tool to zzso zzso concentration as well as oxygen zzso in the uppermost tissue zzso
