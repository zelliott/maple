Recently, we have established an zzso in zzso zzso method named zzso zzso after zzso activated cell sorting zzso in which a specific zzso in a particular cell type is stained with a zzso zzso allowing the stained cells to be selected by zzso without suffering excessive zzso zzso Using this method, the biological characteristics of the sorted cells can be determined by analyzing their gene expression zzso In this study, we used locked zzso acid zzso zzso which are known to enhance both the sensitivity and specificity of zzso zzso as zzso zzso in zzso When we used a zzso probe targeting the human zzso zzso we were able to efficiently separate human cells from rat zzso Using zzso zzso the zzso step was shortened to zzso After the zzso step, zzso zzso was zzso thus, we were able to successfully measure gene expression levels in each type of cell after zzso Providing the zzso probe efficiently zzso with the target zzso zzso with an zzso probe is a powerful tool for separating particular cells and determining their biological characteristics by analyzing their gene expression zzso
