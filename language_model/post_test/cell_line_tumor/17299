zzso imaging has frequently been used in the past to detect changes in skin surface temperature associated with breast zzso Usually a 1-2 degrees C zzso in skin surface temperature is observed at the zzso zzso and it has been proposed that this change is due to zzso resulting from zzso zzso In our study, we used the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso that has been used to identify zzso drugs, to investigate whether infrared imaging can detect zzso in zzso zzso If successful, it was hoped that this technique would represent a simple, zzso procedure for monitoring the activity of zzso zzso It was found that, unlike breast cancer patients, no zzso increase in skin surface temperature was observed, but a constant and highly significant reduction in temperature was noted that was independent of zzso size and was produced by relatively small zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso The explanation for this effect is unclear but it may be due to the poorly zzso nature of rapidly growing zzso Nevertheless, our study indicates that the peripheral temperature zzso reported in breast cancer patients is unlikely to be due to zzso resulting from zzso zzso An alternative explanation is that the temperature increase is due to a chronic inflammatory response around developing breast zzso With increasing evidence that inflammation can enhance zzso growth and is associated with a poor zzso this suggestion implies that infrared imaging may have considerable zzso zzso
