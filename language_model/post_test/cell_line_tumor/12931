A series of novel zzso derivatives with terminal zzso zzso at C2 position on the zzso ring were zzso and studied for their zzso activity and underlying zzso These compounds demonstrated promising zzso to leukemia cells zzso displaying zzso values in the low zzso zzso zzso relationships zzso indicated that the compound zzso bearing a zzso zzso and zzso with a zzso ammonium side chain displayed higher zzso to zzso cells and also solid tumor cells zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, the compounds zzso and zzso had strong binding activity to calf zzso DNA zzso zzso as detected by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but limited zzso activity to human zzso 1 zzso zzso Taken together, this study discovered a series of new synthetic zzso derivatives with potent DNA binding and zzso zzso
