zzso zzso are abundant repetitive elements of viral origin, which in normal cells are kept zzso through zzso zzso zzso of zzso occurs frequently in cancer and can enable zzso zzso but also has zzso zzso We previously reported that in cancer, zzso active zzso promoters can drive zzso of zzso unique sequences giving rise to zzso zzso transcripts zzso Here, we show that one such zzso zzso is a large transcript zzso zzso running zzso to the zzso gene zzso We have zzso zzso zzso expression at zzso in transgenic mouse embryonic stem zzso cells and demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso and deposition of repressive zzso modifications zzso a zzso zzso zzso with this, zzso expression in breast and colon cancer cell lines is associated with zzso and repressive zzso at zzso Furthermore, we detected zzso transcripts in zzso of zzso zzso exhibiting reduced zzso zzso Our findings zzso zzso of zzso elements in subsequent zzso zzso of surrounding zzso thus hinting a novel zzso role for zzso elements in zzso
