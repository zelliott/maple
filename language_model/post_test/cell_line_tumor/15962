A new zzso compound, zzso was isolated from the leaves of zzso zzso zzso zzso The structure of zzso was determined to be zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed a significant zzso effect on the growth of a human breast zzso cell line zzso with an zzso zzso value for zzso of zzso zzso Cell cycle analysis revealed that the proportion of cells in the G zzso phase of the cell cycle increased in a zzso manner (from zzso % to zzso zzso after 48 h exposure to zzso at zzso ranging from 0 to 80 zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso cell cycle progression of zzso at the G zzso zzso After treatment with zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso in zzso cells was zzso accompanied by a decrease in the levels of zzso D zzso and zzso zzso 4 zzso and an increase in the expression of zzso zzso However, the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was not altered in zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso exhibits its zzso effects on zzso cells through zzso of zzso and zzso D zzso and zzso of zzso zzso by a zzso zzso
