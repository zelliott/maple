The addition of molecular targeted agents to enhance the zzso of zzso agents is a promising strategy in cancer zzso The combination of zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso was reported to achieve synergistic cell growth zzso in zzso cell zzso of the head and zzso zzso we zzso that the addition of zzso and zzso to zzso a zzso agent, might further increase zzso zzso 

The combination of zzso zzso and zzso was studied for its effect on cell growth and zzso by cell growth zzso and zzso V zzso The relevant molecular targets of these agents and zzso markers were examined by zzso analyses in the presence or absence of these three zzso zzso changes of the zzso zzso a known target of zzso were also evaluated by zzso for zzso after the combination zzso 

We showed that this triple combination significantly enhanced cell growth zzso and zzso zzso zzso mainly induced zzso zzso whereas the addition of zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso and enhanced zzso zzso One of the underlying mechanisms for zzso of zzso zzso by zzso and zzso is to further inhibit the zzso of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the promotion of zzso zzso 

Our studies suggest that the combination of zzso with a zzso inhibitor and an zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso inhibitor may further improve efficacy of zzso and other zzso therapies in zzso cell zzso of the head and zzso
