zzso zzso occurs frequently in patients with chronic zzso B virus zzso or chronic zzso C virus zzso zzso Recently, several studies suggested that zzso plays an important role as a zzso in other liver diseases such as zzso fibrosis, zzso and liver zzso In contrast to zzso however, the molecular mechanism by which zzso mediates zzso zzso has not been clearly zzso Here, we show the molecular mechanism by which zzso B virus X protein zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and the expression of various zzso zzso genes were investigated in zzso Chang liver cells, zzso stable cells, and zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso induced zzso zzso zzso in zzso stable cells and zzso zzso It also zzso the zzso zzso and protein levels of zzso regulatory element binding protein 1, but not zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso Moreover, we also determined that the expression of zzso increases zzso gene expression as well as its zzso activity in zzso cells, zzso by zzso zzso binding protein alpha zzso Finally, we showed that zzso expression is able to zzso the gene expressions of various zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

We showed that the increased zzso expression causes zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso by zzso regulatory element binding protein 1 and zzso which could be a putative molecular mechanism zzso the zzso of zzso zzso
