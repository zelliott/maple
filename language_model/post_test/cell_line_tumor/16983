zzso tumor cells zzso have gained increasing attention as physicians and scientists learn more about the role these extraordinarily rare cells play in zzso zzso In developing zzso technology, the critical criteria are high recovery rates and high zzso Current isolation methods suffer from an inherent zzso between these two zzso Moreover, ensuring minimal cell stress and robust zzso is also important for the clinical application of zzso In this paper, we introduce a novel zzso isolation technology using selective size amplification zzso for target cells and a zzso architecture zzso filter to overcome this zzso improving both recovery rate and zzso We also demonstrate zzso advantages in minimizing cell deformation during filter transit, resulting in more stable and robust zzso zzso In this technique, zzso zzso zzso with zzso cell zzso molecules zzso were used to selectively zzso zzso breast cancer cells, definitively zzso from the white blood cells zzso by avoiding the size overlap that compromises other size selection zzso 3 zzso was determined to be the optimal zzso diameter, not only for size discrimination but also in maximizing zzso surface zzso A zzso architecture filter was zzso using zzso zzso zzso first such application of this fabrication zzso create a precise zzso structure with a high aspect zzso The filter was designed to minimize cell deformation as simulation results predicted that cells captured via this zzso filter would experience zzso less moving force than with a zzso zzso This was verified by experiments, as we observed reliable cell capture and reduced cell zzso with a zzso average recovery rate and zzso peripheral blood zzso zzso per zzso zzso We expect the zzso platform to zzso zzso recovery rates, zzso and stability, increasing the sensitivity and reliability of such tests, thereby potentially expanding the zzso of zzso technologies in the zzso
