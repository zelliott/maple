To investigate the zzso effect of zzso on human prostate cancer cell line zzso in zzso observing its effects on the proliferation and zzso of zzso zzso 

The effects of zzso on the proliferation of zzso cells were observed by zzso zzso erosion trace test and zzso zzso zzso and their zzso detected by zzso zzso fluorescent zzso and flow zzso 

With the increasing concentration and exposure time, zzso exhibited an increased rate of zzso on zzso cells in a zzso and zzso manner zzso zzso zzso Compared with the controls, the migration distance of the zzso cells and the number of the zzso cells that invaded the inferior chamber were significantly decreased in the 100 zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso induced the zzso of zzso cells and, at 100 zzso significantly increased the percentage of zzso cells in the zzso phase but decreased it in the S phase as compared with the control group zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso the proliferation and zzso the zzso of zzso cells in zzso which, as a new therapeutic for prostate cancer, well deserves further zzso
