In breast cancer, gene expression analyses have defined five tumor zzso zzso A, zzso B, zzso zzso and zzso each of which has unique zzso and zzso zzso Here, we zzso characterize the recently identified zzso tumor zzso 

The clinical, pathological and biological features of zzso tumors were compared to the other tumor zzso using an updated human tumor database and multiple independent data zzso These main features of zzso tumors were also evaluated in a panel of breast cancer cell lines and genetically engineered mouse zzso 

zzso tumors are characterized by the low to absent expression of zzso differentiation zzso high enrichment for zzso transition zzso immune response genes and cancer stem zzso zzso zzso the majority of zzso tumors are poor prognosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso invasive zzso zzso with a high frequency of zzso and zzso zzso They also have a response rate to standard zzso chemotherapy that is intermediate between that of zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, we show that a group of highly zzso breast cancer cell lines, and several genetically engineered mouse models, express the zzso zzso Finally, we confirm that a zzso relevant differentiation hierarchy exists across all breast zzso in which the zzso zzso most closely resembles the zzso zzso stem zzso 

These results should help to improve our understanding of the zzso zzso of breast cancer and provide tools for the further evaluation of the unique biology of zzso tumors and cell zzso
