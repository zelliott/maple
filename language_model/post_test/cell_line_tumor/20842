zzso To explore the effects of human zzso inflammatory zzso beta zzso modification on the in zzso zzso and vaccine efficacy of tumor zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with a zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene zzso The efficacy of gene zzso was tested by zzso zzso The zzso level in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells was zzso by zzso and the zzso activity for zzso T cells, zzso T cells, zzso cells and immature zzso cells zzso were zzso by a zzso zzso The changes of growth characteristics and in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells were also zzso zzso mice were zzso with zzso zzso zzso tumor vaccine and the zzso effect was zzso 

zzso gene could be zzso into zzso cells by zzso with an efficiency over zzso The level of zzso in the culture zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells was zzso zzso and the zzso displayed zzso zzso activity to zzso T cells, zzso T cells, zzso cells and zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso When the zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso in zzso mice, the zzso was delayed and zzso and overt necrosis and zzso zzso were observed in the tumor zzso but not in those zzso with zzso zzso zzso cells or parental zzso zzso The mice zzso with zzso zzso zzso tumor vaccine could induce tumor specific zzso activity and zzso zzso activity, and exhibited resistance to later challenge with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso cells exhibit decreased zzso and zzso zzso tumor vaccine may induce a powerful specific and zzso zzso zzso The data suggested that zzso zzso tumor vaccine may play a potent role in prevention of zzso and recurrence of zzso zzso
