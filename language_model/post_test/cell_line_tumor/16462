zzso acid zzso regulates several gene programs by nuclear zzso receptors zzso that are zzso zzso zzso The basic mechanism for switching on zzso of zzso genes involves zzso binding at specific response elements and a network of interactions with zzso protein zzso In addition to these classical zzso effects, we recently demonstrated that zzso also zzso the rapid zzso of the zzso pathway, with characteristic downstream consequences on the zzso of zzso and the expression of their target zzso Here, we aimed at deciphering the underlying mechanism of the rapid zzso effects of zzso We highlighted a novel paradigm in which a fraction of the cellular zzso pool is present in membrane zzso zzso where it forms complexes with G protein alpha Q zzso in response to zzso This rapid zzso formation of zzso complexes in zzso zzso is required for the zzso of zzso that occurs in response to zzso zzso in zzso cancer cells, characterized by the absence of zzso zzso zzso present in membrane zzso zzso does not associate with zzso pointing out the essential contribution of zzso complexes in zzso zzso
