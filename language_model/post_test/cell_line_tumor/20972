Human zzso growth factor zzso zzso is thought to be involved in human zzso Its zzso has been reported in some human zzso However, its expression in zzso cancer has not been zzso We thus investigated the zzso and biological significance of zzso gene expression in human zzso zzso 

Using real-time reverse zzso we evaluated zzso expression status and correlated data with zzso parameters in 60 patients with zzso zzso Additionally, we established a zzso cancer cell line expressing zzso and investigated its effects on cell invasion and zzso 

The zzso of vascular invasion was significantly greater in patients expressing zzso at a high level than in those at a low level zzso zzso zzso Patients with high zzso expression had a significantly poorer survival rate than those with low zzso expression zzso zzso zzso A zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso expression was an independent zzso zzso We demonstrated in zzso that cells zzso with zzso showed greater zzso zzso zzso zzso and migration zzso zzso zzso than did mock zzso zzso In a zzso study, cells zzso with zzso had higher proliferation rates than mock zzso zzso 

zzso expression may be a new zzso indicator for patients with zzso zzso
