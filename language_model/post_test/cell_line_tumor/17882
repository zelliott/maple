We have previously demonstrated that zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso or zzso leads to the induction of drug resistance to platinum based drugs in human zzso zzso cervical and germ cell tumor cell zzso zzso belongs to a family of zzso zzso that are involved in the zzso of several zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso in particular have been shown to be involved in the zzso zzso of zzso aromatic zzso zzso Based on the involvement of zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso the effect of zzso on the production of zzso oxygen species zzso in a zzso and zzso human zzso zzso cell line was investigated in the current zzso In addition to the zzso of zzso and zzso increased expression of zzso was demonstrated in the zzso zzso cells, compared to the parental 2008 zzso However, as assessed by zzso neither cell line expressed zzso The zzso cells were zzso resistant to zzso and zzso experiments utilizing zzso 2008 cells suggest that this could be zzso by zzso of either zzso zzso or zzso The zzso cells had lower zzso zzso zzso level as compared to the 2008 cells and zzso production was decreased in the zzso 2008 cells with forced, zzso zzso of either, zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso against zzso or zzso in the zzso zzso cells not only significantly decreased their zzso index (as zzso by zzso and colony formation zzso but also led to an increase in the zzso levels of zzso production (although zzso of zzso against zzso resulted in cell zzso The zzso cells were found to be zzso to the zzso effects of hydrogen zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of either zzso or zzso expression zzso zzso resulted in zzso of the resistant cells to these zzso These results support the conclusion that the increased levels of zzso in the zzso cells are directly responsible for the reduced production of zzso and that this may play a role in the development of zzso zzso
