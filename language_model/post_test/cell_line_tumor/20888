A novel prostate cancer cell line zzso was isolated from an zzso independent zzso specific zzso zzso producing zzso cell zzso The zzso correlation between zzso and zzso was determined by short tandem repeat zzso The zzso promoter activity was detected by transient expression zzso in the zzso and zzso cells but not in zzso insensitive zzso zzso When the zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso reporter zzso cells, the reporter zzso indicated that nuclear zzso zzso 4 zzso but not zzso zzso zzso 24 zzso increased the sensitivity and maximum stimulation of zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso The zzso zzso revealed that the expression of several tumor zzso including zzso prostate stem cell zzso zzso prostate zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso was lower in the zzso cells than in the zzso zzso This cell model zzso the regulation of zzso expression and enabled comparison of the gene profile at different stages of zzso in zzso zzso
