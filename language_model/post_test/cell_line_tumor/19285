zzso zzso traits are caused by zzso selection pressures during zzso zzso can drive a tumor toward a more aggressive zzso zzso The objective was to better understand the role of the zzso genes in cervical zzso 

We analyzed the expression of the zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso IX zzso and zzso in cervical cell lines and human tissue samples of cervical zzso zzso zzso zzso and invasive zzso cell zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso were expressed in cervical zzso cell lines, but not in normal or human zzso cervical zzso In clinical tissue samples, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not detected in normal zzso zzso zzso was expressed in nearly all cases of zzso and zzso however, zzso was expressed only in zzso III and zzso zzso and zzso expression was confined to the zzso cells in normal zzso zzso and was detected in the zzso cells of zzso and zzso 

The role of zzso and zzso changes from response to proliferation to tumor progression during cervical zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso to zzso occurs early during cervical zzso and is a specific marker for zzso or zzso zzso and zzso may contribute tumor progression in later zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso may be a powerful zzso advantage during zzso zzso adaptation to the zzso sequence in a zzso is crucial during zzso
