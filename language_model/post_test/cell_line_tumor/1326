zzso zzso is caused by inherited zzso zzso zzso and, in many zzso it is associated with protein zzso The natural zzso of zzso zzso zzso can act as a pharmacological zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso However, zzso shows limited efficacy in some zzso zzso and its chemical synthesis is very zzso Taking an integrated drug discovery approach which has not been applied to this target before, we identified alternative PCs for the treatment of zzso zzso virtual screening of the National Cancer Institute's chemical library identified 84 candidate molecules with potential to bind to the active site of zzso An in zzso evaluation of these yielded six compounds that restored the zzso activity of the unstable zzso zzso and increased its stability in zzso zzso against zzso zzso During a zzso treatment study, two compounds zzso and zzso substantially improved the in zzso zzso zzso and blood zzso zzso of zzso mice zzso zzso zzso was twice as effective as zzso In conclusion, we identified two PCs with high in zzso efficacy that may be further developed into a more effective drug treatment of zzso
