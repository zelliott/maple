Common fragile sites zzso are zzso zzso regions that are prone to breakage under conditions of replication zzso DNA damage and zzso zzso at zzso appear to be critical events in the development of various human diseases, especially zzso Despite the growing interest in understanding the nature of zzso instability, only a few zzso have been zzso zzso In this study, we zzso the location of zzso using zzso zzso in zzso zzso and showed that it is one of the most active zzso in the human zzso zzso encompasses approximately zzso zzso of a zzso region containing a novel large zzso zzso zzso gene zzso Using zzso array comparative zzso zzso we detected gross and zzso zzso zzso involving zzso in a panel of 54 zzso colon and breast cancer cell zzso The zzso zzso frequently involved different classes of long terminal repeats and long zzso nuclear zzso An analysis of zzso junction sequence motifs predominantly revealed signatures of zzso zzso zzso zzso Our data provide insight into the molecular structure of zzso and sequence motifs affected by their zzso in zzso zzso zzso sequences will accelerate the search for DNA zzso and targets for zzso zzso
