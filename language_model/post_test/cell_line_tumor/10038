An effective cancer therapeutic must selectively target zzso with minimal systemic zzso zzso of a zzso protein using zzso zzso would enable spatial and zzso control of delivery because these bacteria zzso target zzso over normal zzso 

We engineered zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso under the control of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The response of the zzso promoter to radiation was measured using zzso and zzso TRAIL toxicity was determined using flow zzso and by measuring zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso model was used to determine bacterial zzso and the response to expressed zzso 

After zzso engineered zzso zzso zzso zzso which caused zzso zzso and death in zzso zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso injection of zzso and induction of TRAIL expression using 2 zzso zzso caused a significant delay in zzso zzso growth and reduced the risk of death by zzso when compared with zzso zzso zzso dosing with zzso zzso in conjunction with radiation improved the 30-day survival from 0 to zzso 

These results show the zzso utility of zzso zzso as a TRAIL expression zzso that effectively reduces zzso growth and extends host zzso
