To investigate the function of the zzso zzso one of the leading genes in the signature associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso selected by zzso zzso and especially its possible roles in invasion and zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso levels of zzso in 27 primary tumors and 23 matched zzso liver zzso from zzso patients, and four zzso cell lines with different zzso zzso were detected by zzso zzso and real-time zzso zzso expression zzso zzso of the zzso gene were constructed and zzso into zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso gene product and in zzso effects of zzso zzso on proliferation and invasion of zzso cell line were also zzso 

zzso levels of zzso in zzso zzso were statistically higher than those of paired zzso liver zzso zzso zzso zzso paired zzso zzso and in zzso with high zzso these were statistically higher than those with low zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the four zzso cell lines with an identical genetic background and zzso higher zzso zzso its expression was consistent with their zzso zzso The zzso gene product was concentrated on the nucleus and cell membrane of zzso cells, without any distribution in the zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso cell line resulted in increased cell zzso colony formation, and zzso 

zzso expression is associated with zzso of zzso zzso of zzso leads to a more invasive zzso of zzso cell zzso
