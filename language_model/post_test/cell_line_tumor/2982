To characterize the biological features of side population zzso in oral zzso cell zzso zzso SP and zzso were sorted and zzso The SP cells were more zzso and in nude mice, only 10,000 SP cells were needed for tumor development compared to zzso zzso zzso The SP cells expressed higher levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The SP cells generated SP and zzso zzso whereas the zzso cells generated only zzso These findings provide the first evidence that SP in zzso possesses tumor stem cell zzso and may play an important role in zzso zzso
