zzso an zzso zzso and zzso zzso chemotherapy have been widely used during lung cancer zzso However, the effect of zzso on the sensitivity of lung cancer cells to zzso chemotherapy remains zzso In this study, the effects of combined treatment with zzso and zzso on the growth and invasion of human lung zzso zzso cell line have been zzso The underlying mechanism has also been zzso In our experiment, zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso of zzso and zzso for zzso zzso Cell proliferation was evaluated by the zzso zzso and colony formation zzso zzso was assessed by flow zzso Cell invasion was detected by zzso zzso The expressions of zzso inhibitor of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined by western zzso Our results showed that zzso combined with zzso resulted in a more pronounced zzso of tumor cells growth and invasion as compared with either drug zzso Besides, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso more significantly by the zzso of the two drugs as compared to zzso treatment or zzso treatment zzso Taken together, the zzso and zzso zzso between zzso and zzso in human zzso zzso cell line was found in this zzso Furthermore, we showed that the zzso zzso between zzso and zzso might be associated with the zzso of zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso between zzso and zzso might be involved in the zzso of zzso and zzso
