Malignancies affecting the central nervous system are intractable to conventional therapies thereby requiring an alternative strategy, such as ultrasound zzso 

We originally designed a zzso for zzso zzso and investigated the effect of zzso zzso ultrasound on zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso zzso effectively disrupted the zzso zzso This effect was reinforced by the zzso agent, zzso The condition was applied to zzso animals and external zzso inhibited subcutaneous tumor zzso It also zzso the growth of zzso implanted tumors and prolonged survival of the zzso When zzso was zzso injected into the tumors, the effect of zzso was significantly zzso 

A zzso system or zzso device has been used commonly for patients with brain zzso Administration of combination therapy consisting of zzso and a local zzso agent will have a role in improving the treatment for zzso zzso
