To detect genes that are zzso in prostate cancer, a zzso zzso library was first constructed from the zzso cell line and subsequently screened by using zzso zzso zzso zzso genes were found to be zzso zzso in zzso Half of these genes were in zzso regions, which, using comparative zzso zzso we previously showed to be gained in zzso zzso the expression and copy number of selected genes were studied by quantitative zzso and zzso in zzso zzso in prostate cancer cell lines, zzso and clinical tumor specimens of benign prostate zzso and zzso as well as zzso prostate zzso Two genes from zzso region zzso and zzso increased expression in clinical prostate zzso and were also amplified in zzso of zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the expression of zzso was significantly zzso higher in tumors with the gene amplification than in those without zzso The data suggest that zzso and possibly zzso are putative target genes for the common amplification of zzso in prostate zzso
