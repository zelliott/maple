In both research and therapeutic applications of zzso zzso it is often advantageous to silence several targets zzso Toward this end, several groups have developed zzso that zzso the model of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso where a single zzso zzso II promoter can drive the expression of multiple interfering zzso zzso pol III promoters have been used to drive individual short hairpin zzso zzso but to date, it has been necessary to repeat the promoter in each zzso cassette to achieve zzso expression from a single zzso Here, we show that it is possible to drive zzso expression from a single pol III promoter when the interfering zzso are zzso to resemble zzso rather than zzso As many as four zzso designed to target zzso B virus zzso transcripts are shown to be processed and functional in reporter zzso as well as in the context of replicating virus in cell culture zzso Although it has been observed that high levels of expression of zzso can lead to zzso we find no significant evidence in transient zzso zzso that the zzso produced by our zzso compete for the activity of zzso produced zzso or for processing of an zzso expressed zzso
