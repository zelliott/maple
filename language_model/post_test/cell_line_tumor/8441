zzso are important biological zzso However, they have few convenient fluorescent zzso zzso currently reported, and their zzso reliability can be zzso We compared the association of two fluorescent cholesterol zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to serum zzso and to zzso HDL and zzso Both zzso could be zzso zzso by zzso but virtually not by zzso At zzso with zzso zzso did not zzso zzso The zzso characteristics of zzso by zzso were well distinguishable between HDL and LDL, regarding zzso associated probe amount and zzso zzso We took benefit of the zzso zzso to approach the structural organization of LDL peripheral zzso since zzso LDL, but not zzso presented a zzso zzso of zzso zzso indicating that the probe was present in an ordered zzso zzso Since the peripheral membrane of LDL contains more zzso zzso than zzso this zzso formation was consistent with the existence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in LDL, as already suggested in model zzso of similar composition and reminiscent to the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Finally, we showed that zzso could stain cultured zzso cells via zzso delivery, with a zzso pattern well different to that observed with zzso zzso delivered to the zzso
