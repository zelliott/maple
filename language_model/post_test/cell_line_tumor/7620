The expression of zzso A6 zzso in zzso zzso tumor cells has been shown to terminate zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and downstream zzso However, as a scaffolding zzso zzso may stabilize activated zzso receptors to promote cellular processes such as tumor cell zzso and zzso In this study, we investigated the contribution of zzso in the activity of zzso in invasive breast cancer cells and examined whether the expression status of zzso influences the response of these cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or patient zzso 

We demonstrate that in invasive zzso breast cancer cells zzso expression is required for sustained membrane zzso of activated zzso zzso and consequently, persistent zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in these cells was accompanied by rapid degradation of activated zzso attenuated downstream signaling and as expected enhanced zzso zzso Besides zzso of cell zzso and zzso zzso cells were also more sensitive to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso We also provide evidence suggesting that reduced zzso expression is associated with a better zzso survival but poorer distant zzso and overall survival of zzso breast cancer zzso 

Together this demonstrates that the rapid degradation of activated zzso in zzso invasive tumor cells zzso their sensitivity to zzso zzso and reduced zzso These data also suggest that zzso expression status may be useful for the prediction of the survival and likelihood of zzso breast cancer patients to respond to zzso zzso
