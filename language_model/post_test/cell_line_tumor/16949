Human zzso leukemia zzso cells exhibit many characteristics similar to leukemia stem cells, which are resistant to zzso drugs and zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso as a member of plant zzso has gained considerable attention due to its ability to prevent cancer from zzso In this study, the potential of zzso to sensitize zzso cells to zzso of zzso killer cells zzso through zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors were zzso Twenty-five zzso zzso was found to inhibit approximately 50% of zzso cell growth and had the least zzso effect on peripheral blood zzso cells zzso after 24 zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso to activate zzso we obtained substantial zzso zzso zzso zzso natural killer zzso T zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso and expressed zzso and TRAIL on their surfaces zzso zzso killer cells, zzso zzso was shown to render zzso cells susceptible to zzso zzso estimated by zzso zzso This heightened sensitivity correlated with an increase in zzso expression of zzso zzso and death zzso 4 zzso coupled with a zzso of zzso expression of decoy zzso 1 zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or TRAIL with zzso zzso could abrogate zzso zzso These results demonstrated that increased sensitivity of zzso cells, modulated by zzso to zzso zzso zzso is a phenomenon attributable to induced expression of zzso zzso and zzso of TRAIL zzso Thus, zzso combined with zzso zzso merits clinical evaluation as a novel and effective zzso strategy to eliminate residual leukemia stem zzso
