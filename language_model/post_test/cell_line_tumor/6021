We evaluated the zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso gene therapy on the growth of canine zzso zzso formed in nude zzso zzso mice were zzso transplanted with cells of 2 zzso zzso canine zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso The zzso zzso were injected with either an zzso zzso that expresses canine zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso growth was significantly inhibited in the zzso injected with zzso in comparison to those injected with zzso or PBS during the observation period of 27 zzso An increase of the amount of zzso zzso and the number of zzso cells was shown in the tumors injected with zzso in comparison to those injected with zzso or zzso The present study revealed that the zzso zzso zzso gene transfer had an zzso effect in canine zzso zzso formed in nude zzso
