zzso a differentiation zzso present in a series of zzso such as zzso zzso lung and pancreatic cancer, has been studied as a marker for diagnosis and a target for zzso zzso however, were interested in evaluating the effects of direct targeting of zzso on the viability of cancer cells as the first step towards developing a novel therapeutic zzso We report here that gene specific zzso for zzso by distinct methods zzso and zzso decreased viability of cancer cells from different origins such as zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso and zzso and pancreatic cancer zzso and zzso Additionally, the zzso of cancer cells was also significantly decreased upon such zzso We then investigated zzso signaling characteristics of cells upon zzso which revealed a significant decrease in zzso and zzso zzso The molecular mechanism of reduced zzso was connected to the reduced expression of zzso an important marker of zzso zzso zzso zzso a protein involved in clearing unfolded proteins and a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was also markedly zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso caused a significant increase in fraction of cancer cells in zzso In next step, treatment of zzso cancer cells zzso with a zzso expressing zzso zzso resulted in significant loss of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso we propose the zzso of zzso as a potential novel strategy for targeting human zzso
