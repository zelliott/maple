zzso is a zzso drug zzso in the chemotherapy of pancreatic zzso however, this drug zzso zzso and toxicity to normal tissue during zzso Here, we zzso report that zzso zzso alone not only has zzso cancer activity, but it also zzso the zzso activity of zzso Treatment with zzso alone zzso proliferation of the pancreatic cancer cell lines in a zzso and zzso manner in zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso cell cycle arrest and zzso of pancreatic cancer cells by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso and zzso and zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Additionally, zzso combined with zzso significantly induce stronger cell cycle arrest and more obvious zzso than each single zzso The zzso study demonstrates that this synergistic effect is also dependent on the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso which subsequently regulates the pathways involved in the zzso and cell cycle zzso Furthermore, both zzso alone and the combination treatments exhibit zzso zzso activity in zzso Overall, our results provide solid evidence supporting that zzso alone or its combination with zzso is a potential zzso approach for treating human pancreatic cancer in clinical zzso
