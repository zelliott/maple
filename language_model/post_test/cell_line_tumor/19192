zzso zzso and their respective receptors have been implicated in distant tumor cell zzso zzso melanoma has a distinct pattern of zzso zzso targeting the zzso of the small zzso However, the underlying zzso mechanism remains zzso zzso of zzso zzso to the small zzso is known to occur in response to the zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso are also known to be important zzso of cellular zzso We zzso that the mechanism of small zzso zzso by melanoma is via the zzso axis and specific zzso 

zzso reverse zzso flow zzso and zzso were used to assess melanoma tumors for zzso and zzso zzso expression was assessed using flow zzso zzso expression by quantitative reverse zzso was assessed in primary zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and melanoma lines derived from small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We showed zzso expression in 88 of 102 zzso zzso zzso from the small zzso 8 of 8 melanoma lines derived from zzso in the small zzso and 0 of 96 zzso zzso from other zzso In zzso migration and invasion studies done on zzso melanoma lines showed migration in response to zzso that was inhibited by zzso zzso or by short interfering zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis confirmed zzso expression by zzso to the small zzso and showed zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our findings show that functionally active zzso on melanoma cells zzso zzso to the small zzso The zzso axis may explain the high zzso of melanoma zzso to this specific zzso
