zzso zzso is immobilized on zzso zzso zzso with ozone zzso and the addition of an intermediate zzso zzso zzso zzso to promote the zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso has revealed that the zzso concentration can be controlled by adjusting the ozone treatment zzso The zzso of zzso is verified by zzso zzso The zzso zzso are in the effective order, as shown by means of high performance liquid zzso zzso and the zzso efficiency is proven to be relatively high compared with the previous zzso The culture of rat zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, demonstrates that the zzso of zzso can enhance the attachment and osteogenesis of zzso cells on zzso With the addition of zzso the cultured zzso cells express normal function in proliferation and zzso From in zzso experiments, zzso immobilized on the surface is shown to be zzso These results lead to the conclusion that the ozone treatment with the intermediate zzso zzso is an efficient, zzso and easily zzso procedure to modify zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso in significant amounts following the ozone zzso could further promote the zzso and the zzso of zzso
