To clarify whether zzso acid zzso activates the nuclear zzso of nuclear zzso zzso in pancreatic zzso 

zzso a human pancreatic cancer cell line, was used throughout the zzso The expression of zzso receptors was confirmed by zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso free calcium was measured by fluorescent calcium indicator zzso and the zzso of zzso was zzso by zzso method with or without various agents, which effect cell zzso 

zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso caused the zzso of zzso free calcium zzso zzso also caused the nuclear zzso of zzso zzso free calcium was attenuated by zzso toxin zzso and zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was similarly attenuated by zzso and zzso but zzso zzso an zzso of protein zzso C, alone did not zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso was completely blocked by zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso pump zzso also promoted the zzso of zzso zzso a protein zzso C zzso attenuated zzso of zzso induced by zzso 

These findings suggest that protein zzso C is activated zzso in zzso and protein zzso C is essential for zzso zzso with zzso calcium and that zzso zzso the nuclear zzso of zzso in zzso by zzso zzso free zzso
