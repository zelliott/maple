zzso mediates cell zzso and zzso outgrowth through a site associated with the peripheral zzso site zzso zzso zzso raised to this site block cell zzso We have raised zzso zzso to one of these zzso The zzso zzso recognized the zzso zzso and zzso mouse zzso but not zzso Five zzso (out of 143 zzso an zzso of zzso were able to promote zzso outgrowth in human zzso cells in zzso in a similar manner to zzso itself, suggesting that these zzso carry an internal image of the zzso zzso Two of the zzso were significantly more effective zzso zzso zzso than zzso in this zzso The zzso also bound specifically to mouse zzso and human collagen IV, as does zzso This binding was displaced by zzso zzso as well as by zzso itself, indicating competition with zzso We have also investigated the development of zzso zzso in mice in zzso and have observed that four of these (out of zzso zzso an zzso of zzso mimic the zzso zzso and abrogate zzso in zzso zzso We have thus demonstrated functional mimicry of the zzso site on zzso in zzso zzso enhancement of this activity in one zzso and mimicry of the zzso zzso site in zzso zzso zzso of these findings for zzso cancer therapy are zzso
