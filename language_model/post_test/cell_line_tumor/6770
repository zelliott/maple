zzso is involved in regulating T cell zzso Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain the zzso of T cell zzso In this context, the possible role of zzso in cell cycle regulation remains to be zzso Using zzso zzso zzso cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso of zzso we investigated the role of zzso in inducing zzso and in controlling the cell cycle of activated T zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited both zzso and zzso T cell zzso However, zzso did not induce T cell zzso as determined by zzso and zzso zzso zzso It induced zzso of the zzso zzso but not its zzso and active zzso Treatment of activated T cells with zzso also reduced the amounts of zzso zzso zzso A, and B by zzso In contrast, it induced an zzso of zzso but not zzso in activated T zzso zzso does not induce zzso of zzso T cells, but zzso zzso and zzso cell cycle zzso
