The zzso response element zzso zzso plays an important role in regulating cellular zzso including zzso zzso zzso Various zzso have been implicated in the pathways leading to zzso zzso Here, we investigated the effect of zzso zzso on zzso gene expression in human zzso zzso zzso time and dose zzso increased zzso zzso and protein expression but had minimal effect on expression of other zzso zzso including zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso knock down of zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso by zzso dose zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso had no significant zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and delta in zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso zzso had no significant zzso These results demonstrate for the first time that zzso zzso expression occurs via zzso and zzso
