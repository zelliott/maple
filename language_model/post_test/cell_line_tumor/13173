zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso that promotes zzso and zzso in numerous cell types and is zzso in a variety of human zzso We have demonstrated that zzso expression was zzso in both human prostate cancer specimens and prostate cancer cell zzso For a more direct assessment of the function of zzso in prostate zzso zzso zzso was used to selectively decrease zzso expression in zzso human prostate tumor zzso After three weeks of selection, colonies zzso zzso with zzso zzso (the zzso zzso cell line) or empty zzso (the control zzso cell line) were selected and expanded to investigate the role of zzso expression in zzso cell growth and zzso Cell proliferation rate was significantly slower zzso in the zzso zzso line after 6 days of growth as indicated by an zzso cell viability zzso zzso zzso zzso Similarly, a soft zzso colony formation zzso revealed significantly fewer zzso zzso zzso zzso cell colonies than control colonies after three weeks of zzso In addition, zzso zzso resulted in cell cycle arrest at zzso as indicated by zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso cell line also exhibited significantly reduced migration through zzso in a zzso zzso of invasive potential, and zzso of zzso could lead to increased sensitivity of these prostate cancer cells to a commonly used zzso drug, zzso Thus, zzso expression is crucial for zzso cell proliferation and invasion, and could be a promising new target for prostate cancer zzso
