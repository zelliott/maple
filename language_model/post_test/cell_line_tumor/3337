In the zzso human B zzso zzso cell line that quickly zzso zzso after DNA zzso I inhibitor zzso zzso treatment, we observed rapid and slight induction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, the expression levels of Bad and zzso zzso and zzso remained mostly unchanged after zzso zzso However, multiple zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso rapidly to the zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso of the zzso proteins assemble themselves into high molecular weight protein zzso The protein composition of these zzso was further analyzed by zzso experiments performed on highly zzso zzso zzso which revealed the formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso complexes after DNA damage zzso Thus, it appeared that zzso zzso zzso and assembly in zzso protein complexes of several zzso members of the zzso family correlated with the rapid zzso of zzso in a zzso zzso after zzso DNA strand zzso
