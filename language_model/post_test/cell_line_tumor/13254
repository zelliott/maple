zzso migration zzso factor zzso is involved in zzso by zzso tumor proliferation and evasion of zzso however, its role in tumor immunity is zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of zzso on the progression of the zzso zzso colon zzso and the generation of tumor regulatory T cells zzso The results showed that the tumor growth rate was significantly lower in zzso knockout zzso mice than in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of both zzso and tumor cells revealed that zzso mice had significantly lower levels of zzso zzso than zzso zzso The zzso cells of zzso mice also showed a decrease in zzso which was accompanied by an increase in zzso tumor zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso response in zzso cells to zzso plus zzso plus zzso was greater in zzso mice than in zzso zzso zzso cells of zzso mice, zzso with zzso produced lower levels of zzso but not zzso than those of zzso mice, which was recovered by the addition of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso production by zzso of zzso mice and suppressed the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the administration of zzso into zzso zzso mice restored the generation of zzso and tumor zzso Taken together, our data suggest that zzso promotes tumor growth by increasing zzso generation through the zzso of zzso zzso Thus, zzso treatment might be useful in enhancing the zzso immune response to colon zzso
