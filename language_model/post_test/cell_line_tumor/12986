zzso gastric zzso is characterized by rapid progression and poor zzso High expression of transforming growth factor zzso and thick zzso zzso are observed in this type of gastric zzso We have previously shown that disruption of zzso signaling via introduction of a dominant negative form of the zzso type II zzso zzso into zzso gastric cancer cell lines, including zzso caused accelerated tumor growth through induction of tumor zzso in zzso In the present study, we show that zzso zzso zzso of expression of tissue inhibitor of zzso 2 zzso in the zzso cell line in zzso and that expression of zzso is zzso by zzso expression in zzso zzso of the zzso cells to nude mice exhibited accelerated tumor growth in response to zzso zzso which was completely abolished when zzso was zzso with zzso Although the blood vessel density of zzso tumors was only slightly zzso the degree of zzso in tumor zzso was significantly increased and zzso covering tumor zzso were decreased by zzso expression in zzso cells, suggesting that the function of tumor zzso was zzso by zzso and consequently tumor growth was zzso These findings provide evidence that one of the mechanisms of the increase in zzso in zzso gastric zzso is the zzso of the zzso protein zzso
