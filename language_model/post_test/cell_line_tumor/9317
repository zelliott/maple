In this report, zzso was identified as a protein that interacts with zzso zzso is a zzso zzso virus and zzso zzso zzso Broad complex zzso zzso zzso which mediates interactions among several other zzso zzso In the present study, an interaction between zzso and zzso was detected in zzso cells and zzso zzso We found that the zzso domain is necessary and sufficient for interaction with zzso Surprisingly, only one of five zzso in the zzso domain that zzso zzso assembly zzso with zzso and zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso formation is not required for zzso zzso zzso demonstrated zzso interactions with both zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies show that zzso and zzso are physically bound zzso To further support the results, a direct interaction was demonstrated in zzso pull down zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso protein expression and resulted in reversal of zzso repression in zzso This interaction between zzso and zzso was not found for other zzso proteins zzso zzso interaction was demonstrated in zzso from rat brain zzso This is the first report to demonstrate that a zzso protein interacts with zzso Taken together, the results indicate that zzso may be part of the zzso zzso zzso
