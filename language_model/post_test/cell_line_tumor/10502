We have zzso zzso and tested zzso of chemically modified zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso peptides that selectively bind to the zzso zzso The cellular zzso zzso distribution, and pharmacological effects of the zzso zzso compared to those of zzso controls were examined using a zzso reporter cassette zzso zzso into zzso positive zzso human melanoma zzso The zzso cells exhibited zzso zzso of zzso zzso but not of zzso control zzso The zzso zzso zzso were taken up by a zzso zzso route and primarily accumulated in zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were taken up by zzso cells to approximately the same zzso However, there were notable differences in their pharmacological zzso The zzso and zzso versions produced progressive, zzso reductions in the level of zzso zzso while the zzso version had little zzso The basis for this divergence of zzso and effect is currently zzso Nonetheless, the high selectivity and substantial zzso zzso effects of the zzso zzso zzso suggest that this targeting and delivery strategy deserves further zzso
