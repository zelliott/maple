zzso analyses have revealed that some newly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into and along zzso zzso by moving along the inner plasma membrane surface, suggesting that they may zzso against the zzso zzso zzso We therefore examined whether or not zzso zzso transport was dependent on zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells with zzso B inhibited zzso of zzso into zzso zzso and inhibited zzso zzso of zzso zzso within zzso zzso injection of zzso B inhibited zzso zzso transport in zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso from zzso cells by an zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso in zzso zzso The zzso light chain zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso within zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that some zzso zzso may undergo zzso transport via zzso interactions with the zzso zzso
