Gene therapy is an important means for the comprehensive treatment of pancreatic zzso Challenges associated with gene therapy include control of zzso security and effective genetic zzso In this paper, a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The reporter gene zzso demonstrated that the viral zzso was confirmed to have zzso replication zzso In zzso zzso studies showed that the zzso promoter regulated the proliferation of the zzso zzso carrying the zzso gene zzso which significantly increased the expression levels of zzso in the zzso pancreatic cancer cells, resulting in an overall reduction in the survival of cancer zzso In the human pancreatic cancer zzso zzso model in immune deficient nude mice, the zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited tumor zzso In the rat pancreatic cancer zzso zzso model in rats, the viral proliferation and high expression levels of zzso promoted the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso T cells into tumors, induced host zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and had a dual zzso effects that completely inhibited the growth of pancreatic zzso The results demonstrated that the zzso zzso under the control of zzso promoter provides additional assurances regarding the safety and efficiency of cancer gene zzso This gene therapy model improves zzso efficiency and has broad applications and zzso zzso
