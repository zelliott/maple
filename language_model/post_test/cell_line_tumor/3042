The zzso (R zzso protein plays an essential role in the zzso viral zzso zzso zzso zzso activates viral gene expression by several mechanisms including direct and indirect binding to target viral zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and stimulation of cellular signaling zzso We previously found that zzso proteins with zzso zzso of 30 zzso were markedly enhanced in their capacity to bind DNA zzso zzso Chang, zzso zzso zzso and Miller, zzso zzso zzso variation in response of consensus binding elements for the zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we show that two zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso of zzso play a crucial role in zzso this DNA binding zzso zzso zzso acids 555 to zzso of zzso constitute a functional DNA binding zzso sequence zzso that markedly decreased DNA binding when transferred to a minimal DNA binding domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso substitution zzso zzso abolished activity of the zzso zzso and zzso are located in the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso by zzso zzso whereas aromatic zzso such as zzso or zzso partially restored zzso zzso zzso zzso protein with zzso zzso were enhanced in DNA binding compared to zzso whereas zzso proteins with zzso or zzso zzso were, like zzso zzso relatively poor DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion proteins with zzso zzso were diminished in zzso zzso relative to zzso zzso without such zzso The results suggest that, in the context of a larger zzso zzso and zzso play a role in the zzso regulation of DNA binding and zzso zzso by zzso zzso of DNA binding by zzso is likely to be important in controlling its different modes of zzso
