Both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was loaded in different form in a targeted zzso in order to achieve the active delivery of these two drugs followed by zzso suppressing tumor zzso and tumor zzso 

zzso stealth zzso loaded with zzso and zzso zzso were prepared and zzso Then in zzso release, cellular zzso in zzso zzso effect, zzso in zzso sequential killing effect, in zzso zzso efficacy against zzso zzso zzso positive cells, as well as the action mechanism of such system, were zzso 

A rapid release of zzso followed by a slow release of zzso was observed in zzso The active targeted zzso zzso showed a specific cellular zzso through zzso interaction and a higher zzso effect in zzso against zzso cell zzso The in zzso sequential killing effect of such system was found as evidenced by the fast zzso of blood vessels and slow zzso of tumor zzso zzso also exhibited the strongest zzso effect in zzso subcutaneous zzso zzso 

zzso zzso system may have great potential as an effective carrier for cancer zzso
