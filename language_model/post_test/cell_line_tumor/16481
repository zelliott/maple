zzso zzso protein zzso contains a nuclear zzso signal zzso sequence within zzso zzso sequences are generally capable of penetrating cellular zzso due to a richness of basic zzso acid zzso and thus have been used as zzso peptides zzso to zzso biologically active zzso into zzso The zzso sequence of zzso is not exception to this zzso however, zzso contains 2 zzso zzso zzso at 99 and 101 within the basic zzso acid stretch, which is not commonly observed in other zzso such as zzso zzso In this study, we indicated zzso relationship of the zzso zzso to understand the effect of zzso zzso zzso on cell zzso and zzso zzso We chemically zzso zzso and its zzso truncated zzso Their zzso zzso pattern was analyzed by zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso Although all zzso were zzso into cells, zzso by the zzso and/or nucleus was zzso specifically, zzso zzso and zzso were more frequently localized in the zzso We assume that reduction in the net positive charge within zzso zzso zzso resulted in increased zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso is a useful carrier zzso for delivery and expression of cargo molecules in the zzso
