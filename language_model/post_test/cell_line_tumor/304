zzso zzso zzso are a family of structural and functional related zzso They play a crucial role in tumor invasion and building of zzso zzso because of their ability to degrade zzso zzso zzso Under zzso conditions their activity is precisely regulated in order to prevent tissue zzso This zzso balance seems to be disrupted in cancer making tumor cells capable of invading the zzso In breast cancer different expression levels of several zzso have been zzso 

To fill the gap in our knowledge about zzso expression in breast cancer, we analyzed the expression of all known human zzso in a panel of zzso tissue samples (five normal breast zzso ten grade 2 zzso and ten grade 3 zzso breast cancer zzso As we found different expression levels for several zzso in normal breast and breast cancer tissue as well as depending on tumor grade, we additionally analyzed the expression of zzso in four breast cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso 20, zzso zzso commonly used in zzso The results could thus be used as model for further studies on human breast zzso zzso analysis was performed on zzso and protein level using zzso zzso Western zzso zzso and zzso 

In zzso we identified several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with a stronger expression in breast cancer tissue compared to normal breast zzso Of those, expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso is related to tumor grade since it is higher in analyzed zzso compared to zzso tissue zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso zzso showed a weaker expression in tumor samples compared to healthy zzso In addition, we demonstrated that the four breast cancer cell lines zzso are zzso expressing a wide variety of zzso Of those, zzso showed the strongest zzso and protein expression for most of the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso might thus be associated with breast cancer development and tumor zzso zzso these zzso are proper candidates for further functional analysis of their role in breast zzso
