zzso implants are prone to bacterial colonization which may result in bone destruction and implant zzso zzso of zzso disease aim to reduce bacterial adherence while leaving the implant surface intact for attachment of zzso host zzso The aims of this study were to investigate the zzso efficacy of gaseous ozone on bacteria zzso to various titanium and zzso surfaces and to evaluate zzso of zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso titanium zzso and zzso and zzso zzso etched and zzso disks served as zzso for the adherence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The test specimens were treated with gaseous ozone zzso zzso 33 zzso for 6 and 24 zzso zzso were zzso using zzso serially diluted and zzso zzso cell zzso was analyzed with reference to cell attachment, zzso zzso and zzso Surface topography as well as cell zzso of the test specimens were inspected by zzso The highest bacterial adherence was found on titanium zzso whereas the other surfaces revealed zzso less adherent zzso zzso zzso was eliminated by ozone from all surfaces within 24 s to below the detection limit zzso zzso zzso zzso was more resistant and showed the highest reduction on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment did not affect the surface structures of the test specimens and did not influence zzso cell zzso and proliferation zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso etched and zzso had a lower colonization potential and may be suitable material for implant zzso zzso ozone showed selective efficacy to reduce adherent bacteria on titanium and zzso without affecting zzso and proliferation of zzso zzso This in zzso study may provide a solid basis for clinical studies on gaseous ozone treatment of zzso and revealed an essential base for sufficient tissue zzso
