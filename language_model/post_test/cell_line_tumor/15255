zzso zzso 2 zzso is involved in various cellular events such as zzso zzso and the cell zzso zzso zzso is associated with multiple human zzso and may therefore be a promising target for cancer zzso To identity novel classes of zzso for zzso we screened a natural product library obtained from National Cancer zzso 

The quantitative zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to screen zzso zzso from the natural product zzso The same zzso was used to determine zzso zzso response of zzso zzso and conduct a kinetic zzso zzso was performed to predict the binding patterns of selected zzso zzso Western zzso analysis was used to evaluate zzso zzso specific to zzso and zzso zzso The cell viability zzso zzso was used to evaluate the zzso effects of zzso zzso on cancer zzso 

We identified zzso as a novel zzso zzso competitive zzso inhibitor with an zzso value of zzso zzso zzso is a zzso compound that belongs to the class of zzso natural compounds that mimic the biological activity of zzso In our study, zzso showed high selectivity among 13 zzso The hydrogen bonds formed between zzso and the zzso acids in the zzso binding site were first reviewed by a molecular zzso study that suggested a possible interaction of zzso with the hinge region of zzso site of zzso In addition, zzso inhibited cancer cell growth partially through zzso of zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso exerted strong zzso effects on the growth of three cancer cell zzso 

Our study shows that zzso a novel zzso competitive and cell permeable zzso inhibitor with zzso zzso had zzso effects on the growth of three cancer cell lines and may represent a promising class of zzso zzso
