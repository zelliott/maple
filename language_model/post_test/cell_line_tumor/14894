Surgery is one of the most effective and widely used procedures in treating human zzso but a major problem is that the surgeon often fails to remove the entire zzso leaving behind zzso margins, zzso zzso zzso and/or satellite tumor zzso Here we report the use of a hand-held zzso pen device zzso zzso and zzso contrast agents for zzso detection of zzso tumors, based on zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso scattering zzso zzso The zzso zzso a zzso zzso laser zzso at zzso zzso coupled to a compact head unit for light zzso and zzso This zzso device effectively removes zzso zzso zzso from the fiber zzso and zzso the reflected zzso light, allowing sensitive analysis of both zzso and zzso zzso Its overall performance has been evaluated by using a fluorescent contrast agent zzso green, or zzso as well as a zzso zzso scattering zzso contrast agent zzso zzso zzso Under in zzso conditions, the detection limits are approximately zzso zzso zzso M for the zzso dye and zzso zzso zzso M for the zzso contrast zzso zzso zzso tissue penetration data show attenuated but resolvable zzso and zzso signals when the contrast agents are buried zzso zzso deep in fresh animal zzso In zzso studies using mice bearing zzso zzso breast tumors further demonstrate that the tumor borders can be precisely detected preoperatively and zzso and that the contrast signals are strongly correlated with tumor zzso After surgery, the zzso device permits further evaluation of both positive and negative tumor margins around the surgical zzso raising new possibilities for real-time tumor detection and zzso zzso
