The zzso zzso zzso has been characterized as a tumor zzso in human prostate zzso zzso zzso of this cell surface zzso protein in prostate cancer cell lines has been shown to increase the frequency of zzso and zzso reduce the rate of cellular zzso Since it is difficult to maintain a therapeutic level of this membrane zzso protein by systemic administration in the blood, we zzso an alternative gene therapy strategy based upon zzso injection into zzso of zzso prostate tumor cells of a zzso containing the zzso zzso Administration of the zzso gene into subcutaneous zzso zzso suppressed in a zzso manner the growth of zzso Within the gene zzso tumors, zzso of the zzso gene product was associated with increased zzso and reduced proliferation of tumor zzso These results suggest that the zzso may be a suitable candidate for gene therapy of prostate cancer zzso
