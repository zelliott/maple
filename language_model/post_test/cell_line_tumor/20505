zzso cancer is one of the leading causes of zzso mortality in the world, and zzso growth is a crucial characteristic in gastric zzso In our previous study, we found that growth zzso gene 1 zzso suppression was involved in making gastric cancer cells zzso by protecting them from drug-induced zzso In the present study, we investigated the potential role of zzso in the growth and proliferation of gastric zzso We demonstrated that zzso expression was decreased in gastric cancer, and patients without zzso expression showed shorter survival times than those with zzso zzso Both zzso (by zzso of zzso and zzso (by zzso small interfering zzso zzso studies showed that increased zzso expression significantly reduced the zzso ability of gastric cancer cells in zzso and reduced cell growth in zzso whereas decreased zzso expression had the opposite zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso induced cell zzso and zzso of zzso inhibited zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that zzso could induce gastric cancer cell zzso at least in part through modulating the zzso ratio and the activity of zzso Taken together, our results strongly indicate that zzso expression was decreased in gastric cancer and was zzso of a poor zzso Restoration of zzso expression inhibited cell growth and promoted zzso of gastric cancer cells, at least in part through modulating the zzso ratio and zzso zzso suggesting that zzso might be used as a novel therapeutic candidate for gastric zzso
