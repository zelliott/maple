Ras gene is frequently zzso and also associated with increased Ras expression and its zzso activity zzso in pancreatic cancer zzso which could in part be due to zzso expression of zzso zzso contributing to tumor zzso Here we report, for the first time, that Ras expression and its activity were significantly higher in zzso cells compared to zzso and zzso cell lines, which was correlated with loss of zzso family and zzso expression in zzso cells compared to zzso and zzso zzso Whereas the expression of zzso a frequently zzso zzso in solid tumors was zzso in zzso cells and it was correlated with increased Ras expression and its zzso The zzso zzso and zzso was found to target zzso and forced zzso of zzso and zzso inhibited Ras activity, cell proliferation and colony formation in zzso We also found that the treatment of cells in zzso or treatment of zzso induced tumors in zzso with zzso a novel synthetic analog of zzso led to the zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso which was consistent with zzso of Ras expression and its zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso zzso resulted in decreased tumor growth and Ras zzso These results suggest that the loss of expression of zzso and zzso and increased expression of zzso leads to increased expression of Ras and its zzso activity, which could be attenuated by zzso treatment and, thus zzso could become a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of zzso
