zzso zzso protein 1 zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso mechanism occurs mainly through the competition of target zzso promoter zzso binding sites by zzso The promoter binding proteins switch between zzso and zzso affects cell proliferation and zzso However, little is known about zzso regulation process in cancer zzso Here, we present evidence that zzso zzso zzso zzso repression by physical interaction with and zzso of zzso zzso reduces the binding affinity between zzso and its target zzso promoter and thereby zzso its zzso suppression zzso zzso of the zzso site from zzso to zzso zzso the zzso ability in the presence of activated zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso target genes zzso and zzso zzso repression and promotes cell cycle and cell zzso However, zzso zzso zzso abrogates the zzso by zzso Thus, our results suggest that zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso suppression and subsequently activates the zzso of zzso target zzso
