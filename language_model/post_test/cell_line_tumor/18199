We have developed new, simple, and efficient procedures for the synthesis of two promising zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso from commercially available zzso acid and zzso zzso The procedures provide zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso overall yields, zzso We found that the combination of four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso acid zzso or zzso acid zzso or our zzso zzso acid metabolism blocking agents zzso 1 zzso or 2 zzso produced synergistic zzso activity on human zzso prostate cancer zzso The combination of 2 and zzso induced zzso and zzso cell cycle arrest and a decrease in the S phase in zzso zzso zzso treatment effectively zzso zzso D1 and zzso and zzso zzso markers zzso zzso and zzso Bad and zzso Following subcutaneous administration, 2, zzso or zzso were well tolerated and caused significant zzso of tumor growth compared with zzso These results demonstrate that compound 2 and its combination with zzso are potentially useful agents that warrant further zzso development for treatment of prostate zzso
