zzso maintenance of zzso 4 zzso is associated with zzso The present study aimed at detecting zzso expression in primary liver cancer and its association with zzso patient zzso A total of zzso liver cancer zzso and 6 liver cell lines were assessed for expression of zzso zzso and protein with zzso western zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were constructed to zzso zzso zzso and zzso changes of zzso zzso zzso cells were analyzed using flow zzso and cell viability zzso The data showed that zzso zzso and protein were highly expressed in zzso zzso compared to the normal zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso 72 zzso zzso primary liver cancer zzso displayed strong zzso zzso of zzso zzso whereas only 6 zzso normal liver zzso showed zzso of zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso expression was significantly associated with tumor size, zzso advanced stages and vascular invasion of the primary liver zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso expression reduced zzso cell zzso These data demonstrated that expression of zzso protein may be useful for the early detection and prediction of primary liver cancer zzso
