One of the recent breakthroughs in cancer research is the identification of zzso zzso in various zzso zzso zzso pathways in many zzso including zzso zzso We zzso that, alternative to zzso zzso of various zzso zzso may also zzso zzso zzso and different zzso may couple with distinct downstream signaling pathways in different zzso of human zzso By zzso we show here that zzso members zzso zzso and zzso were in deed zzso zzso in zzso cancer patient samples leading to zzso zzso of zzso signaling zzso Using zzso specific inhibitor zzso and zzso specific inhibitor zzso we further demonstrated that this zzso zzso of zzso signaling is necessary for the survival of zzso cancer zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso zzso pattern dictates the use of downstream zzso and/or zzso zzso Our data are important additions to current zzso zzso models, and further explain the clinical variation in therapeutic responses of zzso zzso Our findings advocate for more personalized therapy tailored to individual patients based on their type of zzso expression in addition to their zzso zzso
