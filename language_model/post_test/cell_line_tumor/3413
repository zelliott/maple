The zzso zzso factor is a central component of signal zzso pathways in many cells, although the exact role of zzso in controlling cell growth and zzso transformation is zzso We have previously shown that zzso complexes are activated by zzso and steroid growth factors in both normal and zzso breast cells, and that blocking zzso by zzso a zzso form of zzso zzso zzso zzso breast cancer cell growth both in zzso and in zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso cell growth by altering the expression of cell cycle regulatory zzso thus causing a cell cycle zzso In the present study, we used clones of zzso breast cancer cells that express zzso under the control of an zzso zzso First, we determined the effect of zzso blockade on cell growth, then we performed zzso incorporation and flow zzso zzso to investigate whether zzso zzso the cell zzso We observed that in the presence of serum zzso inhibited cell growth and caused a block in the zzso phase of the cell zzso Next, we performed zzso and zzso zzso zzso to determine the effects of zzso on zzso zzso zzso the expression of cell cycle regulatory zzso and zzso zzso We discovered that zzso inhibited zzso zzso and reduced zzso zzso We also found that zzso decreased the expression of D and E zzso reduced zzso and zzso activity, and increased the zzso inhibitor zzso The studies of gene expression at the zzso level showed that zzso decreased zzso Ds zzso zzso Our study suggests that in the presence of serum, zzso zzso breast cancer growth predominantly by inducing zzso of zzso zzso (such as zzso and by reducing the expression of the zzso involved in transitioning from zzso into S phase of the cell zzso These studies lay the foundation for future attempt to develop new agents for the treatment and prevention of breast zzso
