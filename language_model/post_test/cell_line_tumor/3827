The zzso zzso current (I zzso is abundantly expressed in zzso zzso cells, where it controls cell volume and invasive zzso The zzso zzso zzso I zzso zzso in zzso cells is, however, poorly zzso By means of pharmacological and zzso approaches, on zzso human zzso cells we found that I zzso zzso by zzso swelling required the activity of a zzso zzso C zzso I zzso zzso could also be induced by the zzso zzso zzso analog zzso In contrast, neither calcium zzso zzso by zzso nor changes in zzso activity were able to affect I zzso zzso by zzso zzso We further found that zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso reverted I zzso zzso suggesting the involvement of zzso zzso In addition, I zzso zzso required the activity of a zzso zzso small zzso and the resulting zzso zzso as I zzso zzso was prevented by zzso zzso We finally show that I zzso can be activated by the zzso fetal calf serum in a zzso and zzso zzso This observation is potentially relevant because blood serum can likely come in contact with zzso cells in zzso as a result of the zzso partial breakdown of the zzso zzso Given the relevance of I zzso in zzso cell volume regulation and zzso the several key signaling molecules found in this study to be involved in the zzso of the I zzso may represent potential therapeutic targets against this lethal zzso
