zzso diseases are neurodegenerative diseases associated with the zzso of a zzso zzso of the zzso prion zzso The cellular responses to prion infection are not well zzso By performing zzso analysis on cultured zzso cells infected with prion strain zzso in the group of zzso genes we observed predominantly genes of the cholesterol zzso Increased transcript levels of at least nine zzso involved in cholesterol zzso including the gene for the zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso of zzso genes was attributable to a zzso increase in the amount and activity of the zzso regulatory zzso protein zzso resulting in elevated levels of total and free cellular zzso The zzso of cholesterol zzso appeared to be a characteristic response of zzso to prion challenge, as zzso transcripts were also elevated in persistently infected zzso cells and zzso primary zzso zzso but not in zzso cells and primary zzso These results convincingly demonstrate that prion propagation not only depends on the availability of cholesterol but that zzso cells themselves respond to zzso with specific zzso of cholesterol zzso
