zzso factor zzso zzso and zzso are zzso factors responsible for the cellular response to zzso The functional roles of zzso and zzso in cancer are distinct and vary among different tumor zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in breast zzso To this end, immortalized human zzso and zzso breast cancer cells carrying zzso active zzso or zzso zzso were analyzed with respect to their zzso zzso and ability to promote tumor growth in an in zzso zzso We observed that zzso of zzso but not zzso in zzso cells promotes a shift toward zzso zzso with increased zzso production and a loss of zzso zzso In a zzso model, zzso zzso promoted the tumor growth of zzso zzso cells without an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells did not favor tumor growth and behaved as the empty zzso zzso Similarly, zzso of zzso but not zzso in zzso cells promoted a shift toward zzso zzso with increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso in cancer cells increased the expression of zzso Ras and zzso zzso which are known markers of tumor growth and cell cycle zzso In a zzso model, zzso zzso in zzso cells acted as a tumor zzso resulting in an almost zzso reduction in tumor mass and zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso in zzso cells induced a significant zzso in tumor mass and zzso Analysis of zzso activity in these tumor zzso using zzso zzso C zzso zzso demonstrated elevated zzso zzso metabolism zzso in zzso We conclude that the zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso are zzso zzso acts as a tumor promoter in zzso cells but as a tumor zzso in cancer zzso zzso zzso is a tumor promoter in cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells supports cancer cell growth via the zzso production of nutrients (such as zzso that can zzso cancer zzso However, zzso zzso zzso in cancer cells zzso tumor zzso Finally, zzso zzso in cancer cells zzso the expression of known zzso molecules and promotes the zzso activity of cancer zzso
