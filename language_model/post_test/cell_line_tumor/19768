The Ras inhibitor zzso acid zzso has been shown to induce zzso in zzso zzso but its mechanism of action was zzso We show that zzso or zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso decreases zzso gene transcripts in zzso zzso zzso leading to disappearance of zzso protein and cell zzso zzso affected both zzso regulators of zzso zzso and zzso survival zzso Thus, Ras zzso by zzso resulted in release of the zzso zzso on zzso and in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso release of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells was strongly attenuated by forced expression of zzso or by zzso zzso These results show that resistance to zzso in zzso zzso can be abolished by a single Ras zzso which targets both zzso a critical inhibitor of zzso and the intrinsic zzso zzso zzso
