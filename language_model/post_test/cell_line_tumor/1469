It is still a great challenge to apply therapeutic concentration of zzso drugs to the tumor site with low system zzso An in zzso administration strategy was applied to reverse the zzso zzso of tumor in zzso for the first zzso Controlled release of therapeutic concentration of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso mats covering the solid tumor locally was designed to suppress the cervical zzso in zzso A dramatic decrease in the volume and weight of tumors was observed for 19 days in zzso mice, and a totally zzso of the tumor suppression degree was obtained even the initial tumor volume was around 200 zzso Half of the mice recovered in less than 3 zzso zzso was examined rather than zzso on the tumor cells as the main process of cell death induced by the zzso zzso zzso A proposed zzso mechanism was presented to explain the signal pathways that were induced by the zzso zzso of zzso It provided support for this strategy that target the zzso metabolism of the cervical zzso locally is a quick and effective zzso to cure the zzso of zzso
