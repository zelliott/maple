zzso zzso for cell manipulation has focused, for the most part, on approaches for zzso of cells of zzso zzso in cell positioning and zzso onto zzso for cell culture, either as single cells or as cell zzso has benefited from the intensified research efforts in zzso zzso zzso However, there has yet to be a zzso approach that provides the conditions for cell manipulation while promoting cell function processes such as cell zzso Here we present the first demonstration of a system that combines zzso with a hybrid cell adhesive material zzso to allow for cell zzso and cell function, as demonstrated by cell differentiation into zzso cells zzso The zzso comprised of zzso and zzso was engineered to function as an instantaneous cell adhesive surface after zzso manipulation and to support long-term cell function zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso cells flowing within a zzso were attracted to the zzso zzso surface and remained zzso onto the zzso coating under a fluid flow field after the zzso forces were zzso zzso remained viable after zzso manipulation for up to 8 zzso during which time the zzso cells were induced to differentiate into zzso This approach could have further applications in areas such as zzso communication, three-dimensional cell zzso to create cell zzso and cell zzso
