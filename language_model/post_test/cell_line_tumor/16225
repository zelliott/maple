The major obstacle in cancer treatment is the resistance of cancer cells to zzso zzso is a zzso factor that regulates a cellular defense response and is zzso expressed at low zzso levels in normal zzso due to zzso zzso and zzso zzso Recently, zzso has emerged as an important contributor to zzso High zzso expression of zzso was found in many types of zzso creating an environment conducive for cancer cell zzso Here, we report the identification of zzso as a unique inhibitor of the zzso zzso that zzso a broad spectrum of cancer cells and zzso zzso to zzso and other zzso zzso zzso zzso selectively reduces the protein level of zzso through enhanced zzso and degradation of zzso zzso expression of zzso genes is reduced and the zzso protective response is zzso In zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced zzso reduced cell zzso and inhibited tumor growth more substantially when compared with zzso treatment zzso Additionally, zzso zzso in which zzso is expressed at very low levels due to zzso expression of zzso do not respond to zzso treatment, demonstrating that zzso zzso to zzso is zzso zzso Moreover, a decrease in drug zzso and impairment in drug removal may be the primary mechanisms by which zzso enhances the efficacy of zzso zzso Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of using zzso to combat zzso and suggest that zzso can be developed into an zzso zzso zzso
