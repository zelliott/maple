The zzso zzso factor zzso signaling zzso is known as the main zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso is zzso in clear zzso cell zzso zzso with correlation to two major zzso factors: zzso stage and nuclear zzso zzso We questioned whether there is a direct link between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso Interestingly, we observed zzso increase of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso group versus zzso zzso zzso Using different zzso cell models and small interfering zzso zzso targeting either zzso or zzso a zzso zzso zzso we showed induction of zzso expression under zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a direct binding of zzso at the zzso zzso In addition, combined zzso zzso and gel shift zzso allowed the identification of two functional putative zzso responsive elements at zzso and at zzso in the zzso Using a rat kidney model of zzso we confirmed in zzso that clamping zzso zzso for 1 hour followed by 2 hours of zzso induced increased zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso induced significant reduction of invasive and migration properties of zzso cancer cells under zzso Altogether, these results show that zzso is directly regulated by zzso and affects the invasive and migration properties of zzso cancer zzso Thus, zzso could serve as a potential therapeutic target in zzso
