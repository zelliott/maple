The zzso of pre-existing genes has long been thought of as the major mode of new gene zzso Recently, de zzso gene birth from zzso DNA was found to be an alternative mechanism to generate novel zzso zzso However, its functional role in human disease remains largely zzso Here we show that zzso a zzso gene of the zzso zzso initially thought to be a large zzso zzso encodes a de zzso evolved protein regulating the zzso of human zzso particularly zzso The zzso gene is zzso zzso only in the zzso group containing humans and zzso In primary human zzso zzso is zzso zzso and zzso with zzso and zzso zzso expression is associated with poor clinical zzso zzso directly zzso both zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso protein by zzso the activity of zzso a zzso that promotes zzso zzso In contrast to zzso transgenic mice, zzso in zzso double transgenic mice were frequently accompanied by distant zzso behavior reminiscent of human zzso with zzso zzso The zzso protein also interacts with zzso thereby stabilizing the zzso protein in the tumors of the zzso double transgenic zzso Thus, these results suggest that zzso zzso by zzso zzso the zzso protein both in zzso and in zzso Furthermore, the survival of zzso transgenic mice bearing zzso was improved by treatment with zzso a dual zzso inhibitor shown to destabilize zzso via zzso zzso In contrast, tumors caused in zzso double transgenic mice showed zzso to the zzso zzso our results show that zzso is the first de zzso evolved protein known to act as an zzso factor in human cancer, and suggest that de zzso evolved proteins may functionally characterize human zzso
