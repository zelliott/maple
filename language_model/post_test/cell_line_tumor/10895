This article addresses and investigates the dual incorporation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso for better zzso These drugs are potential candidates for interaction due to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso groups on DR and zzso zzso zzso between the two drugs in solution were monitored by zzso and zzso zzso zzso between the two drugs inside the zzso was evaluated by zzso (for zzso and by zzso zzso (for zzso after zzso zzso zzso Our results provide evidence for the lack of interaction between the two drugs in solution and in zzso The zzso efficiencies of zzso in the neutral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso single and double drug zzso were found to be zzso and zzso (on average), zzso The zzso efficiencies of DR in the neutral and zzso double drug zzso were found to be zzso and zzso zzso The corresponding zzso of zzso in the single drug zzso was found to be zzso on zzso Our thin layer zzso (TLC) and transmission electron zzso zzso results suggest stability of zzso and zzso thus pointing plausible existence of double drug zzso zzso experiments were performed by using both single drug and double drug zzso By comparing the results of phase contrast and zzso zzso it was observed that the double drug zzso were zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso resistant cell line) leukemia cells as viewed by the zzso of zzso The zzso was dose dependent and had shown a synergistic effect when double drug zzso was zzso
