For repair of damaged DNA, cells increase de zzso synthesis of zzso zzso through the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study we investigated whether pharmacological zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso sensitivity through a mechanism involving sustained DNA zzso zzso zzso by zzso and resulting zzso were evaluated in human cervical zzso zzso cancer cells through study of DNA damage zzso zzso by flow zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso levels by Western zzso analysis and laser scanning imaging zzso and cell survival by colony formation zzso zzso treatment led to sustained zzso and zzso DNA damage zzso increased zzso zzso in both cell lines through a mechanism of inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso exposure resulted in significantly elevated numbers and persistence of zzso zzso that were associated with reduced zzso zzso DNA damage was associated with a rise in zzso but not zzso protein levels 6 h after treatment with radiation and/or zzso plus zzso We conclude that zzso of zzso activity by zzso zzso DNA damage responses that rely on zzso production and thereby may substantially increase zzso of human cervical zzso
