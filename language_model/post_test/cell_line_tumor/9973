The zzso factor zzso zzso response is often very pronounced in hypoxic zzso of solid zzso zzso leading to zzso of zzso factors and zzso of a zzso zzso zzso Here, the influence of the zzso of zzso cells as a factor determining zzso variations in the relative contributions of both processes has been zzso 

The zzso status was assessed in rat zzso using zzso needle zzso zzso were generated by zzso cells from either zzso cell culture or severely zzso zzso zzso marker expression and zzso distances were zzso using zzso 

zzso zzso in hypoxic zzso form poorly zzso hypoxic zzso in rats, showing strong zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso cell culture form highly zzso zzso zzso with a significantly lower expression of zzso and zzso Growth rates and the fraction of zzso positive cells for both zzso groups were zzso 

The intensity of zzso in this model is primarily determined by the state of zzso adaptation of zzso cells, rather than being a function of zzso during solid zzso growth, a finding which is highly relevant for the design of treatment regimens targeting the zzso zzso
