zzso acid zzso zzso cell cycle arrest of zzso human breast cancer zzso zzso Previously, we demonstrated that zzso growth arrest of zzso zzso cells required the activity of the zzso protein zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso (1997) zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso treatment of zzso cells zzso with growth factor signaling to zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso treatment did not inhibit zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso but resulted in rapid zzso The lack of sustained zzso zzso was associated with transient rather than sustained association of the zzso with the zzso zzso proteins and zzso of zzso 1/2 and with compromised induction of expression of immediate early response zzso zzso the activity of zzso a zzso zzso target zzso prevented the effects of zzso on cell proliferation and zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in the absence of zzso decreased cell proliferation and decreased zzso zzso zzso treatment increased zzso levels of the protein zzso zzso zzso and all measured effects of zzso on zzso zzso function were reversed by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso These results indicate that zzso target zzso particularly zzso prevent sustained growth factor zzso zzso activated zzso zzso zzso and nuclear targets that are required for cell cycle zzso
