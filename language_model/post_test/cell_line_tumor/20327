The hormone zzso is a unique signaling zzso with powerful zzso effects, zzso by its zzso zzso The zzso modification of zzso is unique in that it takes place via a susceptible zzso linkage in the zzso zzso of zzso and is composed principally of zzso and, to lesser extent, zzso fatty zzso The nature of this zzso linkage makes it susceptible to zzso which convert it to its zzso forms, and, if not adequately zzso the conversion to zzso zzso particularly post sample collection, can lead to zzso and misleading zzso Here, we describe sample processing and mass zzso zzso for the accurate and simultaneous zzso of zzso and zzso forms of zzso We exploited these zzso zzso to characterize circulating and zzso forms of zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso a cell system for zzso zzso production and search for the zzso responsible for zzso zzso and zzso to demonstrate that zzso is zzso zzso zzso
