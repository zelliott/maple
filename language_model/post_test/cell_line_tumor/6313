zzso zzso zzso is a validated therapeutic target for zzso drug zzso However, the emergence of viral strains resistant to clinically studied IN zzso demands the discovery of novel zzso that are structurally as well mechanistically zzso zzso we describe the design and discovery of novel IN zzso targeting the zzso domain as well as its interaction with zzso which is essential for the zzso integration as an IN zzso By merging the zzso of zzso and zzso the zzso zzso was identified as a new scaffold to inhibit the strand transfer reaction zzso Further structural modifications on the zzso scaffold revealed that the zzso functionality attached on the zzso portion and the zzso zzso at the zzso ring are beneficial for the activity, resulting in a low zzso IN inhibitor zzso zzso zzso with more than zzso selectivity for the strand transfer over the zzso zzso More significantly, this active scaffold remarkably inhibited the interaction between IN and zzso zzso The zzso example, zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso interaction with an zzso value of 8 zzso Using molecular zzso the mechanism of action was hypothesized to involve the zzso of the zzso metal zzso inside the IN active zzso Furthermore, the inhibitor of zzso interaction was properly bound to the zzso binding site on zzso This work provides a new and efficient approach to evolve novel zzso IN zzso from rational integration and zzso of previously reported zzso
