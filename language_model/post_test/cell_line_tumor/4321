The bacterial gene zzso zzso magnetic properties to zzso cells and provides a basis for cell tracking by magnetic resonance imaging zzso In a mouse model of tumor growth from transplanted cells, we used repetitive zzso to demonstrate the in zzso imaging potential of zzso expression relative to a modified zzso zzso system, lacking regulation through iron response elements zzso 

zzso tumor zzso were monitored weekly from days 2 to 34 zzso Small animal zzso employed balanced zzso free zzso Imaging was correlated with tumor zzso using zzso zzso Blue, zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso with respect to tissue zzso and magnetic resonance zzso contrast was apparent within a week of cell zzso In zzso and zzso tumors, MR contrast enhancement was recorded up to day 20 zzso and zzso tumor zzso zzso tumors showed increases in both quantity and quality of MR contrast as measured by fractional void volume and zzso ratio, zzso MR contrast in both zzso and zzso tumors was zzso by day 13, doubling fractional void volume 1 week ahead of zzso 

zzso and zzso tumor zzso augment MR contrast after 1 week of zzso zzso expression increases MR contrast within days of cell transplantation and provides MR contrast comparable to zzso zzso has utility for monitoring cell growth and zzso with potential for in zzso detection of reporter gene expression using zzso
