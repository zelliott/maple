Human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso expression has been shown to be increased in several types of human zzso In this study, for the imaging of zzso zzso a modified zzso zzso with zzso targeting was zzso with zzso by using zzso zzso zzso as the zzso in the presence of zzso or zzso acid zzso as the zzso zzso testing of the zzso zzso in the serum was performed through zzso The zzso zzso was evaluated for its cellular zzso binding in zzso cancer cells zzso and its zzso properties were assessed in normal and zzso zzso zzso In the presence of either zzso or zzso the zzso zzso were zzso with zzso at a high yield and zzso zzso Cellular experiments confirmed the specific binding of the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso In the animal zzso study, zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by the liver and zzso was remarkably lower than that of the zzso with zzso zzso also showed a higher zzso of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso This study demonstrated zzso to be better than zzso for use as a zzso with the zzso zzso which can be a potential tool for the molecular imaging of zzso zzso
