zzso agents reactivate tumor zzso genes that are zzso silenced in zzso Inevitably these genes are zzso leading to drug zzso Using the zzso tumor zzso gene as a model, we showed that zzso zzso was dependent upon zzso and zzso of promoter zzso Following zzso withdrawal, zzso was rapidly zzso despite persistent promoter zzso Single zzso analysis at multiple time points showed that gene zzso was initiated by zzso zzso on zzso DNA and only then was followed by zzso and stable zzso Taken together, these data establish the importance of zzso positioning in zzso zzso of drug-induced gene zzso and suggest a role for therapeutic targeting of zzso assembly as a mechanism to overcome drug zzso
