The zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that is involved in the zzso zzso cellular migration and zzso cell growth, and zzso Although a distinct expression of zzso was found in a number of human tumors, the role of this protein in the initiation and/or maintenance of zzso transformation has not been studied in zzso Using an in zzso model of zzso zzso a zzso of zzso expression as well as an altered zzso of different zzso zzso was found both in zzso and human zzso zzso cells when compared with zzso zzso This was associated with a reduced growth, wound closure, and migration zzso Vice versa, zzso of zzso in zzso zzso increased the growth rate and migration capacity of these zzso zzso expression was neither modulated in zzso cells by transforming growth zzso nor by zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of the protein zzso C zzso zzso led to the zzso of zzso zzso In particular, the zzso target protein zzso response element binding protein zzso is a major regulator of zzso expression as the zzso of zzso by zzso interference was accompanied by zzso increase in zzso expression in zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso the major properties of zzso cells, which is zzso modulated by the zzso signaling zzso
