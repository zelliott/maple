zzso transition zzso has been implicated in the initiation and conversion of early stage tumors into invasive zzso and is associated with the zzso of cancer zzso The present study was designed to identify whether zzso zzso cancer stem cell generation and tumor progression in human zzso cancer cells in zzso 

zzso cells, as zzso cells, were used for zzso induction by zzso zzso zzso zzso And zzso features were then examined by Western zzso zzso zzso invasion and proliferation zzso Moreover, zzso side population zzso cells were sorted with flow zzso from zzso cells before and after zzso The proportion of SP was compared and zzso zzso and zzso in zzso were identified in SP zzso 

zzso of zzso induced zzso cells to undergo zzso And it zzso zzso marker zzso zzso zzso marker zzso and caused nucleus zzso of zzso and highly invasive and zzso zzso Most importantly, the induction of zzso promoted proportion of zzso side population cells zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso with higher sphere formation and clone forming capability in contrast to zzso population zzso 

zzso can induce cancer stem cell generation and tumor progression in zzso zzso Further understanding the role of zzso and cancer stem cells in cancer progression may reveal new preventive and therapeutic targets for zzso zzso
