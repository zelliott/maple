This paper reports the synthesis and characterization of zzso zzso prepared by soft chemical zzso The zzso of zzso possess zzso zzso phase and were used for the induction of cell death in zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso normal zzso kidney zzso By applying zzso zzso the cells exhibit that the zzso are more zzso on zzso cancer cells, moderately effective on zzso cells and least toxic on normal human zzso zzso The results demonstrated that the treatment with zzso zzso sensitize zzso cells by increasing both the zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso behave as zzso drugs, since they induce a zzso formation in zzso The present study could be helpful in designing more potent zzso agents for the therapeutic zzso
