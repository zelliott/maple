The means of identifying prostate zzso and its zzso are zzso The contrast agents used in magnetic resonance imaging clinical zzso are not taken up into the tumor cells, but only accumulate in the zzso space of the highly zzso zzso We examined the zzso zzso as a possible target for zzso detection using the zzso seven zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso zzso The correct sequence and a scrambled control sequence were coupled to the fluorescent dye zzso and the magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent zzso zzso acid zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso was performed by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction on zzso prostate zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso colon zzso zzso After having confirmed elevated expression of zzso zzso in zzso cells and very low expression of the zzso in zzso cells, these two cell lines were used to create tumor zzso on nude mice for in zzso zzso zzso zzso scanning zzso and magnetic resonance imaging showed a high specificity of the correct zzso for the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was much weaker with the scrambled zzso while the zzso zzso showed no marked zzso with any of the zzso In zzso experiments comparing the correct and scrambled zzso on zzso cells by magnetic resonance zzso and zzso cell sorting confirmed markedly higher specificity of the correct zzso The investigations show that the zzso zzso is a promising tumor cell surface target for future zzso imaging zzso
