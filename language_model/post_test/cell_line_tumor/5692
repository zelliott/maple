zzso evidence supports a central role of zzso in the zzso of Alzheimer's disease zzso We have demonstrated that zzso a synthetic zzso analogue of natural zzso exhibits zzso actions in cells and mouse models, suggesting future investigation of zzso as a candidate compound for the treatment of zzso In this study, we found that the production of zzso zzso was reduced by zzso in zzso zzso cells, and correlated with an increase in the soluble zzso derived zzso of the zzso protein precursor zzso in the zzso Moreover, the active form of zzso and zzso were elevated at the cell surface of zzso cells, consistent with an enhanced zzso of zzso and zzso on the zzso zzso with zzso a protein trafficking zzso blocked zzso zzso of zzso to the cell surface and release of zzso to the culture zzso Furthermore, oral administration of zzso to zzso transgenic mice significantly reduced the levels of zzso zzso with zzso of zzso in the zzso In zzso prediction indicates that the structure of zzso is compatible with the zzso rules for zzso and zzso These findings suggest that zzso reduces zzso production by promoting zzso zzso zzso zzso As such, zzso may have therapeutic potential for the treatment of zzso
