zzso transition zzso which involves the persistent loss of zzso markers and expression of zzso zzso is assumed to have a critical role in not only tissue development during zzso but also central mechanisms that enhance the invasive and zzso ability of cancer zzso Twist has been identified to play an essential role in zzso tumor invasion and zzso Although recent studies suggest that twist expression levels in tissue specimens of lung cancer might be associated with zzso the expression of twist in lung cancer cells itself and its effect have not been fully zzso Here, we evaluated twist expression and its effect on zzso zzso in lung cancer cell zzso Twist expression varied among human lung cancer cell zzso The lung cancer cell lines with high twist expression also tended to show a high zzso ratio, which was supported by a migration zzso in which high twist expression gave rise to high cell zzso Furthermore, in comparison to control cells, the lung cancer cells with zzso expression of twist showed a significant zzso zzso through zzso and an increasing ability to migrate in zzso in part, due to a tenfold increase in zzso zzso activity and almost a zzso increase in zzso of focal zzso zzso activity, although a contribution of zzso appeared unlikely in our zzso Our present analysis of twist expression in lung cancer provide clues to comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms, by which zzso often develops in lung zzso
