zzso zzso factor zzso is a type II zzso zzso belonging to the zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso Active soluble forms of zzso are generated either by zzso of the zzso domain or by zzso DNA zzso The current zzso for measuring the activity of soluble zzso involves stimulation of the proliferation of mouse zzso zzso in the presence of goat zzso zzso chain which is rather cumbersome and lengthy and yields variable zzso We have therefore developed an alternative functional zzso which relies on the ability of zzso to induce an zzso response in human zzso zzso For this, we constructed a zzso zzso containing the zzso of the zzso major cell zzso for zzso the zzso of the zzso of the two functional receptors for zzso is known to contain a death domain and trigger zzso When the zzso zzso was expressed in the zzso human zzso cell line zzso clone 21, zzso zzso of either human or mouse sequence zzso zzso similar to zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso cell population, called zzso expressing the zzso zzso thus provided the basis of a novel functional zzso for zzso that is simple and relatively fast to zzso The construction of the zzso zzso development of the zzso cells expressing this zzso and the development of sensitive and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso
