Selective replication of zzso viruses in tumor cells provides a promising approach for the treatment of human zzso One of the limitations observed with zzso viruses currently used in the treatment of solid tumors is the inefficient spread of virus throughout the tumor mass following zzso zzso Data are presented showing that zzso zzso expressing the zzso gene and containing an zzso zzso fiber showed significantly enhanced zzso and increased virus spread throughout the tumor when compared with zzso zzso zzso The increased spread of such viruses throughout tumors correlated well with improved zzso efficacy and overall survival in two highly zzso tumor zzso Furthermore, zzso viruses expressing zzso did not increase zzso suggesting that high level expression of zzso will not enhance zzso spread of zzso In zzso the data show that zzso may play a role in rearranging zzso components within tumors, which helps zzso zzso zzso to spread effectively throughout the tumor mass and thereby increase the extent of viral replication within the zzso zzso zzso from zzso fiber zzso zzso may prove a potent and novel approach to treating patients with zzso
