zzso of zzso zzso by zzso cells zzso plays an important role in zzso DC in zzso zzso are short lived, being continuously replaced by precursors that zzso and differentiate zzso Paradoxically, although zzso zzso promote immune responses and stimulate DC zzso they impair the zzso capacity of terminally differentiated zzso zzso DC, the major subset involved in zzso In this study, we have investigated the zzso capacity of newly generated zzso DC and especially immediate precursors of zzso zzso We show that these DC do not zzso zzso from dead cells unless zzso by zzso zzso before zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced the expression of zzso molecules required for zzso T cell zzso but also regulated the zzso mechanisms of zzso such as zzso degradation rates without regulating zzso zzso zzso an inflammatory zzso associated with infections, also promoted zzso acquisition by zzso DC and zzso with zzso zzso The concept that zzso zzso as well as inflammatory zzso promote the acquisition of zzso properties by zzso DC has important implications during immune responses and when considering the use of these cells for zzso
