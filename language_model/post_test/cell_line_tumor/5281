The zzso immune system discriminates between tolerance toward the zzso zzso and robust responses to zzso Maintenance of this critical balance is attributed to zzso zzso cells zzso residing in organized zzso tissue and dispersed in the zzso zzso zzso In zzso parameters of zzso zzso zzso zzso remain poorly zzso Here, we combined conditional cell zzso and zzso in zzso zzso to establish that zzso zzso have distinct origins and zzso zzso zzso zzso arose from zzso precursors zzso via zzso zzso zzso through a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were derived from grafted zzso but not zzso zzso under the control of zzso Mice zzso exclusively with zzso zzso when challenged in an innate colitis model developed severe zzso inflammation that was driven by zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results highlight the critical importance of the zzso subset balance for robust gut zzso
