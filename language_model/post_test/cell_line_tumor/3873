Here, we describe a novel interplay between zzso synthesis and degradation involved in pancreatic tumor zzso 

We used human pancreatic cancer cells, both in zzso zzso culture zzso and in zzso zzso zzso to demonstrate the role of zzso synthesis and degradation in tumor cell metabolism and zzso 

We demonstrated that zzso and genetic targeting of zzso the key zzso in the zzso salvage synthesis pathway, zzso cell growth and survival of pancreatic cancer zzso These changes were accompanied by a reduction of zzso levels, zzso zzso zzso production, zzso function, and levels of zzso The massive reduction in overall zzso activity induced by zzso zzso was accompanied by a dramatic decrease in pancreatic tumor zzso The results of the zzso experiments showed that neither the zzso zzso zzso nor zzso play a significant role on the effect of zzso zzso on pancreatic cancer zzso However, we identified a role for the zzso degradation zzso zzso by the zzso zzso on the sensitivity to zzso zzso The responsiveness to zzso zzso is modulated by the expression of zzso low levels of this zzso decrease the sensitivity to zzso zzso In contrast, its zzso decreased cell growth in zzso and in zzso and further increased the sensitivity to zzso zzso 

Our study demonstrates that zzso metabolism is essential for pancreatic cancer cell survival and proliferation and that targeting zzso synthesis via the zzso zzso could lead to novel therapeutic treatments for pancreatic zzso
