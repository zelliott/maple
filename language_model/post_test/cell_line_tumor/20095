The zzso zzso activated protein zzso zzso zzso is known to promote cell survival, zzso therapy resistance and hormone independent breast cancer cell zzso zzso we zzso the novel zzso inhibitor zzso to investigate the relevance of targeting this zzso in the zzso zzso breast cancer cell line zzso Our results show that zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulting in decreased zzso of the downstream zzso targets zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso by zzso blocks zzso survival of zzso cells with little effect on zzso breast zzso zzso Even though zzso is known to zzso zzso at zzso within zzso hinge region at zzso resulting in increased zzso zzso zzso our results suggest zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso by targeting both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso within zzso We further show that zzso decreases the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Taken together, our results strongly suggest that in addition to zzso zzso within zzso zzso indirectly activates the zzso by zzso and stimulation of the known zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Overall, our data underscore the therapeutic potential of targeting the zzso zzso zzso in the treatment of zzso zzso breast zzso
