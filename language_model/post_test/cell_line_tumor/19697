zzso zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso is a critical zzso mark for gene repression and zzso and plays an essential role in zzso and zzso Here, we investigated the effects of hypoxic stress on zzso at both global and zzso zzso We found that zzso increased global zzso in several zzso cell zzso This zzso zzso was temporally correlated with an increase in zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso The increase in zzso was significantly zzso in zzso mouse embryonic stem cells following zzso challenge, indicating that zzso was involved in the zzso zzso In addition to the zzso of zzso our results also indicated that zzso increased zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso were also found to increase zzso as well as zzso protein and zzso Finally, zzso increased zzso in the promoter regions of the zzso and zzso zzso and these increases temporally correlated with the repression of these zzso zzso these results indicate that zzso plays an important role in the zzso zzso which would inhibit the expression of several genes that would likely lead to solid tumor zzso
