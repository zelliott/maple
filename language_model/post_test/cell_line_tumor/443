zzso zzso zzso zzso is a common zzso tumor in zzso zzso Unfortunately, current treatment zzso which include surgery, radiation and chemotherapy have limited success zzso To develop new treatment strategies we hypothesized that a zzso zzso zzso driven by a tumor specific promoter would specifically induce zzso in zzso To test this concept, we selected tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso and the human zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso The latter is highly active in zzso of human cancer cells while it is mostly inactive in zzso zzso Using zzso we confirmed that zzso samples but not normal zzso cells were positive for zzso Similar results were also seen in an zzso cell line, zzso We then constructed first generation zzso zzso which used the zzso promoter to drive TRAIL zzso zzso of zzso but not of control human zzso lung zzso cells, led to zzso as measured by zzso zzso and flow zzso We used the zzso cells for a subcutaneous tumor model in zzso zzso injections of zzso (5 zzso 109 zzso but not of zzso or PBS resulted in significant zzso zzso zzso reduction in tumor sizes, which demonstrated that the human TRAIL driven by zzso promoter could efficiently induce zzso in zzso cells in zzso and in zzso These results suggest that a novel gene therapy strategy can also be used in the treatment of zzso in the near zzso
