A new type of zzso zzso zzso affinity zzso was developed, allowing the specific capture of zzso from zzso media of human zzso cell line zzso The affinity zzso was designed with the objective of using it as a capture column in an integrated zzso separation zzso zzso A comparative study between the utility of this novel zzso based zzso and the conventional zzso based affinity zzso for the continuous capture of zzso in an integrated zzso system was zzso zzso was coupled to zzso activated zzso zzso and zzso using zzso acid zzso as the zzso zzso About zzso zzso of zzso from the zzso culture media was achieved with zzso zzso column giving specific activity of about zzso zzso units zzso protein and zzso yields of about zzso High yields zzso were obtained with zzso column by virtue of its high binding zzso However, the zzso showed lower selectivity as compared to zzso zzso giving specific activity of 161 zzso protein and zzso factor of zzso The high zzso selectivity and reasonably good binding capacity of zzso zzso column make it a promising option for use as a protein capture column in integrated zzso zzso The zzso peak pool from zzso zzso column could be further resolved into separate zzso for high and low molecular weight forms of zzso by gel zzso zzso on zzso zzso The selectivity of the zzso based zzso zzso for zzso was found to be higher as compared to that of zzso zzso
