To determine the expression of zzso in zzso resistant cell lines of zzso cancer and its impact on zzso zzso 

zzso resistant zzso cancer cell lines were established by zzso selection with gradual increase of zzso zzso zzso was applied to zzso the zzso resistant cell lines and determine their resistance zzso The expression of zzso was measured by zzso green real-time zzso 

The resistance index of zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso green real-time zzso showed that zzso was zzso in all of the zzso resistant cell lines zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso was zzso times higher in zzso zzso times higher in zzso and zzso times higher in zzso than in their parental cell lines zzso zzso zzso which was almost equally reflected in their resistance zzso 

The over expression of zzso is associated with zzso resistance of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression may help reverse the zzso resistance of zzso zzso zzso is expected to be a new potential target of genetic therapy for zzso resistant zzso zzso
