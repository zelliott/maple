zzso human zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso was constructed to investigate its expression and biological function in zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso acquired stronger zzso activity and were able to elicit an zzso zzso T zzso zzso response in zzso 

zzso gene zzso was amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gene was then zzso into zzso expression zzso zzso containing human zzso via a zzso The sequence of gene fusion was confirmed using both restrictive zzso zzso and DNA zzso The expression zzso with gene fusion was zzso into zzso cell line with zzso zzso zzso Western zzso zzso stain were performed to determine the expression properties of zzso in zzso zzso Its biological effect on the zzso was measured by zzso zzso and its effect on zzso expression was determined using zzso After preparation of zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso expression zzso were zzso into zzso respectively by zzso to generate zzso zzso zzso The peripheral blood zzso cells zzso were zzso with different zzso lines to create specific zzso The response of target cell zzso cell zzso zzso to zzso zzso was evaluated by zzso release zzso 

The human zzso gene zzso was amplified from the human zzso cells and was inserted into zzso zzso zzso The correct sequence was proved by both restrictive zzso zzso and zzso The correct open reading frame was also zzso Fusion protein of zzso was effectively expressed in zzso cells, which was detected by both zzso and zzso zzso The expressed zzso fusion protein induced similar levels of zzso to that of native zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso fusion protein inhibited the zzso which was consistent with the effects of zzso as a universal tumor associated zzso zzso zzso shows that zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso responses that recognized and zzso tumor target cells of high zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso with zzso gene didn't induced the response of tumor targets zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso fusion protein had both biological activity of zzso and zzso indicating that this rationally designed protein can be further developed as novel tumor zzso zzso zzso with zzso gene were capable of zzso a stronger zzso zzso response in zzso
