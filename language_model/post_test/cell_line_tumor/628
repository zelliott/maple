zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso activated by DNA breaks and involved in DNA repair and other cellular zzso zzso zzso activity can be higher in cancer than in adjacent normal zzso but cancer predisposition is reported to be greater in individuals with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso domain that reduces zzso zzso 

To resolve these divergent zzso we determined zzso zzso zzso protein expression and activity in a panel of 19 solid and zzso adult and zzso human cancer cell zzso 

There was a wide variation in zzso activity in the cell line panel zzso of variation, zzso with the lowest and the highest activity being zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 85 750 zzso zzso zzso zzso Lower variation zzso was observed in zzso protein expression with the lowest expression being zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the highest being zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean activity in the cancer cells was zzso higher than the mean activity in normal human zzso and the zzso protein levels were zzso zzso 

Surprisingly, there was no significant correlation between zzso activity and zzso protein level or the investigated zzso zzso and zzso
