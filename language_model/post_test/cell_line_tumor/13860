The zzso zzso zzso plays a crucial role in zzso zzso and is a target of many zzso and zzso zzso zzso is reportedly involved in regulating zzso activity, but the detailed mechanism is not zzso We employed a zzso zzso zzso using zzso cells and found that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso C, reduced the zzso zzso These reductions were accompanied by the decreased cell surface expression of zzso Our findings suggest that zzso zzso mobilized by zzso zzso is required for the maintenance of zzso zzso This adds another zzso involving zzso for the regulation of zzso to other known mechanisms providing zzso zzso
