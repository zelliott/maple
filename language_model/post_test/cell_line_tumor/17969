zzso of zzso in colon zzso has been described zzso zzso signals have been shown to be implicated in zzso growth, and the effects of zzso are largely determined locally by the zzso zzso expression zzso We zzso zzso zzso expression in human zzso cancer, zzso and normal zzso by quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction zzso Western zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso results revealed significantly decreased ( zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels in zzso compared to normal zzso zzso without any significant change in zzso zzso zzso zzso was absent in most zzso it was detected at low levels in zzso of the zzso zzso analysis showed a similar decrease in zzso zzso expression in zzso and zzso compared to normal zzso zzso Based on these results, we performed further Western zzso analysis on zzso and zzso zzso zzso We found significantly decreased zzso levels in zzso samples compared to normal zzso zzso but there was no significant correlation between zzso zzso expression profile and the zzso stage of zzso zzso zzso revealed expression patterns of zzso zzso and zzso similar to those suggested by the zzso and Western zzso zzso In the present study, we demonstrate that zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in colon zzso and the adjacent normal zzso The results suggest a dramatic zzso in the distribution of zzso receptors in colon zzso These findings raise the perspective of targeted pharmacological studies with selective zzso zzso zzso or zzso in the therapy of zzso zzso
