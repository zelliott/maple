zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit strong and stable zzso that is attractive for many applications such as biological probing and solid state zzso The evaluation of zzso toxicity is important for realizing these practical zzso However, no systematic studies of zzso zzso toxicity have been zzso We investigated and compared the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso in human zzso zzso cells using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso manner, with zzso particles exhibiting somewhat higher zzso Lesser zzso of partially zzso zzso particles zzso methanol zzso and zzso suggested that free cadmium zzso may contribute to zzso We also evaluated the acute toxicity of zzso particles following intravenous exposure in male rats (2 zzso Few signs of functional toxicity or clinical zzso or zzso changes were zzso Interestingly, motor activity was zzso reduced (2 hours after zzso and then significantly increased at a later zzso (24 hours after zzso These studies provide a framework for further characterizing the in zzso and in zzso toxic potential of different types of zzso zzso and suggest that the nervous system may be targeted by these zzso under some zzso
