This article describes the size control synthesis of silicon quantum dots with simple zzso zzso The silicon zzso are small enough to be in the strong confinement regime and zzso in the blue region of the visible spectrum and the zzso can be tuned by changing the zzso zzso The silicon quantum dots were capped with zzso either a platinum catalyst or zzso An extensive zzso protocol is reported and assessed using zzso zzso to produce ultra pure silicon quantum dots suitable for biological zzso The highly pure quantum dots were used in cellular zzso experiments and monitored using zzso zzso The results showed that the zzso terminated silicon zzso accumulated in zzso but not in zzso and could be used as zzso to monitor cancer cells over long zzso
