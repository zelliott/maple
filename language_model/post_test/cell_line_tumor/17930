Despite the high response rates of small cell lung cancer zzso to zzso zzso zzso most patients with zzso will eventually experience disease zzso zzso novel zzso regimens are zzso This in zzso study was carried out in order to develop novel zzso regimens containing zzso zzso or oral zzso for zzso zzso was combined with other standard drugs for zzso zzso zzso an active zzso of zzso and zzso in different zzso The combination effects were analyzed by a zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso method using zzso zzso zzso Among the examined combinations, synergistic growth zzso was observed only when zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso an active zzso of zzso followed by zzso The findings of a flow zzso analysis were consistent with the enhancement of zzso cell death by this sequential zzso This zzso was observed in 4 out of 5 zzso cell lines zzso The effects of zzso and zzso on zzso zzso zzso protein zzso an important zzso of zzso sensitivity, were assessed by Western zzso analysis in zzso zzso Treatment with zzso for 24 h suppressed zzso protein expression and this low level of zzso was maintained for at least 72 zzso zzso with zzso inhibited the zzso increase of zzso zzso The synergistic effect induced by the combination of zzso and zzso may be attributable to the zzso suppression of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso which are clinically available zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso growth zzso These observations provide evidence supporting the clinical applications of the combination chemotherapy using zzso and zzso or oral zzso against zzso
