From zzso zzso 1), seven derivatives were prepared, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso 7, a zzso product of 1, exhibited more potent zzso zzso activity than the parent compound, without zzso A kinetic study revealed that 7 was a zzso and zzso inhibitor of mushroom zzso with zzso as the zzso Analysis of the zzso values indicated that 7 has a slightly higher affinity to the zzso than zzso zzso 6, a zzso analogue of 1 with zzso was deprived of zzso effect on the zzso zzso but showed very strong zzso against the human cancer cells zzso zzso and zzso with potency comparable to those of the zzso agents zzso and zzso Data on the zzso zzso activity and zzso of zzso indicated that O zzso on zzso 1 destroyed zzso activity but generated zzso Thus, facile preparations of a potent zzso inhibitor zzso and a strong zzso agent zzso from the natural product 1 were achieved through simple chemical zzso
