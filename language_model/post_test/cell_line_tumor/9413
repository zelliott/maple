Compare the sensitivity of human cells in zzso to low zzso zzso in air and in moderate zzso zzso zzso 

Continuous low zzso zzso at a dose rate of zzso or zzso zzso was given to human zzso breast cancer cells by incorporation of zzso zzso zzso into cellular zzso Acute zzso at a dose rate of zzso zzso was performed using zzso zzso were cultivated in an atmosphere with zzso zzso using an zzso zzso zzso 

When grown in ambient air with continuous zzso zzso cells were able to continue growth for at least 23 weeks at a zzso of zzso zzso with a surviving fraction stabilized at around zzso When the dose rate was increased to zzso zzso the cell culture died out after about 23 days zzso to about 22 zzso When grown in an atmosphere with zzso zzso we surprisingly found that the continuously zzso zzso cells zzso zzso were severely inhibited in their growth, and cell death became extensive after about 3 weeks while zzso cells continued growth seemingly unaffected by this low zzso Peri cellular zzso varied between zzso and below zzso over an ordinary passage due to zzso through the 2 zzso deep zzso Online zzso over a whole passage showed that oxygen was more depleted in the zzso compared to the zzso cultures indicating increased zzso during zzso While cells growing attached to the bottom were inhibited and zzso during zzso it was found that cells attached high up in the neck region, zzso having only a shallow layer of medium above them, survived and formed zzso When cells cultivated in zzso zzso for 7 weeks were zzso with acute doses of zzso zzso the zzso was the same as for cells cultivated in ambient zzso 

Continuous zzso with zzso zzso for several weeks results in a stronger zzso for zzso cells grown in an atmosphere with zzso as compared to zzso zzso The data indicate that this may be due to increased oxygen consumption resulting in more severe zzso in zzso compared to control zzso zzso
