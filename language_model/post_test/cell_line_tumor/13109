zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso inhibitor but is paradoxically associated with poor outcomes in cancer zzso However, the mechanisms of its effects on tumor cells have not been zzso 

zzso zzso in human tumor cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso was suppressed by small interfering zzso zzso and zzso a small zzso inhibitor of zzso and the effects on zzso were zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso tumor cells was examined in zzso zzso zzso and knockout zzso mice zzso per group), and zzso survival was analyzed by the zzso zzso The effect of zzso suppression on zzso zzso tumors was evaluated for cell zzso zzso and zzso All statistical tests were zzso 

zzso and pharmacological zzso of zzso in the four tumor cell lines increased spontaneous zzso zzso fold increase relative to zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso Student zzso zzso which was blocked in the presence of zzso zzso a zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and was partially attenuated by a zzso zzso zzso zzso mice implanted with zzso zzso zzso cells had decreased zzso and prolonged survival compared with control mice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and their tumors exhibited decreased cell proliferation and zzso and increased zzso Furthermore, five of 15 zzso zzso mice implanted with zzso zzso zzso cells never developed zzso 

These data suggest that zzso exerts a protective effect against tumor cell zzso by a mechanism that, in part, involves zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and may be a promising therapeutic zzso
