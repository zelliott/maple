Advances in tumor zzso and Identification of zzso zzso zzso provide a basis for the development of novel zzso to treat zzso zzso In order to identify novel zzso we performed comparative zzso analysis of zzso zzso and found regulator of G zzso 1 zzso extensively zzso in zzso cell zzso zzso zzso To examine the possible function of this zzso as a novel, broadly zzso zzso synthetic full-length zzso was zzso for the zzso of zzso zzso cells zzso These modified zzso cells zzso were then used to induce zzso zzso T cells zzso in zzso The zzso generated from several healthy donors and a patient with chronic zzso leukemia zzso zzso an zzso and zzso and zzso zzso activity against tumor cells zzso expressing the zzso protein including zzso cell zzso zzso melanoma, zzso zzso and the primary zzso zzso In conclusion, our study demonstrates that the in zzso induction of zzso zzso by zzso zzso is feasible and highly zzso Since this zzso is zzso expressed in a broad variety of zzso it might represent an interesting novel zzso in the context of cancer vaccines designed to target zzso expressing tumor zzso
