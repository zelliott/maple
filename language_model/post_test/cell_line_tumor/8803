To clarify the relationship between the expressions of tight junction zzso proteins and the changes of zzso zzso signaling pathways in the process of zzso zzso barrier zzso injury in zzso and observe the regulatory mechanisms of related signaling zzso zzso 

The in zzso model of zzso zzso injury was established using zzso chamber zzso system of human zzso vein zzso zzso cells and rat zzso zzso zzso The system was supplemented with different zzso of zzso The zzso electrical resistance zzso and zzso of zzso zzso were tested to evaluate the changes of zzso of in zzso zzso cell zzso The expressions and locations of zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso were determined by Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso Signaling zzso zzso were used to clarify the zzso relation between zzso protein expressions and signaling zzso 

Lead inhibited zzso growth and this zzso was zzso and zzso ( zzso zzso value decreased and the zzso of zzso zzso increased significantly as the time of lead exposure went by ( zzso Western zzso showed that the expressions of zzso zzso and zzso were significantly reduced after zzso zzso lead treatment ( zzso the zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were elevated significantly ( zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso reversed the lead zzso These results suggested that lead could inhibit the zzso protein expressions through the zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso proteins are important target molecules of zzso structural and functional damage of zzso The zzso and zzso signal zzso pathways are involved in the regulation on the expressions of zzso zzso
