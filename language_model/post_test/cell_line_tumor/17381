zzso T zzso zzso recognize viral zzso zzso presented by major zzso complex zzso class I molecules on the surface of infected zzso The zzso response is critical in clearance and prevention of zzso zzso Yet, there are no descriptions of zzso peptides derived from the viral envelope zzso In the few reports on zzso zzso class I viral zzso zzso from zzso internal zzso definitive positive identification by mass zzso is zzso The zzso envelope zzso zzso zzso a strong specific zzso response restricted by several human and zzso zzso class I zzso including zzso Previous analyses showed that this response can be zzso zzso with the synthetic zzso zzso zzso We aim to identify the zzso natural peptides zzso the response to this zzso Our data indicate the presence of, at least, two zzso species of different length and sharing the same zzso core, which are associated with the zzso presenting zzso in infected zzso One species is at least, probably, the optimal zzso The second species, identified by mass zzso for the first time in zzso is, unexpectedly, a zzso which lacks the correctly positioned zzso group to bind to zzso And yet, it is present in similar amounts and, notably, is equally zzso Thus, the zzso set of zzso zzso class I zzso is richer and different than expected from studies with synthetic zzso This may help raise the plasticity and thus the effectiveness of the immune response against the viral zzso These data have implications for zzso vaccine zzso
