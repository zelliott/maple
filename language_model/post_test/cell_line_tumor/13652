zzso zzso can be used as a screening tool for identification of zzso expressed proteins as potential zzso for zzso Here, we comparatively analyzed the zzso profiles of zzso cancer zzso and normal zzso zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso technology of zzso tags for relative and absolute zzso zzso with zzso zzso mass zzso zzso unique proteins were zzso Of those, 205 were potentially zzso expressed between zzso cancer and normal zzso zzso Several of the potentially zzso expressed proteins were validated by Western zzso and real-time quantitative zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were validated in zzso tissue zzso by zzso zzso of zzso expression suppressed the migration and invasion properties of zzso cancer cells in zzso Our study represents the successful application of zzso technology to an investigation of zzso zzso Many of the potentially zzso expressed proteins identified had not been linked to zzso cancer before, and provide valuable novel insights into the underlying mechanisms of zzso in human zzso zzso
