zzso zzso virus zzso is being developed for cancer zzso We created a zzso replicating zzso zzso that zzso infected zzso breast cancer zzso This zzso did not express the native zzso zzso zzso Instead, it expressed a zzso zzso zzso which included a zzso zzso zzso directed to the human zzso zzso The virus infected mouse zzso zzso cells zzso expressing zzso zzso better than the parent cells zzso However, viral growth in cultured zzso cells was curtailed after several cycles, and viral yield was very poor at 2 zzso zzso infectious doses zzso We performed in zzso serial passage in zzso cells to evolve a virus with improved growth that could be used for zzso therapy trials in zzso Fifteen passes generated an adapted virus that progressed through multiple cycles in cultured zzso cells until all cells were infected and had a viral yield of 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso of the entire viral zzso found only 2 zzso in the adapted zzso Both zzso occurred in the zzso gene segment coding for the zzso An additional zzso site was created by one of the zzso The adapted virus showed higher density of zzso on the viral zzso improved zzso much greater stability, higher burst size, and decreased induction of cellular zzso The specificity for cells expressing the zzso zzso was zzso These studies demonstrate that serial passage can be used to rapidly evolve a zzso zzso zzso an improved zzso zzso
