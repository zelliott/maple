Despite the effectiveness of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso drugs on human zzso none of these types of treatments by themselves has been sufficient to eradicate the zzso The combination of different zzso may hold enormous potential for zzso therapeutic zzso In the current study, we examined the effects of treatment with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso on human zzso cancer zzso The molecular mechanisms of the combined treatments and their potential to sensitize zzso cancer cells to zzso were also zzso Cancer cells were exposed to the agents alone and in zzso and cell growth zzso was determined by zzso and colony formation zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities as well as zzso oxygen species zzso were zzso Cell cycle zzso and induction of zzso were assessed by flow zzso The expression of cell zzso and zzso genes was determined by quantitative zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of cancer cell sensitivity to zzso upon zzso combination treatment was also zzso The combination of zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso inhibited cancer cell growth, disrupted the cell cycle, induced zzso decreased zzso activity and increased zzso zzso These events were accompanied by the altered expression of genes associated with the cell cycle, zzso and zzso zzso The combination treatment markedly enhanced the zzso of zzso cancer cells zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso and zzso cancer zzso zzso The results of this study have implications for the development of zzso treatments that include zzso zzso and conventional zzso drugs, suggesting a potential therapeutic zzso with general zzso to various types of zzso
