This study examined the role of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in cervical cancer progression and the possible use of this zzso for cervical cancer zzso We analyzed zzso protein expression in 9 cervical cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso expression was observed in all cell lines except for zzso We zzso the human cervical cancer cell line zzso that zzso expresses zzso with a short hairpin zzso zzso targeting zzso and established an zzso cell line to determine whether zzso of zzso mediates cervical cancer zzso zzso zzso suppressed tumor growth in zzso without influencing cancer cell growth in zzso Moreover, zzso zzso enhanced the sensitivity of cervical cancer cells to natural killer zzso cells in zzso and promoted zzso cell zzso in the tumor zzso in zzso These findings indicate that zzso of zzso controls cervical cancer progression by zzso zzso cells, suggesting zzso as a potential therapy for cervical zzso
