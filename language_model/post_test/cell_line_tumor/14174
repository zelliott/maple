zzso drug resistance is a major limitation for cancer zzso Often, one genetic zzso zzso to zzso resistance to an otherwise successful zzso However, little is known about the dynamics of the emergence of resistant tumor zzso In this article, we consider an zzso growing population starting from one cancer cell that is sensitive to zzso Sensitive cancer cells can mutate into resistant ones, which have relative fitness alpha prior to zzso In the special case of no cell death, our model zzso to the one investigated by zzso and zzso We calculate the probability of resistance and the mean number of resistant cells once the cancer has reached detection size zzso The probability of resistance is an increasing function of the detection size M times the zzso rate zzso If zzso zzso 1, then the expected number of resistant cells in zzso with resistance is independent of the zzso rate zzso and increases with M in proportion to zzso for advantageous zzso with relative fitness zzso to zzso zzso for neutral zzso zzso zzso 1), but zzso to an upper limit for deleterious zzso zzso Further, the probability of resistance and the average number of resistant cells increase with the number of cell divisions in the history of the zzso Hence a tumor subject to high rates of zzso will show a higher zzso of resistance than expected on its detection size zzso
