The novel zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso were evaluated for their zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso and in zzso zzso were used to assess the compounds for zzso I activity, zzso activity, gastrointestinal zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso DNA breaks in zzso and was similar in potency to zzso Both zzso and zzso were comparable to zzso regarding zzso zzso activity assessed in mice bearing zzso site zzso and human zzso zzso was also found to be orally zzso Both zzso were zzso more potent in zzso than zzso and both were superior to zzso with respect to zzso assessment of zzso injury in zzso The generation of parent compound from zzso was zzso similar in zzso rat and human blood and liver zzso zzso The percentage of zzso remaining as the active zzso form at equilibrium was comparable in mouse and human zzso The zzso profile in rat blood demonstrated that zzso was rapidly zzso to zzso 

The favorable in zzso zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso characteristics of zzso suggest that the good efficacy of zzso is derived from robust in zzso release of zzso in zzso and the likelihood that this zzso will be preserved in zzso The comparable zzso activity of zzso to zzso as well as reduced zzso zzso zzso make this novel zzso analog attractive for clinical zzso
