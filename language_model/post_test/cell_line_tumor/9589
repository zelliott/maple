zzso cancer remains a leading cause of cancer death worldwide, despite markedly improved response rates to current systemic zzso zzso either alone or incorporated into zzso regimes has resulted in increased survival rates, particularly with regards to zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso which is currently in clinical trial, has been advocated for use in zzso cancer either zzso or in combination with zzso zzso In this study, the zzso capacity of both compounds was compared in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines to determine whether effects were zzso specific at zzso achievable doses, and whether the combination resulted in enhanced zzso Both zzso and zzso displayed marked zzso capacity at therapeutic zzso in the two tumor cell zzso Order of sensitivity to zzso was zzso whereas order of sensitivity to zzso was zzso zzso cells underwent induction of zzso arrest in response to both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was induced by both agents, and up to zzso induction of zzso protein was observed in response to the zzso zzso effects in zzso cells were largely cell cycle independent, and were zzso by induction of zzso zzso were greatly enhanced in both cell lines when agents were zzso This study provides further evidence that zzso may be of use in therapeutic regimes directed against zzso cancer, and suggests that in combination with zzso it may enhance efficacy of the latter in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
