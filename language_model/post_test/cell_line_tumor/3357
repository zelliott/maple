The purpose of this study was to investigate zzso zzso as function of time and zzso 

We studied the effect of 48 hours' exposure to various zzso of zzso in a human pulmonary zzso cell line zzso We measured the level of zzso protein B zzso zzso by quantitative reverse zzso after initial zzso exposure, and after zzso 1 or 2 weeks zzso zzso are mean zzso zzso for 5 zzso Comparisons were made by zzso and zzso test with significance set at P zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso was zzso within 48 hours of the initial zzso zzso zzso with the same zzso concentration resulted in levels more than double those initially zzso zzso with zzso concentration 10 times lower had an effect comparable to that of the initial, higher zzso 

Our results suggest a residual effect of the initial exposure that zzso zzso allowing significant dose zzso
