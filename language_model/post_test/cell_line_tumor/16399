To investigate the zzso effect of diffuse large zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso induced by zzso and its related zzso 

zzso cells were treated with zzso at different concentration zzso zzso 100 zzso 10 zzso 1 zzso for 24 zzso 48 zzso 72 zzso zzso The zzso rate of cell proliferation was detected by zzso zzso The cell growth zzso were drawn and half zzso concentration zzso values were zzso The cell zzso were detected by flow zzso zzso the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Bid, zzso and zzso protein in zzso cells treated with zzso by western zzso the zzso expression of zzso zzso Bid, zzso zzso by zzso gene with zzso 

zzso markedly inhibited zzso cell growth in a zzso and zzso zzso The 48 zzso was zzso The zzso showed that the zzso proportion of zzso cells treated with 100 zzso of zzso zzso zzso positive zzso gradually increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The protein expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso decreased in a zzso zzso The zzso and zzso protein markedly increased, but the Bid protein level did not zzso zzso up regulated zzso and zzso gene zzso however down regulated zzso and zzso gene zzso but the gene expression of Bid and zzso hadn't been changed zzso 

zzso can inhibit proliferation and induce zzso of zzso zzso The mechanism may involve in zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso and the zzso zzso
