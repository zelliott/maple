Much evidence indicates that typical zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso have a growth zzso effect against cancer cells when each is tested zzso However, when fruits and vegetables including a mixture of zzso are zzso it is unclear whether this zzso activity is zzso in the zzso Initially, we found that zzso a typical zzso zzso from zzso had a preventive effect on zzso zzso at zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso zzso acted as a signal zzso to zzso the zzso of the intrinsic zzso of the zzso induced by zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso and zzso zzso which are also zzso zzso from zzso were shown to have a growth zzso effect by us and zzso These results led us to investigate the interactive effects of these zzso zzso on cell zzso In the present study, we found that zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibited a zzso zzso or additive effect when combinations of two of these three compounds were zzso As to the zzso relationship, the zzso group at zzso in zzso was shown to contribute to the zzso zzso By the combined treatment with zzso and zzso zzso the zzso cell population and the activity of zzso were zzso zzso The finding that zzso and zzso zzso induced zzso by reducing the zzso membrane potential suggested that an intrinsic zzso of zzso was zzso activated by the combination treatment with zzso and zzso zzso On the other hand, in the combined treatment including zzso the growth zzso activity of zzso was zzso These results indicate the relevance of the combination of zzso for the enhancement of the zzso zzso
