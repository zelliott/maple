zzso interference zzso is triggered by the presence of zzso zzso zzso in the cell and results in rapid destruction and zzso gene zzso of target zzso The roles of zzso in gene function and zzso therapy have been reported, but its effect on human zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso which is highly expressed in zzso zzso cell zzso and other head and neck zzso has seldom been zzso This study was to explore the zzso effect of zzso zzso gene by short hairpin zzso zzso on growth of zzso zzso cell zzso zzso in nude mice with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso containing zzso gene and zzso zzso sequences was zzso Human zzso zzso cell zzso zzso cells were transplanted into nude mice to establish zzso zzso zzso was zzso into the zzso The tumor volume was zzso Fluorescence expression in the tumors was observed by laser zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed with HE zzso Cell zzso was detected by terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso protein in the tumors was detected by SP zzso The structural change of heart, liver, kidney and zzso was observed, and peripheral blood zzso and zzso parameters were zzso 

The tumor volume was significantly smaller in zzso group than in normal saline zzso group and blank zzso group ( zzso The zzso rate was zzso in zzso zzso After zzso of zzso or blank zzso many green fluorescent cells were observed under zzso zzso The necrosis and zzso of tumor cells were found under light microscope in zzso zzso The zzso index of tumor cells was significantly higher in zzso group than in zzso group and blank zzso group zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso directly zzso zzso protein expression in the tumors, but did no damage to the heart, liver, zzso zzso and blood system of nude zzso 

zzso zzso containing specific sequences of zzso gene could significantly inhibit the growth of zzso zzso in nude mice, with no side effect on the heart, liver, zzso zzso and blood zzso
