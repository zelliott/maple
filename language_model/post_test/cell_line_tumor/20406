The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is often zzso in different types of zzso and promotes cancer zzso We have recently shown that the zzso zzso zzso zzso to promote survival of zzso cancer zzso Here, we examined the possible mechanisms underlying zzso cell zzso Considering the growing evidence about the significance of zzso and zzso in cancer, we tried to investigate how zzso controls these events to regulate survival of cancer zzso zzso zzso and zzso two commonly used drugs for zzso cancer treatment, were found to induce zzso expression in zzso cancer cells zzso and zzso and the zzso effect of these drugs was markedly enhanced upon zzso zzso zzso of zzso protected the cells from zzso and zzso zzso and also averted zzso zzso of cell zzso zzso induced the expression of zzso zzso and decreased the expression of zzso proteins zzso and zzso while zzso of zzso zzso zzso and markedly increased zzso Moreover, zzso promoted the association of zzso with zzso and zzso a novel negative regulator of zzso zzso zzso of zzso from zzso and the induction of zzso were also inhibited by zzso Together, our data signify that zzso is zzso in zzso cancer cells as a survival strategy against zzso drugs and promotes growth of tumor cells by zzso both zzso and zzso Thus, application of zzso drugs along with zzso inhibitor may elevate therapeutic efficiency by reducing the zzso effects of zzso and by simultaneous induction of both zzso and zzso
