zzso is a novel zzso target gene that we previously demonstrated to be involved in cell zzso We zzso here, the expression of zzso in colon cancer to examine its possible role in zzso We generated a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso and found that colon tumor cell lines expressed zzso zzso We also found that expression of zzso was elevated in colon tumor zzso by zzso zzso zzso sections of 23 surgical cases of zzso and 1 case of zzso were stained zzso and the expression of zzso was found to be elevated in all of the zzso compared to adjacent zzso zzso which showed little zzso zzso invading tumors as well as tumors that have invaded zzso vessels showed strong zzso against zzso zzso zzso was expressed in all pathological grades of cancer as well as in the zzso zzso patterns of zzso a zzso for cell zzso were similar to those of zzso in most cases, but the percentage of tumor cells stained by zzso was zzso Although zzso zzso strongly stained some zzso zzso cells including cells in the deeper part of the zzso and in zzso zzso centers, zzso to zzso rarely stained those zzso zzso of zzso expression severely suppressed proliferation of colon tumor cells in zzso Together, our results indicate that the elevated expression of zzso is a characteristic feature in colon cancer, one that may have therapeutic zzso
