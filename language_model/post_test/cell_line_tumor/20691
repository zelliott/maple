zzso of zzso zzso is a hallmark of major gastrointestinal zzso including zzso zzso zzso The zzso role of zzso is well defined but reasons for its zzso in zzso remain zzso zzso 4 zzso acts as a negative regulator of zzso zzso but its functional role in liver zzso has not been zzso We investigated the role of zzso in zzso regulation in zzso zzso expression of zzso was found in zzso zzso of zzso as measured by quantitative real time zzso zzso expression of zzso in two zzso cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso zzso attenuated zzso responsive zzso activity, and decreased both zzso and zzso D1 protein zzso To study the effect of zzso on cell growth and zzso two stable zzso cell lines were established from zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso of zzso hampered cell zzso reduced colony formation and retarded cell zzso When zzso zzso stable cells were used to induce zzso zzso in nude mice zzso reduction in zzso sizes was observed zzso Furthermore, zzso studies showed that decreased expression of zzso was associated with zzso zzso in zzso zzso Additionally, zzso of the zzso using specific inhibitor in zzso zzso stable cells masked the effect of zzso Our findings suggest a potential zzso zzso role of zzso as well as that of an important regulator of zzso
