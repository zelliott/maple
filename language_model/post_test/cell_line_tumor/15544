The metabolism that sustains cancer cells is adapted zzso to zzso even under zzso conditions zzso zzso This effect was one of the first zzso in cancer cells recognized as zzso a survival zzso In this study, we show that gene associated with zzso zzso zzso which was previously identified as a tumor zzso protein associated with growth zzso and cell zzso contributes to the switch between zzso and zzso zzso In parallel to this, vascular zzso growth factor, which promotes zzso is also zzso We have identified zzso factor zzso zzso as the downstream factor of zzso in human zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso promotes zzso synthesis in a zzso manner, which acts as a potential competitive inhibitor for von zzso zzso interaction, and thereby prevents zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, it is concluded that zzso a potential tumor zzso zzso performs its function in part via regulating zzso zzso zzso through zzso signaling zzso and this has added new perspective to its role in zzso thus providing potential strategies for tumor zzso zzso
