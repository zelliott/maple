The zzso of B cell zzso represent zzso zzso T cell responses induced by zzso vaccination in zzso are directed predominantly against zzso zzso whereas in zzso T cells also recognize zzso zzso To investigate the mechanisms regulating the specificity of zzso T cells, zzso or zzso mice were zzso with mature zzso cells loaded with zzso peptides from influenza zzso or from shared zzso zzso or unique zzso structures of the zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells were induced in zzso by the zzso and influenza zzso but not by the J zzso Gene expression profiling of zzso regulatory T cells revealed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity involved J zzso zzso zzso and functional suppression of zzso zzso T zzso zzso in zzso proliferation of transgenic zzso T cells was suppressed by zzso with the J zzso and was restored in zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso induced by a shared zzso zzso can zzso suppress T cell responses against zzso and zzso foreign zzso in zzso The results imply that tumor vaccines should avoid zzso expressed by normal cells in the draining zzso zzso to achieve optimal zzso zzso
