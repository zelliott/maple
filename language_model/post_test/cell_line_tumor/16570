zzso zzso originally identified in zzso is a zzso protein belonging to the zzso zzso zzso In high-grade zzso zzso in zzso zzso was identified as one of the most abundant zzso We have previously shown that zzso was induced by zzso oxygen species zzso Moreover, the zzso of zzso by short hairpin zzso zzso led to the reduced expression of vascular zzso growth factor zzso and inhibited tumor growth in zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate whether zzso could have direct effects on zzso zzso In this study we demonstrated that zzso increased zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso The treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso increased proliferation comparable to that of zzso zzso zzso No change in proliferation was seen when zzso cells were infected with zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso effect of zzso was zzso by a specific zzso Treatment with zzso targeting the zzso for advanced zzso end products zzso thus inhibited zzso cell proliferation and tube formation enhanced by zzso zzso We showed that zzso expression was not induced by hydrogen zzso when zzso was silenced by zzso which led to the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso Indeed, zzso was shown to induce zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso inhibited the zzso generation of zzso in zzso zzso Finally, treatment with zzso zzso protein abolished the effect of zzso on zzso cell zzso Our data suggest that zzso expression in zzso zzso cells leads to increased zzso cell proliferation in a zzso manner through zzso zzso may therefore play a role in breast cancer progression by promoting zzso stress response and zzso
