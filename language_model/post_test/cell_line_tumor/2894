Recent studies have shown a significant involvement of zzso growth factor zzso signaling components in the zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, there has been some evidence to indicate that differential expression of zzso zzso genes can distinguish zzso zzso The present study zzso zzso to determine the expression patterns of zzso zzso zzso binding protein 2 zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso in 24 zzso zzso zzso and 8 zzso zzso zzso A majority of tumors were positive for zzso zzso zzso and zzso and negative for zzso zzso However, only zzso showed a significant difference in expression between the zzso and zzso zzso with higher levels of expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso Within the zzso zzso zzso zzso was limited to zzso zzso zzso The zzso pattern for all 5 proteins was diffuse zzso in the majority of zzso Analysis of zzso cell lines by real-time reverse zzso chain reaction for zzso expression revealed significantly higher mean expression levels in zzso and zzso zzso cell lines when compared to zzso zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso introduction of zzso into an zzso cell line also demonstrated a significant reduction in zzso zzso The results of this study show that expression of the zzso zzso is associated with zzso tumors and may serve as a diagnostic aid in distinguishing zzso zzso Furthermore, the in zzso results are supportive of a role for the zzso fusion gene in the zzso of zzso zzso
