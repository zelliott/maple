zzso zzso zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso that displays potent zzso activity against human tumor zzso in nude zzso zzso exist in a pH dependent equilibrium between active zzso and inactive zzso forms that can be altered by binding to human serum zzso zzso Here we investigated the influence of pH and zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso 

zzso and zzso were used to measure the influence of pH on zzso to zzso conversion and zzso binding of zzso as compared to other zzso In zzso zzso of drugs was determined against zzso human zzso zzso cells and zzso human lung cancer zzso 

The rate of zzso to zzso conversion was similar for zzso and zzso zzso the pH from zzso to zzso increased the equilibrium levels of the zzso forms of the drugs from 20 to almost zzso of total zzso zzso moderately diminished the amount of free zzso zzso but did not change the ratio of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso with the effect of pH on zzso levels, lowering the pH of zzso human zzso zzso cells from zzso to zzso decreased the zzso of zzso from zzso to 98 zzso and zzso from 33 to 12 zzso zzso of zzso by human zzso anchored on the surface of zzso cells further decreased its zzso value to 26 zzso Although zzso significantly decreased the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso at cancer cells with an zzso zzso produced greater zzso than zzso 

zzso and targeted delivery of zzso can enhance zzso zzso even in the presence of zzso
