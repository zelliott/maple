Class III zzso zzso has been discovered as a marker of drug resistance in human zzso To get insights into the mechanisms by which this protein is involved in drug resistance, we analyzed zzso in a panel of zzso and drug-resistant cell zzso We identified two main different zzso of zzso having a specific zzso zzso We showed that the apparently higher molecular weight zzso is zzso and zzso and it is localized in the zzso The apparently lower molecular weight zzso is instead found exclusively in zzso We observed that levels of zzso and zzso of zzso are associated with the resistant zzso and zzso into zzso By two-dimensional zzso zzso analysis, we also found that zzso protein in zzso forms protein complexes through zzso zzso zzso Through zzso zzso we isolated protein species able to interact with zzso Following zzso zzso these proteins were characterized by mass zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that these proteins are involved in adaptation to zzso stress and zzso zzso thereby suggesting that zzso is a survival factor able to directly contribute to drug zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso could represent an attractive zzso whose zzso could hamper zzso zzso and zzso zzso
