There is a critical need to identify markers that can accurately identify existing or predict future zzso disease in patients with zzso since the majority of patients present with zzso zzso zzso We previously reported zzso is zzso in human zzso and increased expression of zzso by zzso correlated with decreased clinical zzso We have established 11 primary cultures from zzso of patients with zzso and ten of the 11 primary cultures have increased expression of zzso relative to normal human zzso To further explore possible mechanisms for zzso suppression previously reported, we used in this report zzso zzso of zzso in four commonly used human zzso lines, then examined their cell zzso migration, and invasion zzso zzso of zzso expression inhibited cell zzso and promoted cell migration and invasion in these zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced cell zzso and inhibited cell zzso Our data demonstrate zzso is commonly zzso in human zzso zzso may inhibit zzso zzso by promoting cell zzso and zzso cell zzso and zzso Thus, zzso may be considered a potential marker for human zzso with zzso value for identifying patients without zzso
