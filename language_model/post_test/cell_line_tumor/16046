Animal tumor zzso and in zzso cell culture systems have demonstrated that zzso zzso the zzso zzso in green tea, possesses zzso and zzso effects on various cancer cells and zzso In this study, we investigated the effects of zzso on cell growth, cell cycle zzso and zzso in human zzso zzso zzso The involvement of zzso zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso was examined as a mechanism for the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso trafficking of zzso was also determined using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our data show that zzso treatment caused zzso cell growth zzso cell cycle arrest at the zzso phase, and DNA fragmentation suggesting the induction of zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the expression of zzso zzso and -9 as well as the ratio of zzso protein increased significantly with higher zzso zzso and longer incubation zzso Moreover, expression of zzso zzso in zzso cells was inhibited by zzso treatment in a zzso manner, while that of zzso zzso remained zzso Here we also reveal zzso zzso of zzso into the zzso of zzso cells and its subsequent nuclear zzso These results suggest that zzso may interrupt zzso signals directed towards genes involved in proliferation and cell cycle zzso Taken together, our data indicate that zzso zzso may be zzso through the induction of zzso and zzso by the zzso activity of zzso zzso as well as suppression of zzso and zzso zzso by the zzso activity of zzso
