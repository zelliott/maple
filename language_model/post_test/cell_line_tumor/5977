The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between zzso and zzso activities of selected plant zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso at low zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso was less toxic zzso zzso zzso was not due to zzso generation from zzso in culture zzso zzso zzso and zzso protected the cells from zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso had a zzso zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso did not exhibit any zzso zzso The first three compounds also inhibited cellular zzso zzso induced by zzso while the latter were zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso protecting cells under zzso stress were identical to those causing cell damage under normal zzso Only in case of zzso there was a narrow range of zzso protecting cells without being zzso to zzso zzso Thus, even for zzso with a high zzso capacity in zzso systems the zzso selectivity zzso was very low or even zzso These results should be taken into account when the zzso or therapeutic application of zzso as antioxidants is zzso
