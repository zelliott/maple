The zzso analog zzso is an zzso drug for zzso cancer therapy, and its clinical effectiveness has been demonstrated in the treatment of zzso syndromes zzso and acute zzso leukemia zzso However, therapy resistance in patients with zzso remains a challenging zzso zzso proteins that are involved in drug zzso are potential zzso of drug zzso The responsible proteins for the transport of zzso into zzso cells are zzso We have now systematically analyzed the expression and activity of various zzso zzso We identified the human zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso as the most abundant zzso zzso in leukemia cell lines and in zzso patient zzso Transport zzso using zzso demonstrated zzso zzso of the drug into the cells, which was inhibited by zzso zzso a zzso zzso The cellular toxicity of zzso and its DNA zzso activity were strongly reduced after zzso zzso In contrast, the cellular activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso drug, persisted after zzso zzso A strong dependence of zzso DNA zzso on zzso activity was also confirmed by zzso DNA zzso zzso which uncovered hundreds of zzso that became zzso only when zzso transport was zzso Our data establish zzso as a key zzso for the cellular zzso of zzso in leukemia cells and raise the possibility that zzso expression might be a useful zzso to predict the efficiency of zzso zzso Furthermore, our data suggest that zzso may represent a valuable compound for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
