To present a set of novel computerized analysis zzso to construct a zzso zzso diagnosis zzso system to differentiate lung cancer zzso and identify cancer cells in the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso methods, including application of zzso zzso may prove to be complementary to zzso diagnosis, especially when they are combined with zzso system for zzso zzso We trained a novel zzso system to recognize expression of the cancer zzso zzso zzso in lung cancer cells and then tested the accuracy of this system to distinguish zzso lung cancer from zzso and normal zzso The major characteristics of zzso zzso is to adapt detection parameters according to cellular image zzso Our newly developed zzso transform is able to zzso select different resolution and orientation features based on image content zzso 

zzso statistical and quantitative results as zzso performance evaluation are presented in this zzso 

The presented zzso and zzso system for cellular feature enhancement, zzso and zzso are very important in distinguishing benign and zzso zzso
