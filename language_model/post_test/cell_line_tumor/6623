Parkinson's disease zzso is characterized by the zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso into zzso and zzso which are observed as zzso bodies zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso However, inability to demonstrate zzso in many cell culture systems is a major drawback for effective in zzso modeling of AS zzso zzso zzso cloning approach, we generated zzso zzso and the recently reported zzso zzso zzso in the zzso repeat region of AS zzso While cloning zzso zzso a zzso deletion zzso zzso adjacent to the intended zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and green fluorescent protein zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells revealed zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso cells formed zzso as compared to zzso in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis demonstrated the formation of high molecular weight AS zzso zzso microscopic analysis of zzso cells expressing the zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated two distinct kinds of zzso Type I, which showed dense zzso zzso and Type II, which were largely zzso zzso inclusions without zzso zzso These two inclusions are reminiscent of zzso bodies and pale bodies observed in zzso zzso brain zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso in 4th zzso repeat lead to higher propensity of zzso of AS compared to other zzso
