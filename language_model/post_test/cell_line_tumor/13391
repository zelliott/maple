zzso zzso zzso is a common cause of zzso media and zzso of chronic zzso pulmonary disease, an increasing worldwide zzso Surface proteins zzso and zzso of zzso bind to a number of human receptors and may function in zzso zzso zzso events in the pathogen can generate hybrid proteins termed zzso However, whether certain key functions zzso zzso zzso zzso can be exchanged between these zzso families remains zzso In this study, we have shown that zzso can incorporate the zzso zzso region not only into rare zzso proteins devoid of zzso ability, but also into zzso which normally lack this zzso Further, a screen of zzso zzso revealed the presence of novel zzso zzso proteins zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso We demonstrate that the expression of zzso with the zzso domain enable zzso to bind both to cell surface zzso and to zzso the latter via zzso Such properties of zzso have not been reported to zzso The studies demonstrate that the zzso family is much more zzso than previously believed and illustrate the in zzso potential for exchange of functional regions between zzso proteins which could convey novel adhesive functions whilst enhancing immune zzso
