zzso of tumor growth by zzso has been shown to be an effective strategy in cancer therapy in zzso However, its widespread application has been hampered by difficulties in a large-scale production of the zzso zzso zzso rapid loss zzso of the zzso and the cumbersome daily zzso These limitations could be resolved by in zzso delivery and expression of the zzso zzso In this study, we observed the effect and advantage of zzso gene therapy zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso on the growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso tumors, comparison with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso in the flank of zzso nude zzso Nine days after tumor cell zzso animals were given a cycle of four courses of zzso injections of zzso of 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at intervals of six days, zzso zzso human zzso protein zzso was zzso daily zzso at a dose of 10 zzso at a site nearby the tumor for ten zzso The expression of zzso zzso in tumor tissue was analyzed by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso after zzso zzso Dynamic changes of concentration of zzso protein in tumor tissue were zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso 

After 4 courses of treatment, the tumor growth rates of high-dose treated group with 1 zzso zzso zzso of zzso were inhibited by zzso compared with the zzso control group zzso zzso zzso and by zzso compared with the zzso buffer control group zzso zzso zzso zzso However, in this study, zzso at low dose of 5 zzso zzso zzso failed to demonstrate significant zzso of tumor growth, compared with control zzso After daily administration of zzso human zzso protein zzso for 9 days, the ratio of zzso zzso group versus PBS zzso was less than zzso However, two days after zzso treatment zzso the ratio of zzso was more than zzso The peak of expression of zzso zzso in tumor tissue was at 2 or 3 days after administration zzso with zzso of 1 zzso zzso zzso and gradually dropped zzso by day zzso Dynamic analysis of zzso concentration in tumor tissue showed that the highest level of zzso is up at the third day after injection, and dropped to zzso level three weeks zzso 

zzso gene therapy zzso by a zzso zzso zzso had significantly inhibited the growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso tumors at a high dose of 1 zzso zzso zzso compared with other zzso The analysis of dynamic expression of zzso in zzso indicated that zzso had acquired a zzso relatively long-term expression in zzso and zzso zzso
