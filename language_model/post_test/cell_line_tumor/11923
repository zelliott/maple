To study the protective effect of zzso zzso brain derived zzso factors on nerve zzso 

zzso cells were infected by the zzso zzso In the zzso condition, the zzso changes were observed, and zzso method was used to examine the zzso effects of different zzso of zzso The whole cells DNA of infected and control groups were extracted to detect the DNA zzso marker of zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso gene promoted the cell survival and zzso It also inhibited the zzso induced cell zzso
