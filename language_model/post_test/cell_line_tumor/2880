zzso is a critical tumor zzso gene zzso frequently in various human zzso Previous studies have showed that zzso zzso expression is zzso by zzso in various cell zzso In present study, we have found that zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein expression in a zzso and zzso manner in zzso cell line zzso Based on the zzso promoter zzso report zzso we have found that zzso zzso is not affected by zzso By using zzso inhibitor zzso D zzso zzso the turnover rate of zzso transcripts appeared to be accelerated during zzso zzso which indicated that zzso of zzso by zzso was zzso What interested us was that zzso of zzso coding sequence increased zzso degradation of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso coding region was account for zzso zzso of zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso expression was blocked by the zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso suggesting zzso and zzso zzso signal pathways played crucial roles in zzso zzso via zzso zzso In this study, we also found zzso accelerated zzso of zzso through the zzso zzso zzso our data clearly demonstrated that zzso zzso of zzso was zzso and zzso depending on its coding zzso zzso and zzso signal pathways were involved in this zzso
