It is well established that after zzso cancer cells escape the primary zzso and enter the zzso their interactions with zzso zzso of a target organ constitute an essential zzso step in zzso cancer zzso However, the zzso and zzso processes supporting zzso cell arrest and retention in the zzso are still poorly zzso In this study, we present experimental evidence that zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso structures such as zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed on circulating zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso by marked increase in zzso cell surface zzso zzso causes gradual decrease in cancer cell zzso (from 72 zzso zzso 33 zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso accompanied by a corresponding increase in the percentage of rolling cells (from zzso zzso to zzso zzso mean zzso and results in human breast and prostate zzso cell arrest and retention in the zzso This process, which could be of high importance in zzso cancer zzso was inhibited efficiently by an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could be a process of zzso significance as it probably occurs in the interactions between a variety of circulating constituents and the vessel zzso
