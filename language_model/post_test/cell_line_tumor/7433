Different mechanisms of drug resistance, including zzso cassette (ABC) zzso are responsible for treatment failure of zzso We developed a zzso DNA zzso which contains 38 genes of the ABC zzso gene zzso This tool has been validated with three different zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso known to zzso either the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso When compared with their zzso parental lines, we observed not only the zzso of these genes in the zzso cell lines but also of other ABC zzso genes pointing to their possible role in zzso zzso These results were zzso by quantitative real-time reverse zzso As the zzso allows the determination of the expression profile of many ABC zzso in a single zzso experiment, it may be useful as a diagnostic tool to detect drug resistance in clinical zzso
