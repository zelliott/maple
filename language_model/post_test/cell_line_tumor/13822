Cellular zzso leading to cell death through prevention of regular cell renewal, is associated with the zzso of the tumor zzso gene zzso While this mechanism has been described as leading to progressive zzso loss, zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso has been linked to a zzso improved patient survival zzso While in both conditions zzso is also zzso the signaling zzso connecting zzso to zzso has not been characterized until this zzso 

Cell culture, zzso Western zzso zzso zzso proximity zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso zzso tumor cells zzso an zzso of zzso and zzso was zzso An increased expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso factors was zzso Using specific zzso a complex formation between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso A further complex partner was zzso zzso with zzso analysis for zzso and zzso indicated the involvement of both factors in the zzso zzso After specifically blocking the zzso zzso zzso expression was significantly zzso However, the zzso B zzso dependent zzso was stronger than that of the A zzso In contrast, primary zzso zzso cells showed a nuclear decrease after zzso zzso This indicates that other zzso members may be involved in the observed zzso zzso (as described in the zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso are important complex partners initiating increased zzso and zzso zzso in zzso tumor zzso
