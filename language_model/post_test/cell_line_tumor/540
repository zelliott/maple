Parkinson's disease zzso is the zzso attached to the most prevalent neurodegenerative movement disorder of adults, derived from observations of an early zzso century physician and zzso James zzso and is now recognized to zzso much more than a movement disorder clinically or zzso zzso death zzso Most zzso ( approximately zzso is sporadic zzso is associated with zzso deficiencies and has been studied in cell and animal models arising from the use of zzso toxins that zzso have not predicted clinical efficacy to slow disease progression in zzso We have extensively studied the zzso hybrid zzso model of zzso in which donor zzso are introduced into and expressed in neural tumor cells with identical nuclear genetic and environmental zzso zzso zzso demonstrate many abnormalities in which increased zzso stress drives downstream zzso response and cell death zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso regulate zzso zzso genes and gene zzso families like zzso zzso zzso zzso spontaneously form zzso bodies and zzso zzso linking zzso expression to zzso and demonstrate impaired zzso transport in processes and reduced zzso zzso Our recent studies show that zzso laser light therapy zzso zzso movement and can stimulate zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene therapy can restore zzso and stimulate zzso zzso gene and protein zzso zzso zzso have provided multiple lines of circumstantial evidence linking zzso to zzso zzso and can serve as platforms for therapy zzso zzso zzso models can be improved by the use of zzso human stem zzso neural precursor cells and by an introduction of zzso brain zzso to test its causality zzso
