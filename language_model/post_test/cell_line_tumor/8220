The aim of this study was to evaluate the zzso effect of zzso in terms of zzso zzso induction of zzso and to investigate the molecular events regulating zzso 

zzso cells were treated with zzso radiation, or the zzso zzso h after treatment, cells were collected for zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso 8 and 9, Bid and zzso expression were determined by western zzso The zzso membrane potential was determined using flow zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso for human zzso genes was performed after the combination or TRAIL zzso 

zzso and radiation resulted in an early zzso block immediately after treatment, after which the cells moved zzso through the cell zzso When zzso distribution returned to zzso levels, an increased induction of zzso was observed with zzso of zzso 8 and 9 and a reduction of the zzso membrane zzso Gene expression after treatment with zzso conditions was comparable with expression after the TRAIL zzso 

A role for the zzso zzso and the induction of zzso could be attributed to the zzso effect of zzso zzso induction was comparable with the zzso zzso observed after the TRAIL treatment, that is the involvement of the zzso zzso zzso
