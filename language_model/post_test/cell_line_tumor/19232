zzso D1 plays a critical role in controlling the zzso transition via the regulation of zzso zzso zzso Several studies have indicated that zzso D1 translation is decreased upon zzso of the zzso initiation factor zzso zzso zzso We examined the effect of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso D1 protein levels and translation and determined that zzso D1 protein levels decrease upon the induction of zzso and zzso zzso activity but that this decrease is not due to zzso zzso of the 26 S zzso with zzso rescued zzso D1 protein levels, indicating that rather than zzso translation, zzso and zzso act to increase zzso D1 zzso Interestingly, this effect still requires zzso zzso at zzso 51, as zzso D1 remains unaffected in cells containing a zzso form of the zzso This zzso degradation of zzso D1 requires an intact zzso pathway, although the zzso of zzso D1 is not itself zzso Furthermore, this degradation is independent of zzso of zzso D1 at zzso zzso which is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso pathways as described in previous zzso Our study reveals a novel functional zzso between zzso zzso and the zzso degradation of zzso D1 and that this degradation is dependent upon zzso zzso during short, but not zzso periods of zzso
