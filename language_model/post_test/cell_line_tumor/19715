The zzso zzso zzso zzso can increase vascular zzso growth factor zzso and zzso factor zzso zzso zzso We examined the effect of zzso an zzso zzso inhibitor that zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso expression and on zzso tumor zzso and zzso zzso decreases zzso expression under zzso via the zzso factor zzso which regulates the zzso core zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso and decreased zzso binding to a probe corresponding to the zzso zzso promoter in a gel shift zzso zzso also decreased the hypoxic induction of zzso which also regulates the zzso promoter, most likely by decreasing its zzso The effect of zzso on zzso expression had the functional consequence of decreasing zzso in an in zzso zzso plug zzso To determine the effect this might have on tumor zzso we did tumor regrowth zzso with zzso in nude zzso The combination of zzso and radiation increased time to regrowth compared with radiation alone whereas zzso alone had little effect on tumor zzso This zzso effect was greater than suggested by in zzso zzso survival zzso One possible explanation for the zzso is that zzso has an effect on tumor zzso zzso we examined this with the zzso marker zzso and found that zzso leads to increased zzso within tumor zzso Our results suggest that zzso decreases zzso expression and tumor zzso which could play a role in its in zzso zzso zzso These data support the use of zzso in combination with radiation in future clinical zzso
