zzso is a highly zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso These cells express the zzso fusion zzso whose zzso are characterized in this zzso The bacterial zzso zzso and the plant extract zzso are zzso drugs that have an zzso synergistic effect on the growth of zzso zzso We show that this zzso is accompanied by an enhancement of the induction of cell zzso zzso alone zzso cell cycle arrest in zzso whereas zzso zzso arrest in zzso We suggest that this additive pressure may drive cells to die, resulting in the synergistic interaction of the drug zzso These data emphasize the potential use of the zzso plus zzso combination as an zzso zzso
