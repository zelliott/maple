In the light of recent advances in tumor biology and zzso we hypothesized that zzso an zzso zzso zzso may have zzso effects on primary human zzso cells and rat zzso zzso zzso cell zzso We thought that zzso should exert its zzso effects by zzso zzso cell differentiation through the zzso zzso zzso receptors in the zzso zzso 

Human primary zzso zzso zzso cells were acquired zzso from ten patients aged between 45 and 69 years, diagnosed clinically and zzso with zzso The diagnosis was confirmed using zzso zzso Human zzso and rat zzso zzso zzso cells were cultivated in zzso to obtain zzso cell zzso zzso was then applied to these cultures in wells, each containing 500,000 tumor zzso 

zzso significantly decreased the number of human zzso cells at the zzso of 10 and 100 zzso For zzso a strong zzso correlation in tumor zzso was found zzso This zzso effect of zzso in human zzso cells was not observed in rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated differential effects on human zzso and rat zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso effects of zzso on human zzso need to be investigated further in in zzso zzso
