In zzso zzso has been shown to bud into zzso structures that contain the late zzso marker zzso We show that these zzso are not zzso but an internally zzso plasma membrane zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso zzso we find that zzso buds into a compartment that contains the zzso zzso zzso and zzso On zzso zzso these proteins are seen at the cell surface and in zzso zzso structures with a complex content of zzso and interconnected zzso that lack zzso zzso including zzso zzso these structures are accessible to small zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso applied to cells at 4 degrees C, indicating that they are connected to the cell zzso zzso assembles on, and accumulates zzso these zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso is recruited to the zzso structures and incorporated into zzso These results indicate that, in zzso zzso exploits a previously zzso zzso plasma membrane domain to assemble infectious zzso
