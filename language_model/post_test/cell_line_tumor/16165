The zzso family member zzso zzso 3 zzso is structurally related to the well characterized zzso that zzso cellular responses to DNA strand breaks and cell death by the synthesis of zzso In contrast to zzso and zzso the functions of zzso are zzso Here, we reveal critical functions for zzso during zzso zzso 

We have used several in zzso and in zzso approaches to examine the possible functions of zzso as a zzso regulator, a function suggested from its previously reported association with several zzso group zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso gene occupancy in the human zzso cell line zzso occurs zzso with zzso genes regulating cell fate zzso tissue zzso zzso development and zzso Addressing the significance of this association during zzso development, we show that zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression in zzso zzso the expression of the neural crest cell zzso zzso and of zzso the formation of zzso sensory zzso inner ears and zzso zzso It delays pigmentation and severely zzso the development of the median fin fold and tail zzso 

Our findings demonstrate that zzso is crucial in the early stages of zzso development, possibly by exerting its zzso regulatory functions as early as during the zzso of the neural plate zzso
