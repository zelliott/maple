In several recent studies, we have shown that zzso can be a poor zzso factor and a factor of zzso in zzso zzso especially in the advanced zzso In our study, we investigated whether zzso alters the expression of zzso regulatory proteins as a mechanism of drug zzso We zzso zzso zzso into zzso cells zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso cells displayed a zzso zzso and zzso increase in zzso against zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso to zzso on zzso cells demonstrated zzso 51% and zzso decrease in zzso To investigate the mechanism of zzso zzso we also assessed whether zzso zzso had an effect on zzso zzso death of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso cells exhibited a strong zzso response to zzso while zzso cells exhibited a weak zzso zzso In an attempt to identify the mechanism of the zzso effect on zzso response to zzso we next assessed the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso While treatment of zzso cells with zzso exhibited increased levels of zzso zzso 3, zzso 7 and zzso 9 compared to that after no treatment, zzso cells did not show any expression of these zzso These results suggest that zzso reduces sensitivity to zzso drugs via zzso of zzso zzso and may be a molecular target for conquering zzso drug zzso
