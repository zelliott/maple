We have previously demonstrated that bovine zzso zzso extract zzso zzso death through an zzso mechanism in zzso breast cancer zzso Depending on the cell type and zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to regulate cell proliferation and zzso the stress response, zzso and zzso It remains unknown whether zzso and other zzso factors are mechanisms by which zzso zzso cell zzso 

To determine whether zzso zzso the zzso DNA binding and gene zzso zzso breast cancer cells were treated with zzso zzso 1, 5, 10 zzso for 72 h and evaluated by zzso mobility shift zzso reverse zzso chain reaction and Western zzso zzso 

zzso induced zzso of cell growth, suppressed the zzso zzso activity, decreased zzso protein expression and modulated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor gene expression in zzso breast cancer zzso 

The present data indicate that zzso can block the zzso zzso activity and expression of several transcriptions factors in breast cancer cells, which will have great potential in improving cancer zzso
