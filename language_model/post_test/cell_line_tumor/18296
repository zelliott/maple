zzso is the most common form of primary bone zzso In this study, we established a human zzso cell line zzso zzso from a highly aggressive primary zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated a large number of zzso zzso as well as extensive zzso zzso Through the use of zzso zzso and zzso zzso we characterized protein and gene expression profiles confirming the zzso nature of the zzso Further evaluation indicated that zzso zzso cells maintain the capacity to differentiate in an in zzso zzso zzso as well as form tumors in the in zzso chicken zzso zzso This cell line provides a useful tool to investigate the molecular mechanisms contributing to zzso and may have the potential to serve as a culture system for studies involving bone zzso
