Since Otto Warburg linked zzso physiology and zzso in the 1930s, a number of studies have focused on the analysis of the genetic basis for the presence of zzso zzso in cancer zzso However, little or no evidence exists today to indicate that zzso zzso are directly responsible for the initiation of tumor zzso Based on a model of zzso in the zzso we aimed to explore whether or not zzso zzso are associated with the initiation of tumor formation, maintenance and zzso We reproduced the different molecular events that lead from tumor initiation to progression in the mouse zzso In human zzso most of the genetic zzso that have been previously identified result in the zzso zzso of different signaling pathways and deregulation of the cell zzso Our data indicates that zzso dysfunction is associated with zzso oxygen species zzso generation, leading to increased nuclear DNA zzso zzso but maintaining the integrity of the zzso zzso In addition, zzso stability has been observed in entire zzso of human zzso this is in full agreement with the results obtained in the cancer mouse zzso We use this model as a paradigm of zzso transformation due to the fact that zzso commonly found in zzso appear to be the most common molecular zzso leading to tumor development in most types of human zzso Our results indicate that the zzso zzso is kept by the cell as a zzso zzso during tumor development in the mouse and zzso This is compatible with the hypothesis that the zzso zzso plays an essential role in the control of the cellular zzso survival response to zzso zzso zzso The integrity of zzso seems to be a necessary element for responding to the increased zzso production associated with the zzso zzso
