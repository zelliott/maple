The zzso activity of zzso zzso makes them potentially useful as zzso zzso zzso We used the zzso patch to study the effect of zzso B zzso having one zzso and one zzso zzso and its zzso zzso B3 zzso having two zzso zzso on the membrane of zzso cancer zzso Application of zzso zzso CB onto the membrane of the cancer cell produces short outward zzso Comparative study with zzso which zzso no outward zzso shows that the zzso group of CB is necessary for the pore zzso The results provide a rationale to study the zzso activity of zzso peptides at the single cancer cell zzso
