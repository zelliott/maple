zzso zzso is part of the zzso cluster associated with cardiac zzso Here, we investigated the effects of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso and regulation of the zzso signaling zzso in the zzso zzso zzso cell line that can be induced to undergo zzso zzso cells were zzso with the zzso zzso or empty zzso and zzso zzso was verified by zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso or zzso control stable cell lines were selected using zzso S zzso and their zzso cell cycle, and zzso levels were analyzed using the Cell Counting zzso and flow zzso zzso cell differentiation zzso zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso genes were detected by zzso the corresponding proteins by Western zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and differentiation marker proteins was also verified by zzso zzso changes associated with zzso were observed by electron zzso and zzso zzso On the basis of these results, we demonstrated that zzso zzso promoted proliferation and differentiation but inhibited zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso expressions were zzso while that of zzso was increased with zzso zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso of the zzso signaling zzso in zzso cells, which may regulate zzso zzso Our findings may bring new insights into the mechanisms underlying cardiac diseases and suggest that zzso is a potential new therapeutic target for cardiovascular zzso
