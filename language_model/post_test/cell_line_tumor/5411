zzso proteins are essential for a number of zzso processes and are zzso expressed in many human zzso zzso factors bind DNA and zzso to activate or repress genes crucial for bone formation, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a nuclear protein that regulates gene zzso zzso zzso and is zzso in many human zzso In this study, we identified zzso as a zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of reporter genes in a zzso zzso zzso zzso also blocked zzso repression of the zzso promoter, a novel zzso target zzso The zzso of zzso is essential for binding the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso In zzso mobility shift zzso zzso inhibited zzso interactions with zzso These data indicate that zzso is an inhibitor of zzso factors and can zzso zzso factor regulation of gene zzso zzso is expressed at high levels in human fetal zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso interference reduced zzso cell viability in zzso suggesting that it contributes to the proliferation and/or survival of zzso lineage zzso
