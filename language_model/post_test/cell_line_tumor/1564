zzso zzso is a common type of cancer that is usually associated with poor zzso In this study, we examined the in zzso and in zzso mechanisms of the traditional Vietnamese herb zzso zzso on the zzso of zzso human zzso zzso cell zzso zzso cells were treated with different zzso of zzso zzso extracts zzso and analyzed with the zzso zzso western zzso analysis, flow zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso zzso nude mouse model was applied to confirm the cellular zzso zzso showed a strong zzso of zzso cell viability in a zzso manner and significantly reduced cell zzso proteins as well as induced cell cycle arrest in the zzso zzso zzso zzso 2A zzso zzso or zzso acid totally blocked zzso cell proliferation zzso In addition, an zzso nude mouse model further confirmed that zzso inhibit zzso tumor cell growth and zzso the survival and cell cycle regulating zzso as well as activate the zzso zzso Our findings indicate that the zzso of zzso cell proliferation by zzso is zzso through zzso zzso
