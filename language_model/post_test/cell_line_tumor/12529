zzso domain zzso repeat protein zzso zzso directly zzso and zzso zzso and protein zzso C, zzso it as a prime target for pharmacological intervention of two major survival zzso Here we report on the discovery of small zzso zzso of the zzso activity of zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso for which there are no general pharmacological zzso First, the Diversity Set of the zzso was screened for zzso of the zzso zzso domain of zzso in zzso Second, selected libraries from the open zzso database were zzso into a virtual model of the zzso domain of zzso previously trained with our experimental data set, unveiling additional zzso zzso and cellular zzso resulted in the identification of two structurally diverse compounds that selectively inhibit zzso in zzso increase zzso signaling in cells, and prevent zzso Thus, chemical and virtual screening has resulted in the identification of small molecules that promote zzso signaling by zzso its negative regulator zzso
