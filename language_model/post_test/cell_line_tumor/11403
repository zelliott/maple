zzso zzso of zzso factors zzso have been implicated in the zzso of zzso In many zzso zzso of zzso results in zzso activity of them without changing their gene expression zzso Gene expression data from zzso or zzso experiments can capture the expression change of zzso however, it is still challenge to reveal the activity change of zzso 

Here we propose a method, called zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso binding data with gene expression data to identify zzso with significantly differential activity between disease and normal zzso zzso successfully detect differential activity of zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso samples in 10 breast cancer zzso When applied to compare tumor and normal breast samples, it reveals zzso that are critical for zzso of breast zzso Moreover, zzso can be zzso to identify zzso programs that are zzso to patient survival time of breast cancer zzso 

zzso provides a useful tool to investigate regulatory programs underlying a biological process providing the related case and control gene expression zzso Considering the enormous amount of cancer gene expression data and the increasingly accumulating zzso data, we expect wide application of zzso for revealing the regulatory mechanisms of various zzso
