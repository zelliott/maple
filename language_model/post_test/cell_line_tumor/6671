zzso is one of the putative zzso genes on zzso which frequently lacks expression in many different kind of tumors, such as glioblastoma, and zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, little is known about the reasons for this lack of expression in zzso In a previous report, our group demonstrated how zzso a zzso cell line which lacked zzso zzso restored it after a zzso zzso So, we wondered whether zzso zzso promoter zzso could be responsible for zzso zzso in several tumor cell lines, in spite of the fact that there is no zzso island near the zzso end of the zzso We studied the possibility that zzso in zzso sequences of the zzso promoter (where zzso means zzso or zzso is able to silence the zzso as had previously been reported for zzso in zzso We zzso zzso DNA by the zzso sensitive restriction zzso zzso II zzso and made two zzso to amplify the three zzso zzso placed in the 1 zzso upstream zzso zzso zzso After the zzso we could not find correlation between zzso in zzso zzso and zzso lack of zzso A positive regulator of zzso might be silenced by zzso zzso
