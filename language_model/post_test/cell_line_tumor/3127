In addition to the activity of heat shock protein 90 zzso as a zzso some recent studies have reported expression of zzso at the cell surface in certain types of cancer and nervous system zzso We study the expression of zzso at the cell surface in human zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments labeling with zzso zzso on both zzso cells and live cells detected zzso at the cell zzso zzso was also identified in a membrane fraction from zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly more expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells than in differentiated flattened zzso In addition, zzso cells were significantly more sensitive to zzso inhibitor zzso compared to flattened zzso This paper describes the first evidence of zzso zzso expression in a cancer cell line from nervous tissue and may indicate a novel target for zzso zzso
