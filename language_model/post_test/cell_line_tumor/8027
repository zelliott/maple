Cystic zzso zzso is a zzso disease caused by zzso in the zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso zzso zzso is characterized by chronic bacterial lung infections and zzso and we have previously reported that tissue zzso zzso a zzso zzso critical to several diseases, is zzso zzso in zzso airways and drives chronic zzso Here, we demonstrate that the generation of an zzso stress induced by zzso function leads to protein inhibitor of activated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso degradation, leading to sustained zzso zzso This prevents zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso and to an uncontrolled inflammatory zzso Cellular zzso can be restored by small zzso modifier zzso or zzso gene zzso which induce zzso zzso and zzso degradation, restore zzso zzso and prevent zzso zzso and degradation, thus switching off zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as the treatment with the synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso control zzso interaction and zzso zzso zzso zzso switches off inflammation in zzso as well as in zzso in a zzso zzso mouse zzso Thus, zzso may function as a link between zzso stress and inflammation by driving the decision as to whether a protein should undergo zzso regulation or zzso zzso zzso interactions might represent a new option to control disease evolution in zzso patients as well as in other chronic inflammatory diseases, neurodegenerative zzso and zzso
