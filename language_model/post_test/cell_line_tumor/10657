In previous studies we demonstrated uniform strong expression of zzso in the zzso attachment to the tooth and in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of serum zzso zzso with zzso zzso correlated with reduced severity of zzso zzso In the present study an zzso culture model with close correspondence for expression patterns for tight junction components in zzso zzso was zzso zzso of zzso expressed by oral zzso cells with an zzso zzso induced formation of tight junctions and zzso imaging confirmed that zzso diffusion of zzso zzso was zzso zzso of zzso and protein for zzso zzso zzso junction zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly increased following zzso of zzso but only zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were increased at cell zzso This change in expression patterns reflected that observed between the zzso of the zzso zzso and that of the healthy zzso zzso In the model system, response profiles to zzso zzso indicated a key role of zzso zzso zzso in the development of zzso tight junction zzso zzso was confirmed by demonstrating zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso against zzso and zzso prevented zzso effects of zzso zzso while zzso with zzso to zzso was partially zzso It is concluded that zzso to zzso facilitate expression and location of zzso zzso and zzso that mediate enhanced zzso barrier function in a protective response against bacterial zzso
