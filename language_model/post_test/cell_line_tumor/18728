zzso of zzso zzso at zzso 139 occurs at sites surrounding DNA zzso breaks, producing discrete spots called zzso that are visible with a microscope after zzso zzso This modification is believed to create changes in zzso structure and assemble various repair proteins at sites of DNA zzso To examine the role of zzso structure, human zzso cells were exposed to zzso salt solutions that are known to zzso zzso and sensitize cells to zzso damage and killing by zzso zzso zzso incubation in zzso M zzso increased zzso expression about fourfold as measured by flow zzso and zzso and loss of zzso was inhibited in the presence of high zzso Focus size rather than the number of zzso zzso zzso was also increased about zzso When zzso treatment was delayed for 1 h after zzso effects on focus size and retention were zzso The increase in focus size was associated with a decrease in the rate of rejoining of zzso breaks as measured using the neutral comet zzso We conclude that zzso expression after zzso is sensitive to zzso changes in zzso structure during focus formation, and that a large focus size may be an indication of a reduced ability to repair DNA zzso
