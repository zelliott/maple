zzso and zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso zzso factors that interact with inflammatory background cells and may serve as zzso for disease zzso To detect new proteins related to zzso we analyzed the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in cell culture zzso of 4 zzso cell lines were identified using zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso In total, zzso zzso including 368 zzso zzso were zzso zzso grouping of zzso proteins revealed 37 proteins involved in immune zzso Sixteen of the 37 proteins zzso zzso zzso C, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were validated in zzso cell lines and patient material using zzso and/or zzso zzso of all 16 proteins was confirmed in zzso cell lines, and 15 were also confirmed in zzso zzso Seven proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso revealed significantly elevated levels in patient plasma compared with healthy zzso zzso analyses of zzso cell line zzso allowed detection of new zzso zzso which may add to our insights in the interaction between zzso cells and zzso zzso and in some instances might serve as zzso
