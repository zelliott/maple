zzso in translation occur in cancer cells, but the precise zzso processes and zzso zzso are not well zzso In this study, we report that interactions between zzso family zzso and the translation initiation factor zzso are critical for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso both directly zzso zzso on zzso and zzso zzso of zzso on zzso was highly sensitive to zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso relied upon zzso zzso activity in both zzso and zzso zzso cells based on their blockade by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso of zzso zzso resistance to zzso by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso and also inhibited their growth as zzso tumors in nude zzso zzso these zzso we found that primary bone zzso cells derived from zzso transgenic mice were less susceptible to zzso zzso relative to cells from zzso zzso Taken together, our results identify zzso as a critical zzso of zzso zzso in zzso the activity of zzso zzso and they highlight zzso as a candidate therapeutic target for treatment of zzso zzso
