zzso chemotherapy brings the advantage of minimizing systemic toxicity towards healthy zzso and zzso while has the drawbacks of limited zzso zzso and low drug zzso at targeted zzso The aim of our study is to apply a clinically available mild zzso zzso treatment with zzso zzso zzso to tackle both zzso A zzso zzso approach was combined with systemic administration of zzso zzso zzso in a first step to maximize zzso zzso in tumors and second step to actively trigger zzso zzso The therapeutic activity of the zzso approach was compared to a zzso zzso triggering zzso zzso release from circulating zzso Whereas the zzso drug release approach requires fast releasing zzso zzso the zzso zzso used in the zzso approach is fine-tuned to prolong zzso retention at zzso temperature in zzso while releasing their drug content at mild zzso at a slower rate zzso zzso zzso show that a zzso zzso at zzso for zzso causes no drug resistance on zzso zzso zzso human zzso melanoma cell lines and Human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso towards subsequent exposure to zzso However, zzso zzso zzso towards zzso at higher zzso zzso After zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso for zzso was applied to trigger zzso release from zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso approach increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso reaching levels comparable to the zzso release zzso The zzso zzso in combination with zzso delayed tumor growth for zzso compared to PBS group, however, was less effective compared to zzso zzso release from zzso using zzso zzso The zzso approach focuses on zzso drug release upon mild zzso instead of zzso drug zzso This novel zzso approach represents an attractive alternative for the treatment of large and deep seated tumors, which are difficult to heat precisely and require zzso zzso of the tumor area and accumulated zzso zzso to obtain a precise zzso drug zzso
