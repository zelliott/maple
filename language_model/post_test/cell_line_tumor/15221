Twist is an zzso transition zzso zzso factor that zzso cell zzso Our research has shown that zzso zzso regulates the zzso factor zzso The underlying signaling zzso is zzso We hypothesized that zzso activates Twist to induce zzso in human breast zzso 

Potential zzso for Twist were identified using zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were applied to human breast cancer cells zzso zzso zzso After 24 zzso Twist was zzso and incubated with zzso zzso of the Twist target zzso zzso was determined following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used as the zzso zzso zzso was zzso 12, 24, and 48 h after zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso caused zzso twofold decrease in Twist zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blockade of zzso in zzso decreased zzso protein twofold zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were significantly decreased in cell migration and wound closure in the scratch zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We demonstrate that zzso zzso binding to zzso activates an zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso resulting in Twist zzso and promoting zzso expression to further zzso initiation and cellular zzso Our results zzso a previously zzso role for zzso as a prime regulator of zzso in human breast cancer zzso
