zzso cell zzso zzso is genetically characterized by the zzso zzso and a high number of secondary zzso zzso However, only a limited number of target genes have been zzso We have studied 10 zzso cell lines and 28 primary tumors with a combination of a zzso zzso zzso array and gene expression zzso We detected highly altered zzso in the majority of the samples with a high number of partial zzso zzso zzso The zzso at zzso was one of the most common, and it was associated with zzso gene zzso zzso deletions targeted 4 known tumor zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso and 6 new genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Gene amplification coupled with zzso was identified in 35 different zzso The most zzso amplified regions were zzso zzso and zzso which targeted zzso zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso all the zzso zzso including zzso were significantly associated with zzso regions enriched in copy number zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso at these regions may play a role in the zzso instability of zzso This zzso zzso analysis has revealed target genes that may be potentially relevant in zzso zzso
