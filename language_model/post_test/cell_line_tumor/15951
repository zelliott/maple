Lung cancer, especially zzso cell lung cancer zzso is the major cause of zzso deaths in the United zzso The aggressiveness of zzso has been shown to be associated with the acquisition of zzso transition zzso The acquisition of zzso zzso induced by zzso several cancer cells has been implicated in tumor aggressiveness and resistance to conventional zzso however, the molecular mechanism of zzso and tumor aggressiveness in zzso remains zzso 

In this study we found for the first time that the induction of zzso by chronic exposure of zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso led to the zzso of sonic zzso zzso both at the zzso and protein levels causing zzso of zzso zzso These results were also reproduced in another zzso cell line zzso zzso of zzso was found to be consistent with aggressive characteristics such as increased zzso growth, cell zzso and zzso The aggressiveness of these cells was attenuated by the treatment of zzso cells with pharmacological zzso of zzso signaling in addition to zzso zzso by zzso The zzso of zzso signaling by pharmacological zzso led to the reversal of zzso zzso as confirmed by the reduction of zzso markers such as zzso and zzso and induction of zzso marker zzso In addition, zzso of zzso by zzso significantly attenuated zzso induction by zzso 

Our results show for the first time the zzso zzso of zzso by zzso which is mechanistically associated with zzso induced zzso zzso and aggressive behavior of zzso zzso Thus the zzso of zzso signaling could be useful for the reversal of zzso zzso which would inhibit the zzso potential of zzso cells and also make these tumors more sensitive to conventional zzso
