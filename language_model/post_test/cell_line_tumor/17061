We have cloned a zzso from zzso band zzso designated as zzso zzso protein 1, originally named zzso Database searches revealed that zzso shares most of its open reading frame with zzso Single zzso zzso zzso screening revealed a high zzso of zzso in the coding region of zzso (12 zzso zzso A collection of 140 controls and 22 cases from the zzso area was zzso at 6 zzso zzso The 22 cases exhibited higher zzso of minor zzso than did the controls, and 2 sites revealed significant differences between the controls and the zzso We constructed 2 zzso zzso (with common zzso at 5 zzso zzso and zzso (with minor zzso at 5 zzso zzso in a zzso expression zzso Both zzso resulted in a remarkable reduction in colony formation and suppression of cell growth after being zzso into the human zzso zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso effect of zzso was stronger than that of zzso Different zzso also resulted in different gene expression profiles in the zzso cell line according to an examination of 588 genes on an zzso zzso The expression induced by zzso caused an zzso of genes involved in cellular proliferation and a zzso of genes involved in cellular zzso and DNA zzso These results, in addition to the statistical data, are biological evidence that the zzso zzso of zzso has a reduced zzso effect on zzso cell growth and an impaired DNA repair zzso This suggests that zzso may be related to cancer zzso
