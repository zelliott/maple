zzso is a zzso compound present in steamed ginger zzso zzso a commonly used zzso zzso zzso respond to nutrients like zzso zzso acids and fatty zzso by an increase in the zzso free zzso concentration zzso which mediates diverse cellular processes in these zzso Some zzso compounds activate the transient zzso potential zzso zzso type 1 zzso zzso 

We investigated whether zzso could trigger zzso signals in the zzso 

zzso was measured from single zzso cells by zzso zzso using zzso as the zzso zzso 

In zzso loaded single rat zzso zzso cells, a widely used model of zzso zzso increased zzso in a zzso zzso zzso increase by zzso was completely blocked when zzso was omitted from the zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of the zzso zzso channel completely inhibited the zzso zzso zzso zzso increase obtained by 1 zzso zzso was greater than that obtained by 10 zzso zzso Moreover, a zzso concentration of zzso zzso zzso significantly enhanced the zzso zzso increase in these zzso 

We conclude that zzso zzso zzso signals in the zzso by zzso the zzso channels, and it zzso the zzso to stimulation by zzso
