zzso a novel zzso gene activated during the early response to DNA damage, can inhibit proliferation via zzso when zzso in some tumor zzso The objectives of this study were to determine whether zzso could enhance zzso induced by zzso besides its induction of zzso and to evaluate the usefulness of combined treatment with mouse zzso zzso gene therapy and zzso zzso chemotherapy in the zzso of tumor growth in colon zzso zzso and Lewis lung zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In this study, the in zzso zzso and zzso effects of zzso and/or zzso on zzso zzso and zzso cancer cells were assessed by zzso zzso flow zzso analysis, DNA zzso and zzso analysis, zzso The in zzso zzso activity of combined treatment with zzso gene therapy and zzso zzso were evaluated in the zzso of tumor growth in colon zzso zzso and Lewis lung zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso volume and survival time were zzso zzso of zzso was also assessed in tumor zzso 

In zzso zzso inhibited proliferation of colon zzso zzso Lewis lung zzso zzso and human zzso cancer zzso cell lines via zzso and significantly enhanced the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso cells induced by zzso In zzso systemic administration of expression zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso significantly decreased tumor growth through increased tumor cell zzso compared to treatment with zzso or zzso zzso 

Our data suggests that the combined treatment with zzso plus zzso may augment the induction of zzso in tumor cells in zzso and in zzso and that the zzso zzso activity in zzso may result from the increased induction of zzso The present study may provide a novel way to augment the zzso efficacy of zzso zzso
