Target cell resistance against natural killer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso Several mechanisms of resistance have been zzso Because of lack of simple zzso for zzso these mechanisms, their relative impact on a given zzso pair is mostly zzso We here zzso the combination of the zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the assessment of zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso to estimate target cell escape zzso Target cell recognition failure leads to negative zzso zzso results, whereas target cell resistance shows positive zzso zzso results in the absence of zzso We confronted zzso cells with the sensitive target cell line zzso and with the resistant cell lines zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells sufficiently activated zzso whilst being resistant against zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso resistance of zzso results from the interaction of zzso class I with zzso killer zzso receptors zzso on the zzso zzso Failure of target recognition by zzso class zzso interaction, lacking zzso to zzso zzso cell receptors and partial resistance to zzso zzso all contributed to resistance of zzso In conclusion, revealing the mechanisms of resistance against zzso zzso zzso may allow improving the results of zzso zzso
