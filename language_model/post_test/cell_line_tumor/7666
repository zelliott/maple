Tight junction protein zzso zzso is mainly involved in the zzso barrier function of zzso cells and is known to be zzso in many cancer types, including gastrointestinal zzso However, the mechanisms behind their potential involvement in the proliferation and survival of tumor cells remain zzso In this study we sought to investigate the potential role and possible regulators of zzso in gastric zzso By analyzing the gastric tumors from publicly available zzso zzso zzso expression profiles, zzso was identified to be zzso in gastric tumors when compared with normal gastric zzso Association between zzso expression and clinical molecular zzso characteristics of gastric cancer showed an elevated zzso expression pattern in zzso and zzso types of gastric zzso Using in zzso zzso zzso analysis in gastric cancer cell lines, we confirmed the potential role of zzso in cellular zzso Aided by the zzso analysis of the zzso prediction method with zzso expression in gastric tumors, we demonstrated the negative association between zzso and zzso expression in gastric zzso Our results highlight the potential involvement of zzso expression in gastric zzso
