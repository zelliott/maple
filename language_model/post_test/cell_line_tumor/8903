zzso invasion is a prominent clinical feature of various zzso which causes difficulty in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso a potent zzso factor, plays an important role in the invasive and zzso behavior of various zzso The aim of this study was to examine the role of zzso on oral zzso cell zzso 

zzso expression in tissue samples was analyzed by zzso zzso zzso zzso Western zzso reverse zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso zzso were carried out to assess the effects of zzso on oral cancer zzso 

Human oral cancer zzso showed higher zzso expression than that in normal zzso We also found that application of human zzso enhanced the cell migration ability of human oral zzso Moreover, treatment with zzso increased zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression in oral zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in oral cancer cells by pharmacological zzso or zzso zzso reduced zzso cell zzso Moreover, zzso with zzso against zzso inhibited zzso cell zzso Treatment with zzso also increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso DNA binding activity in human oral cancer zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso also reduced zzso oral cancer cell zzso In zzso zzso oral cancer cells showed a higher migration ability than that of the original oral cancer zzso Surprisingly, the enhancement of cell migratory activity in zzso zzso was reduced by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of oral cancer revealed higher zzso zzso 

These results indicate a regulatory effect on cell migration by zzso in oral zzso zzso
