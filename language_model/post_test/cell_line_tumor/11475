In this study, we identify zzso zzso 1 zzso as a novel zzso of the zzso zzso orphan zzso zzso and zzso zzso interacts directly with zzso and zzso and zzso regulates their zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso is essential for the interaction, whereas zzso interacts with zzso through either its 28 zzso acids zzso region or its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stabilize the interaction between zzso and zzso The zzso and the interaction through the zzso domain of zzso are critical for its repression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that in liver, zzso is recruited to the zzso response element sites of the clock zzso brain and muscle zzso protein 1 zzso zzso zzso domain protein 2 zzso and zzso 1 zzso as part of the same complex as zzso zzso of zzso by zzso in human zzso zzso cells increased the expression of zzso and several zzso zzso along with increased zzso zzso at these zzso response element zzso zzso zzso sequencing analysis suggests that zzso is a potential zzso target gene in liver, which is supported by the regulation of the rhythmic expression of zzso by zzso Our data suggest that zzso is part of a feedback loop that zzso regulates the zzso control of clock and zzso networks by zzso
