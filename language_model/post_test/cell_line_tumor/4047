zzso zzso in the promoter of the gene coding for zzso reverse zzso zzso have been described and proposed to activate gene zzso 

To investigate zzso zzso frequency, spectrum, association with expression and clinical outcome, and potential for detection of zzso in urine in patients with zzso zzso cancer zzso 

A set of 111 zzso of different stages was used to assess zzso promoter zzso by zzso sequencing and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression by reverse zzso zzso chain zzso The two most frequent zzso were investigated, using a zzso zzso in an independent set of 184 zzso and 173 zzso zzso zzso zzso 53 zzso and 21 zzso zzso zzso urine from patients with suspicion of incident zzso zzso or under surveillance after diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso was tested using a zzso zzso 

Association of zzso status with age, sex, zzso stage, grade, zzso growth factor zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso survival, zzso survival, and overall zzso 

In the two series, 78 of 111 zzso and 283 of zzso zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso being the most frequent substitution zzso for both zzso zzso zzso were not associated with clinical or zzso zzso but were more frequent among zzso zzso tumors zzso There was no association between zzso zzso and zzso expression zzso zzso were not associated with clinical zzso In zzso zzso zzso had zzso specificity in subjects with zzso but no zzso zzso and zzso in recurrence-free zzso zzso The sensitivity was zzso in incident and zzso in zzso zzso A limitation of the study is its retrospective zzso 

zzso zzso promoter zzso are an early, highly prevalent genetic event in zzso and are not associated with zzso zzso levels or disease zzso A zzso zzso in urine may help to detect zzso zzso
