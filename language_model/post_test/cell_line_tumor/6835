The Ewing family of tumors harbors zzso zzso that join the zzso region of the zzso gene with the zzso region of several zzso factors of the zzso family, mainly zzso resulting in zzso zzso factors that play a pivotal role in the zzso of Ewing zzso To identify downstream targets of the zzso fusion zzso we established zzso cells expressing zzso either the zzso zzso or wild type zzso proteins and used zzso zzso to identify genes zzso regulated by zzso zzso zzso an unusual orphan nuclear zzso involved in zzso development, sex determination and zzso showed a consistent zzso by zzso zzso but not by wild type zzso zzso induction of zzso by zzso was confirmed in two independent cell systems with zzso expression of zzso We also analyzed the expression of zzso in Ewing tumors and derived cell lines, as well as in other zzso small round cell zzso zzso was expressed in all Ewing tumor specimens zzso and in seven out of eight Ewing tumor cell lines, but not in any zzso or zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso by zzso interference in a Ewing tumor cell line markedly reduced the levels of zzso zzso and zzso confirming that zzso zzso is dependent upon zzso zzso The high levels of zzso found in Ewing tumors and its potent zzso zzso activity suggest that the zzso effect of zzso may be zzso at least in part, by the zzso of zzso zzso
