Gene therapy and stem cell transplantation safety could be enhanced by control over the fate of therapeutic zzso Suicide gene therapy uses zzso that convert zzso to zzso zzso however, zzso zzso with poor zzso are zzso We describe a novel zzso combination for selectively inducing zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso designed zzso of human zzso zzso zzso that effectively zzso zzso zzso were efficiently zzso zzso zzso cell lines were eliminated by zzso We demonstrate that this zzso targeted both dividing and zzso cells, with a novel killing mechanism involving zzso induction via disruption of the zzso inner membrane potential and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and human T cells were also zzso and responded to zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso administration to non-obese zzso combined zzso zzso mice injected with zzso zzso cells suppressed tumor zzso This novel suicide gene therapy approach can thus be integrated as a safety switch into therapeutic zzso
