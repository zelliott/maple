Resistance to chemotherapy limits the effectiveness of zzso drug zzso Here, we present a new approach to overcome the setback of drug resistance by designing a zzso of a zzso zzso and the zzso agent zzso zzso Two different zzso zzso and zzso were designed and their zzso delivery efficiency was characterized by zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso was zzso to the transport peptides and the ability of the zzso zzso to inhibit zzso zzso the target zzso of zzso was found to be 15 and 20 times less potent than zzso In addition, in zzso studies were performed in a drug resistant cell model using the zzso zzso resistant breast cancer cells zzso At a concentration of 1 zzso the zzso zzso were shown to overcome zzso resistance and kill the cells more efficiently than zzso zzso zzso zzso were determined for zzso zzso and zzso to be zzso zzso and 20 zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is a new way of increasing delivery, and zzso the potency of already zzso therapeutic molecules into drug resistant zzso zzso
