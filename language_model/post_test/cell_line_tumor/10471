Conventional chemotherapy and zzso produce marginal survival benefits in pancreatic cancer, zzso the need for novel zzso The aim of this study is to develop an adoptive T cell transfer approach to target zzso expressing prostate stem cell zzso zzso a zzso zzso that is frequently expressed by pancreatic cancer zzso 

zzso of zzso on cell lines and primary zzso samples was confirmed by zzso Healthy zzso and zzso T cells were isolated, activated in zzso using zzso and zzso with a zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting zzso The ability of these cells to kill zzso cells was zzso by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso stem cell zzso was expressed on zzso of the primary zzso samples zzso zzso zzso T cells could be readily generated in clinically relevant numbers and were specifically able to kill zzso pancreatic cancer cell lines with no zzso killing of zzso target cells, thus indicating the potential efficacy and safety of this zzso 

zzso stem cell zzso is frequently expressed on pancreatic cancer cells and can be targeted for zzso destruction using zzso zzso transferred T zzso The safety and efficacy of this approach indicate that it deserves further study and may represent a promising novel treatment for patients with pancreatic zzso
