zzso syndromes zzso are a group of zzso zzso characterized by ineffective zzso Recently, we identified zzso zzso zzso that are zzso in zzso This study examines possible explanations for that observed zzso of zzso expression in zzso Since zzso losses are insufficient to explain the zzso of all our zzso zzso we explored other zzso We demonstrate that these zzso are predominantly zzso and that, in many cases, they and their host genes are expressed in a similar pattern during zzso zzso suggesting their zzso This zzso is further supported by the zzso of several of the host genes in zzso and increased zzso of the shared promoters of several zzso and their respective host zzso These studies identify a role of zzso of zzso promoters in the zzso of zzso zzso unifying research on zzso in zzso and zzso regulation in zzso into a common zzso
