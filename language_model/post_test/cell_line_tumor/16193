zzso devices have been developed in the last few decades to support patients with liver failure on the road to recovery or zzso zzso bed zzso zzso liver cells are zzso within zzso zzso to be a valuable alternative to hollow zzso devices for improving mass transfers and enhancing treatment zzso This approach nevertheless deserves zzso in terms of zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of zzso type and of two zzso diameters zzso zzso and 600 zzso on mass transfers within beads and on the biological functions of zzso zzso zzso After assessing the effect of the zzso process on zzso quality, we investigated cell viability and zzso activities zzso zzso zzso synthesis and zzso zzso They were successfully maintained over 48 h within zzso bed zzso independently of zzso type and zzso zzso Mass transfers were not significantly influenced by the latter zzso Finally, suggestions are made for improving the zzso process as a means of enhancing the treatment efficiency of the zzso bed zzso zzso
