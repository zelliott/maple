Liver X receptors function as central zzso regulators for zzso zzso for which zzso have been developed as potential drugs for treatment of cardiovascular diseases and zzso zzso Because zzso of zzso metabolism has been implicated in sex zzso zzso we investigated the effect of liver X zzso zzso on prostate and breast cancer cell zzso Treatment of human prostate cancer zzso cell lines with the synthetic liver X zzso zzso zzso decreased the percentage of zzso cells in a zzso manner and increased the expression of zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso interference blocks zzso growth zzso suggesting that zzso expression plays a crucial role in this zzso Liver X zzso zzso also inhibited the proliferation of other prostate and breast cancer cell zzso The level of liver X zzso alpha expression correlated directly with sensitivity to growth zzso by liver X zzso zzso zzso expression of liver X zzso alpha in human breast cancer zzso cells, which express low levels of zzso liver X receptors and are insensitive to zzso zzso these cells to zzso zzso with our observations in zzso cells, zzso zzso dramatic zzso of zzso in liver X zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, oral administration of zzso inhibited the growth of zzso tumors in zzso nude zzso Based on these results, zzso of the liver X zzso signaling zzso is a new target for controlling tumor cell zzso therefore, liver X zzso zzso may have utility as zzso zzso
