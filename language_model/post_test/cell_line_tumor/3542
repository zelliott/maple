The sex steroid hormone zzso zzso is critically involved in the development of the zzso zzso and it also is thought to play a role in breast cancer zzso However, the effect of zzso on zzso zzso is not fully understood in breast zzso We previously reported that in zzso zzso zzso zzso breast cancer cells, zzso was able to counterbalance the zzso effect of zzso or serum on proliferation and on expression level of zzso which generally stimulates cell proliferation and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso breast cancer cells lack zzso and express high levels of zzso zzso and zzso showed no effect on Id zzso zzso and invasion in these zzso However, after introducing zzso zzso zzso or zzso into zzso cells, zzso inhibited the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells exhibited less zzso activity after zzso treatment than parental or control zzso cells, an effect which correlated well with reduction of zzso zzso This zzso effect on proliferation was accompanied by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso showed significant zzso change, appearing more flattened and spread out than control zzso zzso zzso chamber invasion zzso revealed that zzso zzso cells also lost most of their invasive properties after zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso drastically inhibited zzso zzso zzso activity in cells zzso with either zzso or zzso To determine whether zzso could act as a key zzso of the effects of zzso we prepared cells zzso with zzso and zzso The zzso change and zzso zzso still were observed after zzso zzso However, zzso zzso was not zzso the zzso and invasive activities were mostly zzso and zzso zzso could not be detected zzso From these zzso we conclude that either form of the zzso is sufficient to reduce the zzso zzso on treatment with zzso and that zzso plays an important role as a zzso of the effects of zzso on breast cancer cell proliferation and zzso
