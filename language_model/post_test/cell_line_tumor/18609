zzso cancer is associated with the worst zzso survival rate of any human zzso This high mortality is due, in part, to difficulties in establishing early and accurate zzso Because most zzso share the ability to accumulate zzso acids more effectively than normal zzso and any other pathology, assessment of zzso acid transport in zzso cells using zzso zzso acids has become one of the most promising tools for zzso zzso This study investigated the potential of zzso zzso for detection of pancreatic cancer by zzso zzso zzso zzso affinity for pancreatic zzso was investigated in human pancreatic zzso zzso and zzso cells, followed by analysis of the underlying mechanisms of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso was evaluated for targeting of pancreatic zzso using zzso mice zzso with primary human pancreatic zzso cells, as well as in acute inflammation models in zzso mice and zzso zzso accumulated zzso in human pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells following a zzso incubation at 37 degrees zzso zzso varied from zzso to zzso of the total loaded activity per zzso zzso The cellular zzso was temperature and pH dependent and predominantly zzso by specific carriers for neutral zzso zzso namely the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso incorporation was less than zzso zzso studies showed rapid zzso of the zzso to zzso reaching zzso to zzso of the injected dose per gram zzso in zzso zzso compared with zzso to zzso zzso in the zzso zzso at 60 and 240 zzso post injection of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso in the gastrointestinal tract and areas of inflammation remained moderate and decreased with zzso Excellent zzso detection was obtained by gamma camera zzso The specific and high-level targeting of zzso to zzso and the negligible zzso in the gastrointestinal tract and areas of inflammation indicate that zzso is a promising zzso for differential diagnosis of pancreatic zzso
