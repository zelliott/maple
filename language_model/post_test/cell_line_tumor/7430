The zzso zzso zzso activates various signaling pathways including nuclear factor zzso that mediate zzso zzso and zzso resistance in zzso zzso leukemia zzso Here we report that protein zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso family, is a novel zzso of zzso zzso was found to be the major zzso of the zzso family expressed in chronic zzso leukemia cells and is zzso zzso by zzso in its zzso zzso zzso A zzso that zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso domain activates nuclear factor zzso independently of its zzso zzso Furthermore, our data show that zzso zzso of the nuclear factor zzso cascade in zzso cells is largely zzso by zzso zzso These data present a novel mechanism of zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso not its zzso activity, could be a novel therapeutic approach for the treatment of zzso zzso zzso
