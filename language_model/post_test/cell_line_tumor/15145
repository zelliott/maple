zzso zzso is highly expressed in zzso zzso signaling via its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for the development of zzso However, the differential expression of zzso and the zzso in brain suggests that zzso may signal via an alternate zzso By zzso affinity zzso of zzso mouse brain membrane followed by mass zzso analysis, we identified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a cell surface zzso zzso zzso zzso as a novel zzso zzso zzso is primarily expressed on neural zzso and zzso cells and is highly expressed in human zzso zzso selectively bound zzso in zzso zzso human zzso cell zzso and inhibited the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso cells in a zzso zzso These effects were correlated with an increase in zzso zzso of the previously identified zzso downstream zzso focal zzso zzso and zzso zzso binding to zzso cells was zzso by zzso ABC treatment, and zzso zzso with zzso for binding to the zzso domain of zzso and to the cells, indicating a dependence of binding on zzso zzso zzso This study identifies an alternate zzso for zzso that may mediate its action on novel cellular zzso
