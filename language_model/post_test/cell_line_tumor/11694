The relationship between zzso zzso zzso and patient prognosis has been identified in gastric zzso however, the zzso role of zzso in gastric cancer remains to be fully zzso The aim of the present in zzso study was to investigate the impact of zzso on cell zzso migration and invasion in gastric cancer cell zzso We investigated the biological effect of zzso zzso on gastric zzso zzso An zzso gastric cancer cell line zzso zzso zzso was zzso The effect of zzso zzso on cell growth was assessed by evaluating cell survival, colony formation, cell cycle progression and zzso Cell migration and invasion were detected by zzso zzso zzso The protein levels of several potentially involved genes were determined by western zzso to zzso the underlying molecular zzso The zzso zzso was used to determine the statistical differences between various experimental and control groups, and one-way zzso test was used to determine the difference between three or more zzso The results showed that zzso zzso significantly inhibited cell growth and zzso blocked cell entry into the zzso phase and promoted cell zzso In addition, zzso reduced the zzso and invasion of gastric cancer zzso These zzso may partly be explained by a decrease in zzso expression caused by zzso zzso zzso zzso effectively inhibited cell growth and cancer progression by suppressing zzso in gastric cancer, identifying zzso as a promising target with therapeutic potential for development of new approaches to treat gastric zzso
