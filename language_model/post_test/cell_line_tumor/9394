Using zzso three-dimensional zzso systems and zzso conditions, we compared the ability of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso breast cancer cells to interact and undergo zzso zzso on association with breast zzso zzso Although all breast cancer cell lines zzso with tumor zzso zzso and its zzso zzso counterpart zzso cells were most receptive and responded with dramatic, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells underwent zzso zzso when zzso with zzso from zzso or zzso breast zzso however, zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso exhibited decreased tamoxifen sensitivity compared with cells zzso with zzso tumor zzso zzso tamoxifen resistance was accompanied by zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso reduced sensitivity to zzso or zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The intrinsic tamoxifen resistance of zzso cells correlated with zzso zzso zzso that was unaffected by the tumor zzso Our results suggest that tumor zzso tamoxifen resistance of zzso cells is not zzso by zzso growth factor zzso or zzso growth factor zzso axes because no correlation was found between expression levels of IGF-1, zzso zzso zzso or zzso growth factor zzso and tamoxifen sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso
