zzso evidence suggests that zzso generated from the zzso reaction of zzso oxide and zzso is critically involved in the zzso of neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's zzso zzso with zzso zzso molecules has been proposed to be a major zzso zzso of zzso in biological zzso This study was undertaken to determine if chemically elevated zzso reduced zzso zzso a major zzso zzso zzso protection against zzso toxicity in cultured zzso zzso zzso of human zzso zzso cells with the unique zzso zzso zzso led to a significant zzso of cellular zzso in a zzso zzso To examine the protective effects of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso and then exposed to either the zzso zzso zzso zzso or the authentic zzso We observed that zzso cells showed a markedly increased resistance to zzso or authentic zzso zzso as assessed by zzso reduction zzso zzso depletion of cellular zzso by zzso zzso zzso caused a marked zzso of zzso or authentic zzso zzso To further demonstrate the zzso role for zzso induction in zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso to abolish zzso zzso zzso zzso of the cells with zzso was found to significantly reverse the protective effects of zzso on zzso or authentic zzso zzso Taken together, this study demonstrates for the first time that zzso can induce zzso in cultured zzso cells, and that the zzso cellular zzso defense zzso a marked protection against zzso toxicity in cultured human zzso zzso
