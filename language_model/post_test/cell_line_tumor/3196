To evaluate the tumor targeting potential of zzso zzso zzso zzso by magnetic resonance zzso zzso 

zzso zzso with and without zzso were zzso to incorporate side chains for zzso zzso The zzso were characterized by their zzso contents and zzso zzso In zzso zzso affinities of zzso zzso were assessed via competitive cell binding zzso on zzso zzso cells and zzso breast cancer zzso In zzso MR imaging was performed on zzso zzso zzso mice at different time points using zzso and zzso zzso The specificity of zzso targeting was assessed by using zzso zzso zzso to block zzso zzso followed by injection of zzso zzso zzso after 2 zzso 

The zzso zzso showed zzso higher than zzso zzso cell binding studies showed that zzso values for the zzso with zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells were similar to that of free zzso zzso lower zzso values were observed at the tumor site after 2 h using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso blocking study showed significantly higher zzso values zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso 

These results demonstrate the potential of this zzso as an effective zzso MR contrast agent for tumor imaging and therapy zzso
