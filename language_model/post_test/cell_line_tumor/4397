zzso cell lung cancer zzso not amenable to surgical zzso has a high mortality rate, due to the ineffectiveness and toxicity of zzso Thus, there remains an urgent need of zzso drugs that can combat this zzso In this study, we show that targeting the formation of zzso zzso acids zzso by the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso represents a new and safe mechanism to treat zzso growth and zzso In the transgenic zzso zzso model and human zzso models of zzso we found that zzso could be zzso by zzso the zzso factor zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso both treatments reduced primary and zzso zzso growth, tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso and circulating zzso zzso These beneficial effects were independent of the time of administration, whether before or after the onset of primary zzso and they persisted after drug withdrawal, suggesting the benefits were zzso Our findings suggest that strategies to zzso zzso expression and/or its zzso activity may provide a safer and effective strategy to treat zzso Moreover, as zzso is a zzso clinically approved drug used for managing zzso our findings provide an immediate cue for clinical studies to evaluate the utility of zzso zzso as safe agents for the treatment of lung cancer in zzso
