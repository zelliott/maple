zzso zzso target of zzso signaling plays a key role in the development of many tumor zzso zzso zzso is an attractive target for cancer zzso Although zzso zzso are thought to have zzso activity, the molecular bases remain largely zzso Here we show that treating zzso breast cancer cells with zzso (an zzso zzso results in significant suppression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso end joining zzso two major mechanisms required for repairing zzso zzso DNA zzso We observed that zzso impaired recruitment of zzso and zzso to DNA repair zzso both essential for zzso Moreover, consistent with the zzso role of zzso on both zzso and zzso persistent zzso zzso were detected in cells zzso with zzso Furthermore, the frequency of zzso and zzso breaks was increased in cells treated with zzso before and after zzso Thus our results show that zzso by zzso zzso occurs via disruption of the major two DNA zzso repair zzso
