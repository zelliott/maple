zzso of zzso to affinity surfaces involves zzso zzso complicating greatly the recovery of the zzso zzso A unique system for the efficient binding and release of different cells and particles is zzso zzso zzso and synthetic particles are detached from the zzso zzso zzso a so-called zzso when the zzso zzso elastic zzso The particle detachment upon elastic deformation is believed to be due to breaking of many of the zzso attachments between the particles and the affinity zzso and the change in the distance between affinity zzso when the zzso is zzso However, no release of zzso protein occurred upon elastic zzso The phenomenon of particle detachment upon elastic deformation is believed to be of a generic nature, because it was demonstrated for a variety of zzso of different sizes and for synthetic zzso for different zzso pairs zzso A, zzso metal zzso zzso and when the deformation was caused by either external forces zzso zzso or internal forces (the shrinkage of zzso zzso zzso upon an increase in zzso The elasticity of zzso zzso ensures high recovery of captured cells under mild conditions, with highly retained zzso This property, along with their continuous porous structure makes zzso zzso very attractive for applications in affinity cell zzso
