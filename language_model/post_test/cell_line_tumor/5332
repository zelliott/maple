zzso zzso zzso zzso have shown promising efficacy in the treatment of tumors with zzso zzso and zzso However, zzso zzso zzso have also proven ineffective against most tumors with zzso zzso zzso zzso Although some genetic changes, including the zzso zzso have been shown to zzso resistance to zzso zzso zzso novel strategies for the treatment of cancer patients with tumors harboring zzso zzso zzso have yet to be thoroughly zzso The principal objective of this study was to improve our current understanding of drug interactions between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in an effort to gain insight into a novel therapeutic strategy against zzso zzso zzso Using a panel of human zzso zzso gastric cancer cell lines, we showed that gastric cancer cells harboring the zzso zzso were selectively sensitive to zzso zzso as compared with those cells harboring zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, all cell lines were found to be resistant to zzso zzso The results from Western blots and zzso zzso showed that, in zzso inhibitor resistant cell lines, zzso was activated through the zzso zzso following zzso zzso zzso zzso of this feedback mechanism through the targeting of zzso and zzso resulted in zzso synergistic effects in some cell lines in zzso and in zzso Our results provide the basis for a rational combination strategy against human zzso zzso gastric zzso predicated on the understanding of zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso
