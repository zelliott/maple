Vitamin D is a steroid hormone that regulates calcium zzso and bone zzso The active form of vitamin D zzso zzso zzso zzso acts through both zzso and zzso zzso zzso has zzso effects in a variety of zzso including zzso zzso breast, zzso and skin zzso zzso exerts zzso effects in cancer cells through the induction of zzso cell cycle arrest, and zzso The mechanisms regulating zzso zzso remain zzso We investigated the role of zzso signaling in zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso induced rapid and sustained zzso of zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 pathways in SCC zzso These effects were zzso they occurred rapidly and were not inhibited by zzso or zzso zzso To examine whether the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso plays a role in zzso zzso the expression of zzso or zzso was reduced by small interfering zzso zzso zzso significantly enhanced zzso zzso as indicated by increased levels of zzso zzso cells and increased zzso population and DNA zzso In contrast, zzso had no effects on zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso followed by zzso treatment induced zzso much sooner than zzso zzso zzso and zzso induced zzso zzso suppressed the expression of zzso and zzso and promoted zzso zzso zzso These results support a link between zzso zzso signaling and zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso which suppresses zzso zzso and zzso the survival of SCC zzso
