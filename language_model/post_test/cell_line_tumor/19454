Several reports have recently documented that zzso functions as a zzso zzso for zzso which regulates a spectrum of normal and pathological zzso In this study, the role of zzso in prostate cancer zzso was zzso zzso of high density tissue zzso demonstrates that the levels of zzso expression increase as the tumors become more zzso In zzso and in zzso studies with zzso cell lines suggest that zzso in zzso expression are associated with enhanced adhesive and invasive activities in addition to a survival zzso In addition, it was observed that zzso levels are regulated by zzso Among the potential downstream targets of zzso are zzso and zzso which are likely to contribute to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso also regulates the expression of the zzso factors zzso or vascular zzso growth factor, which are likely to participate in the regulation of tumor zzso Finally, we found that signaling by zzso activates zzso zzso Together, these data demonstrate a role for zzso in zzso zzso and progression and suggest potential targets for therapeutic zzso
