zzso zzso has zzso activity in prostate cancer zzso which can be attributed to zzso of zzso zzso zzso are small zzso zzso that zzso regulate gene zzso We have analyzed differential zzso expression in zzso cells treated with zzso 

Using zzso zzso we found that 23 zzso were significantly zzso and 28 zzso were significantly zzso after Res zzso The zzso zzso included zzso and zzso clusters with well recognized zzso properties while the zzso zzso included several tumor zzso zzso zzso were verified by zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Since these zzso target zzso zzso and zzso zzso deleted on zzso 10), we performed Western zzso to confirm zzso of zzso in zzso zzso In addition, using zzso database, we have identified putative zzso targets for zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using a zzso approach, we generated gene networks specifically altered by zzso zzso 

Our results indicate that the dietary compound Res may play an important role in prostate zzso through zzso of zzso expression: Res zzso zzso zzso and zzso tumor zzso zzso in zzso zzso Further in-depth studies are necessary in order to fully recognize the beneficial zzso effects of Res in zzso
