In most cases, zzso zzso cancer is not zzso thus new approaches are necessary to identify novel targets for zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso directly regulate zzso of zzso tumor cells, and for zzso an association with colon cancer zzso has been already zzso However, as its depletion only incompletely zzso zzso zzso more suitable cellular targets have to be zzso Here we analyzed expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in comparison with zzso and found that, besides zzso zzso was expressed with the highest frequency zzso in zzso zzso As well as zzso zzso was not zzso in normal colon tissue and expression of both proteins was positively correlated with zzso of zzso zzso To zzso the zzso role of zzso for zzso of colon zzso cells in comparison with zzso expression of the proteins was zzso zzso in the human colon zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso Analysis of zzso of colon zzso cells in zzso mice revealed that depletion of zzso reduced zzso zzso and depletion of zzso zzso as compared with control zzso Most likely the stronger effect of zzso depletion on colon cancer zzso is due to the fact that in zzso knock down of zzso impaired all steps of zzso zzso invasion and migration while zzso of zzso only reduced zzso and zzso This very strong reducing effect of zzso depletion on colon zzso cell zzso makes the protein a promising therapeutic target for individualized zzso cancer zzso
