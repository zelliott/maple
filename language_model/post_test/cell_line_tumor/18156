We recently reported increased zzso zzso 1 zzso and decreased neutral zzso 2 zzso gene expression in zzso syndromes and acute zzso This zzso is supposed to change the cellular zzso zzso however, positive correlations were observed between zzso zzso and the zzso message but not between zzso and zzso messages, when 16 different leukemia cell lines were used to analyze the relationship between gene expressions and zzso against zzso Using two cell lines with either the highest or lowest zzso zzso cellular zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso by liquid zzso zzso Increased zzso was observed in zzso but not in zzso cell lines treated with low doses of zzso Upon zzso treatment, zzso decreased more in the sensitive cell lines than in resistant cell zzso A zzso inhibitor recovered the zzso sensitivity of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso gene expression by either zzso or using zzso affected the zzso sensitivity of representative cell zzso zzso clearly show that zzso is both a good marker to predict the zzso sensitivity of leukemia cells and a potential therapeutic target for leukemia with high zzso zzso and suggest that the zzso zzso plays a significant role in zzso zzso
