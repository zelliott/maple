zzso cells are often zzso by zzso to the effects of zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso We have demonstrated previously that TRAIL has an zzso effect on protein synthesis zzso zzso zzso M, zzso zzso zzso S & Clemens zzso (2002) Cancer zzso zzso and we have therefore examined the consequences of prior zzso treatment for the sensitivity of translation to zzso by zzso zzso treatment alone has only a minor effect on protein synthesis but it zzso both zzso cells and zzso cells to the zzso of translation by zzso The zzso of translation is characterized by increased zzso of the alpha zzso of zzso initiation factor zzso and zzso of the zzso protein zzso Both of these effects, as well as the decrease in overall protein zzso require zzso activity, although they zzso overt zzso by several zzso zzso enhances the level and/or the extent of zzso of zzso by zzso thus providing a likely explanation for the zzso of cells to the zzso of zzso
