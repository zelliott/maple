zzso zzso play a protective role against zzso zzso and zzso zzso The two zzso zzso zzso of soybean seeds are the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso zzso inhibitor zzso In this study, we report that soybean seeds incubated in warm water release large amounts of proteins into the surrounding zzso zzso gel zzso analysis of the seed zzso resulted in the separation of 93 distinct protein spots out of which 90 spots were identified by zzso The basic zzso zzso and the zzso are the two zzso proteins found in the soybean seed zzso In addition to zzso and zzso seed storage zzso others known to protect the seeds against pathogens and zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also identified in the seed zzso zzso seed zzso obtained by zzso the seeds in warm water was also able to inhibit the growth of human breast cancer cell line zzso Since soybean seeds release large amounts of zzso active zzso when immersed in warm water, our procedure could be exploited as a simplified alternative method for the preparation of zzso concentrate which is being used as a cancer zzso zzso
