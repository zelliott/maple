zzso in the zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso complex is the most common primary zzso found in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso which encodes the internal zzso zzso in zzso zzso was introduced into the nuclear zzso of a zzso defective human cell line, zzso carrying the zzso zzso In zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso total and complex zzso zzso were fully restored and largely resistant to complex I zzso zzso indicating a dominant role of zzso in the transfer of electrons in the host zzso Whereas the original zzso zzso cell grows poorly in medium containing zzso the zzso have a fully restored growth capacity in zzso zzso although the zzso production was not totally zzso Furthermore, the increased zzso stress in the cells carrying the zzso zzso was alleviated in zzso demonstrated by a decreased zzso oxygen species zzso zzso Finally, zzso were also shown to be zzso to induction to zzso and also exhibit greater resistance to zzso cell zzso It is concluded that the zzso zzso zzso can improve the zzso zzso capacity in cells carrying the zzso zzso and protect the cells from zzso stress and cell zzso
