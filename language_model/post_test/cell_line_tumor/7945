Fetal exposure to environmental zzso may contribute to zzso and/or to zzso germ cell zzso However, many of these zzso have only a weak affinity for the classical zzso receptors zzso which is zzso less potent than the affinity of zzso zzso Thus, several mechanisms have been suggested to explain how they could affect male germ cell proliferation at low environmental relevant zzso 

In this study we aimed to explore the possible promoting effect of zzso A zzso on human zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso used as a zzso to manufacture zzso zzso plastic and released from zzso food or zzso cans or from dental zzso 

zzso at very low zzso zzso to zzso zzso similar to those found in human zzso zzso zzso cell proliferation in zzso zzso activated both zzso protein zzso and zzso protein zzso pathways and triggered a rapid (15 zzso zzso of the zzso factor zzso zzso protein zzso and the cell cycle regulator zzso protein zzso This zzso zzso did not involve classical zzso because it could not be reversed by zzso zzso (an zzso zzso or reproduced either by zzso or by zzso (a potent synthetic zzso which instead triggered a zzso zzso This zzso was reproduced only by zzso coupled to bovine serum zzso zzso which is unable to enter the zzso As with zzso zzso promoted zzso cell proliferation through a zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso involving a zzso and a zzso zzso as shown by the zzso effect observed by the corresponding zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

This zzso zzso action zzso addition to the classical zzso zzso new basis for evaluating zzso such as zzso that, at low doses and with a high affinity for this zzso could interfere with the zzso programming of fetal germ cell proliferation and/or differentiation when they cross the zzso
