To investigate the role of bone zzso protein 4 zzso on the proliferation and zzso in zzso stem zzso 

Stem cells were isolated from a human zzso cell line zzso by using zzso and characterized by zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined by soft zzso colony zzso and flow zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected by Western zzso zzso 

zzso inhibited cell proliferation and promoted zzso in zzso zzso stem zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso D1 expression were decreased by zzso while zzso level was zzso 

zzso can inhibit zzso zzso stem cells proliferation through zzso zzso D1 level, and promote zzso through induction of zzso expression and zzso of zzso zzso It suggests that zzso plays an important role in human zzso stem cell zzso
