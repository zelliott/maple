zzso zzso zzso have been studied for drug, zzso and zzso acid delivery both in zzso and in zzso Due to their zzso structure, they are supposed to cross the plasma membrane and enter directly into the zzso likely upon an zzso mechanism without inducing cell zzso In this study, two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were investigated for zzso zzso Both zzso zzso zzso zzso and showed zzso zzso activity and a zzso of zzso However, in terms of reduced toxicity or increased zzso activity, zzso and zzso did not show an added value over zzso and other standard zzso zzso zzso the type of zzso of carbon zzso might be a key zzso to obtain an efficient and zzso zzso delivery zzso Nevertheless, in view of the present results and zzso also of the zzso of zzso preference should currently be given to designing zzso carriers which mimic the needle structure of zzso
