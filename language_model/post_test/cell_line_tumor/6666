zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been shown to inhibit tumor progression and zzso Recently, its biological functions have been linked to its zzso zzso Specifically, a zzso opposed to a combined nuclear and zzso zzso has been associated with increased survival in human zzso including zzso cell lung cancer zzso However, it is not known whether transformation affects zzso expression during lung zzso and whether its zzso zzso zzso with the zzso features of zzso To address these questions, we studied zzso expression in a model of transformation of zzso zzso cells and in zzso zzso We found that decreased zzso accompanied chemical transformation of normal immortalized zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso expression to be virtually universal in zzso occurring in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso showed almost exclusively a combined zzso zzso In contrast, nuclear zzso but not combined zzso zzso significantly correlated with low zzso grade, lower zzso rate, absence of invasion, and negative zzso stain in zzso These data support the hypothesis that nuclear zzso of zzso may zzso zzso of zzso with favorable zzso zzso
