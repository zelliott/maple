It is widely recognized that the growth of solid tumor depends on zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso is an zzso zzso zzso that promotes zzso in solid zzso zzso of zzso is considered a promising approach for cancer therapy, and treatments including administration of zzso drugs and zzso interference for the zzso gene are geared to the suppression of tumor zzso 

As a new approach for gene therapy of zzso zzso zzso four groups of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used to block the expression of zzso then zzso zzso and protein were detected by zzso and Western zzso 

After treatment with zzso the relative zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were decreased significantly to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The relative zzso protein levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were decreased significantly to zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso 

Among the four zzso the zzso for Cap structure showed the strongest zzso effect and that for zzso the least ( zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso on the expression of zzso proteins was similar to that of zzso zzso zzso
