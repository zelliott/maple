zzso zzso is often observed in zzso zzso zzso cells due to zzso in the zzso gene or zzso of its negative regulator, zzso double zzso zzso This event is now considered an essential part of the zzso zzso zzso virus zzso is strongly associated with zzso and is a zzso in its zzso We previously showed that zzso an zzso of zzso activates the zzso zzso in zzso cell lines harboring zzso zzso However, zzso strongly induced zzso in zzso zzso or zzso I zzso zzso cells, whereas zzso III zzso zzso cells were much more zzso We show here that this resistance to zzso is also observed in zzso III zzso zzso zzso cell zzso We also show that, in zzso III zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso 2 zzso is selectively zzso and interacts with zzso X protein zzso preventing its zzso The treatment of these cells with the zzso domain 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso interaction and allows zzso zzso by zzso Furthermore, treatment with these two compounds strongly zzso zzso Thus, a combination of zzso and zzso zzso might be a useful zzso strategy for diseases linked to zzso zzso
