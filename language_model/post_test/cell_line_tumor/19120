The aim of this study was to determine constitution and physical properties of a zzso material based on Portland cement and assess zzso compared with zzso cement by evaluating cell zzso 

Analysis of the material was performed using energy zzso analysis zzso and X-ray zzso zzso zzso zzso strength and the effect of changing the mixing and curing conditions on the zzso strength of the materials were zzso zzso stability was evaluated by measuring water zzso of the zzso zzso was assessed at 1 and 28 days using a zzso technique and zzso cell zzso evaluation was performed by zzso 

Analysis of the material showed that it was primarily composed of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso strength of the zzso cement and zzso was comparable to zzso zzso zzso N zzso after 1 day, zzso zzso mixing did not improve the zzso strength of the zzso zzso at any zzso Wet curing was zzso to the neat cement at 1 day zzso N zzso zzso and 7 days zzso N zzso zzso The zzso cement prototypes were more stable and less susceptible to changes in zzso strength by varying the curing method zzso The zzso material took up more water zzso than zzso cement zzso with zzso after 1 zzso zzso at zzso humidity resulted in a net loss of weight for all the materials zzso The test materials were less zzso than zzso cement at 1 day but their zzso improved as the material zzso 

The constitution of the zzso material was broadly similar to that of mineral zzso zzso The zzso cement could be a potential dental zzso material as its zzso strength compared well to an established zzso zzso However, the material did not support cell growth, with zzso being similar to that of zzso zzso
