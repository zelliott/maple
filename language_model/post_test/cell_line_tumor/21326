zzso zzso are important gene regulators, which are often zzso in zzso In this study, the authors analyzed the zzso profiles of 78 matched zzso liver zzso from zzso patients and 10 normal liver zzso and found that 69 zzso were zzso expressed between zzso zzso zzso and corresponding zzso liver zzso zzso Then the expressions of 8 zzso expressed zzso were validated by real time zzso zzso The set of zzso expressed zzso could distinctly zzso zzso N and normal liver zzso zzso Moreover, some of these zzso expressed zzso were related to the clinical factors of zzso zzso Most importantly, zzso estimates and the zzso test showed that high expression of zzso was correlated with good survival of zzso patients zzso ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso p zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed that zzso of zzso in zzso cell line could obviously suppress the cell growth and zzso of zzso In conclusion, the authors have demonstrated the diagnostic zzso profile for zzso and for the first time, identified the zzso with zzso significance for zzso zzso
