Identification of tumor zzso is essential in advancing zzso therapeutic interventions in zzso Particularly attractive targets are those molecules that are selectively expressed by zzso cells and that are also essential for tumor zzso 

We have used a computer-based differential display analysis tool for mining of expressed sequence tag clusters in the human zzso database and identified zzso as a novel tumor zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso factor family, is a key player in zzso zzso during embryonic zzso Moreover, zzso factors that control zzso have been implicated in the zzso transition zzso which has been zzso to be a key step during tumor progression to zzso zzso zzso analysis validated the in zzso predictions and showed zzso expression in tumors of the small zzso stomach, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as in cell lines derived from zzso zzso and prostate zzso but not in the vast majority of the normal zzso zzso An zzso zzso of human zzso was identified that was able to expand T zzso from blood of cancer patients and normal donors with the ability to lyse zzso tumor zzso 

To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that zzso a zzso zzso factor and zzso a zzso implicated in zzso development, zzso zzso can be a potential target for human zzso cancer zzso
