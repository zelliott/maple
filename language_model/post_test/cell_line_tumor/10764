zzso zzso zzso is a rare, highly aggressive zzso associated to zzso zzso To date no chemotherapy regimen for zzso has proven to be definitively zzso and new therapies for zzso treatment need to be zzso We have previously shown in zzso that zzso combined treatment in zzso specifically acts on cell cycle regulation triggering zzso with survival zzso 

We zzso at molecular level, the zzso increase caused by zzso treatment in zzso cell zzso By means of zzso wide zzso we analyzed zzso gene deregulation both after the single zzso or zzso and the combined zzso Here we show that zzso increase following combined treatment is zzso by zzso since zzso increase in zzso combined treatment is abolished upon zzso zzso 

zzso combined treatment determines an zzso increase in zzso cells, which is dependent on the zzso zzso The results provided suggest that zzso combination might be tested in clinical settings in tumor specimens that express zzso
