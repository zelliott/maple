zzso module containing zzso hormone zzso 2 zzso is a zzso zzso G zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso and its highly zzso zzso zzso have been reported in various human zzso zzso we investigate the expression of zzso in zzso breast human tissue and its relationship with patient zzso zzso expression in normal and zzso breast tissue was assessed by zzso in sections from 10 normal controls and zzso tissue zzso from 69 cases of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and 272 invasive zzso The pattern and intensity of zzso was correlated with the zzso characteristics of each case and the disease zzso While absent in normal breast zzso zzso was significantly zzso in the zzso and nuclear compartments of both zzso and invasive zzso with invasive samples displaying significantly higher expression levels compared with in zzso zzso In invasive disease, zzso zzso expression was significantly associated with higher zzso grade but not with patient age, zzso status, zzso size, zzso zzso zzso zzso or overall zzso In contrast, zzso nuclear expression correlated zzso with higher zzso zzso Of note, zzso nuclear expression was associated with longer zzso survival as well as overall zzso This study indicates that zzso is expressed in zzso breast zzso and suggests that expression patterns of zzso are relevant in breast cancer zzso The association of improved patient survival with higher nuclear expression levels identifies zzso as a potential zzso in patients with invasive breast zzso
