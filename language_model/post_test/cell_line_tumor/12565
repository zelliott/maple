zzso zzso zzso constitute major infiltrates of solid tumors and express a marker profile that characterizes alternatively activated zzso zzso zzso accumulate in hypoxic tumor regions, express high amounts of zzso zzso zzso and contribute to tumor zzso and zzso However, the precise role of zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso remains poorly zzso zzso we zzso wild type zzso versus zzso zzso with tumor zzso Both, zzso and zzso zzso infiltrated hypoxic regions of tumor zzso at equal rates and got alternatively zzso Interestingly, significantly higher amounts of zzso zzso expressed the zzso markers zzso and zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso of infiltrated zzso with zzso zzso revealed a reduced expression of the zzso markers zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso and zzso zzso oxide zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso were less zzso toward tumor zzso Although zzso of zzso increased the invasive potential of tumor zzso independently of zzso the ability to stimulate differentiation of stem cells toward zzso cells was triggered by zzso but not by zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso develop a more prominent zzso marker profile accompanied by reduced zzso whereas zzso seems indispensable for the zzso properties of zzso
