zzso zzso protein vaccines have shown therapeutic potential in previous clinical studies, and results from a completed zzso phase 3 controlled trial are zzso However, streamlined production of these zzso vaccines is required for eventual clinical zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso DNA vaccines, when combined with zzso that induced sterile inflammation with recruitment of zzso cells at vaccination sites, were exceptional in their ability to provoke memory zzso immunity in mice, compared with several zzso zzso The combined vaccination strategy zzso both zzso zzso responses and zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor protection was intact in B zzso mice but was zzso completely by zzso depletion in zzso suggesting zzso zzso Furthermore, the optimal effect of zzso was observed with fusion vaccines that specifically targeted zzso delivery to zzso cells and not with vaccines lacking a targeting zzso suggesting that the rational vaccine design will require combination strategies with novel, zzso agents and highly zzso molecular vaccine zzso These studies also challenge the paradigm that zzso responses are the primary of zzso zzso effects and support the zzso of zzso vaccines designed to induce primarily zzso zzso
