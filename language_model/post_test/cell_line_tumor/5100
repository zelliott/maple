zzso zzso zzso zzso also known as zzso is zzso from the liver and zzso zzso zzso activity of the insulin zzso zzso in type 2 diabetes is not only a secondary manifestation of insulin resistance, but could also be responsible for directly inducing insulin resistance in target zzso In this study, we examined the effect of high zzso zzso on zzso gene zzso in the human zzso cell line zzso 

zzso zzso activity and protein expression were evaluated using reporter gene zzso and Western zzso analysis, zzso 

zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso enhanced zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso zzso also increased zzso protein zzso No protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso or a zzso radical scavenger zzso affected zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso inhibitor zzso or zzso inhibitor zzso significantly inhibited promoter zzso by zzso 

Our data suggest that zzso enhances zzso zzso through zzso of the zzso signaling zzso Increased zzso expression in the liver may be a cause of zzso toxicity in the diabetic zzso
