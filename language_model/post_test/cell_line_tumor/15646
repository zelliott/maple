The zzso target of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso are a promising new tool for the treatment of zzso zzso zzso zzso However, their mechanisms of action remain to be zzso We used two zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso to evaluate the zzso effects of zzso in zzso and in zzso in a zzso model of liver zzso zzso In zzso zzso inhibited the proliferation of cells in the zzso state and after stimulation by zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso In zzso zzso substantially inhibited the zzso growth of zzso cells, zzso of the timing of its administration and even when the treatment was administered after cell zzso zzso In addition, treated animals had significantly prolonged survival zzso survival time: zzso days in treated animals versus zzso days in zzso and better clinical zzso zzso treatment was associated with a significant decrease in zzso index and in zzso vascular density within zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso effect obtained after treatment with a combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso was more significant than with zzso alone in both cell zzso Our results suggest that the zzso efficacy of zzso in neuroendocrine tumors results from a combination of zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, a more potent zzso efficiency could be obtained by simultaneously targeting several levels of the zzso zzso
