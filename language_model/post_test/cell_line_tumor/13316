The use of zzso compounds, which act in part by zzso zzso zzso has become an integral strategy of zzso zzso Recently, zzso were identified as a novel class of natural compounds of zzso origin, which inhibit zzso zzso As these compounds are structurally highly complex, the search for simplified precursors zzso zzso zzso and their derivatives is mandatory to overcome supply problems zzso clinical zzso We tested the zzso efficacy of zzso and seven of its derivatives in comparison to zzso A zzso 

The compounds were tested in cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso cell cycle, migration, zzso tube zzso and in zzso zzso zzso The efficacy of zzso was also tested in zzso in a zzso subcutaneous zzso model induced with zzso zzso zzso size and zzso were zzso 

The zzso potency of all the compounds tested ran parallel to their zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso showed nearly the same efficacy as zzso zzso in low zzso range in all cellular zzso Some modifications in the zzso zzso caused only a moderate drop in zzso while others resulted in a dramatic loss of action, providing initial insight into zzso zzso In zzso zzso completely prevented zzso growth and reduced vascular density to zzso 

zzso a chemically accessible precursor of some zzso is a highly attractive zzso compound both in zzso and in zzso Even more simplified derivatives of this compound still retain high zzso zzso
