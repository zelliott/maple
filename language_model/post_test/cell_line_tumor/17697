zzso zzso zzso shows highly invasive and zzso zzso This study aims to investigate zzso migration zzso factor zzso invasion of zzso cells in zzso and the effects on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and to study the mechanism of tumor cell invasion and zzso in the early stage of zzso 

Two zzso zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso were adopted in this zzso The zzso cell invasion and migration were evaluated by zzso zzso The variation of expression percentages of zzso or zzso cells was detected by flow zzso in two cell lines with or without zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso were used to zzso the protein and zzso expressions of zzso and zzso The zzso concentration zzso by zzso cells was compared with the cells with different treatments using zzso 

After treating with zzso for 48 hours, the cell numbers of zzso and zzso which went through the zzso filter membrane were zzso Compared with zzso treated zzso cells, significant difference could be found both in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso zzso The percentages of zzso cells were significantly increased in both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The relative intensity of zzso protein expression was also enhanced in both cell lines zzso from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso the increased zzso zzso expression level was significantly zzso in both cell zzso The concentration of zzso in the zzso of zzso was higher zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso It was also remarkably higher than that in the zzso of zzso without treatment zzso zzso zzso However, there was no significant difference in the concentration variation of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso while the zzso zzso level was only enhanced in zzso 

zzso can induce potent invasion of zzso cell lines in zzso and the zzso zzso in zzso might be responsible for the invasion and zzso of tumor zzso zzso zzso which is zzso by these zzso zzso might contribute to the invasion as well as zzso of zzso in the early stages by induction of zzso and zzso in an indirect zzso
