We propose a mathematical model of tumor cell zzso zzso governed by the presence of two key zzso zzso zzso and zzso The model allows us to describe, in a remarkably simple way, different in zzso scenarios previously reported in experiments of tumor cell metabolism using distinct energy zzso The predictions of our model show good agreement with all the examined tumor cell lines zzso zzso and zzso and provide a first step toward the development of more comprehensive zzso accounting for in zzso cancer dynamics under complex spatial zzso
