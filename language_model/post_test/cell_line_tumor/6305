zzso zzso provide a promising therapeutic approach for several disorders including zzso Chemical stability, controlled release, and zzso delivery are crucial factors determining their zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso network have been previously suggested as carriers for controlled delivery of drugs to improve stability and to provide controlled release, but have not been used for zzso zzso In this work, a zzso zzso zzso system is formed by mixing a zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso The zzso of zzso gel was characterized by circular zzso zzso atomic force zzso zzso and scanning electron zzso zzso zzso and zzso images revealed establishment of the zzso zzso zzso Due to the zzso interactions between PA and zzso zzso release can be controlled by changing PA and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Cellular delivery of the zzso by zzso zzso complex was observed by using zzso labeled zzso zzso zzso incubated with zzso complex had enhanced cellular zzso compared to cells incubated with naked zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso amounts were lower in zzso human breast cancer cells in the presence of zzso complex compared to naked zzso and mismatch zzso evidenced by quantitative zzso zzso These results suggest that PA molecules can control zzso release, enhance cellular zzso and present a novel efficient approach for gene therapy studies and zzso based drug zzso
