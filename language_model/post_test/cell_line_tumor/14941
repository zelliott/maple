zzso a type II zzso zzso zzso is responsible for the early stage proliferation of a wide range of human zzso It is highly expressed on the surface of tumor cells, allowing the zzso to serve as a zzso of cancer zzso zzso in this study, we designed two molecular zzso consisting of a fluorescent zzso zzso attached to gold zzso zzso zzso for in zzso and in zzso detection of the zzso expression on tumor zzso The zzso zzso zzso for zzso served as the zzso between dye zzso and zzso zzso zzso In this zzso the dye zzso was zzso by zzso zzso under zzso conditions and recovered after selective zzso of the zzso by zzso To maximize spectral overlap between dye zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso efficiency zzso by zzso resonance energy transfer zzso the visible dye zzso and zzso zzso dye zzso zzso were each attached to zzso and zzso zzso zzso for in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso Both in zzso cell and in zzso animal studies indicate that these two molecular zzso are sensitive and specific for the detection of zzso expression in the zzso thereby paving the way to image the activities of this diagnostic zzso in living zzso
