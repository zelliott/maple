To explore the relationship between Aurora A expression and cell sensitivity to zzso and zzso the effect of Aurora A on the treatment efficacy of zzso for prostate zzso 

A cell clone highly expressing Aurora A was constructed through zzso with full length Aurora A zzso and then termed as zzso zzso zzso were treated with different dose zzso The growth zzso rates of cells were detected by zzso zzso and the cell zzso rates were detected through flow zzso The growth zzso and zzso rates of zzso A and zzso cells were compared for Aurora A zzso zzso zzso cells zzso A were treated with zzso for zzso the Aurora A zzso and then the variations of cell growth inhibited rate and zzso rate were zzso 

zzso of Aurora A expression reduced the cell zzso and zzso rates when treated by zzso but the zzso of Aurora A expression after zzso applied increased the cell zzso and zzso rates when treated by zzso 

There is a positive relationship between Aurora A expression and treatment efficacy of zzso for prostate cancer, and zzso Aurora A expression will enhance the treatment efficacy of zzso for prostate zzso
