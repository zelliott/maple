zzso zzso zzso prepared from the zzso zzso zzso has been used as a biological response modifier for the treatment of cancer zzso Many studies describing the zzso effects and direct zzso effects of zzso have been zzso Most of studies describing the zzso effects focused on cellular zzso although there were several studies which focused on zzso immunity where zzso was shown to be able to induce zzso production in zzso However, even in these zzso immunity studies, it is thought that the enhancement of zzso production was due to the zzso of cellular zzso In this study, we investigated the direct effect of zzso on B cells and discovered that zzso was able to enhance zzso production in the human B cell line zzso Furthermore, zzso was shown to have the characteristic features of zzso cells, which are independently involved in the primary immune zzso These results show that there is a possibility that zzso directly acts on B cells and simultaneously enhances both zzso immunity and cellular zzso
