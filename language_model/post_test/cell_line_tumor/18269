The zzso of tumor cells is one of the major obstacles to successful clinical zzso A treatment strategy by incorporating a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso with stealthy zzso zzso was used in this study for zzso the zzso of tumor cells and enhancing the efficacy of zzso zzso In zzso zzso cell zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell invasion and migration zzso were performed on human zzso melanoma cell zzso In zzso measurement of zzso zzso zzso of tumor growth, and zzso of zzso were assessed in female zzso zzso In zzso zzso or stealthy zzso zzso alone was effective to inhibit the growth of zzso zzso On the contrary, zzso had no influence on either zzso when treating with zzso alone or zzso plus zzso In addition, in zzso results showed that zzso had no impact on the zzso of tumor cells to zzso zzso zzso and zzso and invasion of tumor zzso In mice, zzso significantly inhibited the activity of zzso Furthermore, administered at the initial zzso of zzso zzso melanoma cells, zzso evidently delayed the growth of zzso and depressed the occurrence of experimental lung zzso A subsequent administration of stealthy zzso zzso resulted in further zzso growth and zzso of zzso indicating that zzso plus stealthy zzso zzso exhibited a significant zzso effect and slightly potent effect against tumor growth as compared with stealthy zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, administration of zzso zzso followed by giving stealthy zzso zzso may be beneficial for zzso the growth and zzso of melanoma in zzso The likely mechanism could be associated with zzso of zzso after administration of zzso
