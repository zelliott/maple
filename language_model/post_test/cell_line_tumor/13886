Blue light from dental zzso devices has significant biological effects on zzso These effects may alter normal cell function of zzso exposed during placement of oral restorations, but recent data suggest that some zzso effects may also be zzso useful, for example in the treatment of zzso zzso zzso oxygen species zzso appear to mediate blue light effects in cells, but the sources of zzso zzso versus zzso and their respective roles in the cellular response to blue light are not zzso In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that zzso and zzso sources of blue zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso and oral zzso cell zzso zzso cells were exposed to blue light zzso zzso zzso zzso from a dental zzso source zzso 550 zzso Light was applied in zzso media or balanced salt solutions with or without cells zzso zzso zzso levels were estimated using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were estimated using the zzso violet zzso Cell response was estimated using the zzso zzso activity zzso Blue light increased zzso zzso equally in both zzso and zzso Blue light also increased zzso levels in zzso zzso or salt solutions, and zzso supplements increased zzso zzso zzso applied zzso rapidly zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso levels, which were higher and zzso in zzso than zzso The type of zzso medium significantly affected the ability of blue light to suppress cellular zzso zzso the greatest suppression was observed in zzso or zzso zzso zzso the data support our hypothesis that zzso and zzso generated zzso zzso to affect cellular zzso suppression of tumor cells in response to blue zzso However, the identity of blue light targets that mediate these changes remain zzso These data support additional investigations into the risks of zzso exposure of zzso to blue light during material zzso of zzso materials, and possible therapeutic zzso
