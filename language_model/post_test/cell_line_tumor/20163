zzso has been a major target of many zzso trials because it is expressed by various zzso and is highly zzso In this study, we have identified a novel zzso zzso T cell zzso zzso zzso and compared its zzso and zzso to that of the reported zzso zzso restricted to zzso Although both zzso were readily zzso by zzso exposed to various forms of full-length zzso zzso remarkably zzso is much more efficiently zzso from the soluble form, than zzso On the other hand, zzso is efficiently presented by zzso tumor cells and its presentation was not enhanced by zzso treatment, which induced zzso as demonstrated by Western blots and functionally a decreased presentation of zzso zzso whereas zzso was very zzso presented by the same tumor cell lines, except for one that expressed high level of zzso It was only presented when the tumor cells were first zzso treated, followed by infection with zzso zzso virus zzso zzso which dramatically increased zzso zzso These data indicate that the presentation of zzso is zzso zzso Furthermore, a survey was conducted on multiple samples collected from zzso melanoma zzso Surprisingly, all the zzso responses to zzso from patients, including those who received zzso zzso vaccine were induced zzso Taken together, these results imply that some zzso can be zzso presented by tumor cells although the corresponding zzso T cell responses are efficiently primed in zzso by zzso zzso these zzso The potential implications for cancer vaccine strategies are further zzso
