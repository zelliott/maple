zzso regulate diverse cellular processes and play an integral role in cancer zzso zzso variation within zzso target sites may therefore be important sources for genetic differences in cancer zzso To investigate this possibility, we mapped zzso single zzso zzso zzso to putative zzso recognition sites within genes zzso in zzso zzso breast tumors and used local linkage zzso patterns to identify high-ranking zzso in the Cancer zzso zzso of zzso zzso breast cancer zzso association study for further zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso scoring in the top 100 from the zzso study, were in strong linkage zzso with zzso an zzso that resides within a zzso target site in the 3' untranslated region of the bone zzso zzso type zzso zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso We validated the zzso association findings for zzso in an independent cohort of zzso cases identified from families with multiple case zzso zzso association testing of zzso for these cases and zzso controls with zzso zzso supported the zzso Furthermore, zzso reporter zzso and zzso of zzso combined with quantitative reverse zzso showed that zzso transcript is a direct target of zzso and that zzso zzso regulates the C and T zzso of zzso These results suggest that zzso regulation of zzso by zzso explains the observed disease zzso Our approach is general and can help identify and explain the mechanisms behind disease association for zzso that affect zzso zzso
