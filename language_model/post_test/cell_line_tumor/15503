zzso is zzso expressed in the zzso zzso and experimental evidence has shown that it zzso blood vessel zzso The relative contribution of local and circulating zzso to blood vessel formation in zzso remains unknown despite evidence for unexpected roles of circulating zzso in various zzso Using transgenic mouse models, we established that circulating zzso zzso the growth of bone zzso by enhancing blood vessel formation and zzso This effect is more relevant than that of zzso produced by zzso cells and zzso which only exert a small additive effect on vessel zzso zzso zzso enhances its local production in tumors through a positive feedback loop and increases the amount of vascular zzso growth factor zzso retained in the zzso Both zzso and zzso then cooperate to stimulate blood vessel zzso zzso content in the tumor zzso with the number of blood vessels and tumor growth in the mouse zzso zzso with these results, examination of three separate zzso from patients with breast and prostate zzso revealed that a high zzso intensity for zzso in tumors is associated with increased zzso These results establish that circulating zzso zzso blood vessel formation and tumor growth by zzso the amount of and the response to zzso Furthermore, determination of the zzso content can serve as a zzso zzso for breast and prostate zzso and possibly other zzso
