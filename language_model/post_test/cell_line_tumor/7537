For developing a zzso zzso targeted and synergistic zzso system for zzso drug zzso zzso and zzso gene for potential cancer therapy, zzso zzso inclusion complex was prepared from zzso and zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso and multiple zzso zzso arms with zzso acid zzso zzso via a zzso zzso The inclusion complex, termed as zzso was formed between zzso and the zzso cavity of zzso core of the star zzso The zzso complex further formed zzso with zzso to give positively charged zzso becoming zzso zzso zzso zzso system for zzso and zzso targeting to cancer cells that zzso folate receptors zzso The results showed that the zzso function induced higher gene zzso efficiency in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso in the zzso system led to the detachment of the zzso groups from the carrier after the zzso zzso which resulted in the release of the bound zzso followed by the recycling of the zzso from the zzso onto the cell membrane surface, zzso continuous zzso zzso to achieve enhanced gene zzso In addition, the zzso zzso was zzso to the cells with zzso which further enhanced the gene zzso even at low zzso ratios in the zzso zzso zzso Further, the efficient delivery of zzso zzso gene resulted in large cell population at zzso zzso and zzso zzso inducing significant cell zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso system with the synergistic effects of zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene delivery may be promising for cancer therapeutic zzso
