Uniform zzso distribution of sufficient zzso is one of the important aspects of zzso therapy for solid zzso 

zzso zzso derived from a human transitional cell zzso cell line zzso were used as a surrogate system of tiny solid tumors to study zzso distribution of zzso zzso included zzso zzso zzso zzso aluminum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ring A zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were incubated with various doses of the above drugs for zzso hours, and were examined by zzso zzso 

zzso showed all cells were healthy in zzso less than 400 zzso in zzso zzso electron zzso showed tight zzso zzso in zzso zzso distributed more zzso in zzso than other zzso Free zzso and zzso penetrated zzso zzso deeper than zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso penetrated less than their free zzso 

The zzso mimic solid tumors prior to zzso Based on drug distribution in zzso zzso and zzso appear superior to zzso zzso and zzso for zzso administration for zzso cancer zzso
