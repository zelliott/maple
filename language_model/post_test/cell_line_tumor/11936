Our aim was to determine the effects of zzso D1 zzso on zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso 

We have generated zzso system for zzso to zzso D1 zzso zzso and evaluated in zzso and in zzso zzso Small interfering zzso against zzso D1 was also used to analyze zzso D1 zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso 

The zzso treated with zzso AS zzso showed less vessel density and displayed smaller tumor size in colon cancer cell lines zzso and zzso In zzso studies indicated that AS zzso decreased zzso protein expression in zzso but not in zzso zzso D1 small interfering zzso caused a decrease in zzso expression at protein and zzso levels in zzso A modest decrease was noted in the zzso promoter activity, with zzso of the zzso zzso factor through zzso On the hand, the zzso D1 zzso plus zzso inhibitor markedly decreased zzso expression in zzso although zzso did not change by the zzso inhibitor zzso In cultures of human zzso vein zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso D1 expression and cell zzso AS zzso significantly inhibited zzso growth even in the presence of zzso AS zzso also significantly suppressed in zzso tube formation in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso formation in zzso zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso D1 may play a role in the maintenance of zzso expression and that AS zzso could be potentially useful for targeting both cancer cells and their zzso of tumor zzso
