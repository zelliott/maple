zzso inhibitor zzso suppressed the growth of human oral zzso cell zzso zzso cells significantly at zzso that inhibit zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso following treatment with zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, but not in zzso zzso zzso cells, indicating selective zzso for zzso alpha in oral SCC zzso zzso zzso analysis and DNA analysis by zzso gel zzso revealed an increase in the proportion of zzso cells and DNA fragmentation in zzso zzso zzso membrane potential was zzso and zzso c was released from zzso However, the zzso cell death was not accompanied by zzso of zzso 3 and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso failed to prevent zzso cell zzso Another zzso factor zzso G, but not zzso factor zzso was also released from zzso and zzso to the zzso These results suggest that zzso alpha inhibitor zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso
