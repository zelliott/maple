zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso the reduction of various zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso has been also shown to rescue proteins containing zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso from degradation by the zzso zzso through an unknown zzso Here, we studied the nature of interaction between zzso and the zzso zzso Our study revealed a double negative feedback loop between zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso prevents the zzso activity of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso degrades the zzso form of zzso Furthermore, we zzso both in zzso and in zzso that zzso levels are highly dependent on zzso zzso These observations suggest a link between zzso zzso and the zzso cellular zzso More generally, the results may represent a regulatory mechanism by which associated zzso dictate the stability of zzso thus zzso protein levels with the zzso zzso
