zzso are small zzso zzso which diminish the stability and/or translation of zzso This study examined whether zzso previously shown to be elevated in zzso zzso zzso breast cancer, regulates the expression of zzso Two putative zzso sites, zzso and zzso were found in zzso within the zzso region of human zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso or zzso zzso specifically decreased or increased, respectively, zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso reduced zzso and zzso protein levels, with no effect on zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso or zzso binding sites inserted into the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso and zzso repression of zzso activity, respectively, in zzso zzso Both zzso sites responded accordingly to zzso zzso and zzso zzso and both sites were rendered inactive by zzso that disrupted zzso to the zzso of zzso A zzso single zzso zzso in the zzso site increased repression of zzso activity to approximately zzso in zzso zzso zzso levels were higher in zzso zzso cells than zzso zzso cells, but only the zzso site zzso significantly more repression in reporter zzso zzso expression was strongly inhibited by zzso zzso but not by an zzso zzso or zzso indicating a mutually zzso feedback zzso These findings provide the first evidence for the zzso regulation of zzso by a zzso in the context of breast zzso
