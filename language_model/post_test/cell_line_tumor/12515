To investigate the zzso activity of ex zzso zzso cells derived from zzso zzso from cervical cancer patients when combined with zzso zzso and studied both in zzso and in zzso 

The presence of zzso in cervical cancer specimens was detected by zzso and zzso were expanded using the zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso by the human cervical cancer cell line, zzso was measured by Western zzso and zzso In zzso zzso activities of expanded zzso with or without zzso zzso were determined using the zzso zzso In zzso zzso activity of zzso combined with zzso zzso was evaluated using the zzso mouse zzso 

zzso existed in the cervical cancer and the percentage of zzso cells in zzso after ex zzso expansion was zzso detected by flow zzso zzso cell expressed and zzso zzso as measured by Western zzso and zzso Expanded zzso from human cervical cancer demonstrated marked zzso to zzso or zzso zzso In comparison with zzso group, the zzso of zzso zzso towards zzso or zzso cell was significantly increased when zzso and target cells were incubated with either zzso or zzso zzso at zzso ratio of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso treatment, significantly suppressed the growth of zzso in zzso mice, in comparison with all other groups zzso zzso zzso zzso alone also showed the ability to inhibit zzso growth in zzso but were more efficient when combined with specific zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Taken together, our results suggest that zzso cells, combined with zzso zzso treatment, could be a more effective adoptive zzso for patients with cervical cancer than traditional adoptive zzso zzso
