zzso PET imaging in clinical zzso represents a notable development because the availability of zzso is not dependent on a zzso Furthermore, labeled zzso acid derivatives have been proven to be useful for the imaging many tumor zzso In the present study, we zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso agents, such as, zzso zzso and zzso zzso The compounds produced were found to be potential useful as zzso imaging zzso In particular, they showed high tumor zzso in zzso and in zzso and had high labeling yields and excellent zzso The zzso chemistry of zzso compound zzso was studied by zzso zzso In zzso studies showed that the zzso compounds were taken up by cancer cells more than controls zzso and zzso Furthermore, in zzso studies showed that they have high tumor to muscle and tumor to blood ratios, and zzso PET imaging revealed high tumor zzso as compared with other zzso and high zzso activities, indicating rapid zzso zzso These results might motivate the use of zzso zzso acid PET for tumor zzso
