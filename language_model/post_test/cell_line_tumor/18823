zzso degradation and cell migration are key steps in cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been linked with these zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation zzso combined with the zzso cell migration zzso zzso relationships of zzso were zzso Our data indicate that zzso zzso zzso degradation and enhances cell zzso cell migration occurs as a concurrent but independent zzso Using zzso DNA approaches, we demonstrated that the zzso domain and a zzso component of the zzso domain of zzso are essential for zzso cell zzso Because the zzso domain of zzso was not required for zzso zzso degradation and cell migration, it is proposed that zzso between the zzso domain of zzso and adjacent cell surface molecules is responsible for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dominant negative zzso we demonstrated that zzso zzso in the zzso signal zzso zzso These data demonstrated that each domain of zzso plays a distinct role in zzso degradation and cell zzso
