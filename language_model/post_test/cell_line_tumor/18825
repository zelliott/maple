Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by zzso deposition of zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso peptides are zzso derived from the zzso zzso precursor protein zzso Although the function of zzso is not entirely clear, previous studies demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso receptors at sites of focal zzso suggesting that zzso is involved in zzso zzso process zzso zzso zzso is also a zzso component of immune cell zzso zzso Using primary mouse zzso and the human zzso cell line, zzso we have begun investigating the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrate that zzso is recruited into a zzso signaling complex during zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso specific recruitment of zzso zzso proteins to zzso including Lyn and zzso zzso zzso of cell surface zzso leads to a similar response characterized by zzso and recruitment of zzso zzso to zzso as well as subsequent zzso of zzso protein zzso and increased zzso protein zzso These data demonstrate that zzso can act as a zzso zzso in zzso lineage cells and provide insight into the contribution of this protein to the inflammatory conditions described in Alzheimer's zzso
