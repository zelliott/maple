We here report the synthesis and biological evaluation of new zzso derivatives designed as potential zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used to generate three scaffolds that were successively exploited to introduce various zzso on the zzso zzso The synthesis includes a final zzso key zzso reaction, which was carried out with a zzso zzso or with a zzso zzso Each step was zzso and the complete chemical strategy is zzso Several compounds showed a marked zzso against zzso human leukemia cells with zzso values in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso relationships were zzso Cell cycle analysis, zzso I zzso and interaction with DNA were zzso and zzso of zzso activity was also zzso Although binding of the drugs to DNA likely contributes to the zzso action, the exact molecular targets of these molecules remain zzso The efficient chemical routes reported here for the design of highly zzso compounds provide novel opportunities to identify zzso agents in the zzso zzso
