zzso in the zzso zzso gene are frequent in breast zzso These zzso are associated with poor zzso thought to be due to zzso advantage and poor response to chemotherapy associated with loss of zzso zzso The focal zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso is zzso in a variety of human tumors including breast zzso zzso is a critical regulator of zzso and zzso and its zzso is associated with increased zzso zzso Recently, zzso promoter has been shown to contain zzso responsive elements and to be zzso by zzso in a zzso zzso Here, we have used five zzso breast cancer cells lines with different zzso status, including an zzso model, to show that zzso expression was regulated in a zzso manner in response to zzso zzso protein and zzso expression were zzso by zzso in zzso but not zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso while over expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiment showed that zzso bound to zzso promoter in the presence of zzso in zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso cells, suggesting a direct role of zzso in down regulating zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was also found to correlate with zzso zzso status in a series of breast zzso Finally, loss of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells was correlated with increased proliferation and invasion upon zzso zzso while zzso zzso reduced zzso These results suggest that zzso is an important down regulator of zzso and that loss of zzso function in breast cancer may contribute to the zzso potential of zzso tumors through uncontrolled zzso expression upon zzso zzso
