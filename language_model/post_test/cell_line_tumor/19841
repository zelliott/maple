A wealth of zzso evidence supports the zzso properties of zzso zzso which is a major zzso food component in zzso zzso However, the underlying molecular zzso accounting for these effects remain zzso In the present study, zzso zzso alpha zzso was identified as a potential molecular target for zzso Treating zzso cells with 100 zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso expression by approximately zzso compared to zzso This reduction in zzso transcript levels was confirmed using real-time zzso chain zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was considerably more effective in depressing zzso zzso in zzso cells than the zzso zzso The zzso effects of 5 zzso zzso on zzso zzso was comparable to that caused by 100 zzso zzso zzso is known to accumulate in the nucleus and is a preferred zzso for zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso to zzso The addition of other zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso and zzso (10 zzso to the culture media resulted in a similar suppression in zzso zzso levels to that caused by 5 zzso zzso Thus, it is likely that the binding of zzso to zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso The results from these experiments suggest that the zzso effects of zzso in zzso human breast cancer cells may arise from its ability to reduce zzso expression through the binding of its zzso zzso to the nuclear zzso
