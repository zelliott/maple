Despite important advances in human zzso no specific treatment for both zzso zzso and resistant zzso zzso is zzso Gene transfer by viral zzso can be considered as a promising way to achieve a specific and efficient zzso Here we show the possibility of efficient gene transfer in human zzso zzso cells in zzso using a human zzso virus zzso zzso zzso Using enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso gene as a marker placed under the zzso zzso zzso promoter, zzso and zzso zzso were zzso even with moderate viral zzso The expression started at day 2, reached a peak at day 5, and it was still present at day zzso For targeting zzso and zzso zzso human growth hormone zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso zzso and two fragments of the human zzso hormone zzso promoter zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso and zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso were zzso In zzso zzso the percentage of identified fluorescent cells and the zzso intensity analyzed by zzso cell sorting indicated that the strength of the zzso 1 and zzso 2 promoters were comparable to that of the zzso zzso zzso cultures of rat zzso cells showed that zzso 1 is more selective to zzso and zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso promoter activity appeared weak in zzso zzso The human zzso zzso did not increase the zzso promoter activity at all but the human zzso promoter zzso zzso allowed zzso more fluorescent cells to be obtained than the zzso zzso Several cell lines appeared too zzso to test zzso of zzso zzso However, on human zzso cell cultures, the tested zzso promoters seemed clearly selective to target zzso zzso zzso This study gives a starting point for a zzso program using zzso zzso to transfer therapeutic genes in human zzso zzso
