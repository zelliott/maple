The zzso determining zzso cellular zzso which depends upon zzso of the zzso tumor zzso zzso is poorly zzso A growing body of evidence suggests that promotion of DNA zzso break repair by zzso zzso zzso may be the means by which zzso maintains zzso stability, while a role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso processes has just begun to be zzso The zzso protein becomes zzso in response to DNA damage, but the effects of zzso on zzso repair are zzso In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the zzso regulation of zzso requires the zzso and zzso zzso zzso We studied zzso zzso and random zzso integration of zzso zzso DNA, a zzso of zzso which we demonstrate to be dependent on the zzso zzso Prevention of zzso zzso via zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso disrupted both the zzso promotion of zzso and the suppression of zzso Similar results were obtained when zzso zzso zzso activity was inhibited by expression of a zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, the opposing regulation of zzso and zzso did not require the zzso zzso sites on zzso zzso and zzso Together, these data suggest a functional link between zzso control and breast cancer predisposition in carriers of zzso and zzso germ line zzso We propose a dual regulatory role for zzso in maintaining zzso integrity, zzso zzso zzso status controls the selectivity of repair events dictated by zzso and zzso zzso
