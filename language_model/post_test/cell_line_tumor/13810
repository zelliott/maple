The inhibitor of zzso protein zzso plays an important role in zzso and may be a potential target for cancer zzso zzso which belongs to this family, is highly expressed in various zzso The previous study demonstrated that zzso zzso gene promoted lung cancer cell zzso however, the effects on tumor growth suppression by targeting this gene in zzso to thereby determine the efficacy of targeting zzso for patient therapy, have not been zzso This study injected zzso zzso into established zzso tumors derived from the lung zzso cell line zzso in zzso nude mice, the result showed that zzso zzso zzso expression zzso induced tumor cell zzso reduced tumor cell zzso and suppressed tumor growth dramatically, with a tumor volume zzso rate of zzso and a tumor weight zzso rate of zzso but with less severe adverse reaction to the zzso This study further demonstrated that zzso gene zzso induced a zzso cell cycle arrest and zzso D1 zzso which is a key regulator of the zzso to zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso local injection may serve as a therapeutic method for patient treatment, and that zzso may suppress tumor growth by arresting the cell cycle in the zzso
