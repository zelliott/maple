zzso zzso has excellent efficiency against a wide spectrum of zzso However, the current clinical zzso has limited its zzso as it causes some severe side zzso Various zzso zzso have thus been developed as alternative zzso of zzso but they have been mostly zzso on a laboratory zzso Previously, we zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso 1000 zzso zzso and found that it exhibited great potential in drug delivery with improved zzso In this study, we applied the zzso porous glass zzso zzso technique to prepare the zzso zzso zzso on a pilot zzso The effect of several zzso variables on the zzso zzso properties, including particle size, zzso potential, and zzso efficiency, were investigated based on zzso type and concentration in the zzso phase, zzso phase zzso ratio, zzso size, zzso cycles, and operation zzso The zzso zzso were obtained with sizes of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso value zzso standard zzso and zzso efficiency of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso study exhibited a significant advantage of zzso zzso over zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso and zzso higher values for area under the curve, zzso and mean residence time, respectively, compared with those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso higher than those of zzso zzso In zzso real-time distribution of zzso was measured on zzso mice by zzso zzso imaging, which demonstrated that the zzso zzso achieved much higher concentration and longer retention in tumors than zzso zzso after intravenous zzso This is consistent with the zzso behavior of the zzso The zzso effect of zzso zzso was observed in zzso in an zzso zzso mice model via intravenous zzso This indicated that zzso zzso are a feasible zzso zzso with a pilot fabrication technique and have superior zzso and zzso effects compared to the commercially available zzso
