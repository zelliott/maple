To investigate the pharmacological effects and underlying mechanism of zzso zzso on human zzso cells in zzso 

The zzso activity of human zzso zzso cells was determined by zzso zzso after 24 zzso incubation with 50, 100, 200 zzso zzso and control vehicle zzso Colony formation efficiencies of the cells were zzso zzso of the 1st, 3rd and 6th generations were zzso followed by evaluations of zzso A protein expression by Western zzso cell cycle distribution by flow zzso zzso level by single cell gel zzso and proliferation index by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso inhibited zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso A expression levels in the cells treated with 50 and 100 zzso zzso were significantly lower than controls zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the expression was in a zzso and zzso zzso Compared with controls, zzso phase cells were obviously decreased zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso and S phase cells significantly increased zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso after treatment with 50, 100 and 200 zzso zzso The cell numbers of zzso and S zzso at the 1st generation of above three treated groups changed in a zzso manner, whereas S phase cells increases in all zzso treatment groups and zzso phase cell decrease in group treated with 50 zzso zzso were also in a zzso zzso Both the zzso cells of the 1st and 6th generations of all zzso treatment groups were significantly more than controls zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso their numbers of the 6th generations of the three groups increased with zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso and all of them were more than the 1st and 3rd generations of the same dosage group zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso Colony formation efficiencies and zzso labeling indexes of the three zzso treatment groups were distinctly lower than controls zzso zzso zzso and they were also decreased with the zzso of zzso concentration and/or the zzso of the zzso zzso The difference of any above zzso had no significance among the 1st, 3rd and 6th generations of control group zzso zzso zzso 

zzso blocks zzso conversion of zzso cells by zzso of zzso activity and zzso A zzso leading to an enhancement of zzso and suppression of cell zzso
