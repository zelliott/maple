zzso zzso using zzso zzso type 1 zzso cells has been considered as a potential strategy for tumor zzso However, its application to tumor zzso has been hampered by difficulties in expanding zzso zzso cells from zzso zzso Here, we have developed an efficient protocol for preparing mouse zzso zzso cells from zzso activated zzso cells after zzso transfer of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso cells zzso with the zzso and zzso genes from the zzso zzso zzso zzso clone zzso produce zzso but not zzso in response to stimulation with zzso peptides or zzso B zzso zzso cells expressing zzso as a model tumor zzso zzso zzso cells also exhibited zzso against tumor cells in an zzso zzso Moreover, adoptive transfer of zzso zzso cells, but not zzso zzso cells, exhibited potent zzso activity in zzso and, when combined with zzso treatment, completely eradicated established tumor zzso Thus, zzso zzso cells are a promising alternative for the development of effective adoptive zzso
