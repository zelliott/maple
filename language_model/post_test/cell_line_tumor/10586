zzso zzso is useful not only as a novel tumor marker, but also as an zzso zzso for zzso We recently established zzso zzso zzso zzso clones from zzso zzso patients after zzso zzso zzso The present study was designed to evaluate the tumor zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso clone against zzso clear cell zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso clone could recognize zzso and zzso zzso CCC cell lines on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and showed zzso against zzso zzso The zzso clone recognized naturally processed zzso zzso on zzso CCC cells in a zzso class zzso zzso Moreover, we confirmed that the level of zzso expression was responsible for zzso recognition and that zzso chemotherapy made tumor cells more susceptible to the zzso effect of zzso Thus, it might be possible to treat zzso CCC patients by combining chemotherapy with zzso Our data suggest that zzso could be an effective target for zzso against zzso zzso
