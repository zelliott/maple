zzso leak syndrome zzso is the major zzso toxicity of zzso zzso In our previous study, a modified zzso zzso zzso was engineered to eliminate zzso The zzso zzso has been proved to retain potent zzso activity but with a remarkable zzso in zzso In the present study, we have constructed and expressed a zzso zzso zzso containing humanized zzso zzso zzso zzso genetically fused to zzso in zzso zzso After washing with buffer containing 2 M zzso the purity of inclusion body was about zzso The zzso inclusion bodies were zzso zzso in zzso buffer zzso zzso containing zzso of zzso and 1 zzso of zzso using a zzso of decreasing zzso We found that the presence of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso buffer was important for efficient zzso In addition, slow flow rate was another important factor could increase zzso Under these conditions, the activity of the zzso protein could reach about zzso of that of the native zzso The zzso proteins were zzso to zzso ( approximately zzso zzso by a combination of zzso metal affinity zzso and gel zzso zzso The in zzso zzso zzso indicated the zzso zzso zzso had specific zzso to zzso zzso cells comparable to zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso was shown to be much weaker in inducing zzso in mice than zzso The protein zzso zzso and zzso system established in this paper is important for further study on zzso zzso
