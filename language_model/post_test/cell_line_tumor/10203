We report the design, zzso and zzso relationship zzso of a series of novel zzso compounds as potent zzso zzso zzso We evaluate their specificity profile against a panel of human zzso zzso as well as their biological profile toward a panel of zzso cancer cell zzso Our study reveals that zzso in the 3- and zzso of the zzso zzso lead to improved potency and improved selectivity both in zzso and zzso zzso Altogether, our results provide an insight into the zzso of zzso for the development of drug candidates with improved potency and selectivity for the targeted treatment of zzso
