zzso libraries of artificial zzso zzso factors zzso provide a robust tool for inducing and understanding various functional components of the cancer zzso zzso we zzso zzso zzso library technology to better understand how breast cancer cells acquire resistance to zzso a clinically important zzso therapeutic zzso From a diverse collection of nearly 400,000 different zzso we isolated six zzso library members capable of inducing stable, long-term zzso zzso in two independent zzso zzso breast cancer cell zzso Comparative gene expression profile analysis of the six different zzso breast cancer cell lines revealed five distinct clusters of zzso expressed zzso One cluster was shared among all 6 zzso cell lines and therefore constituted a common zzso gene expression zzso zzso zzso of this common zzso resistant signature also revealed significant overlap with gene sets associated with an zzso zzso state and with gene sets associated with drug resistance to different classes of breast cancer zzso therapeutic zzso zzso of the four remaining unique gene clusters revealed overlap with zzso zzso Finally, we also demonstrated that the common zzso signature is associated with poor prognosis by interrogating five independent, publicly available human breast cancer gene expression zzso Our results demonstrate that artificial zzso libraries can be used successfully to induce stable zzso in human cancer cell lines and to identify a gene expression signature that is associated with a clinically relevant zzso zzso
