The growth and circulation of B zzso is largely under the control of bone zzso zzso cells, zzso and zzso The gene responsible for the pivotal B cell growth factor, zzso derived zzso zzso has recently been shown to contain a single zzso zzso G zzso A at position 801 which leads to higher zzso zzso This zzso is common in the normal population and has been shown to play a potential role in the development of both zzso and zzso related zzso zzso We therefore undertook a large zzso study to ascertain its role in the zzso of two other common zzso zzso notably chronic zzso leukemia zzso 197 zzso and multiple myeloma zzso zzso We show that the 801 G zzso A zzso plays no role in the zzso of multiple myeloma or zzso nor the outcome in multiple zzso By contrast, it trends towards an inferior zzso survival in zzso
