The effects of tumor necrosis zzso zzso on zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso zzso and downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso was examined in zzso liver zzso The zzso treatment of zzso cells with zzso for 1 h caused zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was obtained with 1 zzso zzso and no further increase was observed with higher zzso of this zzso The cells zzso with zzso for 1 h followed by incubation with insulin (10 zzso showed near additive effect on zzso of zzso and downstream zzso zzso zzso The long-term zzso 8, 24 zzso zzso treatment of cells with optimal (1 zzso concentration of zzso also caused zzso of zzso albeit to a lesser zzso However, long-term zzso of cells with zzso reduced zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and long-term zzso of zzso cells with zzso also resulted in parallel changes in zzso synthesis in the presence of zzso In fact, long-term zzso with zzso completely abolished the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that short-term exposure to zzso zzso insulin effects whereas long-term exposure causes insulin resistance in zzso zzso
