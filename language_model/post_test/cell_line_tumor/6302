zzso zzso T zzso cells are a population of zzso zzso which are restricted by the zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso is a zzso member of the zzso class I family of zzso it is unknown if zzso presents any kind of zzso to zzso zzso In the present manuscript we describe that detection of zzso on the cell surface by zzso zzso zzso is enhanced upon culture the cells at zzso we also show that detection of zzso on the cell surface is lost after treating the cells at pH zzso as in the case of classical zzso class I zzso Finally, the zzso of zzso on the cell surface is independent of zzso Taken together these results strongly suggest that zzso needs to bind zzso zzso in order to properly reach the cell zzso
