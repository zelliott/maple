zzso zzso are produced and shed by some tumors into the zzso zzso Their concentration is related to disease progression in children with zzso and in experimental zzso The mechanism for this tumor promoting effect is not zzso 

Here, we investigated the effect of zzso on zzso and tumor cell zzso under zzso forces simulating zzso and zzso zzso 

High zzso force increased zzso zzso zzso compared to low zzso zzso of zzso with zzso increased zzso at low zzso to a level comparable to high zzso zzso The addition of zzso to zzso zzso at high zzso did not further increase zzso zzso zzso cells are adherent to collagen in zzso zzso No effect of either zzso or zzso was observed on cell zzso under dynamic zzso However, when zzso in the presence of zzso an increase in binding of tumor cells was observed at both zzso forces compared to cells zzso 

These results demonstrate that zzso and zzso increase dynamic zzso zzso to zzso In addition, zzso facilitate tumor cell zzso zzso by acting as a zzso of zzso zzso zzso may promote blood borne zzso by increasing zzso binding to the vessel wall and in turn facilitate tumor cell arrest in zzso
