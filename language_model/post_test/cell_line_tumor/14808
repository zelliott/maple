zzso zzso administration of zzso zzso zzso prepared by zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso can efficiently suppress the growth of zzso zzso In this study, we characterized the drug distribution of zzso injected zzso in zzso tumor and liver in a mouse model using zzso human gastric cancer zzso Oregon zzso zzso showed zzso zzso in zzso tumor in the zzso at 24 h after intravenous zzso zzso however, the amount of zzso in tumor was markedly less than that in zzso In contrast, a larger amount of zzso accumulated in the peripheral area of zzso zzso at 1 h after zzso injection and the area gradually zzso The depth of zzso zzso reached 1 zzso from the tumor surface at 48 h after zzso injection, and the zzso intensity was markedly greater than that in zzso Interestingly, zzso injected zzso zzso accumulated in relatively zzso areas, and many tumor cells in the vicinity of zzso zzso showed zzso This unique zzso pattern and lesser zzso in zzso areas are thought to be attributable to the superior penetrating activity of zzso and thus, zzso is considered to be highly suitable for zzso chemotherapy for zzso zzso
