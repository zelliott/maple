The amplification of the zzso band of zzso 8 zzso occurs in a large percentage of breast zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso located in the zzso region, zzso regulates the zzso tumor zzso zzso To characterize the role of zzso in breast cancer, we analyzed zzso gene dosage and expression level as well as zzso zzso A copy number gain of zzso was found in 51% zzso of breast cancer cell lines and in zzso zzso of primary breast zzso zzso of zzso zzso was analyzed with real-time zzso Northern zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso is zzso in zzso zzso of breast cancer cell lines, and zzso of zzso is significantly correlated with a gene copy number zzso In a panel of zzso from primary breast tumors and normal zzso expression of zzso in tumors is significantly higher than that in normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly induced cell growth arrest and zzso in the zzso and zzso breast cancer cell zzso zzso zzso zzso activated zzso zzso zzso of zzso by the zzso system in 2 immortalized breast zzso cell lines zzso and zzso promoted cell zzso These results suggest that zzso aberrations of zzso may contribute to the zzso of breast zzso
