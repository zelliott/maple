The zzso zzso have a heavily zzso zzso domain, a zzso membrane domain and a short zzso zzso Three of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are clustered on zzso 7 and found in the gastrointestinal zzso These zzso have zzso sequences typical of zzso zzso To identify zzso proteins that are able to interact with the zzso screened zzso domain zzso using zzso zzso fluorescent zzso zzso zzso exhibited a strong binding to zzso zzso domain containing 1), whereas the binding zzso zzso regulatory factor 1) was zzso we showed weak binding of zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso pull-down experiments confirmed that the zzso tail of zzso zzso with the scaffold protein zzso as identified zzso This was zzso through the zzso zzso site in zzso which was capable of binding to three of the four zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso or zzso mouse zzso with an zzso against zzso mouse zzso of human zzso revealed strong zzso membrane zzso in the zzso mice compared with an zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso This suggests that zzso plays a specific role in stabilizing zzso the zzso membrane of small zzso zzso
