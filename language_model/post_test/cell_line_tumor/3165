Full details of the development of a direct zzso of zzso with zzso to provide zzso are described along with key zzso and labeling zzso Following an zzso zzso reaction initiated by generation of a presumed zzso radical zzso that zzso a subsequent zzso fragmentation and zzso zzso with zzso addition of the resulting reaction mixture to an zzso solution leads to zzso of the zzso double bond and reduction of the intermediate zzso zzso directly providing zzso zzso and zzso zzso its naturally occurring zzso alcohol zzso The yield of coupled products, which exclusively possess the natural zzso zzso approaches or exceeds zzso and the combined yield of the zzso zzso alcohols is zzso zzso studies of zzso zzso reaction illustrate a zzso zzso zzso zzso identify alternatives to zzso trap at the oxidized zzso provide a unique entry into zzso zzso zzso and afford initial insights into the observed zzso zzso The first disclosure of the use of zzso proceeding through zzso in such zzso reactions is also detailed with identical zzso zzso zzso either a zzso zzso group or a zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso whereas the removal of the potentially key zzso zzso group of zzso does not adversely impact the zzso zzso Extension of these studies provided a total synthesis of zzso zzso via zzso zzso also a natural zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso both of which we can now suggest are likely natural products produced by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as a series of key zzso bearing systematic modifications in the zzso zzso Their biological evaluation provided additional insights into the key functionality within the zzso zzso contributing to the activity and sets the foundation on which further, more zzso changes in the structures of 1 and 2 will be explored in future zzso
