The zzso target of zzso zzso signaling network is central to the regulation of cell growth in response to both growth factors and zzso We developed a zzso zzso zzso to identify zzso zzso of the zzso signaling zzso One such compound, which we name zzso zzso zzso this network by directly targeting the zzso activity of the zzso zzso of class zzso zzso This study illustrates the power of zzso zzso screening as a means for illuminating cell circuitry, and resulted in the identification of a zzso for selective zzso of the class zzso zzso
