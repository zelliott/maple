zzso primarily acts as a zzso between the plasma membrane and the zzso and is a key component in tumor zzso In the present study, zzso interference zzso using zzso small hairpin zzso zzso zzso was used to define the roles of zzso in the regulation of zzso behaviors of human breast zzso The highly zzso human breast cancer cell zzso in which zzso zzso and protein levels are the zzso was selected as a cell model in zzso In addition, we also found that zzso expression was zzso and its zzso zzso from cell membrane to zzso whereas zzso expression decreased and showed the same cell distribution as zzso in zzso zzso of human breast zzso After repression of zzso by more than zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso in zzso and protein levels was maintained in the stable expressing zzso zzso zzso cell zzso the abilities of cell zzso and zzso were obviously inhibited with a zzso and zzso respectively, and the altered cell polarity was zzso Western zzso analyses further revealed that the zzso of zzso induced an increased zzso expression and a decreased zzso of zzso by zzso zzso levels of zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso positively correlated with zzso zzso of human breast cancer cells, especially zzso system zzso zzso zzso expression by zzso reversed zzso behaviors of human breast cancer cells by inducing zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may have potential values in assessing zzso zzso of human breast zzso
