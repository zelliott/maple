We describe the use of novel zzso zzso zzso zzso to enhance zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso constructed from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso show enhanced zzso in mantle cell zzso zzso and other zzso cell lines, as well as patient tumor samples, without a zzso zzso compared with their parental zzso counterparts, alone or in zzso The zzso zzso have different properties from and are more potent than their parental zzso in zzso The juxtaposition of zzso and zzso on zzso cells by the zzso resulted in zzso zzso and triggered zzso changes that include loss of zzso zzso potential, production of zzso oxygen species, rapid and sustained zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso membrane zzso culminating in cell zzso They also displayed different zzso in depleting zzso cells and normal B cells from whole blood ex zzso and significantly extended the survival of nude mice bearing zzso zzso in a zzso manner, thus indicating stability and zzso activity in zzso Such zzso zzso may constitute a new class of therapeutic agents for improved cancer zzso as shown here for zzso and other zzso zzso
