zzso gene therapy combined with radiation is expected to be a new approach to treat pancreatic zzso However, there are no reports of definitive effects of radiation on zzso gene zzso In the present study, we investigated the effect of radiation on the zzso efficiency of an zzso gene zzso 

We used zzso expressing zzso zzso an zzso for zzso growth factor, as a representative gene zzso zzso cancer cells zzso with zzso were zzso and zzso levels in culture media of these cells were zzso We investigated zzso zzso promoter activity and zzso of zzso in these zzso To examine the effect of radiation in zzso zzso was given to zzso subcutaneous tumors in nude mice, and zzso levels in tumors were zzso 

zzso levels in culture media of zzso cells were zzso zzso zzso zzso higher than those of zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso of the zzso promoter and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to increased levels of zzso We found that zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso of zzso 2 may be involved in the zzso zzso of the zzso promoter and zzso zzso zzso zzso levels in zzso tumors were zzso zzso zzso zzso higher than those in zzso zzso 

The present findings suggest that radiation significantly improves the efficiency of zzso gene transfer in pancreatic cancer and probably contributes to decreasing the dose of zzso required for gene transfer and controlling side effects of zzso infection in zzso normal zzso
