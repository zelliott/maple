In engineered zzso medicine, various types of scaffolds have been customized to pursue the optimal environment for different types of therapeutic zzso In liver therapeutic research, zzso require attachment to solid anchors for survival and proliferation before they could grow into cellular zzso with enhanced zzso Among the various zzso scaffolds and vehicles, zzso cell carriers are suited to these zzso Individual spheres may provide two-dimensional zzso zzso surfaces for cell zzso and zzso whereas multiple zzso may form three-dimensional zzso zzso with zzso space for cell expansion and zzso zzso In this study, we culture human liver zzso cell line zzso cells on zzso gelatin zzso of two different zzso zzso suggest that both zzso support cell zzso zzso and spontaneous formation of zzso zzso among which the spheres with bigger size zzso zzso seem more favorable than the smaller ones in terms of zzso formation and liver specific zzso These findings suggest that the zzso zzso is a competent vehicle for liver cell zzso
