Human zzso zzso zzso a heavily zzso protein containing six zzso zzso sites, zzso cortisol and other zzso in blood zzso Here, we investigate the biological importance of the zzso of zzso derived from human serum by performing a structural and functional characterization of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso combined with zzso treatment revealed 26 complex type zzso all of which were terminated with zzso zzso acid zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed predominantly zzso and zzso zzso but higher branching was also zzso zzso from all six zzso sites were identified with high site zzso zzso and zzso from all sites contained a relatively low degree of zzso zzso zzso showed zzso zzso and the zzso differences in zzso and branching could be in zzso correlated with the accessibility to the individual zzso sites on the zzso folded zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were generated to investigate the biological importance of zzso zzso As a functional zzso zzso cells were challenged with native and zzso zzso and the amount of zzso which is produced as a quantitative response upon zzso binding to its cell surface zzso was used to evaluate the zzso zzso The removal of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso increased the production of zzso zzso This confirms that zzso are involved in the zzso interaction and indicates that the zzso is performed by zzso and/or zzso means through the terminal zzso zzso
