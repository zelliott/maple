The selective zzso inhibitor zzso is widely used to treat pain and inflammation in zzso arthritis, zzso and zzso zzso The drug has well-known important effects on immune cells but its direct and/or indirect influence on zzso has not yet been explored in zzso This study aimed to investigate the zzso effects of zzso on cell zzso energy metabolism and bone zzso processes in cultured human zzso zzso 

zzso human zzso and zzso cells were incubated with zzso zzso 10, zzso Cell viability and zzso were determined by zzso blue, zzso and zzso zzso zzso on cellular oxygen consumption were measured zzso using a Clark zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso was determined by zzso zzso protein zzso by zzso and zzso protein expression by zzso 

While zzso at a concentration of 2 and zzso showed only marginal effects, a zzso concentration of zzso influenced viability and energy zzso as well as zzso expression and zzso of zzso zzso Cell viability was significantly reduced by zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso oxygen consumption zzso zzso experiments with the zzso zzso suggest that this effect is due to zzso zzso After zzso zzso zzso expression was significantly zzso zzso protein was not expressed under any of our experimental zzso We also showed that zzso at zzso significantly zzso zzso protein zzso leading to a zzso increase of zzso zzso 

zzso effects of zzso on cell viability zzso oxygen consumption zzso zzso zzso expression zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso in zzso cells were observed only at zzso concentration not reached by therapeutic doses giving plasma zzso less than zzso On the contrary, zzso at 2 and zzso showed only marginal effects, suggesting that zzso administration is probably safe with respect to bone metabolism in cases requiring potent treatment of pain and zzso However, higher zzso zzso which might occur through zzso zzso investigations with high zzso
