By using zzso zzso zzso to vascular zzso growth factor zzso type 1 zzso and zzso we have shown that acute zzso leukemia zzso cells with specific zzso abnormalities are dependent on zzso zzso zzso with zzso is the most dependent zzso on zzso with both zzso and zzso zzso cells depend on zzso with zzso zzso cells with zzso abnormalities showed variable dependence on zzso The growth of zzso cells are most extensively inhibited by zzso zzso Then, the growth of zzso a zzso cell line was suppressed by either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The growth of zzso a zzso cell line was more zzso suppressed by zzso zzso zzso than by zzso zzso zzso These results are quite zzso with the results of clinical samples with zzso or zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso significantly zzso the growth zzso effect of zzso for zzso As for downstream signals, we have shown that zzso zzso growth and survival signals through zzso of zzso and zzso in leukemia cells zzso However, zzso zzso growth and survival signals through pathways other than zzso and zzso zzso although zzso zzso may account for some of the zzso signals zzso Finally, our data suggested that zzso zzso of zzso and zzso observed in zzso cells with specific zzso zzso have contributed to zzso as activated signaling of zzso zzso zzso
