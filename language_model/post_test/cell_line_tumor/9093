Previous analyses of zzso in 40 zzso zzso cell zzso of the head and neck zzso indicated that zzso zzso zzso zzso that were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso occurred within zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso Of the 6, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso peptides were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso against the parental wild type sequence zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso cells were specific for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, and an zzso zzso cell line naturally expressing the zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso zzso can be processed and presented for zzso T cell zzso Furthermore, using an zzso zzso system, zzso zzso zzso cells recognizing the zzso tumor could also be zzso Our analysis of zzso in 10 additional zzso zzso tumors detected the zzso zzso in zzso tumors raising the overall frequency of the zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, independent of their zzso class I zzso the zzso zzso zzso frequency for all human tumors analyzed to date is approximately zzso This unexpectedly high frequency of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso suggests that vaccines targeting this zzso would not only be expected to induce robust zzso immune responses in zzso subjects, but also be more widely zzso than previously envisioned for any given zzso zzso zzso
