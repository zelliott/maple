Early exposure to zzso may zzso to breast cancer risk later in adult zzso It is likely that zzso zzso zzso zzso cells are more susceptible to these exposure injuries over time and transmit the injured memory through zzso mechanisms to their differentiated zzso Here, we used zzso zzso as an in zzso exposure model to study this zzso zzso zzso profiling identified that, relative to control cells, zzso of zzso (82 of zzso zzso were altered in zzso progeny derived from zzso exposed to a synthetic estrogen, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were found at a zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso to zzso This was accompanied by recruitment of DNA zzso 1 that caused an zzso increase in DNA zzso of its promoter zzso island in zzso zzso cells on zzso zzso zzso analyses suggest that zzso plays a role in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso therefore, reduces this cellular function and promotes the proliferation of breast cancer zzso zzso zzso of this zzso may be a hallmark for early breast cancer development, and restoration of its expression by zzso and zzso therapies is another viable option for future treatment of this zzso
