Major zzso complex zzso class I zzso protein A zzso is involved in zzso zzso recognition of target tumor zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the feasibility of zzso of sodium zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso to sensitize zzso cell lung cancer zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a zzso increase in the zzso and protein expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso T cells showed zzso to zzso cells, which was increased by about 50% in the presence of zzso The zzso addition of zzso zzso significantly attenuated the zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced the zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso cells zzso with zzso T cells, and such enhancement was reversed by the zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso tumor cells to zzso zzso zzso through the zzso of zzso and may thus have benefits in improving zzso zzso cancer zzso
