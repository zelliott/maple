zzso by the use of naturally occurring substances is becoming a promising strategy to prevent zzso In this study, the effects of zzso A, a novel constituent isolated from the leaves of zzso zzso on the proliferation of human zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso Under our experimental conditions, zzso A was found to elicit a zzso growth impediment zzso zzso The demise of these cells induced by zzso A was zzso in nature, exhibiting a zzso increase in zzso fraction and DNA zzso zzso zzso analysis further revealed that zzso zzso to zzso resulted in a rapid release of zzso zzso followed by zzso of zzso 3 and zzso zzso and finally cell zzso zzso zzso cells also displayed transient increase of zzso during the earlier stage of the experiment, followed by the disruption of zzso zzso potential zzso The presence of a zzso scavenger zzso and an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso production and the subsequent zzso cell zzso In addition, in order to investigate the acute toxicity of zzso A, groups of zzso old zzso rats were subjected to oral administration of zzso or 700 zzso zzso zzso A four times each week for two zzso There was no significant difference between control animals and treated animals with respect to the body weight gain, the body weight ratio of liver, zzso and zzso zzso and clinical chemistry zzso Taken together, our data suggest that zzso generated through the zzso of zzso zzso plays an essential role in zzso induced by zzso A, and the zzso of zzso A tested in this study did not cause animal zzso
