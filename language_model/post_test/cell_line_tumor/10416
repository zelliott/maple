zzso of zzso zzso is involved in the regulation of cell proliferation in zzso solid zzso The present study aimed at analyzing the relevance of zzso zzso in zzso of human zzso zzso of the human leukemia cells zzso and zzso was determined in the absence or presence of zzso zzso and cell cycle distribution was investigated by determination of zzso activity and/or flow zzso after zzso with zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed by zzso and by a zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited proliferation of both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso effect was due to interference of zzso with the cell cycle with no evident signs of zzso Comparative analysis of expression of zzso in zzso zzso cells and in zzso human mast cells revealed a much lower expression of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells indicating a significantly reduced zzso zzso in the zzso zzso At the zzso level, zzso of proliferation of both cell lines by zzso was associated with cell zzso zzso of the expression of zzso of the zzso zzso The present results point to a significant role of zzso zzso in the zzso of cell proliferation of zzso cells, at least in zzso and zzso cells, that may serve as a potential target for an zzso therapy in the treatment of human zzso
