Different studies describe the zzso effects of zzso species, a medicinal plant widely used in folk medicine since ancient zzso As knowledge regarding the zzso properties of this species is rather zzso we investigated the influence of methanol extracts of different zzso species on cell zzso cell death, and zzso cell zzso through the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were treated with methanol extracts of different zzso species leading to strong growth zzso and high cell death zzso The expression of cell cycle regulators, zzso and cell death zzso was determined by Western zzso zzso zzso the effect of zzso zzso was studied in an zzso reporter zzso and in a novel zzso measuring zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso that were induced by zzso breast cancer zzso zzso extracts of zzso species exhibited strong zzso zzso zzso zzso extract inhibited zzso and later on zzso and zzso zzso inhibited zzso and in both cases this was associated with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso led to necrosis and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso but not zzso zzso effectively attenuated zzso cell zzso through zzso zzso cell zzso which correlated with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso exhibited promising zzso effects and this was most likely due to the zzso of various cell cycle regulators, zzso and zzso and the zzso of zzso
