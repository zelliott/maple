zzso zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and is implicated in the interactions of zzso zzso and bone zzso zzso zzso zzso capacity to bone zzso zzso was impaired for zzso cells, suggesting that a breakdown of adhesive mechanisms governed by an zzso zzso may exist in zzso zzso We previously found that zzso was low expressed in primary acute zzso cells compared with normal bone zzso zzso zzso In this study, we investigate the functional importance of low zzso expression in zzso cell zzso and investigate its effects in the abnormal interaction of zzso cells with zzso zzso After expression of zzso was restored by a zzso agent in zzso cells, zzso zzso was zzso Additionally, zzso zzso interfering zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells resulted in a reduction of cell zzso zzso and enhancement of cell proliferation and colony zzso These results suggest that low expression of zzso contributes to the vigorous growth and transforming ability of zzso zzso
