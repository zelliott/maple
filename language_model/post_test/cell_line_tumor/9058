zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso is a novel zzso acid zzso which has a specific binding affinity to the zzso acid receptors zzso and zzso Using zzso zzso analysis, it was observed that zzso induced zzso in a zzso human colon cancer cell zzso In this study, the induction of zzso proteins and the activities of zzso in a zzso cell line under medication with zzso were zzso 

zzso cells were cultured with different zzso of zzso for 12, 24 and 48 zzso The expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Bid were measured using a Western zzso zzso The activities of zzso zzso and -9 were measured using a zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The Western zzso analysis showed that zzso had almost no effect on the level of zzso zzso or Bid zzso Although zzso did not change the expression of zzso and zzso zzso increased the expression of zzso in both a zzso and a zzso zzso A zzso increase in zzso activity and a zzso increase in zzso activity were observed in cells treated with zzso in comparison to the control cells ( zzso 

Our data indicate that the death zzso root of the zzso signal zzso in zzso cells mainly zzso in the zzso induction of zzso Because the compounds inducing zzso activity are frequent targets of cancer therapy, zzso may be a good candidate for use in the treatment of colon zzso
