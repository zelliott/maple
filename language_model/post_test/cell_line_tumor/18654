Class switch zzso gene conversion, and zzso zzso that diversify rearranged zzso genes to produce various classes of high affinity zzso are dependent on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Evidence suggests that zzso zzso is due to zzso DNA repair that is initiated by zzso zzso of zzso in DNA, whereas the mechanism by which AID controls zzso remains to be zzso In this study, using a zzso model system, we have observed zzso zzso zzso of human AID in zzso zzso is zzso for zzso to zzso zzso and as expected, this zzso is increased upon zzso of zzso zzso AID expression also strongly zzso zzso zzso zzso but only in a strain possessing zzso zzso Thus, the initial step of base zzso repair is required for zzso zzso and is a branch point for either zzso or zzso
