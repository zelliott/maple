The aim of the present study was to examine the potential zzso activity of zzso and other statins together with zzso a second generation zzso zzso against tumor cell zzso zzso effects were measured using crystal violet zzso zzso of the cell cycle and induction of zzso were evaluated using flow zzso and Western zzso migration of tumor cells was measured in a scratch wound zzso and their zzso was measured with a zzso zzso zzso effects of the combination treatment were evaluated in a zzso zzso 02 pancreatic zzso zzso Combination of zzso and zzso produced zzso zzso effects against breast and pancreatic cancer cell zzso The combination was also effective in zzso of tumor cell zzso to collagen IV and zzso and zzso with migration and zzso of tumor zzso Neither zzso nor zzso alone affected tumor growth in mice but the combination treatment resulted in zzso of tumor growth and zzso of mouse zzso The combination of statins and zzso a second generation zzso demonstrates promising zzso effects at doses readily achievable in zzso This combination holds promise for future clinical zzso
