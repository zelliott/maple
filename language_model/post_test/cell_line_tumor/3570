zzso expression of zzso zzso is associated with aggressive zzso growth and decreased survival of patients with breast zzso In general, the breast cancer cell lines with high vascular zzso growth factor zzso expression also express high levels of zzso zzso The consequence of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso both implicated in regulation of these zzso was examined in four cell zzso Treatment with the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso reduced expression of zzso and zzso in zzso cells, partially inhibited expression in zzso and zzso cells, with minimal effects in zzso zzso Treatment with zzso reduced zzso expression in zzso and zzso cells, with partial reduction in zzso and less effect in zzso zzso Thus, zzso and zzso were regulated by different zzso pathways in different cell zzso this suggests that zzso of the zzso active zzso can zzso both zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso is active may identify targets for zzso therapy of breast zzso
