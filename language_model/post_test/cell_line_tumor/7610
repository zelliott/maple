To explore the regulating effect of zzso on B zzso factor, and check whether the regulation influences the growth of multiple myeloma zzso 

The potential binding sites of zzso for zzso were predicted using zzso zzso zzso reporter gene analysis was used to evaluate the regulatory effect of zzso on zzso Human multiple myeloma zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso zzso and their negative controls, zzso After above treatments, zzso zzso and protein levels were detected by real-time zzso and Western zzso analysis, and the proliferation and zzso in the multiple myeloma zzso cells were examined by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso expression levels in the zzso group, zzso zzso group, zzso zzso group and zzso zzso group were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressions in zzso cells zzso with zzso and zzso were significantly decreased compared with that in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein expression level of each group was consistent with the zzso zzso zzso The zzso value in 450 zzso of the zzso group, zzso zzso group, zzso zzso group and zzso zzso group were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In comparison with the zzso group, the zzso value at 450 zzso of zzso and zzso zzso groups was significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso The cell zzso rates of zzso group, zzso zzso group, zzso zzso group and zzso zzso group were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the cell zzso rate of zzso zzso group was significantly increased than that of the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso protein expression level was decreased in the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso can inhibit the proliferation and induce zzso in zzso cells via regulating zzso zzso signaling zzso is involved in the regulation of zzso by zzso
