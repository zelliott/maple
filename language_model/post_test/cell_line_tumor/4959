zzso zzso resulting from bovine leukemia virus infection of sheep offers a large animal model for studying mechanisms underlying zzso zzso of viral information including Tax, the major contributor to the zzso potential of the virus, is critical if not mandatory for tumor zzso In this study, we have identified zzso mechanisms that govern the complete suppression of viral zzso using a zzso zzso clone carrying a silent zzso zzso was not relieved by injection of the zzso B cells into zzso However, zzso expression of Tax or treatment with either the DNA zzso inhibitor zzso or the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso A rescued viral zzso as demonstrated by in zzso zzso zzso Comparing silent and zzso zzso we found zzso connections between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with DNA zzso and decreased accessibility of promoter zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso are associated with the inactive but not the zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso structure marked by zzso zzso and zzso zzso a loss of zzso at zzso zzso 4, and an increase of zzso zzso 9 zzso These observations point to the critical role of zzso mechanisms in zzso zzso zzso a potential strategy to evade immune response and favor the propagation of the transformed zzso
