zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is commonly known as zzso in zzso and Hindi in zzso Various parts of this plant have been used as a folk medicine for the treatment of zzso wound healing, inflammation and as a zzso zzso 

The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the zzso activity and zzso status of zzso methanol extract of zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso treated zzso 

In zzso zzso zzso has been evaluated by using the zzso blue zzso The determination of in zzso zzso activity was performed by using different zzso cells (2 zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso mice groups zzso The groups were treated for 9 consecutive days with zzso at the doses of 200 and 400 zzso zzso zzso After zzso of last dose and 18 h of zzso half of the mice were sacrificed and the rest were kept alive for assessment of increase in life zzso The zzso potential of zzso was assessed by evaluating tumor volume, viable and zzso tumor cell count, tumor weight, zzso parameters and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso parameters were zzso by zzso liver and kidney tissue zzso 

zzso showed direct zzso on zzso cell line in a dose zzso zzso zzso exhibited significant ( zzso decrease in the tumor volume, viable cell count, tumor weight and elevated the life span of zzso tumor bearing zzso The zzso profile, zzso zzso and tissue zzso zzso were reverted to normal level in zzso treated zzso 

Experimental results revealed that zzso possesses potent zzso and zzso zzso Further research is going on to find out the active zzso of zzso for better understanding of mechanism of its zzso and zzso zzso
