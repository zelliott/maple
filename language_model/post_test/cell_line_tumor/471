The zzso zzso proteins act as zzso of the zzso zzso downstream of zzso zzso zzso In this study, we report a novel interaction between protein zzso C delta zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso interact in cells upon basic zzso growth factor zzso indicating a zzso relevance for the zzso This interaction appeared to require the full-length zzso protein and was zzso zzso constraints were released upon zzso zzso allowing the interaction to zzso Although this interaction did not affect the zzso of zzso by another zzso it reduced the zzso of a zzso zzso protein zzso D1 zzso zzso was found to interact more strongly with zzso with increasing amounts of zzso which indicated that instead of competing with zzso for binding with zzso it was more likely to form a zzso complex with both zzso and zzso zzso of the complex was found to be dependent on an existing zzso zzso By zzso the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso was unable to associate with zzso to form the zzso zzso As a consequence of this zzso complex, the existing interaction between zzso and zzso was increased, and the transfer of zzso groups from zzso to zzso was at least partly blocked by zzso The action of zzso on zzso resulted in the zzso of both zzso zzso and invasion of zzso cells via zzso zzso By zzso the capacity of zzso to zzso its zzso zzso zzso may serve to zzso zzso signaling downstream of zzso zzso zzso and to regulate the zzso zzso
