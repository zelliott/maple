zzso has been the mainstay of zzso therapy for zzso zzso breast zzso However, approximately zzso of breast cancer patients do not respond to tamoxifen zzso Further, most tumors eventually acquire tamoxifen zzso zzso it is necessary to develop effective zzso to enhance the efficacy of tamoxifen in breast cancer zzso In this study, we investigated the mechanism by which breast cancer cells develop resistance against tamoxifen from the viewpoint of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso rendered the human breast cancer cells zzso resistant to zzso zzso To examine whether the zzso of zzso can enhance zzso zzso we introduced zzso targeting the zzso gene zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso not only induced zzso without tamoxifen treatment but also zzso the zzso zzso We have previously demonstrated that zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso which are widely used to reduce the serum cholesterol levels in zzso patients, decreases zzso expression in colon cancer zzso To develop a pharmacological approach for improving the efficacy of tamoxifen treatment, we determined whether zzso can enhance zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso the expression of zzso protein in zzso cells in a zzso zzso In addition, the proportion of zzso cells induced by the tamoxifen and zzso combination was greater than the theoretical additive zzso These results suggest that zzso may function as a factor inducing resistance against zzso zzso and the combined use of tamoxifen and zzso may be a novel approach to overcome tamoxifen resistance in breast zzso
