zzso zzso factor zzso positively regulates zzso of zzso genes in several cell zzso including zzso Recent data also indicate a new important role for zzso as a factor that appears to be required for survival of melanoma cells, suggesting a possibility that zzso of zzso function in transformed zzso could lead to a decreased survival via attenuating zzso zzso zzso to gain a better understanding of the role which zzso plays in melanoma cell survival, it is important to find efficient means of abolishing the zzso of its target zzso Recently, a dominant negative zzso lacking the zzso has been shown to zzso zzso and zzso expression in normal zzso and mouse zzso melanoma zzso Here, a dominant negative zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso is described carrying deletions of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso resulted in a complete zzso of the wild type zzso function as tested on both the zzso zzso promoter and an zzso zzso zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso The dominant negative construct also strongly zzso the activity of a zzso zzso zzso zzso deletion of both zzso zzso was necessary to eliminate the residual zzso activity observed when only the zzso domain was removed and to achieve the repressive effect in human melanoma zzso If the activity of zzso plays a role in the long-term survival of zzso zzso zzso of a strong dominant negative zzso zzso might be a useful strategy to suppress its zzso zzso
