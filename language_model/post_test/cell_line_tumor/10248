zzso regulation of genes involves the coordination of DNA zzso and zzso modifications to maintain zzso zzso These two features are frequently disrupted in zzso such that critical genes succumb to zzso zzso zzso is an agent which zzso DNA zzso and holds great potential as a treatment for cancer, yet the extent of its effectiveness varies greatly between zzso zzso Previous evidence suggests expression status after zzso exposure cannot be explained by the DNA zzso status zzso 

We sought to identify zzso changes involved with short and long term gene zzso following zzso zzso Two zzso cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso were treated with zzso and then grown in drug-free media to allow DNA zzso DNA zzso and zzso modifications were assessed with zzso sequencing and zzso zzso zzso 

Increased zzso zzso zzso zzso and loss of zzso zzso were associated with zzso zzso genes that did not show increased zzso were zzso expressed with zzso treatment before reverting to an inactive zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were still expressed 10 days post zzso treatment and displayed zzso zzso at the zzso start site, and also an increased enrichment of zzso zzso zzso 

These observations suggest that zzso alone is insufficient to reactivate silenced genes and that increased zzso zzso zzso in unison with zzso zzso allows long term zzso of these zzso silenced zzso This study suggests that combined DNA zzso and zzso zzso zzso may aid long term zzso of silenced zzso
