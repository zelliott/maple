zzso is a protein involved in DNA repair, transcription, zzso translation, and zzso zzso resistance in several zzso However, it is unknown which zzso activity is required for this zzso To identify the zzso by which nuclear zzso zzso zzso resistance, we generated several zzso zzso and tested their impact on resistance in the zzso tumor cell lines zzso and zzso zzso of wild type zzso bestowed zzso resistance in such cells but a zzso zzso with a point zzso at position 175 zzso did zzso A truncated zzso increased zzso resistance above the levels zzso by wild type zzso The truncated zzso has intact zzso activities but could not separate a DNA duplex containing a zzso sequence zzso associated with DNA zzso Moreover, this truncated zzso did not alter zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso as it had low binding affinity for several zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso protein behaved like wild type zzso regarding all these activities but yet did not zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso of zzso zzso had low impact on overall zzso The wild type and truncated zzso induced important but different zzso in gene expression as revealed by zzso zzso Our results indicate that the zzso and the zzso activities associated with zzso have minor impact on zzso zzso In contrast, the global expression profiles displayed by both wild type and truncated zzso revealed several zzso signatures which differed depending on the genetic status of the breast cancer cell line zzso
