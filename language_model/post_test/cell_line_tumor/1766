zzso DNA and zzso are DNA zzso zzso sequences associated with zzso zzso that can facilitate the formation and increase the stabilization of zzso can halt tumor cell proliferation and have been regarded as potential zzso zzso In the present study, we have investigated the interaction of 11 natural zzso with zzso formed by zzso DNA and zzso zzso Our results indicated that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the first series zzso can induce the formation of zzso as well as increase the stabilization zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the second series zzso showed similar stabilization zzso We found that zzso ring C, zzso positively charged centers, and zzso aromatic rings are key factors to increase the stabilization ability of S1, and we gave some advice on structure modification to zzso through zzso zzso Besides, we found San and zzso to be cell cycle blocker in zzso San was speculated to bind to zzso through zzso or end zzso
