Clinical studies of patients treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso labeled with zzso and zzso have shown overall response rates in the range of zzso This study evaluates the potential for combination therapy with zzso in an effort to improve clinical zzso 

Human pancreatic zzso zzso rat pancreatic cancer zzso and human small cell lung cancer zzso cells were each treated with 1 zzso zzso for 4 days followed by replacement of the medium alone for four additional zzso Cell cycle and direct zzso studies were performed with zzso after the total zzso treatment as zzso Cell viability and zzso experiments were performed to study the effects of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Parallel control studies were performed with zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso treated with zzso for 4 days showed a zzso of zzso expression as determined by zzso zzso However, after 4 days of additional growth in absence of zzso the zzso of zzso was zzso times greater than that of the zzso control zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso of the cell population was in the zzso phase of the cell zzso Due to zzso zzso and cell cycle zzso synergistic effects of zzso zzso were observed in cell viability and zzso zzso zzso resulted in two to three times greater zzso in zzso zzso cells compared to the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and acts as a zzso through cell cycle zzso The rational combination of zzso and zzso zzso represents a promising zzso therapeutic tool with great potential to improve clinical outcomes and, thus, merits further zzso
