zzso B virus zzso belongs to the zzso family of enveloped DNA zzso It was previously shown that zzso can induce zzso zzso zzso stress and activate the zzso zzso of the unfolded protein response zzso through the expression of the viral regulatory protein X zzso However, it remained obscure whether or not this zzso had any functional consequences on the target genes of the zzso zzso Of these targets, the zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso are thought to play an important role in zzso the zzso stress during zzso by recognizing terminally zzso zzso and delivering them to the zzso degradation zzso In this study, we investigated the role of zzso in the zzso zzso We found that synthesis of zzso zzso and its zzso zzso and zzso is significantly zzso in cells with persistent or transient zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso envelope proteins with zzso resulted in their massive degradation, a process reversed by zzso zzso Surprisingly, the zzso rather than the zzso were involved in disposal of the zzso envelope zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso expression in zzso replicating cells significantly increased zzso of both, enveloped virus and zzso zzso This is the first report showing that zzso activates the zzso pathway, which, in turn, reduces the amount of envelope zzso possibly as a mechanism to control the level of virus particles in infected cells and facilitate the establishment of chronic zzso
