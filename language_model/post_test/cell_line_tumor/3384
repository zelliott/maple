We describe the use of laser ultraviolet zzso zzso to study the interaction of zzso factors with in zzso assembled zzso DNA templates in real zzso Because the laser source delivers a high density of photons in a single zzso pulse, the zzso reaction is completed in less than 1 zzso allowing the investigator to freeze rapid dynamic changes in zzso zzso Using this approach, we have sampled the dynamic equilibrium of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso complex zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on a zzso mouse zzso tumor virus promoter in zzso zzso laser zzso shows that the zzso and zzso complex zzso a periodic binding and displacement event during the process of zzso zzso The zzso provides unique information regarding the equilibrium of zzso interactions in real time and can be easily adapted to study the dynamic events in the assembly and zzso of other zzso complexes on zzso or DNA zzso
