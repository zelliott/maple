zzso zzso is a known marker for zzso embryonic stem cells and zzso zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso is regulated in zzso cells remains zzso Here we report that zzso an zzso zzso protein known for its role in maintaining stem cell zzso is a zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso in embryonic stem cells resulted in a reduction of zzso zzso whereas forced expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso reporter, we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso deletion studies mapped the zzso element between zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso Although zzso and zzso can both zzso zzso promoter, only zzso zzso with zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate that the C zzso of zzso is responsible for zzso the zzso promoter, a function that can be zzso for by a viral zzso zzso efficiently in zzso cells but less so in zzso zzso Taking these findings together, we conclude that zzso is a direct target of zzso which is zzso by zzso and zzso
