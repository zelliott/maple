Enteric zzso that act at G zzso receptors zzso are well known to acutely promote zzso zzso and fluid zzso Here we examined if acute zzso zzso might have more long-term consequences for zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was measured as changes in zzso current across zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was measured by western zzso and zzso zzso levels by zzso zzso 

While acute (15 zzso treatment of zzso cells with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rapidly zzso zzso zzso subsequent zzso responses were attenuated in a zzso zzso The first phase was transient and resolved within 6 h but this was followed by a chronic phase of attenuated responsiveness that was sustained up to 48 zzso zzso did not chronically alter responses to another zzso zzso zzso or to zzso or zzso which elevate zzso zzso and zzso zzso This chronically acting zzso mechanism is not shared by zzso that activate zzso zzso medium from zzso cells zzso its chronic zzso actions, suggesting involvement of an zzso soluble factor but further zzso ruled out the involvement of zzso growth factor zzso zzso Acute zzso exposure did not chronically alter surface expression of zzso zzso receptors but inhibited zzso zzso zzso upon subsequent zzso zzso 

These data reveal a novel, chronically acting, zzso mechanism that zzso zzso zzso capacity upon repeated zzso zzso zzso This mechanism involves release of a soluble factor that zzso zzso zzso from downstream zzso zzso
