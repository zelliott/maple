A previous study has illustrated that the zzso zzso served as the functional zzso for West Nile virus zzso entry into zzso zzso III zzso of zzso envelope protein zzso was zzso to mediate virus binding to the cellular zzso In this study, the specificity and affinity binding of zzso E zzso protein to zzso zzso was confirmed with zzso and zzso competition zzso zzso of zzso E zzso protein to zzso zzso induced the zzso of focal zzso zzso that is required to mediate zzso zzso into zzso A novel platform was then developed using the atomic force zzso to measure this specific binding force between zzso E zzso protein and the cellular zzso zzso zzso The single protein zzso force measured was in the range of 45 zzso 5 zzso This interacting force was highly specific as minimal force was measured in the zzso E zzso protein interaction with zzso zzso molecules and zzso zzso These experiments provided an insight to zzso zzso zzso Force measurement using atomic force zzso can serve to zzso analyze the effect of candidate drugs that zzso zzso zzso zzso
