The identification of zzso and zzso genes that are zzso expressed is a useful step in defining new targets for the diagnosis and treatment of zzso zzso information on the zzso zzso of genes represented on DNA zzso is difficult and is limited by the incomplete sequence and zzso that is available in existing zzso Here we combine a zzso and zzso approach to identify zzso and zzso genes expressed in the zzso breast cancer cell zzso Our approach is based on the analysis of differential zzso levels of zzso that have been physically separated by virtue of their association with zzso on the zzso zzso This approach is specifically zzso to zzso zzso such as zzso which use zzso zzso instead of zzso competitive zzso zzso to zzso and zzso class membership is based on both the differential zzso levels and an expression zzso which are calculated zzso from data collected on a reference set of known zzso and membrane zzso This method enabled the identification of zzso zzso and zzso probe sets expressed in zzso cells for which this zzso did not previously zzso The data were used to filter a previously reported expression zzso to identify zzso and zzso genes which are associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer and represent potential targets for diagnosis and zzso The approach reported here should provide a useful tool for the analysis of gene expression patterns, identifying zzso or zzso genes with biological relevance that have the potential for clinical applications in diagnosis or zzso
