Imaging methods can give both zzso and spatial dimensions to characterize the processes in progression of and/or treatment of specific disease zzso tumors can be cured after zzso zzso Growth and reduction of tumors as a result of zzso therapy can be followed by zzso video imaging directly on the same animal after zzso Imaging of tumors should bring more information on the cellular effects of zzso Green fluorescent protein zzso expressing zzso and zzso tumors implanted in zzso mice were treated with zzso with zzso The growth or zzso of the tumors was monitored either classically by using a zzso or by a manual definition of the region of interest where critical zzso levels were detected on the zzso A very good correlation between the two methods was zzso The zzso mean zzso zzso was only slightly affected by zzso with zzso injected zzso zzso zzso observations under a zzso microscope showed that zzso was only detected on the outer layer of the zzso No zzso was detected in the central part of the tumors, which were zzso
