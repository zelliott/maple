zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein that exerts a zzso effect by zzso zzso Strong induction of zzso synthesis has been observed in inflamed zzso of the lungs and zzso zzso of zzso is zzso in the lung zzso cell line zzso by zzso but not by zzso despite an induction of zzso binding to the zzso promoter by both zzso In this study, we present evidence that the zzso specificity is caused by a requirement of the zzso promoter for the zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression in zzso cells following zzso stimulation was dependent on de zzso protein synthesis and was greatly diminished by a small interfering against zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with a zzso expressing zzso made zzso capable of inducing zzso transcription, indicating that zzso induction is the only factor discriminating between zzso and zzso in their ability to induce zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso which is closely related to zzso did not enable zzso to induce zzso zzso A functional zzso site of the zzso promoter was required for zzso to exert its zzso The human beta zzso 2 gene also required zzso for its zzso induction in zzso zzso Our findings indicate that a common regulatory mechanism has evolved to control expression of a subset of zzso proteins expressed in zzso zzso
