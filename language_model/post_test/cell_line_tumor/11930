To determine whether altering the dietary content of zzso zzso and omega-3 zzso zzso fatty acids affects the growth of zzso prostate cancer zzso tumor membrane fatty acid zzso and tumor zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso male severe combined zzso mice were fed zzso zzso zzso fat diets with the fat derived either primarily from zzso fatty acids zzso zzso or with the fat consisting of zzso and zzso fatty acids in a ratio of zzso zzso group), and injected zzso with Los Angeles zzso Cancer 4 zzso zzso zzso volumes and mouse weights were measured weekly, caloric intake was measured 3 days per week, and tumors and serum were harvested at 8 weeks zzso 

zzso growth rates, final tumor volumes, and serum zzso zzso levels were reduced in the zzso group relative to the zzso zzso The zzso group tumors had decreased proliferation zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso In zzso proliferation of zzso cells in medium containing zzso group serum was reduced by zzso relative to zzso cells cultured in medium containing serum from the zzso zzso The zzso fatty acid ratios in serum and tumor zzso were lower in the zzso group relative to the zzso zzso In addition, zzso group tumors had decreased zzso protein and zzso levels, an zzso reduction in zzso levels, and decreased vascular zzso growth factor zzso 

These results provide a sound basis for clinical trials evaluating the effect of dietary zzso fatty acids from fish oil on tumor zzso and membrane fatty acid zzso and serum and tumor zzso of progression in men with prostate zzso
