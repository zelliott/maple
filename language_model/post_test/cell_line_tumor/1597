This study attempts to combine two findings toward developing a rational strategy for improved therapy for zzso One of the findings, made in this zzso study, is that an zzso zzso zzso gene zzso exerts zzso zzso The second observation is that the zzso of a small zzso zzso zzso causes zzso of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso While blocking in zzso tumor growth only slightly, zzso of zzso significantly zzso both the migration and invasion of zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that a simultaneous zzso zzso of zzso might enhance the zzso effects of zzso and that a combination therapy with zzso and the zzso gene would be an effective approach for treating zzso We tested this by developing zzso zzso that zzso zzso under the zzso promoter and employing them in combination with zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso in animal zzso We found that the zzso zzso harboring an zzso expression cassette plus zzso produced prolonged survival benefits compared to administration of zzso or zzso zzso This study demonstrates that combination therapy using the zzso gene together with zzso zzso produces enhanced zzso effects compared to that resulting from zzso gene therapy zzso
