zzso virus zzso causes infectious zzso and is associated with various zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso Like all zzso the zzso life cycle zzso between zzso and zzso zzso During zzso the viral zzso is largely silenced by zzso zzso of zzso motifs and, in the switch to the zzso cycle, this zzso zzso is zzso A key event is the zzso of the viral zzso gene by the zzso protein zzso zzso is a zzso zzso factor that zzso binds to specific response elements zzso in the zzso promoter zzso when these elements are zzso zzso ability to trigger zzso cycle zzso is severely compromised when a zzso zzso in its zzso domain is zzso to zzso zzso but the molecular basis for this effect is zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso is defective for zzso zzso in a zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso is compromised both in zzso and in zzso for binding two zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso although the effect is striking only for zzso zzso modeling of zzso bound to zzso zzso together with zzso data, indicate that zzso directly contacts one of the two zzso zzso within a specific zzso zzso The zzso second zzso zzso (on the complementary DNA zzso is predicted to contact zzso a zzso known to regulate zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso regulates the enhanced interaction of zzso with zzso DNA in overturning the zzso control of viral zzso As zzso is zzso in many zzso zzso the selectivity of zzso for zzso DNA may be a paradigm for a more general zzso
