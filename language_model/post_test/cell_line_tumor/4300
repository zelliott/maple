zzso gastric zzso zzso has the worst prognosis of all gastric zzso zzso to its rapid expansion by invasion and frequent zzso zzso Due to the increased proliferation of zzso zzso zzso that occurs within zzso zzso and the zzso zzso sites, zzso have been proposed to support the progression of this zzso However, the biological and molecular basis and the pathological role of the zzso interaction between zzso cells and zzso remain largely zzso In this study, we investigated the role of zzso in the invasion of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso When zzso cells were zzso with zzso derived from zzso tissue on three-dimensional zzso zzso they were attracted together to form large cellular zzso that invaded within the zzso zzso imaging revealed that this process was associated with extensive contraction and zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso analysis showed that zzso cells stimulate zzso of zzso light chain and zzso mechanical zzso of the zzso by zzso By utilizing this zzso system for inhibitor library zzso we have identified several zzso that zzso suppress the cooperation between zzso cells and zzso to form the invasive zzso Among them, a zzso inhibitor zzso impaired the interaction between zzso cells and zzso both in zzso and in zzso and effectively blocked zzso dissemination of zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso mediate mechanical zzso of the zzso by zzso cells, thereby promoting invasion and zzso dissemination of zzso
