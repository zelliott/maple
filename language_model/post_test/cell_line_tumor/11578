zzso zzso a naturally occurring zzso derived from the root of zzso zzso has showed potent zzso and cancer prevention activity in a variety of zzso However, the clinical translation of zzso has been significantly hampered due to its extensive degradation, zzso zzso and poor zzso To address these clinically relevant issues, we have developed a novel zzso magnetic zzso zzso zzso zzso we have evaluated the in zzso and in zzso therapeutic efficacy of this novel zzso zzso in pancreatic zzso Human pancreatic cancer cells zzso and zzso exhibited efficient zzso of the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso As a result, the zzso zzso effectively inhibited growth of zzso and zzso cells in cell proliferation and colony formation zzso The zzso zzso suppressed pancreatic tumor growth in an zzso zzso mouse model and improved the survival of mice by delaying tumor zzso The zzso effect of zzso zzso correlated with the suppression of zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso large zzso induced zzso leukemia cell differentiation protein zzso cell zzso zzso 1 zzso collagen I, and enhanced membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso did not show any sign of zzso and was stable after incubation with human serum zzso In addition, the zzso zzso improved serum zzso of zzso in mice up to zzso as compared with free zzso zzso studies show that a significant amount of zzso zzso was able to reach the pancreatic zzso zzso which suggests its clinical zzso zzso In conclusion, this study suggests that our novel zzso zzso can be valuable for the treatment of pancreatic zzso
