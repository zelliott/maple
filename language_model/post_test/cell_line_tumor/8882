The inflammatory tissue zzso can be an active promoter in zzso cancer zzso zzso steroid hormone metabolism as induced by the inflammatory zzso may contribute to zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso is the most abundant zzso steroid hormone present in human serum and can be zzso to zzso zzso and/or zzso in peripheral zzso We have previously reported that zzso zzso prostate zzso cells increase zzso metabolism to active zzso and alter prostate cancer cell gene zzso While much of the focus on mechanisms of prostate cancer and steroid metabolism is in the zzso cancer cells, this study focuses on zzso effects on zzso zzso pathways and zzso in human prostate zzso zzso In zzso primary prostate zzso cells, zzso produced zzso and zzso increases in metabolism of zzso to zzso and zzso Also zzso prostate zzso cells exhibited changes in the gene expression of zzso involved in steroid metabolism including zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso These studies suggest that zzso prostate zzso and the inflammatory zzso may contribute to altered steroid metabolism and increased zzso zzso
