The objective of this project was to determine the mechanisms in which zzso enhances zzso tumor zzso effects in head and neck zzso 

In advanced head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso the zzso survival rate is less than zzso Because patients with advanced zzso have a high rate of zzso failure zzso with existing treatment zzso aggressive local therapy approaches need to be zzso Previous data show that zzso or zzso alone have significant zzso activity in zzso Before testing whether a combination approach zzso and zzso could be developed in clinical trials, zzso experiments were zzso 

The zzso gene was zzso in 2 head and neck zzso zzso zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso enhancement of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso induction of zzso zzso V zzso were zzso The zzso of regulators in the cell cycle, zzso and signal zzso pathways were measured using Western zzso 

zzso increased zzso zzso which was dependent on the dose of zzso and levels of zzso The enhanced viral zzso was due in part to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso enhanced zzso zzso through increased expression of zzso zzso Together, the combination of zzso and zzso altered expression of key regulators in the cell cycle, zzso and signal zzso pathways with an increase in the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso at position at zzso zzso A and B1 expression were down regulated by zzso and zzso When comparing the zzso to sensitive cell lines, the altered expression of zzso and zzso by zzso and zzso were dissimilar between these cell zzso 

zzso enhanced zzso zzso and increased expression of zzso zzso gene transfer, zzso and zzso zzso These results support a clinical combination of zzso with zzso gene therapy in patients with head and neck zzso
