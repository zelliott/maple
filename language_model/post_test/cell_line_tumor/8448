Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer related death worldwide and the prognosis is still poor with zzso survival of approximately zzso zzso is the leading cause of death by zzso Recent researches have demonstrated that zzso transition zzso plays a key role in the early process of zzso of cancer zzso Here, we identified that zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is a novel transforming growth zzso zzso target gene that regulates lung cancer cell zzso zzso has been reported as a major zzso of zzso We observed that the expression of zzso in lung cancer tumor zzso is significantly higher than matched normal lung zzso Moreover, the expression of zzso was also significantly higher in zzso tumor zzso than zzso tumor zzso zzso of zzso zzso were increased among patients with shorter zzso survival times, indicating the potential role of zzso in lung cancer progression and zzso zzso zzso expression with zzso small interfering zzso zzso in lung cells zzso lung cancer cell growth, colony formation and invasion in zzso Interestingly, zzso expression of zzso in zzso lung cancer cells induced zzso with increased expression of the zzso marker zzso and decreased expression of zzso marker zzso We also found that the expression of zzso was increased under treatment of zzso indicating that zzso is a novel downstream target of zzso Taken together, our study showed that zzso is a novel zzso related zzso in lung cancer and may be new diagnostic and therapeutic target for lung zzso
