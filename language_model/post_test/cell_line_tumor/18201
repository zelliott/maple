Although the zzso ring is found in a wide variety of biologically active compounds and is frequently condensed with various zzso synthesis and biological evaluation of the zzso skeleton attracts only very limited zzso We report zzso the synthesis and zzso evaluation of certain zzso derivatives against the growth of six cancer cell lines including human cervical zzso zzso zzso oral zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso human stomach zzso zzso prostate cancer zzso and zzso cell lung cancer zzso The results indicated that zzso zzso is more active than its zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso afforded its zzso zzso 20 which is more active than the zzso precursor zzso More potent agents were obtained by further zzso of zzso Thus, zzso activities decreased in an order of zzso zzso zzso 21, zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso were resistant to zzso with zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso respectively, while zzso values for zzso were in the range of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Among them, zzso was the most potent with zzso values of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso against the growth of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells, zzso zzso analysis indicated zzso can induce cell cycle arrest in S phase, and DNA zzso zzso followed by zzso
