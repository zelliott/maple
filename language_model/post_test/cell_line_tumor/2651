The E6 and zzso genes of human zzso type 16 zzso zzso zzso that bind and degrade zzso and zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso We examined the effects of zzso E6 and zzso zzso expression on the transformed zzso of zzso zzso cancer cell zzso 

Human zzso zzso cell cancer zzso and zzso zzso integrated zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells were infected with zzso that expressed a short hairpin zzso zzso targeting the zzso E6 and zzso genes or a zzso control zzso zzso zzso terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso V were used to assess zzso in zzso cell zzso zzso analysis involved quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction analysis of zzso and zzso gene expression and zzso for zzso and zzso protein zzso 

In zzso and zzso cells, zzso zzso of zzso E6 and zzso expression reduced the E6 and zzso zzso levels by more than zzso compared with control cells that expressed a zzso zzso E6 and zzso repression resulted in restoration of zzso and zzso protein zzso increased expression of zzso genes zzso and zzso decreased expression of genes whose expression is increased in the absence of functional zzso zzso and zzso and induced substantial zzso in zzso and zzso cells compared with the control zzso cells (from zzso in zzso to zzso in infected zzso cells and from zzso in zzso to zzso in infected zzso zzso 

zzso of E6 and zzso zzso results in restoration of zzso and zzso zzso pathways and induced zzso in zzso zzso zzso cell cancer cell zzso
