zzso zzso is the most lethal and aggressive zzso among primary brain tumors in zzso However, most zzso cells have been reported to be resistant to tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we have shown that zzso zzso a clinically approved cardiac zzso for heart failure, can induce zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso doses (20 zzso can increase zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso Treatment with zzso led to zzso and a robust reduction in the levels of the zzso protein zzso by inducing its zzso degradation; however, it did not affect the levels of many other zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso with small interfering zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso the functional role of zzso depletion in the zzso actions of zzso We demonstrate that zzso of zzso and death zzso 5 expression by zzso is sufficient to restore TRAIL sensitivity in resistant zzso zzso Our results suggest that combining zzso with TRAIL treatments may be useful in the treatment of zzso zzso zzso
