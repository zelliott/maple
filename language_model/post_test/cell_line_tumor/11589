zzso zzso zzso one of the most prominent modes of action of zzso zzso suffers from important limitations due to the need for optimal interactions with zzso zzso In this work, we report the design of a new zzso zzso format, compact and zzso based on the use of zzso zzso zzso that are capable of zzso most of these zzso This zzso zzso format was created by fusing zzso zzso directed against the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso to human zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso acting as a natural zzso zzso In zzso and in zzso characterization of these zzso zzso molecules revealed favorable features for further development as a therapeutic zzso They are easy to produce in zzso coli, very stable, and elicit potent zzso of tumor cells by human natural killer cells at zzso zzso Unlike conventional zzso they do not engage zzso zzso zzso do not compete with serum zzso G for zzso zzso and their zzso activity is independent of zzso zzso and zzso zzso As opposed to zzso zzso zzso zzso they do not engage regulatory T cells as these latter cells do not express zzso Studies in zzso zzso combined zzso gamma mice zzso with zzso zzso tumor cells showed that zzso zzso molecules in the presence of human peripheral blood zzso cells significantly slow down tumor zzso This new zzso zzso zzso zzso format offers a promising approach for zzso zzso zzso
