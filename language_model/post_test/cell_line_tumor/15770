zzso zzso display has been exploited for the purpose of discovering new cancer specific targeting zzso However, this approach has resulted in only a small number of tumor targeting peptides useful as in zzso imaging zzso We zzso that in zzso screening for tumor zzso of zzso zzso zzso particles displaying multiple copies of an in zzso selected tumor targeting zzso will zzso the development of zzso based imaging zzso In this study, both in zzso selection and in zzso screening of zzso displaying foreign peptides were zzso to best predict peptides with the zzso properties necessary for translation into zzso in zzso imaging zzso An in zzso selection of zzso display libraries was performed in zzso mice bearing human zzso prostate zzso zzso Eight randomly selected zzso clones and four control zzso clones were zzso labeled with zzso zzso for subsequent in zzso screening and zzso The corresponding peptides of six of these zzso clones were tested as zzso zzso zzso for single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging of zzso prostate zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were successful as in zzso imaging zzso The affinities of zzso and zzso peptides for cultured zzso cells were then analyzed via cell flow zzso resulting in zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The peptides bound zzso to prostate tumor cell lines compared to that of other zzso and normal cell lines, and zzso appeared to possess zzso zzso This study demonstrates the value of in zzso screening of zzso labeled zzso for the prediction of the efficacy of the corresponding zzso synthetic zzso as an in zzso zzso tumor imaging zzso
