Although zzso clinical trials showed no benefit from combining zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with standard chemotherapy for advanced zzso lung cancer zzso better results might be obtained by combining zzso with individual agents that are zzso for the zzso zzso binding cassette zzso zzso because zzso can inhibit their zzso The combination effects deserved to be further examined in zzso 

The combination effects of zzso with three zzso agents zzso zzso zzso or zzso or with zzso were tested in 17 zzso cell lines using the zzso zzso zzso and classical zzso zzso The effects of drug combinations, identified by the values of mean combination index zzso were correlated with the expression levels of zzso zzso zzso were analyzed to further evaluate the possible mechanisms of drug zzso 

zzso zzso interactions were observed in the tested cell zzso The zzso was more robust in the four lines zzso de zzso or acquired zzso zzso individual zzso range, zzso all p values were zzso zzso or in 12 cell lines exhibiting no zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso All p values were zzso zzso The zzso could be observed in cells expressing nearly zzso zzso and other zzso tested in this zzso The combination of zzso was additive zzso zzso zzso 

Combined zzso showed zzso in zzso cells harboring no zzso zzso zzso zzso could enhance zzso effects through mechanisms not restricted to zzso zzso
