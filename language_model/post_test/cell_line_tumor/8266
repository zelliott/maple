To identify zzso genes that may play a role in the zzso of zzso human zzso cell zzso zzso a cohort of zzso from smokers (29 SCC of the head and neck, 3 SCC of the esophagus and 46 SCC of the zzso were zzso analyzed for gene expression using zzso zzso zzso zzso and for zzso variation using zzso Human zzso 100 K zzso Gene expression profiling clearly separated benign zzso zzso zzso from SCC and identified several candidate genes relevant to the biology of zzso The zzso zzso array data adapted for copy number analysis identified two discrete areas of high-level zzso amplification, including zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso When gene expression measures were correlated with amplification status at zzso zzso zzso zzso in relation to benign tissue was dependent on amplification and occurred in only zzso of zzso However, an adjacent gene zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso showed strong zzso in the majority zzso of zzso regardless of gene amplification zzso This finding was zzso with quantitative real-time zzso zzso and protein zzso Interestingly, small interfering zzso zzso of zzso gene products in a SCC cell line zzso resulted in increased cell zzso The results of these studies identify zzso as a protein relevant to the biology of zzso
