The physical and biological properties have been determined for three zzso complexes with trans zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The crystal structures of zzso and zzso reveal substantial strain resulting from zzso between the zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso All three complexes have reduction zzso in the range zzso to zzso zzso values usually associated with high resistance to reduction and low zzso However, the complexes all demonstrate surprisingly high zzso with values and trends that closely follow those seen for the zzso zzso of these zzso These results are consistent with more rapid reduction of the zzso complexes than would be expected based on the reduction zzso perhaps associated with the trans arrangement of the zzso zzso
