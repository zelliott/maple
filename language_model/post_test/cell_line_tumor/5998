The zzso of zzso in the zzso compartments during zzso therapy zzso plays a major role in the cell zzso therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso and normal zzso Our study involves the characterization of the structural zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and how zzso zzso affects the selective toxicity of zzso towards tumor zzso Using zzso laser scanning zzso zzso and fluorescent zzso zzso we examined the zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso colon zzso zzso and normal zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrated that after zzso of zzso the distribution of zzso was localized mainly in the zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso apparatus, around the nuclear envelope and also in the nucleus but not in the zzso zzso whereas in zzso cells, zzso was found to be localized minimally only in the nucleus not in other zzso zzso The relationship between zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso was zzso zzso cell death was judged by the formation of known zzso hallmarks including, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso for zzso and the formation of zzso zzso At the zzso dose of 1 zzso the percentage of zzso cells was zzso zzso This study provided substantial evidence that zzso zzso localized in the zzso zzso in the following order: nucleus, zzso zzso and the zzso apparatus and subsequent zzso of the zzso and zzso played an important role in zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results based on the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso extensively enhance the efficacy of zzso with appropriate zzso and light dose and support the idea that zzso can contribute to elimination of zzso cells by inducing zzso which is of zzso zzso
