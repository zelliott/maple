Human zzso peptides zzso small molecular zzso zzso are expressed within tumors and associated with tumor necrosis and zzso of zzso Recent investigations have suggested that zzso are likely to be involved in the host immune responses to zzso 

We used zzso zzso which expresses a zzso form of zzso to obtain expression of zzso in the tumor milieu in zzso mice to explore the possible roles of zzso in tumor zzso The zzso effects were investigated in established zzso colon cancer and zzso breast cancer zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso effects on immature zzso cells were detected both in zzso and in zzso zzso expression of zzso resulted in not only significant tumor growth zzso but also increased zzso zzso within zzso zzso transfer of zzso and a zzso release zzso revealed specific cellular immune zzso Furthermore, increased zzso were also found in zzso from zzso mice supporting specific zzso immune zzso Increased zzso and decreased zzso were also shown in treated zzso 

These findings indicate that zzso can exert multiple zzso effects through different zzso more importantly, zzso mediates host immune responses to tumors in zzso through the recruitment and subsequent zzso of immature zzso cells and thus shows promising potential in cancer zzso
