To identify gene expression profiles specific to zzso of human zzso 

Global gene expression profiles of a total of 15 tumor and normal zzso cell lines were analyzed using DNA zzso and statistical zzso zzso Initially, six of the cell lines were zzso into zzso zzso or zzso zzso groups according to the radiation dose required to reduce their survival to zzso zzso Genes for which expression was specific to each group at 1 or 3 h after zzso were identified using statistical procedures including analysis of zzso and a two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso The remaining nine cell lines were subjected to the zzso neighbor pattern zzso 

The nine test cell lines were successfully classified by their zzso value using 46 and 44 genes for which zzso levels had significantly changed at 1 and 3 h after zzso zzso Of these zzso 25 showed altered expression at both time points in the zzso or zzso but independently were unable to zzso the test cell zzso 

zzso cell lines analyzed in this study showed certain zzso changes in gene expression profiles that are different from the profile changes of the zzso cell zzso
