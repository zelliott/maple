zzso zzso is the major component extracted from the Chinese herb zzso zzso numbers of studies have indicated that zzso zzso zzso has zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the actions of zzso have not been fully zzso In this study, using real-time zzso and western zzso techniques, we demonstrate that zzso significantly zzso the expression of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso with a role for zzso in cancer development, zzso zzso the migration, proliferation and colony formation of zzso zzso cells in zzso more effectively than the zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso does not affect the cell cycle when the cells are grown to zzso zzso but zzso zzso arrest at zzso zzso as indicated by a significant reduction in the zzso and zzso zzso These findings were also confirmed in zzso zzso were implanted with zzso zzso cells and treated with 100 zzso zzso for 20 zzso Our data show that zzso growth was significantly inhibited in rats treated with zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso growth in control rats zzso zzso zzso in the implants was zzso in the zzso rats than that in the control rats, as measured by zzso zzso zzso with the in zzso results, zzso significantly zzso the expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso compared with the zzso This study provides new insights into the mechanisms of the zzso zzso zzso
