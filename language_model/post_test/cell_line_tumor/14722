The expression of tumor associated zzso zzso in zzso cell lines allowed us to design an in zzso model for the generation of zzso zzso Since the zzso of these peptides represents the major obstacle to clinical applications, we studied a second method for the generation of zzso starting from zzso cell line zzso and zzso of zzso compatible healthy zzso zzso zzso showed high and homogeneous zzso response against each zzso high levels of zzso were released by zzso cell line zzso zzso in response to the zzso cell line they were activated zzso The zzso dependent zzso cell line zzso zzso activity was proved by the indifference against the zzso zzso cell line zzso and by the absence of zzso production with the addition of zzso I blocking zzso These two methods may be considered the model for the zzso setting in the context of zzso approaches for zzso zzso
