zzso zzso play an essential role in the generation of the cerebral zzso through their function as zzso precursors and as zzso migration zzso A molecular marker for zzso zzso in the developing central nervous system is the brain zzso protein zzso To generate mouse models for the zzso and study of zzso zzso we expressed zzso zzso or zzso in transgenic mice under the control of the zzso zzso In these transgenic lines, fluorescent protein expression is restricted to zzso zzso in the embryonic zzso and to zzso in the adult zzso zzso of the zzso into embryonic zzso also resulted in zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso promoter driven transgenic mice and zzso brain slices expressing different fluorescent markers in a zzso zzso manner will be useful tools to further study the differentiation and function of zzso zzso in distinct regions of the developing zzso
