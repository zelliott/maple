The role of zzso growth factor zzso in zzso zzso is zzso The effects of zzso on growth, zzso and zzso from zzso tumors are not zzso To this end, we zzso zzso three human cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with human zzso full-length zzso zzso of zzso did not affect tumor cell proliferation or migration in zzso The growth of zzso tumors grown zzso or zzso was impaired in all three tumor zzso This decrease in tumor growth correlated with a decrease in tumor zzso The zzso tumors had decreased vessel density and increased vessel diameter, but vessel zzso was not different from the parental zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited higher levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso but decreased levels of zzso zzso Our study shows that zzso zzso decreases zzso zzso formation and zzso tumor zzso
