There is evidence showing that high zzso zzso can be more effective than low zzso zzso for adoptive tumor zzso Because many T zzso tumor zzso are zzso zzso tolerance mechanisms are likely to render high zzso T cells unresponsive or cause T cell elimination by zzso zzso We recently used the zzso strategy to circumvent zzso tolerance to a zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso and raised high zzso zzso in humans and in zzso In this study, we investigated whether high zzso zzso zzso can mediate tumor protection without causing damage to normal zzso in zzso Although the zzso prolonged survival of zzso mice without causing damage to normal zzso tumor protection was zzso We show that tumor growth occurred despite the continued presence of zzso zzso and the continued zzso of tumor cells to zzso zzso However, analysis of the zzso revealed that they had been rendered unresponsive in zzso because they did not produce zzso gamma in response to zzso zzso These experiments suggest that induction of zzso may be an important mechanism limiting the efficacy of adoptive zzso zzso
