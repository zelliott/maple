zzso display was used to select novel peptides that specifically bind the zzso zzso and with properties suitable for imaging zzso positive zzso 

After three rounds of selection against zzso and using two different zzso conditions including a long zzso the consensus sequences zzso and zzso were expressed on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cell sorting analysis and zzso zzso provided evidence that both zzso specifically bound zzso in zzso Both peptides are stable in zzso zzso By a cell binding competition zzso the zzso for zzso was measured as zzso zzso and therefore zzso higher affinity than zzso at zzso zzso The zzso in mice carrying zzso tumors in one thigh were similar for both zzso at 30 zzso but at 90 zzso the zzso zzso accumulated almost three times higher in the zzso The zzso images were consistent with the zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso library and two different zzso conditions were used to identify two new higher affinity binding peptides for the zzso zzso One, was a single brief zzso with pH zzso zzso zzso and the second began with the zzso zzso but was followed with a longer zzso with zzso zzso saline zzso at pH zzso The zzso that bound zzso were evaluated by zzso cell sorting analysis using zzso positive zzso cells and confirmed by zzso zzso The consensus peptides displayed on the selected zzso were zzso and zzso with zzso for zzso with zzso The zzso for zzso binding was evaluated by cell binding competition in zzso while binding affinity was evaluated in zzso by zzso and zzso imaging in a tumor mouse zzso 

We have identified a zzso with a zzso zzso zzso constant for the zzso zzso that may have application in cancer zzso
