We have used the molecular zzso techniques of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and comparative zzso zzso zzso to analyze two established lung cancer cell lines zzso zzso 80 primary lung zzso samples and 80 zzso cell lung zzso samples in order to identify common zzso zzso zzso revealed numerous complex zzso zzso zzso 5, 6, 11, 12, and 17 were most frequently involved in zzso zzso zzso revealed regions on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to be commonly zzso and regions on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to be zzso In lung zzso the most common gains were found in zzso zzso while in zzso cell lung zzso the common gains were found in zzso zzso and these zzso were observed to be associated with their specific pathological zzso In conclusion, the present study contributes to the molecular biological characterization in lung zzso and zzso cell lung zzso and through evaluation of molecular events to the recently emergent focus on novel markers for lung cancer zzso
