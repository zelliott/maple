High zzso expression in classical Hodgkin's zzso and zzso large cell zzso zzso suggests an important zzso role of this zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, we investigated zzso signaling in Hodgkin's and zzso cell lines by different zzso 1) zzso zzso 2) zzso zzso and 3) a combination of zzso The effects were determined at the zzso zzso and real-time quantitative zzso protein zzso mobility shift analysis, zzso and flow zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso We demonstrate that Hodgkin's cells are virtually zzso zzso Neither zzso stimulation nor zzso zzso of Hodgkin's cells had any significant zzso In contrast, zzso stimulation of zzso cells activated nuclear zzso zzso zzso induced major zzso changes, and decreased zzso These effects could be zzso by zzso of zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells, zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso induced pronounced zzso zzso and massive zzso Our data indicate that 1) zzso signaling is not effective in Hodgkin's cell lines but is effective in zzso cell lines, 2) zzso is probably not significantly involved in the zzso of classical Hodgkin's lymphoma, and 3) zzso stimulation triggers two competing effects in zzso cells, namely zzso of zzso and zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso therapy in zzso should be combined with zzso zzso to induce effective cell zzso
