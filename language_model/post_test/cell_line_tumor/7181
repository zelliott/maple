Great attention has been recently given to a zzso of the zzso class, zzso zzso which is widely spread throughout the plant kingdom, and is present in both fruits and vegetables of human zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of zzso on proliferation and differentiation of human melanoma zzso Both zzso and functional parameters were zzso using electron and zzso zzso zzso analysis, zzso zzso Western zzso analysis, and zzso zzso as zzso A treatment with a single dose of zzso decreased cell proliferation without affecting cell viability and without inducing zzso or zzso The zzso index and cell percentage in S phase were significantly lower in zzso treated cells compared with zzso zzso zzso treatment zzso in a zzso and zzso manner, melanoma cell differentiation characterized by a strong increase in zzso outgrowth accompanied with a zzso of the zzso network, a dramatic increase of focal zzso and an increased expression of zzso zzso zzso components such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment also induced increase of zzso levels and zzso of zzso expression and activity resulting in an enhanced zzso synthesis and zzso zzso zzso of the melanoma differentiation zzso zzso in treated cells respect to the zzso control was also zzso Data obtained provide evidence that a single treatment with zzso is able to zzso the human melanoma cells from the zzso to the differentiated zzso We conclude that zzso is a very promising zzso to include in the strategies for treatment of zzso also because of its nutritional zzso
