Human and zzso zzso receptors exhibit differences in their sensitivity to zzso In this study we have cloned and characterized the dog zzso zzso to determine if its zzso sensitivity more closely resembles the human or zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso the dog zzso zzso was isolated from a dog heart zzso library, expressed in zzso zzso cells using the zzso viral expression system and characterized in zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso Native zzso receptors were examined by measuring zzso zzso release in dog and human whole zzso 

The dog zzso zzso was zzso zzso acids long and exhibited high zzso zzso to the human and zzso zzso although it contained an additional zzso at position zzso and an zzso acid deletion at position zzso zzso possessed low zzso potency at dog zzso zzso zzso zzso had slightly higher potency but was a partial zzso Dog zzso receptors possessed relatively high affinity for a number of selective zzso of the human zzso zzso although there were some differences in potency between the zzso zzso affinities in human and dog blood exhibited a similar rank order of potency as observed in studies on the zzso zzso although absolute potency was considerably zzso 

Dog zzso and native zzso receptors display a number of pharmacological similarities to the human zzso zzso Thus, dog may be a suitable species for assessing zzso toxicity of zzso intended for evaluation in the zzso
