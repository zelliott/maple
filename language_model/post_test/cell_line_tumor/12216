A number of groups have developed libraries of zzso to identify genes through functional zzso While these studies have validated the approach of making functional zzso libraries to understand fundamental cellular mechanisms, they require information and knowledge of existing sequences since the zzso sequences are generated zzso An alternative strategy would be to create an zzso library from zzso Unfortunately, the complexity of such a library of zzso would make screening zzso To reduce the complexity, longer zzso could be zzso however, concerns of induction of the zzso response and zzso effects of long zzso have prevented their zzso As a first step in creating such libraries, long zzso was expressed in zzso zzso The 250 zzso zzso were capable of efficiently zzso a zzso reporter gene that was zzso zzso in zzso cells without inducing the zzso response or zzso effects any more than reported for zzso In addition, a long zzso expressed in the same cell line was capable of zzso zzso zzso expression and inhibited cell migration, whereas the zzso against zzso had no effect on zzso or cell zzso The studies suggest that large zzso libraries are feasible and that functional selection of genes will be zzso
