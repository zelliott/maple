While zzso organ donors represent the majority of the organ donor pool, it appears that graft survival is adversely affected by brain death zzso Brain death has been shown to cause severe disturbances in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso which could in part be responsible for the inferior outcome of zzso originating from zzso donors compared to living zzso zzso effects of brain death lead to a wide fluctuation in mean zzso pressures, blood flow to the zzso and systemic oxygen consumption, altering regional zzso In addition, a wide array of zzso changes has been shown to occur after brain death contributing to organ injury and zzso zzso Recent studies have shown that brain death zzso multiple zzso and zzso zzso and the injured brain itself may be the source of zzso factors such as zzso This increased inflammatory response seen during and immediately after brain death has also been associated with poor zzso zzso Furthermore, there is evidence to suggest that the massive inflammatory response seen in zzso donors could also lead to increased zzso and accelerated zzso rejection after zzso zzso we zzso that zzso zzso of this inflammatory response by zzso could potentially lead to improved donor organ and zzso zzso As a zzso of zzso we tested the ability of a novel zzso to remove zzso in zzso using two human zzso cell zzso Our results indicate a zzso reduction in zzso after 2 h of circulation with the zzso
