In our previous paper, zzso appended zzso zzso 1 was used as a scaffold to display artificial receptors on a cell surface zzso zzso et zzso zzso 2009, 10, zzso This zzso can be retained on the cell surface for more than 30 zzso before being slowly zzso into the zzso In this study, our aim is to achieve the efficient zzso of quantum dots zzso into target cells via artificial receptors on the zzso As a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were introduced into the zzso and zzso binding zzso zzso were used as a zzso We found that zzso zzso could be zzso effectively into cells via zzso zzso whereas zzso were not zzso into zzso zzso These data suggest that our method based on zzso engineering using zzso zzso a new approach to the delivery of various poorly permeable zzso into zzso
