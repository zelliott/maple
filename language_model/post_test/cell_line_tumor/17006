To identify potential cancer related zzso in breast cancer cells, we enriched zzso zzso by lentil zzso from the human breast cancer cell line zzso and the normal breast cell line zzso for zzso zzso zzso were separated and compared by two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso were identified that expressed remarkably differently, among which nine were involved in the progress of collagen zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso II zzso expression and influence in breast cancer was further zzso zzso revealed that zzso was zzso in breast tumor cells compared with its adjacent normal zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso interference of zzso showed that zzso expression suppressed cell proliferation and migration in zzso in zzso
