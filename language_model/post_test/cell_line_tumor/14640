zzso data accumulated in last few years have shown that differential expression of candidate zzso in normal versus transformed cell provides important insights into the zzso of cancer including zzso In our previous report, we have revealed that zzso was significantly zzso in both zzso cells as well as zzso ALL zzso zzso zzso patients as compared to their respective zzso We have zzso proven that zzso restoration in zzso cells leads to significant zzso of zzso and its zzso zzso zzso human zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and qualifies for tumor zzso function in zzso zzso Keeping in view these results, the present study was aimed at zzso the role of zzso and other zzso present zzso the zzso regions involved in genetic zzso characteristic of ALL in zzso ALL cell lines and patient zzso We have demonstrated significant zzso in the expression of zzso in zzso and zzso ALL patients with respect to the respective control zzso zzso experiments revealed that none of the six identified zzso were able to knock down the expression of zzso zzso Interestingly, it was found that zzso loses its ability to zzso zzso gene expression in zzso ALL as a consequence of zzso in target zzso region zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the present study revealed that zzso becomes zzso in zzso ALL as a consequence of zzso in zzso of zzso gene in zzso ALL cellular zzso
