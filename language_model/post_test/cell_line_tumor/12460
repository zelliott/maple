zzso growth factor binding protein 2 zzso has been implicated in the zzso of zzso The zzso zzso has recently been shown to be a zzso regulator of zzso at the protein level in zzso breast cancer zzso However, there are gaps in knowledge with respect to the molecular mechanisms that zzso this zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso regulates zzso protein levels by modulating zzso zzso abundance in zzso zzso This change is achieved by regulating zzso through a critical region present in the first zzso upstream of the zzso initiation site where zzso zzso factor binds and drives zzso IGF-1 treatment leads to increased nuclear abundance of zzso and increased zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso and zzso induce a decline in zzso nuclear abundance and zzso zzso and protein zzso This work provides a zzso explanation for the observed effects of the zzso zzso on zzso levels in zzso zzso
