Although zzso zzso has been demonstrated in zzso cells, the cellular signaling zzso by which zzso zzso elicits a zzso zzso role remains to be zzso In this study, we showed that zzso zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso manner, which relates to the zzso of the S phase of the cell zzso zzso we have shown for the first time that zzso cells retain a considerably high content of zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso protein before zzso exposure, assuming that this status enables the cells to respond to zzso more readily as well as more zzso zzso treatment resulted in the zzso of zzso and induced zzso zzso zzso zzso (but not zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso While zzso zzso and zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso the zzso zzso and zzso known zzso zzso failed to inhibit zzso However, zzso alone significantly increased zzso protein expression but not its activity, suggesting that zzso more likely works as an zzso zzso in zzso cells after zzso rather than a direct inhibitor of zzso zzso In conclusion, it is suggested that the abundance of zzso zzso level is an indispensable condition for an efficient cellular signaling of zzso and that control of zzso activity in zzso cells might be important to cell fate resulting from zzso zzso after zzso
