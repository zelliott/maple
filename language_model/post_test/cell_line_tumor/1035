To construct an expression zzso for soluble zzso human stem cell factor zzso zzso and zzso culture conditions for high-level expression of zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso was amplified by zzso with total zzso from human zzso zzso as a template, followed by cloning into zzso zzso The zzso terminal of the zzso zzso was modified by degenerative zzso to obtain high-level expression in zzso The biological activity of the zzso zzso zzso with high performance zzso interaction zzso was examined by zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was amplified and zzso and was inserted into an zzso expression zzso zzso The expressed zzso accounted for about zzso of total bacterial proteins and reached zzso of total bacterial proteins under optimal culture zzso The expressed zzso appeared in bacterial zzso in the form inclusion zzso The zzso with biological activity was obtained after zzso of the inclusion body with 8 zzso zzso or 7 zzso zzso zzso followed by preliminary zzso and zzso 

zzso was cloned and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso strain expressing zzso can be used to produce zzso with biological activity on large-scale zzso
