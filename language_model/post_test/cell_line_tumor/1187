DNA zzso 1 zzso zzso the zzso zzso of DNA and is responsible for maintaining the DNA zzso pattern during cell zzso A long list of data supports a role for zzso in cellular transformation and zzso of zzso were shown to have zzso zzso It was long believed that zzso promoted zzso by maintaining the zzso and silenced state of tumor zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso knock down by either zzso zzso directed at zzso or expressed zzso activates a number of genes involved in stress response and cell cycle arrest by a DNA zzso zzso In this report we demonstrate that zzso knock down of zzso in human lung zzso zzso and zzso kidney zzso cells zzso gene expression by a mechanism that does not involve either of the known zzso mechanisms, DNA zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso of the cell cycle inhibitor zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso is independent of the mechanism of zzso of the same genes by zzso zzso zzso We determine whether zzso knock down activates one of the zzso zzso zzso pathways in the cell and demonstrate that zzso activates zzso response zzso This zzso of zzso response does not involve an increase in either zzso or zzso protein levels in the cell or the occupancy of the zzso elements with these zzso The zzso regulation of zzso elements by zzso zzso a novel function for zzso in gene zzso DNA zzso was believed to be a mechanism for suppression of zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest a fundamentally different and surprising role for zzso regulation of zzso genes by a mechanism independent of DNA zzso and zzso zzso The implications of our data on the biological roles of zzso and the therapeutic potential of zzso zzso as zzso agents are zzso
