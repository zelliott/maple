The zzso gene promotes invasion and zzso in breast cancer cells, which have undergone zzso transition zzso zzso of zzso in cells that do not show zzso increases their invasion potential as a result of increased zzso levels, which specifically suppress the zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso results from zzso of zzso leading to the release of zzso of nuclear factor zzso by zzso We further show that zzso expression is regulated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in breast cancer cells leads to reduced zzso levels and increased zzso and zzso levels, resulting in loss of invasion zzso The central regulation of this interactive zzso by zzso accounts for the increased invasion associated with increased zzso expression seen in aggressive breast cancer zzso zzso therefore, is a potential target to suppress invasion and zzso in breast cancer zzso
