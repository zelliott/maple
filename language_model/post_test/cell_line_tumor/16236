The effects of low doses of zzso radiation on cellular development in the nervous system are presently zzso The focus of the present study was to examine zzso zzso effects on the differentiation of zzso cells and on the development of neural stem cells to zzso zzso Human zzso zzso cells were exposed to zzso zzso rays at different stages of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso formation was determined 6 days after zzso When zzso cells were exposed to zzso zzso rays at the onset of zzso the number of zzso formed per cell was significantly less after exposure to either 10, 30 or 100 zzso compared to control zzso Exposure to 10 and 30 zzso attenuated differentiation of immature zzso zzso neural stem cells to zzso cells, as verified by the diminished expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso cells by zzso after 30 zzso zzso showed that proteins involved in zzso development were zzso zzso involved in cell cycle and proliferation were altered in both cell lines after exposure to 30 zzso however, the rate of cell proliferation was not affected in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso of differentiation and the persistent changes in protein expression is indicative of an zzso rather than a zzso zzso
