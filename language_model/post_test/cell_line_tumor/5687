A major obstacle to the successful management of pancreatic cancer is to acquire resistance to the existing zzso zzso Resistance to zzso the standard zzso zzso agent for advanced and zzso pancreatic cancer, is mainly attributed to an altered zzso threshold in the pancreatic zzso The zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso in the pancreatic cancer and recently, has been shown to increase pancreatic zzso cell growth by the zzso of zzso 

Effect of zzso on pancreatic cancer cells resistance to zzso was studied in zzso and zzso down pancreatic cancer cell lines after treatment with zzso by zzso zzso DNA fragmentation zzso assessment of zzso zzso c release, zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and DNA fragmentation experiment demonstrated that zzso protects zzso pancreatic cancer cells from zzso zzso In concert with these results, zzso also attenuated zzso zzso c release and the zzso of zzso Further, our results showed that zzso exerts zzso function through zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso protein zzso 

Our results zzso the function of zzso in zzso resistance to pancreatic cancer cells against zzso through the zzso of zzso pathways and, zzso promoting cell zzso
