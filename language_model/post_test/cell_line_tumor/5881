This study is to find out the induction by sodium zzso of zzso transition zzso in human zzso zzso cells, zzso After treatment of zzso with zzso - 25 zzso sodium zzso for 48 zzso the zzso used include zzso zzso zzso zzso for evaluation of zzso zzso and zzso level in the zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and scratch wound healing as well as zzso migration zzso for measurement of migration and zzso zzso Additionally, the hallmarks of zzso zzso and its downstream signaling molecules were examined by Western zzso The results showed that zzso zzso by zzso elevated significantly in a zzso fashion, whereas the increased zzso and zzso did not show zzso zzso The zzso was induced by exposure of zzso with zzso zzso of sodium zzso which was characterized by increased level of zzso decreased zzso and elevated activity of migration and zzso zzso The results suggest that sodium zzso could induce zzso zzso by increased zzso of zzso and zzso
