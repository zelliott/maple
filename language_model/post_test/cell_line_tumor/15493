Two zzso of zzso zzso C zzso zzso are generated by alternative zzso zzso and zzso Both zzso are present within the nucleus, but in contrast to zzso the vast majority of zzso is zzso In mouse zzso leukemia cells, zzso is involved in the regulation of cell division and the balance between cell proliferation and zzso It has been demonstrated that nuclear zzso is crucial for the zzso function of zzso although the mechanism by which this nuclear import occurs has never been fully zzso The aim of this study was to characterize both the mechanism of nuclear zzso and the molecular function of nuclear zzso by identifying its zzso in zzso zzso isolated zzso utilizing a procedure that coupled zzso zzso with tandem mass zzso zzso Using this zzso 160 proteins were demonstrated to be in association with zzso some of which have been previously zzso such as the zzso factor zzso zzso and zzso B zzso zzso analysis of selected proteins confirmed the data obtained via mass zzso Of particular interest was the identification of the nuclear import proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as factors involved in zzso zzso and several zzso zzso These data give new insight into possible mechanisms of nuclear trafficking and functioning of this critical signaling zzso
