The identification of zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso as zzso targets represents one approach to improve treatment options for diffuse large zzso zzso zzso We previously identified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso domain containing 1 zzso a zzso zzso that was expressed in a range of zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate the presence of a zzso zzso zzso response to zzso in zzso zzso A significant zzso zzso release was detected in zzso zzso zzso patients (18 de zzso zzso two transformed zzso and one zzso rich zzso zzso following short-term culture of their peripheral blood zzso cells zzso with five zzso zzso zzso No significant responses were detected in 21 zzso zzso patients (12 de zzso zzso seven transformed zzso two zzso rich zzso zzso or six normal zzso zzso cell lines were able to lyse zzso zzso cells in a major zzso zzso I dependent zzso The presence of a zzso response correlated with zzso protein expression in the zzso cells in zzso cases zzso This is the first report of a zzso response to a zzso in zzso Our results provide additional valuable evidence supporting zzso as a potential zzso target for the treatment of zzso and other zzso
