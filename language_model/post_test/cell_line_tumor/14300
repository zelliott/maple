The role that transforming growth factor zzso zzso plays in influencing growth of zzso cells is somewhat zzso To further understand the potential zzso effects of zzso constructed an animal zzso tumor model by injecting either zzso or zzso zzso human zzso zzso cells into nude rat zzso Wild type zzso cells produced very low amounts of zzso and were highly zzso In contrast, zzso cells zzso to express high levels of zzso showed reduced tumor size in zzso in a zzso zzso This reduction in tumor size was not due to either decreased zzso or increased zzso To test whether zzso overproduction inhibited tumor growth through an zzso zzso the highest zzso producing cells were then double zzso with a zzso expressing the zzso type II zzso zzso zzso expressing high levels of truncated zzso zzso were less sensitive to zzso zzso growth zzso in zzso and produced more aggressive tumors in zzso The data suggest that the degree of zzso of the zzso high-grade zzso cell line may be associated with zzso low level of production of zzso These results also would tend to support the possibility that zzso may be useful in treating some high-grade zzso
