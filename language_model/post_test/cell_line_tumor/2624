Recent studies support zzso therapies for cancer zzso An advantageous cell type for such therapeutic schemes are the zzso stem cells zzso that can be easily zzso in culture, genetically modified to express therapeutic zzso and exhibit an innate zzso to solid tumors in zzso Recently, we successfully isolated and expanded zzso from zzso zzso fluid zzso The main characteristic of zzso is their efficient and rapid expansion in zzso zzso we investigated the zzso zzso and capability to transport zzso beta zzso to the region of zzso in a zzso tumor zzso To this end, we used the zzso zzso cancer cell line, previously generated from our studies, and developed a disease progression model in zzso mice, that can zzso the molecular events of zzso zzso Our results documented that zzso exhibited high zzso when migrated either to zzso cells or to zzso zzso and we further identified and studied the zzso factors which may trigger these enhanced migratory zzso Further, zzso zzso expressing green fluorescent protein zzso or zzso were zzso administered to zzso zzso animals at multiple doses to examine their therapeutic zzso zzso and zzso successfully migrated and zzso at the tumor zzso zzso significant zzso of tumor growth as well as prolonged survival of mice were observed in the presence of zzso zzso these results document the great potential of zzso as zzso vehicles, implemented by the targeting of the tumor site and further facilitated by their high proliferation rate and expansion efficiency in zzso
