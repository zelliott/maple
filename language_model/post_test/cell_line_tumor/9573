Cancer cells are typically characterized by zzso zzso In order to investigate a possible role for the zzso zzso gene in zzso cell cancer zzso we analyzed its expression in tumor tissue samples and in zzso cell zzso In addition, we studied the contribution of zzso to the zzso resistance of zzso cells by zzso interference zzso zzso gene expression was detected in a significant portion of zzso tumor tissue specimens zzso zzso and zzso cell lines zzso zzso Moreover, targeted zzso of zzso by zzso markedly zzso zzso cells towards zzso zzso such as zzso zzso or the zzso drugs zzso zzso and zzso These effects were specific for zzso expressing tumor zzso We conclude that zzso can contribute significantly to the zzso resistance of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso could represent a novel therapeutic strategy to increase the sensitivity of zzso zzso towards zzso zzso
