zzso zzso zzso has widely been used in hormone replacement therapy zzso and is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, possibly due to disruption of zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the synthetic zzso zzso does not increase breast density, and is rapidly zzso to zzso zzso and zzso and a zzso zzso zzso that has both zzso and zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso stabilize zzso protein levels, initiate specific zzso zzso interactions critical for zzso zzso regulation, and increase proliferation of zzso positive zzso breast cancer zzso zzso modeling and molecular dynamic simulation indicate that zzso zzso a more stable zzso structure than does zzso and zzso a less stable zzso zzso expression analyses confirms that the molecular actions of zzso more closely resembles zzso in breast cancer cells than either zzso does to zzso
