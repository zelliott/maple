zzso zzso protein zzso can enhance the effect of therapeutic proteins in gene therapy, such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso however, the mechanism is unclear or zzso In this study, zzso expression zzso carrying bovine zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso type 4 zzso zzso zzso were constructed in order to evaluate and compare the therapeutic zzso of zzso and zzso to enhance zzso zzso suicide gene therapy for zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso imaging in zzso and in zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso compared to that with zzso both in zzso and in zzso However, zzso utilizing a mixture of parental and zzso zzso cells indicated that the enhancement was detected only in zzso zzso Thus, the therapeutic potential of zzso and zzso in zzso suicide gene therapy in this tumor system is not due to zzso delivery of zzso into surrounding cells but rather is likely due to an enhanced zzso zzso
