Recent studies demonstrated that zzso has zzso properties in several types of cancer cells, mainly by inducing zzso and zzso zzso The arrest of proliferation is a feature of cellular zzso however, the occurrence of zzso in melanoma cells upon zzso treatment has not been investigated until zzso Our results demonstrated that exposure of human zzso melanoma cells zzso to zzso zzso a zzso zzso characterized by zzso arrest, positive zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Also, the main pathways leading to cell zzso were examined in zzso human melanoma cells, and the expression levels of zzso and zzso were zzso by zzso suggesting that cell cycle regulators and DNA damage pathways are involved in the onset of zzso Since zzso can act as a zzso agent, and zzso stress may be related to zzso we measured the zzso zzso levels in zzso cells upon zzso zzso Interestingly, we found an increased amount of zzso zzso in these cells, which was accompanied by elevated expression of zzso and zzso zzso our results demonstrated that zzso can induce zzso in human melanoma cells by zzso of zzso pathway, and that zzso stress may be related to this zzso
