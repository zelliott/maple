zzso zzso human zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which promotes tumor progression when zzso Our previous studies demonstrated that zzso zzso cells release zzso zzso that activate zzso on viable tumor zzso In the present study, we identified an zzso zzso released by zzso human zzso zzso zzso tumor cell zzso zzso contained zzso 1 zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso of zzso A1 with a specific zzso markedly reduced the zzso activity of zzso for tumor cells and diminished its capacity to promote tumor cell growth, invasion, and colony formation on soft zzso In addition, zzso A1 was present in tumor zzso formed by human zzso cells in nude zzso zzso A1 zzso significantly reduced the zzso of zzso cells in nude mice, but zzso A1 double zzso diminished tumor growth even zzso The clinical relevance of zzso A1 in zzso was supported by the observation that zzso A1 was more highly expressed in poorly differentiated human primary zzso compared with lower grade zzso Our study implicates zzso A1 as a major component in zzso tumor zzso stimulants of the growth of zzso via the zzso of zzso
