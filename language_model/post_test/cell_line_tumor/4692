Multiple myeloma is an incurable plasma cell zzso for which existing animal models are zzso We have previously shown that the targeted expression of the zzso zzso and zzso in zzso plasma cells produces zzso that displays features of human zzso such as zzso of tumor cells to the bone zzso and zzso bone zzso We have isolated and characterized in zzso cultures and adoptive transfers of tumors from zzso transgenic zzso zzso have a zzso zzso and variable expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso from primary tumor cell cultures shows that the zzso tumors contain a variety of zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso The most frequently zzso zzso are 12 and zzso Three sites for recurring zzso were also identified on zzso zzso zzso and zzso Gene expression profiling was used to identify differences in gene expression between tumor cells and normal plasma cells zzso and to cluster the tumors into two groups zzso groups C and zzso with distinct gene expression zzso Four hundred and zzso genes were significantly different between both tumor groups and zzso whereas 124 genes were uniquely different from zzso in tumor group C and 204 genes were uniquely different from zzso in tumor group zzso Similar to human zzso the zzso D genes are zzso zzso in the mouse tumor zzso These data suggest the zzso tumors are similar to a subset of zzso human zzso and provide insight into the specific genes and pathways underlying the human zzso
