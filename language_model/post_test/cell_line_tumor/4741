The prognosis for patients diagnosed with zzso zzso cancer is zzso with a median survival time of only 6 zzso Novel therapies are needed for these and other zzso zzso that are zzso to conventional zzso 

Our goals were to assess the ability of an zzso zzso zzso zzso virus zzso to enter and lyse human zzso zzso and determine whether zzso zzso virus zzso expression is a zzso of zzso zzso 

A panel of 12 human zzso cancer cell lines including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were exposed to zzso and assessed for zzso to viral entry and zzso The expression of zzso zzso virus zzso D receptors zzso and zzso virus entry zzso was assessed by quantitative zzso cell zzso and correlated with zzso entry and zzso 

There was significant variation in the ability of zzso to enter zzso cancer cells as measured by zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso expression correlated strongly with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso blocking studies validated the importance of zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso were least sensitive to zzso zzso All zzso zzso and zzso zzso tested exhibited greater than zzso zzso 7 d after exposure to zzso at zzso of infection 1, although zzso was variable at zzso of infection zzso zzso correlations between zzso expression and zzso zzso were identified using zzso zzso 

zzso causes significant zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is a novel marker of zzso cancer sensitivity to zzso zzso therapy that might guide patient selection for zzso
