The zzso zzso transition pore complex zzso is involved in the control of the zzso membrane zzso during zzso necrosis and zzso Indeed, the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso channel zzso two major components of zzso are the targets of a variety of zzso zzso Using zzso and zzso analysis, we identified some of the interacting partners of zzso in several normal zzso and human cancer cell zzso During zzso zzso some of these interactions were constant zzso zzso whereas others changed strongly zzso with the dissipation of the zzso zzso potential and until nuclear degradation occurred zzso zzso zzso zzso of the respiratory chain, a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso beta 4 and zzso zzso In addition, a zzso zzso interacts with zzso in normal zzso in colon zzso cells and in zzso This interaction is lost during zzso zzso suggesting that zzso behaves as an zzso zzso of zzso and zzso pore zzso Thus, zzso is connected to zzso proteins as well as to proteins from other zzso such as the zzso zzso forming a dynamic zzso zzso Changes within this zzso zzso coordinate the lethal response of cells to zzso zzso
