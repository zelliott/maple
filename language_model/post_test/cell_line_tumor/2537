The zzso of zzso a clinically used zzso drug, can be enhanced by zzso zzso zzso or zzso to promote the formation of zzso zzso zzso supplies the carbon required for the zzso linkage of zzso to one strand of DNA, with hydrogen bonds zzso the zzso zzso to the other strand of DNA, to act much like an zzso zzso zzso zzso present a major challenge for cellular repair zzso requiring the zzso of numerous DNA damage response proteins for resolution of the resulting DNA zzso and zzso This work investigates DNA damage response proteins activated by zzso zzso Although zzso was zzso at zzso 15 in response to zzso long term growth zzso of zzso cells was not affected by zzso zzso Using zzso technology and zzso zzso we observed enhanced cellular sensitivity to zzso zzso when the activity of the zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso using a double zzso block were zzso to zzso cell death upon zzso zzso but relatively unaffected by zzso zzso Loss of zzso was associated with zzso of a drug-induced zzso block and induction of zzso catastrophe, while loss of zzso was associated with drug-induced zzso in zzso zzso These proteins may therefore be potential drug targets to achieve synergistic zzso responses to zzso zzso forming zzso The analysis of these protein zzso with respect to cell cycle progression indicates that zzso is required for zzso checkpoint responses while zzso appears to function in zzso zzso responses to zzso zzso
