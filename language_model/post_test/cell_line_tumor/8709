zzso elimination of defective zzso suppresses zzso stress and preserves zzso zzso Here, the essential zzso gene zzso was deleted in a mouse model of zzso lung cancer in the presence or absence of the tumor zzso zzso zzso deletion initially induced zzso stress and accelerated tumor cell proliferation in a manner indistinguishable from zzso zzso zzso deletion of zzso and zzso had no additive effect, suggesting that both genes zzso zzso by regulating zzso stress and revealing a potential mechanism of zzso tumor zzso At later stages of zzso zzso zzso resulted in an zzso of defective zzso zzso zzso reduced tumor burden, conversion of zzso and zzso to zzso and increased mouse life zzso zzso zzso cell lines were impaired in their ability to zzso and survive zzso and were zzso suggesting that zzso zzso from protein degradation sustains zzso tumor growth and zzso 

The essential zzso gene zzso functions to promote zzso lung zzso by preserving zzso zzso zzso This suggests that zzso zzso is a novel approach to treating zzso zzso
