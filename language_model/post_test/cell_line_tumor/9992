zzso factor 6 zzso zzso 1 zzso is an zzso zzso zzso of the zzso tumor zzso gene that is specifically zzso in a number of human zzso Previously, we have demonstrated that increased expression of zzso is associated with decreased survival in lung zzso patient samples and that targeted reduction of zzso using zzso induced zzso both alone and in combination with the zzso drug zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso lung cancer cells express increased levels of zzso Furthermore, targeted reduction of zzso using zzso interference restores chemotherapy sensitivity to lung cancer cells both in culture and in zzso through induction of zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in a marked reduction in chemotherapy sensitivity in a tumor zzso zzso zzso these findings highlight a functional role for the zzso zzso zzso in the regulation of chemotherapy response in lung cancer and could provide novel insight into lung cancer zzso
