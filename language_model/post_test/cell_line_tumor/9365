A promising strategy to carry genetic material to brain cells either in zzso or in zzso is using the LDL zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso naturally help to low density zzso zzso transporting across the zzso by zzso Here we present the idea of using the zzso zzso for transporting genetic material to brain zzso A tandem zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso sequence was used as a novel DNA zzso zzso for zzso of brain cells either in zzso or in zzso DNA zzso occurs with this zzso because zzso interaction between DNA and zzso The zzso favors to protection of DNA from zzso degradation and also helps to DNA carrying in blood stream to reach zzso and transport it to brain cells and eventually help DNA expression in target zzso These results suggest a novel gene delivery zzso for gene therapy of brain zzso
