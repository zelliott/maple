The zzso derivatives zzso zzso and zzso zzso are promising zzso drugs that inhibit heat shock protein 90 zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso treatment zzso the degradation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso We have found, however, that zzso zzso alone is not sufficient for efficient zzso degradation in some zzso zzso zzso structurally unrelated to zzso zzso and zzso while inducing the degradation of the zzso client protein zzso fail to induce zzso degradation or inhibit zzso zzso in zzso human colon cancer zzso Moreover, after treatment with zzso the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso was also zzso zzso of cells with a zzso oxygen species zzso scavenger, zzso zzso partially restored zzso activity and also partially prevented zzso degradation due to zzso zzso zzso treatment with the zzso producing drug zzso clearly inhibited zzso and reduced zzso These results suggest that in addition to direct zzso of zzso the zzso effect of zzso and its derivatives is also zzso though the production of zzso which may directly zzso zzso zzso zzso
