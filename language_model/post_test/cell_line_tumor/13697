We detected significant levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities associated with the plasma membrane of zzso from normal and zzso subjects and of cells from breast, zzso colon and zzso tumors in zzso All of the cells subjected to zzso zzso showed an increase of the activity of plasma membrane zzso zzso and zzso zzso in addition of the well known increase of activity of plasma membrane zzso under similar zzso Human breast cancer cell line zzso was studied in zzso In these cells the increase of activity of zzso and zzso was parallel to the increase of zzso dose up to zzso and continued with time, at least up to zzso from zzso zzso increased up to 17 times and zzso up to 40 times with respect to zzso zzso zzso and zzso increased about 2 times at a dose of zzso but no further significant differences were observed with increase of radiation dose and zzso After zzso we observed a reduction of cell zzso an increase of zzso cell death and an increase of plasma membrane zzso up to 3 times, with respect to control zzso zzso zzso zzso has been administered to zzso cells under conditions that prevented the zzso zzso zzso became component of the plasma zzso and was transformed into zzso zzso and zzso The quantity of zzso produced in zzso cells was about two times that of control zzso
