zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso has become the standard zzso agent for pancreatic cancer zzso The clinical impact of zzso remains modest zzso to the high degree of inherent and acquired zzso There are various lines of evidence that confirm the role of zzso a zzso in tumor invasion, zzso and zzso This study examines a hypothesis that implicates zzso in the development of zzso in pancreatic cancer zzso zzso protein expression was assessed in parental pancreatic cancer cells and their zzso zzso Western zzso analysis revealed elevated levels of zzso protein expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso cells as compared to their parental zzso A time course analysis was conducted to determine the change in zzso expression in the parental cells after incubation with zzso zzso zzso quantitative real-time zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis revealed a significant increase in zzso zzso All the three parental cells incubated with zzso showed elevated zzso protein expression at 6 zzso By 24 zzso the expression level had zzso Using small interfering zzso zzso against zzso in zzso cells, we demonstrated a reversal in zzso zzso and also detected a marked reduction in the expression of the zzso target genes zzso and zzso Our novel finding demonstrates the significance of zzso in the development of zzso zzso in pancreatic cancer zzso Based on these results, a new zzso therapeutic strategy targeting the zzso genes can be designed to overcome zzso
