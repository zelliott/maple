zzso infection zzso is a common problem in zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment of all mice with a diet containing therapeutic levels of zzso for several weeks is often used to control zzso zzso We examined the effect of feeding a therapeutic diet containing 150 zzso zzso on the growth of zzso mouse zzso tumors implanted into zzso zzso zzso Mice were zzso to receive either a zzso or control diet for 1 zzso before tumor cells were injected zzso in the zzso and throughout tumor zzso zzso growth was monitored by serial zzso of tumor diameters from the time tumors became palpable until they reached 1000 zzso The zzso diet did not alter tumor growth, invasion, or zzso When tumors reached volumes of approximately 100 zzso some were zzso locally with 10 zzso of zzso zzso significantly delayed tumor zzso zzso did not alter the zzso growth zzso However, cell culture studies showed that zzso zzso not far above those expected in the zzso of mice on this diet altered the growth of the tumor cells in zzso Recent data from other laboratories also have demonstrated effects of zzso that could complicate zzso Care should therefore be exercised in deciding whether zzso containing zzso should be administered to mouse colonies being used in cancer zzso
