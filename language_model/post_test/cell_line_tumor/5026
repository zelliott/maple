zzso represent a potent group of antibiotics that inhibit bacterial DNA replication by targeting the essential bacterial zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity by zzso involves the interaction of these drugs with the zzso component of bacterial zzso DNA zzso viruses also zzso zzso that are essential for their DNA replication in the zzso 

In this study we have evaluated the effect of zzso on viral DNA replication using the DNA zzso virus zzso virus 40 zzso as our zzso Four different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were tested for their ability to inhibit viral DNA zzso 

We show here that all four zzso tested were effective in the zzso of zzso plaque formation and DNA replication in zzso zzso In addition, we found that each of these zzso was zzso to the zzso activity of zzso large zzso zzso 

zzso and their zzso may therefore be useful in the treatment and/or prevention of infection by zzso human DNA viruses that zzso zzso activity for their zzso
