The development of zzso zzso disease zzso is known to be a zzso risk factor in the evolution of zzso of the zzso The major component of this zzso is gastric zzso However, the impact of low pH on gene expression has not been extensively studied in zzso zzso This study zzso a zzso and zzso approach to assess regulation of gene expression in response to low zzso In more detail, zzso zzso cell lines were exposed to a range of pH zzso zzso zzso were used for zzso analysis and results were validated using cycle limitation and real-time zzso analysis, as well as northern and western zzso Comparative promoter zzso factor binding site zzso analysis zzso of zzso clustered zzso data was employed to identify the elements which may zzso regulate individual gene zzso zzso experiments demonstrated zzso induction of zzso gene expression at pH zzso zzso array zzso revealed significant induction of gene expression from such functional categories as DNA damage response zzso zzso and zzso control zzso zzso zzso Changes in expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were verified in separate experiments and in a variety of zzso cell zzso zzso analysis of promoters identified zzso factors that may zzso regulate zzso zzso zzso 1: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Low pH has the ability to induce genes and pathways which can provide an environment suitable for the progression of zzso Further functional analysis of the genes and clusters identified in this low pH study is likely to lead to new insights into the zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso
