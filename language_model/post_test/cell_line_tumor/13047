Based on our current knowledge, zzso holds a key position in the induction of a selective battery of zzso and zzso of drug zzso In order to prevent serious adverse drug effects or zzso zzso interactions zzso it is compulsory to investigate the possible inducing potency of drugs under zzso Furthermore, analysis of the inducing potency of environmental pollutants and new or manufactured chemicals is part of zzso risk zzso In zzso human zzso and rat zzso zzso cells, we examined the characteristics of expression of 45 genes involved in drug zzso A few gene products such as zzso or zzso zzso were prominent in zzso cells while their major rat counterparts were, zzso zzso or zzso Furthermore, a number of zzso receptors including zzso were expressed in both cell zzso A number of genes were regulated in a cell type and zzso manner after incubation with the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Then, we established zzso reporter gene zzso for screening for zzso induction of drug zzso zzso and zzso cells were zzso zzso with a reporter gene containing zzso responsive elements zzso which mediate the induction of zzso target genes such as zzso zzso With both stable cell lines the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as the drug candidate zzso zzso and the zzso flame zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso mixture were zzso In the human zzso and rat zzso cells, zzso and zzso were found as common zzso of the human and rat zzso whereas zzso was more effective with the human cell zzso zzso and zzso did not induce the rat zzso reporter gene expression in zzso cells, while a moderate increase was found in zzso zzso zzso zzso also acted as zzso in human but not in rat cells confirming in zzso zzso In zzso the established zzso in zzso system allows the simultaneous, fast, and zzso screening of zzso environmental zzso food ingredients and drugs for zzso induction in cells of human and rat zzso
