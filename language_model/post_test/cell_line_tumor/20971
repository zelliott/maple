Human zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso gene has been reported to achieve cancer zzso zzso The purpose of this study is to clarify clinical significance of zzso expression in gastric zzso 

zzso zzso expression was zzso by real-time reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso using paired tumor and normal clinical samples from a total of 110 gastric cancer zzso zzso protein expression was investigated by zzso The relationship between zzso zzso expression and zzso factors was statistically zzso 

zzso zzso expression in tumor tissue was significantly zzso compared with that in normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein expression was also diminished in cancer cells by zzso zzso survival zzso demonstrated that the patients with low zzso expression tumor showed significantly shorter survival zzso zzso zzso than those with high zzso expression zzso Furthermore, the tumors with low zzso expression showed deeper invasion into the zzso layer zzso zzso zzso or more frequent distant zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso gene was zzso in clinical gastric zzso Loss of zzso expression would be a novel zzso to determine biological aggressiveness of gastric zzso
