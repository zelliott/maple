The zzso fusion transcript encodes the zzso zzso zzso zzso which causes chronic zzso leukemia zzso Although the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso which targets the zzso zzso has been proven to be effective in controlling zzso growth, zzso resistance has been observed with disease zzso because of point zzso in the zzso gene that inhibit zzso zzso In this study, we designed zzso zzso that specifically target and cleave both the junction sequence and the site of the point zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance in zzso zzso zzso significantly induced zzso and inhibited proliferation in zzso and zzso zzso zzso Selective zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso led to cell cycle arrest in zzso phase, with induction of zzso in zzso zzso cells harboring the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso with the zzso targeting the zzso zzso and zzso resulted in enhanced zzso of proliferation and induction of zzso in zzso zzso cells as compared with zzso alone, thereby zzso zzso resistance in zzso cells bearing zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso combined with zzso treatment may be an alternative approach to overcoming zzso resistance in zzso zzso
