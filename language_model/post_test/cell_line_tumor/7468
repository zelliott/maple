Fluorescent proteins have revolutionized biology, allowing what was formerly invisible to be clearly zzso The Nobel Prize in zzso was awarded in 2008 for the discovery and early use of green fluorescent protein zzso as a genetic zzso Our laboratory pioneered the use of zzso for in zzso zzso In this chapter we review the developments within our research on zzso imaging of zzso trafficking of cancer cells carried out in real time in zzso zzso fluorescent cells, with one color fluorescent protein in the nucleus and another color fluorescent protein in the zzso enable real-time zzso dynamics to be zzso in living cells in zzso as well as in zzso In the zzso cells, red fluorescent protein zzso is expressed in the zzso of cancer cells, and zzso is linked to zzso zzso and is expressed in the zzso Nuclear zzso expression enables zzso of nuclear zzso whereas simultaneous zzso zzso expression allows zzso of nuclear zzso ratios in addition to simultaneous cell and nuclear shape zzso With the use of zzso fluorescent cells, it is possible to achieve zzso real-time imaging of cancer cell trafficking in live zzso zzso can also be zzso in real zzso zzso imaging has shown that zzso processes of cancer cells exit the vessels first, with zzso following along the zzso projections zzso et zzso Cancer Res zzso zzso zzso in zzso cellular imaging was used to zzso cancer cell trafficking blood vessels, as well as in the zzso systems of the zzso The real-time imaging of cancer cell seeding on the lung has now been achieved with zzso zzso zzso in zzso imaging zzso great promise for understanding zzso at the cellular level in zzso
