zzso alcohol was zzso with new zzso zzso derivatives with the aim of increasing its zzso zzso thus improving zzso and favoring its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were prepared by zzso alcohol zzso substitution with zzso chains through a zzso zzso at zzso and zzso substitution zzso The complexes were obtained by zzso zzso solutions of the zzso zzso and free zzso alcohol at different weight ratios zzso zzso zzso zzso The main zzso characteristics of the complexes were analyzed and correlated to the zzso activity of zzso alcohol toward tumor cell zzso The complexes strongly increased the zzso zzso of zzso alcohol and provided zzso alcohol release in the presence of zzso conditions zzso in zzso zzso The complexes obtained by zzso zzso alcohol weight ratio offered higher release rates than the zzso and zzso ratios, zzso zzso also increased zzso alcohol zzso toward tumor cells due to increased availability of the active zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to be zzso and no toxic effect was detected up to the highest concentration used in the present study zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso alcohol with the zzso analyzed here efficiently increased the availability of the fatty alcohol in zzso zzso The enhanced zzso toward tumor cells of the zzso zzso alcohol and the zzso zzso make these zzso zzso derivatives interesting candidates for soluble pharmaceutical zzso containing zzso drugs whose therapeutic potential is often underestimated due to zzso levels of their zzso zzso
