zzso of the zzso extract from the stem bark powder of zzso zzso led to the isolation of a new zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso characterized on the basis of its spectral zzso zzso was evaluated for its zzso capacity on the human zzso zzso zzso and the African green monkey kidney zzso cell zzso The 50% zzso of cell growth zzso obtained after 24 h incubation was similar for both cells lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but at 48 h the zzso value for the zzso cells was lower than for the zzso cells (20 zzso zzso 49 zzso versus 90 zzso zzso 220 zzso indicating a higher cell growth zzso effect on the colon zzso zzso At the respective zzso zzso zzso did not significantly induce zzso but induced cell cycle arrest in the zzso phase, as well as a decrease of cells in S zzso zzso also induced DNA fragmentation in both cell lines, as revealed by zzso gel zzso and a zzso zzso effect in both cell lines as revealed by the zzso zzso
