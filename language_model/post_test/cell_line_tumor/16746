In cells exposed to environmental stress, zzso of translation initiation zzso energy for the repair of cellular zzso zzso zzso that accumulate in these cells move to discrete zzso zzso known as stress zzso zzso The assembly of zzso helps cells to survive under adverse environmental zzso We have analyzed the mechanism by which hydrogen zzso zzso zzso stress zzso translation initiation and zzso zzso assembly in zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso zzso translation and zzso the assembly of zzso The assembly of zzso zzso is independent of the zzso of zzso a major trigger of zzso zzso but requires zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso are zzso distinct from zzso zzso and targeted zzso of zzso a protein required for zzso translation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our data reveal new aspects of zzso regulation induced by zzso zzso
