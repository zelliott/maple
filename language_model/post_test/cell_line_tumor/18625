The core protein of zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso can bind zzso or zzso zzso and undergo zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso supports extensive and permanent zzso formation, whereas zzso zzso appear to support a more zzso possibly transient zzso zzso zzso release of zzso oxide, which zzso zzso degradation of the zzso zzso chains on the same core zzso Although free zzso zzso support a more limited degradation, zzso zzso support a more extensive zzso zzso Here, we have investigated processing of zzso in rat zzso zzso cells and the possible participation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso induced extensive, zzso zzso zzso degradation, which could be demonstrated using a specific zinc zzso zzso interference zzso of zzso expression reduced the extent of zzso zzso In zzso experiments, the presence of free zzso zzso prevented free zzso zzso from binding to zzso and precluded extensive zzso zzso zzso However, in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso underwent extensive, zzso zzso We propose that the zzso that is required for zzso of zzso can take place on zzso and thereby ensure extensive zzso processing in the presence of free zzso zzso
