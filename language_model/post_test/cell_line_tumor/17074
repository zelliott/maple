zzso zzso and zzso complexes display zzso and zzso activity, disrupt zzso function and induce zzso zzso We have examined the effect of these drugs on the structure of zzso and zzso cell zzso and the integrity of cellular zzso Exposure of zzso zzso to zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in DNA degradation whereas exposure to zzso or zzso did zzso All drugs induced extensive changes to the internal structure of zzso cells including zzso of the zzso nuclear fragmentation and disruption of the zzso In the case of cultured zzso cells zzso induced zzso as evidenced by the zzso pattern of DNA fragments following gel zzso and also the zzso of the cell zzso The other drugs produced zzso DNA degradation in zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso and zzso complexes have the potential to induce zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Given their distinct mode of action compared to conventional zzso drugs, zzso and zzso complexes may represent a novel group of zzso agents for use either in combination with existing drugs or in cases where resistance to conventional drugs has zzso
