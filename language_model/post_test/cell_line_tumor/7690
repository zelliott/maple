At present, the zzso of zzso during zzso of zzso cancer is widely recognized while the role of zzso in this process remains zzso We aimed to investigate the differential expression of zzso and evaluate the therapeutic potential of expression intervention in this zzso 

We first examined the different expression of zzso in normal colon zzso zzso and cancer, investigating the relationship between its expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was established in colon cancer cell lines by zzso infection to study the changes in growth, proliferation and zzso 

Compared with normal colon zzso the expression of zzso was higher in zzso while lower in cancer both at zzso and protein level zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso of zzso expression is more common in poorly differentiated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines, zzso cell groups showed higher expression of zzso poorer colony formation and slower cell zzso In terms of zzso related zzso zzso zzso leads to higher zzso rate and zzso arrest, while zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso zzso zzso was also observed in zzso zzso cells zzso zzso 

The change of zzso expression from colon zzso zzso to cancer suggested it may be involved in the zzso of colon zzso The zzso of zzso exhibits an zzso role in cancer growth and proliferation while promoting zzso However, a zzso role of zzso zzso differentiation was also zzso
