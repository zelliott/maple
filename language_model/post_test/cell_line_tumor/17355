zzso protein zzso zzso was recently suggested to have a zzso effect although its primary function is believed to mediate cellular adaptation to zzso zzso Here, we investigated the effect of the zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso using mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was increased by zzso zzso either with zzso zzso or with zzso of active zzso zzso also induced nuclear zzso zzso zzso along with zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso zzso and the zzso zzso cell death was zzso In addition, zzso inhibitor zzso prevented the zzso cell death by zzso Thus, our data suggest that zzso mediates the zzso effect of zzso
