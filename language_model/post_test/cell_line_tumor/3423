zzso zzso is a very active oral zzso zzso and breast zzso whose clinical use is complicated by the presence of zzso syndrome zzso This zzso toxicity is less frequently encountered with other oral zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso is thus attributed to the presence of the main zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but without strong pharmacological zzso The aim of the present study was to closely examine this latter zzso zzso generates zzso zzso which is transformed into zzso at the cellular target site through the zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso effects zzso test, zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were tested against the spontaneously immortalized human zzso cell line zzso and the human cancer colon cell line zzso as a zzso Mean zzso on zzso and zzso were, respectively, zzso and 10 zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and greater than 650 and zzso zzso for zzso The respective zzso zzso values were not different when cells were exposed to zzso alone or in combination with zzso zzso and zzso in both cell lines, the relative proportion of each drug reflecting known zzso data for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This latter finding demonstrates the relative lack of significant zzso activity of zzso and zzso on human zzso zzso activity was particularly high in zzso cells and zzso activity was very low in both cell zzso These data strongly suggest that the presence of zzso zzso does not play a major role in the zzso generated by zzso and that it can probably be attributed to particularly high zzso activity in zzso This observation may have important clinical consequences such as a possible local pharmacological zzso of zzso for controlling zzso
