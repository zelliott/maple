zzso cells adapt to zzso zzso zzso stress through a set of zzso zzso zzso as part of a process termed the unfolded protein response zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso with increasing progression and poor clinical outcome of several tumor types, including prostate zzso zzso signaling can activate zzso a master regulator of zzso of zzso zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso 2 zzso is zzso in several zzso zzso including prostate cancer, and recently zzso was implicated as a key zzso of breast cancer zzso Here, we zzso that the tumor cell zzso regulates zzso zzso 

We interrogated zzso regulation in zzso and human prostate cancer cells undergoing pharmacological and zzso zzso stress, and tested zzso and zzso dependence by using pharmacological zzso of these signaling zzso 

zzso of zzso stress using zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso stress zzso or via zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso present in the tumor zzso zzso zzso production in zzso and human prostate cancer zzso zzso of the zzso using zzso acid zzso dramatically decreases zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in prostate cancer cells undergoing zzso zzso stress by BAY zzso abrogates zzso zzso 

We conclude that the zzso activates zzso production in prostate cancer cells in an zzso zzso Our results imply that the observed zzso of zzso 2 in various types of cancer cells may be the direct consequence of zzso zzso zzso and that the zzso zzso 2 axis is a potential new target for intervention in cancer zzso
