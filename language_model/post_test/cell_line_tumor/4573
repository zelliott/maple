Both molecular and clinical evidence support a link between zzso infection and insulin zzso We examined the in zzso interaction between the zzso core protein of zzso zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso We measured the expression levels of insulin zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso and other factors involved in the insulin signal zzso in a human zzso cell line zzso zzso expressing the zzso core protein of zzso zzso or zzso by molecular biology and zzso zzso The zzso (but not zzso protein level was significantly reduced in zzso expressing the core protein of both zzso zzso and zzso as compared to cells zzso with the empty zzso However, while the core protein of zzso zzso promoted zzso degradation through the zzso of zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso and by zzso the zzso of zzso signal 7 zzso the core protein of zzso zzso activated the zzso target of zzso zzso We confirmed these findings by using zzso for zzso zzso or short interfering zzso for zzso 

Despite the small sequence divergence of the zzso core proteins of zzso zzso and zzso the 2 proteins appear to interfere with the insulin signaling zzso using zzso zzso
