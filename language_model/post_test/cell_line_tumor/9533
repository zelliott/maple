To investigate the effects of zzso acid zzso on zzso and proliferation of zzso cell zzso 

Human zzso cell lines zzso and zzso zzso were cultured in medium supplemented with different zzso of zzso normal human zzso line zzso was used as zzso Cell zzso zzso and gene expression were detected using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso flow zzso Western zzso DNA zzso zzso electron zzso and zzso 

zzso acid inhibited the proliferation of zzso and zzso cell lines in a zzso zzso zzso acid can change cell cycle distribution of zzso and zzso the proportion of cells in zzso phase increased whereas the proportion of S phase cells and zzso phase cells zzso zzso acid arrested the cell cycle in zzso phase by zzso the cell cycle related proteins zzso zzso D3 and zzso protein zzso The zzso rates of zzso and zzso treated with zzso zzso zzso were significantly higher than those of zzso In the zzso and zzso treated with zzso expression of zzso decreased whereas expression of zzso increased, the nuclear fragmentation and zzso condensed, cells shrank and lost attachment, zzso bodies and DNA ladders zzso zzso had no effect in inducing zzso on zzso cell zzso 

zzso can selectively inhibit proliferation and induce zzso of zzso and zzso cell lines by blocking cell cycle and regulating the expression of zzso zzso
