In an attempt to improve zzso activity and reduce systemic toxicity of zzso zzso we zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by a novel zzso procedure without using zzso organic zzso or vigorous zzso These zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with drug loading of zzso were zzso and zzso 20 zzso in zzso The zzso can be released from the zzso zzso the zzso at pH zzso was faster than that at pH zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso enhanced the cellular zzso and zzso of zzso on the zzso colon zzso cell in zzso and slowed the zzso of zzso in the transgenic zzso zzso Compared to free zzso zzso zzso were more effective in zzso tumor growth in the subcutaneous zzso colon zzso and Lewis lung zzso models, and zzso survival of mice bearing these zzso zzso zzso also induced lower systemic toxicity than free zzso In conclusion, incorporation of zzso in zzso zzso enhanced the zzso activity and decreased the systemic toxicity of zzso these zzso zzso are an interesting zzso of zzso and may have potential clinical applications in cancer zzso
