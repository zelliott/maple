zzso zzso of zzso surrounding zzso acid zzso breaks zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso plays a key role in recruiting repair factors, including zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we show that human zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso accumulated in zzso repair zzso through recognition of zzso zzso products by its motif interacting with zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso of repair factors at zzso zzso Instead, zzso functionally zzso with zzso and zzso for association with zzso zzso independent of its zzso activity, limiting the magnitude of their recruitment to zzso zzso By delaying zzso of zzso and zzso at damaged zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and restrained zzso end joining, affecting cell survival after zzso zzso Our results show that zzso functions in a zzso fashion to harness zzso protein recruitment to zzso zzso thereby contributing to regulation of zzso repair zzso zzso
