We have previously described the zzso of zzso mast cells for zzso production by zzso zzso but the mechanism remains zzso zzso zzso binds zzso cells primarily through zzso on the target cell zzso This study was undertaken to determine whether the zzso zzso alpha chain on zzso cells is important for zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso release by a series of zzso zzso correlated with the release induced by zzso zzso Further, zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells using a zzso zzso inhibited both zzso and zzso zzso production, providing further evidence for an zzso zzso mechanism of zzso To examine the role of zzso in zzso zzso release, we created zzso zzso zzso zzso using a zzso expressing a short hairpin sequence designed to inhibit message for the zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso production by the zzso zzso was reduced in similar proportion to the degree of message zzso zzso zzso zzso production in the four zzso zzso was completely blocked in contrast to results with the controls or parent zzso zzso We conclude that the heavily zzso zzso alpha chain is required for zzso of mast cells for zzso production by zzso zzso
