zzso drug delivery vehicles have been harnessed extensively as carriers for cancer zzso However, traditional pharmaceutical approaches for zzso have been a challenge with molecules that exhibit incompatible zzso properties, such as zzso zzso Here we propose a paradigm based on rational design of active molecules that facilitate zzso assembly in the zzso zzso Using zzso as a template, we describe the synthesis of a unique platinum zzso zzso to a cholesterol backbone via a unique zzso and zzso coordination environment that zzso zzso assembly with a fixed ratio of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso formed exhibit lower zzso values compared with zzso or zzso in zzso and are active in zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso exhibit significantly enhanced in zzso zzso efficacy in zzso zzso breast cancer and in zzso zzso cancer models with decreased zzso and zzso Our results indicate that zzso rational drug design and zzso zzso can emerge as a powerful strategy for drug zzso Furthermore, given that zzso zzso form the frontline therapy for a broad range of zzso the increased efficacy and toxicity profile indicate the constructed zzso could translate into a next-generation zzso agent in the zzso
