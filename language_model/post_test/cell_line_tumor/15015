In this study, zzso zzso and zzso zzso glass compositions zzso zzso zzso zzso 0, zzso 1, 2 and 3 zzso were zzso by a simple and cost-effective zzso zzso The prepared samples were zzso by X-ray zzso zzso transform infrared zzso transmission electron zzso scanning electron zzso and zzso X-ray zzso zzso zzso All the compositions of the glass samples revealed zzso phase with zzso zzso and a particle size less than 100 zzso The prepared glass samples reveal the specific surface area in the range of zzso zzso zzso The zzso of glass samples was confirmed through the formation of the zzso layer on glass surfaces during in zzso studies in which silver doped glasses (2 and 3 zzso showed better zzso A better zzso was achieved in human gastric zzso cell line in case of zzso glass sample while comparing the biological zzso of zzso zzso Further, the zzso zzso glasses revealed significant zzso activity against zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed better in zzso zzso and remained slightly toxic to human cells at a concentration of 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso glass shows good zzso property as well as no significant toxic for implant zzso
