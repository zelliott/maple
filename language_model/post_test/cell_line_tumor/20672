The expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso is remarkably lower than that in zzso zzso We investigated how zzso could influence the development of zzso zzso Our analyses revealed that zzso inhibited the migration and invasion of zzso zzso zzso gene expression data and target site zzso zzso showed that zzso appears to directly regulate zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso resulted in zzso of the migration and invasion of zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso and its target zzso may be associated with the progression of zzso In clinical zzso zzso the expression levels of zzso which were lower compared to those in normal zzso were zzso correlated with the zzso expression levels of zzso Moreover, we found that there was a significant correlation between the expression levels of zzso and the zzso zzso The identification of a cancer network regulated by zzso could provide new insights into the potential mechanisms of the progression of zzso
