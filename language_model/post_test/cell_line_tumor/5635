Survival rate of zzso zzso zzso is less than zzso A major reason is that those zzso respond poorly to chemotherapy zzso However, factors contributing to zzso in zzso zzso are barely known, thus isolation of factors involved is the critical first step for zzso understanding and therapy zzso With expression zzso we isolated human zzso zzso 8) as an influential factor for zzso poison zzso zzso is an accessory zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso complex (also known as zzso zzso but its role in cancer and drug resistance is zzso Here, we report that zzso is involved in cellular survival and in sensitivity to zzso poisons and zzso inhibitor in aggressive zzso zzso zzso protein expression level is zzso higher in human zzso zzso cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso than in other cell lines zzso zzso rat zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue expressed a barely zzso amount of zzso zzso but aggressive colon tumors induced with zzso and zzso sodium zzso expressed zzso at a significantly higher level, suggesting that zzso expression is associated with tumor progression toward advanced stages and may aid to gain growth zzso Supporting the notion, zzso zzso of zzso induced cell death or growth delay in zzso cancer cell lines, and surviving zzso cells were particularly sensitive to zzso poisons and a zzso inhibitor zzso zzso at least one zzso of zzso gave growth advantage and resistance to zzso when zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso would improve therapy outcome against zzso zzso zzso
