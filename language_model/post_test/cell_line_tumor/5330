Our previous studies and those of others have indicated that zzso inhibitor of zzso protein zzso holds promise as a target gene in colon cancer gene zzso In this study, we constructed an zzso zzso to deliver small hairpin zzso zzso against zzso zzso into colon cancer cells and tested its therapeutic efficacy in zzso and in zzso We first confirmed an zzso of zzso in colon cancer cells and human cancer zzso We then designed zzso interfering zzso zzso and confirmed the zzso effect of these zzso in colon cancer zzso The sequences of the effective zzso were converted into zzso and then packed into zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso System to generate zzso zzso of zzso and zzso cells with zzso led to enhanced zzso activity, which was associated with increased zzso and reduced cell zzso The therapeutic effect of zzso was then tested in zzso tumors in nude zzso We showed that treatment of the zzso tumors derived from zzso cells with zzso resulted in a zzso of tumor growth, which was associated with enhanced zzso increased zzso activity, and reduced expression of zzso cell nuclear zzso in the tumor zzso Treatment of zzso tumors with zzso did not affect the expressions of inflammatory zzso in zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso of zzso exerts a therapeutic effect in colon cancer by promoting zzso and zzso proliferation of colon cancer cells, and the zzso effect of zzso was unlikely to be related to zzso immune zzso
