Acute and chronic zzso exists within the three-dimensional zzso of solid tumors and drives therapy resistance, genetic instability, and zzso zzso cells exposed to either severe acute zzso (16 hours with zzso zzso followed by zzso or moderate chronic zzso zzso hours with zzso zzso treatments have decreased zzso zzso zzso protein expression and zzso As zzso defects are zzso lethal with zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso we evaluated the sensitivity of zzso hypoxic cells to zzso zzso Although zzso zzso itself did not affect zzso expression or function, we observed increased zzso killing in zzso hypoxic cells following chemical zzso of zzso This effect was partially zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso embryonic zzso zzso showed a zzso disadvantage under hypoxic zzso when compared with zzso zzso zzso hypoxic cells accumulated zzso and zzso zzso as a consequence of altered DNA replication firing during S zzso cell zzso In support of this proposed mode of action, zzso zzso zzso displayed increased zzso and zzso zzso expression in zzso hypoxic zzso in zzso which was associated with decreased ex zzso zzso survival following experimental zzso This is the first report of selective cell killing of zzso hypoxic cells in zzso as a consequence of zzso zzso synthetic zzso As all solid tumors contain aggressive hypoxic cells, this may broaden the clinical utility of zzso and DNA repair zzso either alone or in combination with zzso and chemotherapy, even in tumor cells lacking zzso zzso genetic zzso
