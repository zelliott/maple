Recent zzso studies have identified distinct zzso of breast tumors that arise from different cell types and that show statistically significant differences in patient zzso To gain insight into these differences, we identified in zzso and in zzso changes in gene expression induced by zzso We treated two cell lines derived from zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso and two lines derived from zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso used in the treatment of breast cancer and zzso for changes in gene expression using DNA zzso Treatment doses for zzso and zzso were selected to cause comparable zzso across all four cell zzso The dominant expression response in each of the cell lines was a general stress zzso however, distinct expression patterns were zzso Both cell types induced DNA zzso genes such as zzso but the response in the zzso cells showed higher fold changes and included more zzso zzso zzso cell lines zzso a large number of cell zzso genes and other genes involved in cellular zzso whereas the zzso cell lines did zzso Instead, the zzso cell lines zzso genes that were involved in zzso These in zzso responses were compared with expression responses in breast tumors sampled before and after treatment with zzso or zzso zzso The in zzso data zzso the zzso responses to zzso observed in zzso including the induction of zzso zzso between in zzso and in zzso responses help to identify important response mechanisms to zzso
