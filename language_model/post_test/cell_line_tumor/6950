The zzso synthesis of a zzso zzso zzso library based on the structure of zzso and their biological activity are zzso zzso are a family of marine zzso and are composed of a zzso zzso system bearing two zzso zzso The zzso zzso system zzso reacted with two zzso Our strategy for the zzso synthesis of the zzso zzso involves the zzso reaction of a zzso zzso 10 bearing an zzso group, followed by zzso zzso with zzso The zzso zzso 7 zzso was prepared from the zzso zzso 10 in zzso total zzso zzso synthesis of a small library using twelve zzso and eight zzso resulted in the production of 74 desired compounds from 98 candidates, and were detected by their mass zzso zzso effects of the crude compounds against zzso cells showed that zzso samples showed strong zzso activity zzso zzso Further biological examination of four zzso compounds by using five tumor cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso revealed strong zzso comparable to that of zzso
