The zzso resistance zzso zzso induced by the zzso of several ABC zzso or by zzso mechanisms, has been identified as the major cause of drug resistance in the treatment of patients with acute zzso leukemia zzso In this study, we have shown that zzso acid zzso (a zzso zzso zzso can inhibit the proliferation of both zzso zzso and zzso protein 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso also induced zzso of zzso zzso zzso induced zzso in zzso cells led to decrease in Flip zzso zzso zzso expression with Flip zzso which could not be observed in zzso zzso In zzso cell line, which proved to be resistant to zzso by zzso we observed an abnormal expression of zzso regulatory zzso zzso of zzso and absence of zzso Also, the zzso zzso zzso rapidly restored zzso in this cell zzso zzso with zzso zzso induced very strong zzso in both zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso also induced zzso in zzso patient cells expressing zzso and/or zzso Our findings show zzso as an interesting drug that should be tested in clinical trials for overcoming the zzso zzso in zzso zzso
