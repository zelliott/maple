zzso stress has long been linked to cell death in many neurodegenerative zzso Treatment with antioxidants is a promising approach for slowing disease zzso In this study, we used the zzso zzso cells as an in zzso model to first assess the effect of zzso from zzso zzso zzso a natural marine zzso on zzso zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso inhibited zzso cell death in a zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso oxygen species generation and zzso zzso were inhibited by zzso Under severe zzso zzso zzso promoted zzso zzso defense components including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso also protected DNA from zzso damage and enhanced the removal of zzso from zzso Further, we found that zzso potentially prevented zzso cell zzso When investigated zzso protein zzso signaling pathway, we found that zzso of cells with zzso significantly blocked zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso However, zzso had little zzso effect on the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these data demonstrate that zzso prevents zzso zzso zzso oxygen species production and zzso zzso zzso zzso and may be useful in the treatment of neurodegenerative zzso
