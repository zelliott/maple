zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that is zzso in many types of tumors, including pancreatic cancer, and plays an important role in cell zzso and survival zzso zzso cancer is a lethal disease and is very resistant to chemotherapy, and zzso has been shown recently to assist in tumor cell zzso zzso zzso is an excellent potential target for zzso zzso We identified a novel small zzso inhibitor zzso zzso that we called zzso targeting the main zzso site of zzso and hypothesized that it would be an effective treatment strategy against human pancreatic zzso zzso specifically blocked zzso of zzso and total zzso of zzso It directly inhibited zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso increased pancreatic cancer cell detachment and inhibited cell zzso in a zzso zzso zzso effectively caused human pancreatic tumor zzso in zzso when administered alone and its effects were synergistic with zzso zzso This was accompanied by a decrease in zzso of zzso in the tumors treated with zzso Thus, targeting the zzso site of zzso in pancreatic cancer with the small zzso zzso zzso zzso is a potentially effective treatment strategy in this deadly zzso
