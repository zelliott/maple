zzso resistance is one of the main impediments to the successful treatment of colon zzso zzso zzso zzso which is related to zzso resistance zzso can reduce the level of zzso and can help cells escape from the zzso cell zzso However, the underlying mechanism is still zzso 

The cell proliferation and cell toxicity were measured with Cell Counting zzso zzso The zzso levels of zzso and zzso were detected by zzso reverse zzso amplification, the protein levels of zzso zzso and zzso proteins were indicated by Western zzso The zzso rates of cells were measured with flow zzso 

The relative zzso levels of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso levels of zzso were respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso complexes were respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso The protein levels of zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso rates of cells were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In conclusion, our research indicated that suppression of zzso restores the sensitivity of zzso resistance colon cancer cells to drug zzso
