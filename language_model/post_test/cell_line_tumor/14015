The objective of this study was to assess in zzso whether zzso zzso zzso acid bacteria cells and zzso of zzso cells could suppress the viability of human cancer cells and inhibit the zzso associated with zzso zzso 

Among the zzso the zzso cells of zzso zzso 606 and zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited the most profound zzso activity in all of the tested cell zzso zzso cells of zzso zzso 606 were determined to be less toxic to healthy human zzso zzso zzso zzso than were zzso cells of zzso zzso zzso zzso The soluble zzso from zzso zzso 606 evidenced the most effective zzso activity, but inhibited zzso cell growth by only zzso The soluble zzso from zzso zzso 606 were partly observed to induce zzso in the zzso cells by DNA fragmentation and zzso zzso zzso Both the zzso cells of zzso zzso 606 and the soluble zzso components of this strain also exhibited potent zzso zzso 

Our findings suggest that the soluble zzso fraction from zzso zzso 606 may constitute a novel zzso agent, which zzso a high degree of selectivity for human cancer cells and zzso agent in the food zzso 

These soluble zzso components from zzso may be applied to various foods, and used as zzso for cancer therapy and zzso
