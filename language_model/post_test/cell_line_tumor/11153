To study the molecular mechanism of differentiation induction by zzso zzso of myeloma cell zzso 

zzso induction effect on myeloma cell lines zzso zzso and zzso which were incubated with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was evaluated by cell zzso zzso zzso zzso of light chain zzso and the level of zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso caused zzso zzso and the zzso light chain zzso changes typical of differentiation in all the three myeloma cell zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso partially inhibited the differentiation of zzso zzso zzso cells induced by zzso whereas zzso zzso did the zzso After incubated with zzso zzso for 72 hours, zzso zzso zzso cells exhibited characteristic zzso feature of zzso The expression of zzso was increased statistically zzso zzso zzso Light chain zzso in the zzso was also increased statistically zzso zzso zzso After incubation with zzso zzso the level of zzso zzso was declined, while the level of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso could induce cell differentiation and zzso zzso zzso expression in myeloma cell zzso zzso could help zzso with inducing differentiation of myeloma cells through zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
