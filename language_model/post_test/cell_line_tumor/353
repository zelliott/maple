zzso oxide zzso is a potent zzso of hypoxic zzso zzso There have been many reports demonstrating zzso in zzso and in zzso by the use of NO donors to generate NO by chemical means or by producing agents that mimic the free radical zzso of NO for zzso zzso However, much of this work has been done without taking account of the zzso NO that is generated in tumor cells by NO zzso zzso in zzso or in tumor cells and host cells in solid tumors in zzso To evaluate the contribution of zzso generated NO to cellular zzso we exposed human zzso and zzso tumor cells to a zzso cocktail that results in an increase in cellular zzso expression to a level that is seen in many human solid zzso We also carried out parallel studies to determine the zzso of zzso and zzso cells engineered to zzso zzso the zzso zzso When cells are treated with zzso under zzso conditions zzso zzso there is up to a zzso increase in zzso zzso but no zzso NO is generated (since zzso is required for the generation of NO via the zzso conversion of zzso to zzso As a consequence, when these cells are zzso under hypoxic conditions, no zzso is zzso However, as the oxygen tension was increased, the amount of NO generated also increased, and we show that this NO then contributes to an overall increase in the zzso of zzso For example, at zzso zzso in control zzso cells, with little measurable zzso activity, the dose of radiation required to reduce survival by zzso was 6 zzso compared to 10 zzso in zzso zzso After zzso treatment, the level of NO generated at zzso zzso was significantly increased and the dose of radiation needed for zzso cell killing was reduced further to 4 zzso The presence of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso shortly before and during zzso zzso this increase in zzso confirming that the effect was due to the generation of zzso We conclude that zzso zzso of the zzso expression in tumor cells can produce sufficient NO to significantly increase the zzso effect of radiation and that this is particularly apparent at intermediate oxygen zzso
