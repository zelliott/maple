zzso growth factor zzso promotes cell growth and zzso and also increases zzso Multiple myeloma zzso cells produce zzso and the plasma concentration of zzso is significantly elevated in patients with clinically active zzso suggesting that zzso might play a role in the zzso of zzso zzso an zzso of zzso is structurally zzso to zzso and our previous report showed that zzso inhibited the proliferation of vascular zzso cells induced by zzso zzso The purposes of this study were to zzso the contribution of zzso to the growth of zzso cells as well as to investigate the possibility of the therapeutic use of zzso In zzso study showed that zzso protein stabilized the growth of zzso cell lines and regulated the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso was injected zzso into zzso mice bearing tumors derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited the growth of these tumors in zzso zzso examination revealed that zzso induced zzso of zzso cells, accompanied by a reduction in zzso in the zzso Thus, zzso inhibited the growth of zzso cells via zzso as well as direct zzso zzso The molecular targeting of zzso by zzso could be applied as a novel therapeutic approach to zzso
