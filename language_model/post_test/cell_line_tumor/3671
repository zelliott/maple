To investigate the zzso activity of zzso on zzso a human zzso zzso cell line in zzso and in zzso and to evaluate its possible use in zzso 

In zzso zzso activity of zzso was demonstrated by its induction of zzso in tumor zzso We analyzed cell proliferation with zzso zzso cell cycle with flow zzso DNA zzso with zzso on zzso zzso To test the mechanism of zzso zzso Western zzso was used to investigate the factors involved in this zzso The zzso study of zzso was tested by high phase liquid zzso In in zzso study, zzso nude mice were incubated with zzso zzso zzso was injected zzso every other day into tumor bearing zzso nude zzso 

Our results showed that zzso induced zzso of zzso cells in a zzso and zzso zzso At zzso zzso for 48 zzso zzso induced zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso study demonstrated that, zzso could be absorbed quickly by zzso injection, and maintained in plasma for more than 10 zzso In nude mice bearing zzso zzso zzso displayed zzso activity by zzso tumor growth and zzso the lifespan of tumor bearing zzso 

With its few toxicity to normal cells and potent zzso activity in zzso and in zzso zzso might be a potential chemotherapy candidate in treating human zzso zzso
