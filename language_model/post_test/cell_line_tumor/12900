Changes in DNA zzso of crucial cancer genes including tumor zzso can occur early in zzso being potentially important early indicators of zzso The objective of this study was to examine a zzso approach to assess the zzso of tumor zzso genes as tumor zzso and clinical outcome zzso zzso for lung zzso 

A zzso probe panel interrogated DNA for zzso zzso status in 18 tumor zzso genes in lung cancer using a zzso multiplex zzso probe amplification zzso zzso Lung cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso and primary lung tumors zzso zzso zzso were examined using zzso 

Genes frequently zzso in lung cancer cell lines including zzso zzso zzso were found among the most commonly zzso in the lung tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified as novel tumor zzso candidates zzso in lung zzso The most frequently zzso genes in lung tumors were zzso and zzso (both zzso zzso rates for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were significantly different between zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was significantly associated with the extent of the disease when comparing localized versus zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were significantly associated with overall zzso 

zzso can be used for zzso of certain types of lung tumors and clinical outcome zzso This latter is clinically relevant by offering an adjunct strategy for the clinical management of lung cancer zzso
