To study the effect of zzso zzso on the cell cycle of human gastric cancer cell lines zzso and zzso 

Cell proliferation was evaluated by zzso blue dye exclusion zzso zzso zzso was observed under a transmission electron zzso Changes of cell cycle and zzso zzso of cells were determined by flow zzso zzso of zzso gene was examined using zzso and zzso 

The growth of zzso and zzso cells was inhibited by zzso The zzso zzso against 50% cells zzso at 24 h and 48 h were 54 zzso and 23 zzso for zzso and 61 zzso and 37 zzso for zzso Typical zzso bodies and zzso zzso were observed 24 h after cells were treated with ST at a concentration of 200 zzso The percentage of cells at zzso phase was decreased and that of cells at zzso was increased significantly in the group treated with ST at the zzso of 40 zzso 60 zzso 100 zzso for 24 zzso compared with the control group ( zzso The expression levels of zzso gene in both zzso and zzso cells were markedly zzso after treatment with zzso 

ST can cause arrest of gastric cancer cells at zzso phase, which may be one of the mechanisms that inhibit cell proliferation and cause zzso in these zzso Effect of ST on cells at zzso phase may be attributed to the zzso of zzso zzso
