zzso protein zzso family members zzso zzso and zzso are zzso of the zzso and key players in orchestrating the cellular response to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was shown to have a role in regulating zzso zzso protein zzso We previously found that zzso cell zzso zzso cells exposed to zzso displayed the zzso zzso of zzso zzso which is critical for the zzso regulation of specific downstream zzso and zzso and is likely to zzso the zzso of SCC zzso However, SCC cells expressing zzso became more zzso We also found that zzso forms complexes with a number of proteins involved in cell death response through regulation of cell cycle arrest, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here, we showed that zzso induced zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso in zzso SCC cells, while zzso increased a zzso of zzso zzso and zzso genes in zzso SCC zzso We report that the zzso regulatory mechanisms implicated in the zzso of plethora of zzso including zzso acid, zzso zzso and zzso zzso thereby affect tumor cell response to zzso cell death, suggesting that the zzso zzso zzso plays a role in the resistance of tumor cells to platinum zzso
