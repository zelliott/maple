zzso is widely used to treat various human zzso However, it is difficult to achieve a sufficient zzso effect because of dosage limitation to prevent zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso would reduce zzso and improve the zzso zzso zzso comprises zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso block zzso through an zzso zzso zzso The zzso forms a zzso structure of zzso zzso in diameter in an zzso zzso zzso zzso 15 zzso and zzso (10 zzso were given zzso three times to mice bearing zzso or liver zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was evaluated by zzso in zzso mice that were given zzso (10 zzso or zzso (10 zzso in nine doses over 12 zzso zzso showed a significantly potent zzso effect against zzso zzso tumors compared with zzso Moreover, zzso also produced a significantly longer survival rate than zzso against the liver zzso tumor of zzso With respect to zzso zzso mice showed significant zzso in fractional zzso and ejection zzso In contrast, cardiac functions of zzso treated mice were no less well maintained than in control zzso This study warrants a clinical evaluation of zzso in patients with zzso zzso or other zzso
