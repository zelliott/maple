Recently, it has been demonstrated that zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso can be engineered to form zzso zzso In this work zzso structural zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso have been zzso to form zzso sites in order to probe the effect of engineering on structural integrity and zzso stability of zzso as well as on binding to the zzso zzso A, zzso and zzso zzso The zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso binding to human zzso zzso was introduced into zzso CD and/or zzso zzso and single and double zzso were zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso binding of engineered zzso was tested using both binding to coated zzso zzso in zzso or to zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso Additionally, blocking of zzso cell zzso to zzso was zzso The data presented in this report demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso can be grafted on the zzso zzso of zzso without zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso differences between the investigated zzso in structural stability and zzso binding are discussed with respect to the known structure of zzso and its structural zzso
