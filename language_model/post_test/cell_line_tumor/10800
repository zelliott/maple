zzso zzso zzso is the only de zzso source of zzso zzso for DNA synthesis and zzso Drugs targeting zzso protein are a mainstay in cancer treatment, but zzso effects and toxicity limit their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso contribute to an alternative zzso pathway, by salvaging zzso from the tumor zzso and may zzso resistance to zzso zzso Combined zzso of these zzso is an attractive strategy to enhance cancer zzso We have shown previously that zzso zzso enhanced tumor cell sensitivity to zzso drugs in zzso and in zzso Because both zzso and zzso contribute to increased cellular zzso we hypothesized that zzso mediate resistance to the capacity of zzso small interfering zzso zzso to sensitize tumor cells to zzso zzso zzso We assessed the effects of targeting zzso or zzso with zzso alone and in combination with zzso targeting zzso and/or zzso targeting drugs on tumor cell zzso zzso of zzso with zzso enhanced the capacity of zzso zzso to sensitize tumor cells to traditional zzso zzso drugs zzso zzso and zzso The zzso was greater than that observed in response to any zzso used alone and was specific to drugs targeting zzso zzso of zzso in response to combined zzso and zzso zzso suggests that zzso zzso may be zzso useful in combination with these zzso zzso may be useful targets for cancer therapy when combined with molecules targeting zzso zzso and zzso zzso
