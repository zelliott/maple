The orphan nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha is a downstream zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in the regulation of genes important for zzso zzso zzso zzso is also a potent zzso of the zzso program required for zzso zzso and in particular of the key zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We report here that the regulatory sequences of the zzso gene harbor a functional zzso binding zzso However, in contrast to the zzso effects of zzso and zzso on zzso gene zzso zzso acts as a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression by small interfering zzso leads to reduced binding of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and an increase in promoter occupancy by zzso suggesting that part of the zzso function at this gene is to antagonize the action of zzso In agreement with the in zzso studies, animals that lack zzso show increased expression of zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso but decreased expression of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso beta and zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso has opposing effects on genes important for zzso zzso capacity and zzso The different functions of zzso in the regulation of these pathways suggest that enhancing zzso activity could have beneficial effects on zzso metabolism in diabetic subjects by two distinct zzso increasing zzso zzso capacity in peripheral zzso and liver, and suppressing zzso zzso zzso
