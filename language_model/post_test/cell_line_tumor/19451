The second zzso zzso acts via protein zzso A zzso to induce zzso by mechanisms that are poorly zzso Here, we assessed a role for zzso and analyzed gene expression in zzso zzso by comparing zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and the zzso zzso zzso zzso which lacks zzso zzso but has zzso levels of zzso activity and zzso zzso growth zzso Treatment of zzso but not zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso for 24 h induced loss of zzso membrane potential, zzso release of zzso c and zzso and increase in zzso zzso Gene expression analysis zzso zzso 430 zzso zzso revealed that zzso and zzso cells incubated with zzso have similar, but zzso zzso of zzso gene expression at 2 h zzso 800 zzso and 6 h zzso 1000 zzso zzso zzso 2, p zzso zzso by contrast, at 24 zzso approximately zzso and approximately zzso transcripts were changed in zzso and zzso cells, zzso Using an approach that combined zzso analysis, zzso and functional zzso to identify transcripts that showed differential expression between zzso and zzso cells, we found differences in zzso regulation of zzso involved in zzso repression, zzso the cell cycle, zzso zzso zzso and zzso The two cell lines differed in zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and expression of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso early zzso and in zzso expression of genes in the inhibitor of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The findings indicate that zzso zzso of zzso cells occurs via zzso events and imply that such zzso involves gene networks in multiple zzso zzso
