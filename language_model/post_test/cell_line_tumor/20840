To investigate the zzso effect of zzso injection on zzso tumors of human gastric zzso cell line zzso cells in nude mice and explore its zzso 

zzso models of human gastric zzso cell line zzso cells in nude mice were zzso They were divided at random into three groups as control group, zzso group and high-dose zzso The zzso solution at concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 75 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were injected to the mice in zzso group and high-dose group, respectively, and zzso sodium zzso was injected to the mice of control group per day for 10 days zzso The mice of the three groups were sacrificed at 11th day after the first injection of zzso The tumor weight of the sacrificed mice was zzso zzso and zzso examinations of the tumors were carried out by light and electron zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was detected by zzso 

zzso injection showed a zzso effect on the growth of zzso tumors in the nude zzso The tumor growth zzso rates were zzso and zzso in the zzso and high-dose groups, zzso The zzso study demonstrated that tumor cells displayed a typical appearance of zzso The expression of zzso was zzso while zzso zzso and zzso were zzso 

zzso can markedly inhibit the growth of zzso human gastric zzso in nude zzso It was due, at least in part, to the induction of zzso in cancer zzso
