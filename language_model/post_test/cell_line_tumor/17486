zzso family zzso factors are integral components of zzso signaling pathways and have been implicated in cell cycle regulation, zzso zzso and zzso zzso It was noted previously that zzso loss and loss of expression of zzso are zzso involved in gastric zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso is zzso by zzso DNA zzso in approximately zzso of lung cancer cell lines and zzso of primary lung cancer zzso zzso zzso is zzso since it is not observed in surrounding normal lung zzso Our results suggest that loss of zzso expression by DNA zzso is frequently associated with the evolution of lung zzso
