zzso interference is a powerful tool for zzso zzso of gene zzso However, efficient and safe in zzso delivery of short interfering zzso zzso to the target organ, which is essential for therapeutic applications, has not been zzso In this study we used zzso zzso zzso which has its own zzso transport zzso to most of the zzso as a carrier zzso of zzso in zzso The zzso was zzso bound to the zzso strand of zzso zzso at the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was designed to be zzso by zzso producing a mature form of zzso zzso after releasing zzso The zzso zzso group of zzso associated with zzso activity, was zzso Using this new zzso intravenous injection of 2 zzso of zzso targeting zzso B zzso achieved efficient reduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was confirmed by the zzso of zzso droplets in the liver as a zzso Neither induction of zzso zzso nor other overt side effects were revealed by zzso and pathological zzso These findings indicate that zzso is effective and safe for zzso zzso gene zzso in zzso
