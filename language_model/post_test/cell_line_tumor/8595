zzso acid is a classic zzso zzso zzso Although salicylic acid also zzso zzso injury, the mechanism of its zzso activity is not well zzso In this study, by using a zzso affinity zzso scheme with salicylic zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso in zzso was identified as a new molecular target of salicylic zzso Moreover, the zzso structure of the zzso acid complex was zzso zzso and zzso studies showed that salicylic acid binds to the zzso interface of zzso in two possible zzso and zzso its zzso zzso zzso analysis confirmed that zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid zzso located at the zzso zzso are directly involved in salicylic acid zzso On a gel zzso column, salicylic acid caused a shift in the zzso profile of zzso indicating that its zzso change is induced by salicylic acid zzso In cultured human cells, salicylic acid treatment or zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso whereas salicylic acid did not exert its zzso effect in zzso zzso zzso zzso salicylic acid treatment or zzso zzso inhibited zzso synthesis in zzso zzso zzso the salicylic zzso effect in zzso was partially rescued by zzso zzso Taken together, these findings illustrate that zzso is responsible for salicylic zzso zzso of zzso zzso which may contribute to its zzso and zzso zzso This study establishes a novel aspect of the complex pharmacological effects of salicylic zzso
