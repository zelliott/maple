The present study aims to establish a method that provides fast, precise and zzso zzso zzso parameters of zzso zzso The method should discriminate between zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso were injected in the tail vein of nude zzso At regular time zzso 5 zzso whole blood samples were taken from the tail zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso as well as zzso of their respective zzso zzso were determined by sandwich zzso zzso This detection system measures changes in the plasma resonance angle caused by the interaction of zzso on zzso zzso We determined as a first measure the binding of zzso or zzso to their respective zzso zzso or zzso As a second measure we determined the amount of CM on the zzso zzso This was done by determination of changes in plasma resonance angle after binding of an zzso zzso 

zzso zzso resonance allowed detection of both zzso in blood of mice in a range of zzso zzso zzso Due to the precision of the sampling and detection methods, zzso values of each zzso were determined in individual zzso zzso bound to zzso was eliminated faster than the zzso zzso The presence of a zzso zzso in mice reduced the plasma levels of the zzso zzso but not of the zzso zzso 

Using small blood samples from a zzso the sandwich zzso resonance method provided zzso of zzso and information about the stability of the linkage in zzso zzso between the zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso mice suggested that retention of the zzso in zzso tissue due to zzso targeting could be deduced from the plasma zzso
