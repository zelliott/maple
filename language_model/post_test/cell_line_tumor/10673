In a zzso screen of novel zzso agents, the hit compound zzso which bears a zzso scaffold, exhibited zzso zzso activities against a panel of tumor cell zzso The promising in zzso zzso activity and structural novelty of zzso prompted us to investigate the synthesis of five zzso of zzso and test their zzso zzso The most potent zzso zzso exhibited enhanced zzso activities compared with the parent zzso and exhibited an zzso value against zzso cells of zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso for the positive control zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso significant levels of zzso in zzso cells in zzso at low zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso based on its zzso scaffold may constitute a novel class of zzso agents, which deserve further zzso
