zzso zzso zzso is the phenomenon zzso cells exposed to radiation doses of less than approximately zzso zzso exhibit increased cell killing relative to that predicted from zzso high-dose survival data using a zzso zzso While the exact mechanism remains to be zzso the involvement of several molecular repair pathways has been zzso These processes in turn are also associated with the response of cells to zzso zzso zzso We propose a model in which the level of zzso cell killing is determined by the efficiency of both zzso repair by the DNA repair zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso repair by the DNA mismatch repair zzso zzso We therefore hypothesized that the response of cells to low doses of radiation is dependent on the expression status of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein expression signatures were determined in a panel of normal zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso prostate cell lines and correlated with zzso survival and cell cycle zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso were associated with zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso negative cell lines lacked expression of at least one zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso had no significant effect on cell zzso These results indicate a possible role for zzso processing of damage produced by low doses of zzso
