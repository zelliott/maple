The tendency of tumor cells to disperse throughout the liver is a distinct feature of zzso zzso zzso zzso family zzso proteins function to regulate zzso zzso reorganization that leads to cell zzso We previously found that Max binding protein zzso was zzso expressed in zzso and zzso with zzso by zzso zzso is a protein member of the zzso network which plays roles in cell zzso zzso and zzso We investigated the effects of zzso on migration of human liver cancer zzso cells to study the migration regulatory role of zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso between zzso and zzso was further validated in zzso cells by zzso down zzso and zzso zzso specific to zzso zzso zzso were used to zzso zzso zzso Western zzso zzso zzso were used to determine the migration potential of zzso 

zzso between zzso and zzso was validated in zzso zzso zzso zzso promoted the migration of human liver cancer zzso cells zzso zzso zzso 

The results suggest that zzso via interaction with zzso zzso zzso cell zzso
