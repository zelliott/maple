zzso is zzso in liver zzso during severe zzso zzso C and zzso zzso zzso is involved in both these zzso We therefore examined the zzso effect of zzso on zzso cells and human zzso in zzso together with the underlying zzso We first measured zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso by an zzso zzso or by zzso zzso zzso We then focused on the pathways involved in zzso zzso and the role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso was expressed on both cell types, and zzso was activated by zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso inhibited this zzso zzso induced zzso of both zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso ( zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced the zzso membrane potential, activated Bid and zzso and zzso zzso 3, 8, and 9 zzso zzso blockade inhibited zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso was unaffected when zzso cells and zzso were cultured with zzso and zzso zzso blockade failed to inhibit zzso zzso These results show that zzso zzso zzso of human zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso membrane potential, and increased zzso zzso independently of the zzso zzso zzso might thus contribute to the progression of severe liver graft zzso
