zzso is frequently used in the therapy of zzso In DNA, zzso zzso like zzso the formation of zzso which are commonly accepted as being responsible for the zzso of platinum zzso The detection of zzso DNA zzso formation and repair could be a good measure of assessing how a patient is responding to the zzso In this study, we used a validated modification of the alkaline comet zzso for detecting the presence of these zzso in zzso and in cancer zzso The zzso zzso cell line was treated in zzso with a range of zzso and zzso doses, and the subsequent zzso formation and repair compared between the two zzso In addition, zzso from cancer patients undergoing zzso chemotherapy were zzso for the formation and repair of zzso zzso A zzso was observed in the in zzso samples, with zzso producing more zzso than zzso at zzso zzso and zzso induced by both agents showing different repair zzso Furthermore, evidence of zzso formation and repair was observed in the peripheral blood zzso of all cancer patients zzso along with the detection of zzso zzso in zzso formation and repair zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that zzso DNA zzso have been detected either in zzso or in patient samples using the alkaline comet zzso Due to its sensitivity, zzso small cell sample and low cost, the alkaline comet zzso is a good method for the detection of zzso zzso and their subsequent repair and, in future clinical studies, could prove to be a valuable tool in zzso a patient's response to zzso
