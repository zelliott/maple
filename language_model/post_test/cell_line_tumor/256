zzso zzso in transgenic mice results in a zzso disorder that closely resembles human chronic zzso leukemia zzso It has been reported that zzso of zzso expression is a universal phenomenon in patients with zzso due zzso DNA zzso of its zzso Based on this, we studied zzso and gene expression levels of zzso in zzso We analyzed the zzso status of the zzso gene in 6 cell lines and in 102 patients with zzso using several zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was analyzed using real-time zzso and gene expression zzso zzso zzso was not observed in any of the cell lines zzso and only in zzso of patients with zzso Despite the lack of zzso zzso zzso was expressed at low levels both in zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso range zzso to zzso and in patients with zzso in zzso phase zzso zzso zzso zzso range zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, we evaluated zzso expression in 82 additional patients with zzso by gene expression zzso We found that zzso was significantly zzso in advanced phase zzso in contrast to chronic phase zzso zzso log ratio difference in expression zzso zzso Overall, our results indicate that zzso expression is zzso in advanced phase zzso through a mechanism independent from DNA zzso
