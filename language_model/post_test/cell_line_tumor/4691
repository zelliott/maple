zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways are important for the survival and proliferation of prostate cancer zzso Because zzso activity is facilitated by distinct zzso factors and complexes, it is conceivable that some of these proteins might also play a role in promoting prostate zzso The zzso zzso complex is an important zzso for a broad range of regulatory zzso factors including zzso yet its role in prostate cancer is zzso Here, we used zzso interference to knock down the expression of two integral zzso zzso zzso and zzso in prostate cancer zzso zzso plays a particularly important role in zzso signaling in that it serves as a direct binding target for zzso We found that the zzso of either zzso markedly decreases zzso from zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso as well as zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso target zzso We show for the first time that loss of either zzso or zzso in prostate cancer cells significantly decreases both zzso and zzso cellular zzso zzso cell cycle zzso and increases zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso is zzso in both zzso and zzso prostate cancer cells lines, as well as in 50% (10 of zzso of the clinically localized human prostate zzso we zzso thus suggesting that zzso zzso may have implications in prostate zzso In sum, our data suggest that zzso plays an important zzso role in prostate cancer cell proliferation and survival, and therefore, may represent a new target for therapeutic zzso
