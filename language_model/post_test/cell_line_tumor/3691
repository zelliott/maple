zzso is an important animal model for studying human zzso B virus zzso zzso Within the zzso network, zzso zzso plays an important role in immune responses that may lead to viral zzso To further understand zzso zzso biology, we cloned and characterized the zzso gene from white blood zzso The complete zzso zzso gene is about 7 zzso and consists of five zzso and four zzso The zzso gene organization of the zzso is similar to those of the human, zzso and zzso Also several elements are highly zzso in the 300 zzso promoter region of the zzso zzso including a nuclear factor zzso B zzso binding zzso The zzso zzso gene encodes a zzso of zzso zzso acids in a precursor form and 189 zzso acids in the mature zzso The expressed protein was 23 zzso according to zzso To demonstrate zzso activity, we expressed zzso zzso and showed that the zzso zzso protein induced terminal zzso as reflected by zzso of zzso zzso zzso and substantially inhibited proliferation of zzso cells, a zzso zzso leukemia cell zzso The zzso effect of zzso zzso on zzso cells was blocked by an zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso activity is specifically zzso by signaling through the zzso zzso zzso Cloning of the zzso zzso gene and demonstrating zzso activity of the gene product will facilitate studies of human zzso B virus using the zzso zzso
