This work is focused on the development of a plant zzso carrier system for cargo delivery, specifically zzso zzso mosaic virus zzso Whereas previous reports described the engineering of zzso through genetic or chemical zzso we report a zzso infusion technique that zzso efficient cargo zzso zzso and retention of zzso fluorescent dye molecules per zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso orange zzso zzso as well as 140 copies of therapeutic payload zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso is achieved through interaction of the cargo with the zzso zzso zzso zzso The loading mechanism is zzso empty zzso zzso zzso could not be zzso zzso zzso zzso remain chemically active, and surface zzso zzso were zzso modified with zzso leading to the development of zzso zzso carrier zzso We demonstrate zzso to a panel of cancer cells zzso breast, and zzso zzso zzso enter cells via the surface marker zzso the zzso target the zzso where the carrier is zzso and the cargo is released allowing imaging and/or cell zzso In conclusion, we demonstrate zzso and delivery to zzso the methods discussed provide a useful means for zzso of zzso toward its application as drug and/or contrast agent delivery zzso
