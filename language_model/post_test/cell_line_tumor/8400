zzso contain aggressive zzso cancer, and zzso rate remains an important factor in zzso Currently, zzso zzso using orally administered zzso acid zzso has proved to be beneficial in improving the prognosis of patients with zzso zzso is zzso to zzso IX zzso that accumulates selectively in the tumor and exhibits strong zzso upon zzso but zzso cells do not always respond to zzso which can result in incomplete or excessive zzso Several possible mechanisms for this phenomenon have been suggested, but they remain poorly zzso To clarify the probable mechanisms underlying the variable induction of zzso and to improve zzso surgery, the authors searched for key negative regulators of fluorescent signal induced by zzso 

A comprehensive gene expression analysis was performed using zzso in 11 pairs of tumor zzso zzso and zzso tumors, and screened genes zzso specifically in zzso tumors as the possible candidates for key negative regulators of zzso zzso The most possible candidate was selected through zzso analysis in combination with a comparison of expression levels, and the relevance of expression of the selected gene to zzso zzso in tumor zzso was confirmed in the zzso expression zzso The biological significance of an identified gene in zzso zzso and zzso zzso was evaluated by in zzso zzso zzso intensity analysis and in zzso zzso zzso molecular imaging in 4 human zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses using a specific small interfering zzso in zzso cells was also performed to determine the mechanisms of action and genes working as partners in the zzso zzso zzso 

The authors chose 251 zzso that showed remarkably high expression only in zzso tumors zzso intensity of expression signal zzso zzso and eventually the zzso 13 gene zzso was selected as the most possible zzso of zzso fluorescent signal in zzso The mean expression level of zzso in the zzso zzso was statistically higher than that in positive ones zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso expression enhanced the zzso image and increased the amount of zzso zzso over controls zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells treated with zzso Comprehensive gene expression analysis of the zzso zzso cells demonstrated another two genes possibly involved in the zzso zzso zzso cassette zzso zzso significantly decreased in the zzso zzso while zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso 

The zzso 13 gene might play a role in the zzso zzso zzso and act as a negative regulator of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Although further studies to clarify the mechanisms of action in the zzso zzso zzso would be zzso the results of this study might lead to a novel fluorescent marker able to overcome the obstacles of existing zzso zzso and improve the limited zzso zzso
