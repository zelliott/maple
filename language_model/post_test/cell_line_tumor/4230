A contributing factor to the emergence of zzso resistant prostate cancer zzso is the ability of the tumor to circumvent low circulating levels of testosterone during zzso deprivation therapy zzso through the production of zzso zzso zzso from precursors including cholesterol and zzso zzso As these processes promote zzso signaling and prostate cancer progression their zzso is required for disease prevention and zzso 

We evaluated the involvement of the vitamin D zzso zzso zzso in the regulation of genes with a role in zzso metabolism using the zzso dependent cell lines zzso and zzso zzso regulation of zzso metabolism was assessed using zzso zzso promoter zzso western zzso zzso activity zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso induced significant expression of genes involved in zzso metabolism in prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso significant regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Data revealed potent regulation of zzso at the level of zzso protein expression and zzso activity, with zzso identified as the zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity using the specific inhibitor zzso resulted in zzso of the zzso response of zzso zzso in prostate cancer zzso Mass zzso revealed that zzso of zzso protein in prostate cancer cells resulted in a significant increase in the zzso zzso of testosterone and zzso to their zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

These data highlight a potential application of zzso therapies for the reduction of zzso zzso within the tumor zzso
