Technologies are now available enabling saliva to be used to diagnose disease, predict disease zzso and monitor therapeutic zzso This pilot study describes the use of zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso to detect putative breast cancer markers in zzso 

zzso specimens were analyzed as either pooled cancer saliva zzso or individual specimens from healthy women and women diagnosed with zzso of the zzso The specimens were applied to a variety of protein chip zzso washed extensively to remove zzso zzso and analyzed on a zzso mass zzso 

The results of this initial study suggest that the zzso protein chip array prepared and washed at pH zzso yielded the most promising zzso Additionally, the analyses revealed a number of proteins that were higher in intensity among the cancer subjects when compared with zzso These zzso proteins were present at the 18, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso ranges using zzso zzso 

The study suggests that saliva may be useful for zzso zzso zzso
