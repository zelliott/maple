zzso human zzso zzso represent the most common sexually transmitted agents and are classified into low or high risk by their propensity to cause zzso warts or cervical cancer, zzso zzso zzso against zzso may be a useful adjunct to the newly licensed zzso zzso A main objective in the development of novel zzso is to block zzso entry into zzso cells through cell surface zzso zzso zzso In this study, selective chemical modification of the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso was integrated with innovative zzso and biological zzso to prepare a collection of zzso zzso derivatives with a backbone structure resembling the zzso zzso precursor and to test them for their zzso zzso Surface zzso resonance zzso revealed that zzso zzso with a high degree of zzso zzso and zzso zzso with a high zzso or low zzso zzso degree, but not unmodified zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with low levels of zzso prevented the interaction between zzso zzso and immobilized zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Their 50% zzso concentration was between zzso and zzso zzso without evidence of zzso These findings provide insights into the design of novel, safe, and zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso
