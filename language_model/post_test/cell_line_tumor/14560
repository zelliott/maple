zzso is a ubiquitous protein involved in cellular zzso zzso zzso and zzso of a few zzso resistance zzso Its role in resistance to zzso in zzso and zzso zzso cells was zzso Using zzso zzso to zzso the zzso zzso we showed that zzso zzso did not affect the capacity of zzso cells to zzso drugs since zzso zzso was insufficient to significantly reduce zzso production in these cells, and zzso the expression of 11 zzso genes measured by zzso was significantly zzso Interestingly, six of these genes zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins whose expression was higher in zzso producing than in zzso zzso zzso Fluorescence zzso confirmed this new zzso role of zzso which is strengthened by a significantly reduced zzso c zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso
