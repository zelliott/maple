zzso severely restricts the clinical treatment of zzso zzso zzso zzso evidence demonstrates that zzso expression of zzso zzso contributes to cancer progression and sensitivity to zzso zzso we aimed to identify zzso associated with zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso compared to its parental cells, was screened by zzso sequencing technology and determined by quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction analysis zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to predict the downstream target genes of zzso Then, functional and mechanical analyses of zzso in zzso zzso were performed by zzso and zzso of zzso in zzso cells and its parental zzso Finally, the clinical significance of zzso and zzso was investigated in zzso zzso 

Our data reveal that the expression of zzso is significantly decreased in zzso cells compared to its parental cells, and zzso is predicted to be the downstream target of zzso Both zzso and zzso of zzso following zzso result in zzso zzso and protein changes of zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells and its parental zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso are significantly correlated with advanced clinical stages of zzso and this inverse expression pattern is also observed in zzso zzso before and after zzso 

The present study reveals that zzso contributes to the zzso of zzso by regulating the zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso are potential zzso for zzso in zzso which may serve as valuable targets for reversing zzso in the management of zzso
