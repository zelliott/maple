zzso zzso and zzso are a family of zzso zzso which have been found to be zzso in a variety of zzso zzso and solid zzso zzso were discovered as a novel class of zzso zzso that zzso inhibit all three zzso zzso with zzso to low single-digit zzso zzso values and exhibit excellent selectivity against a panel of diverse zzso zzso crystal structures of the bound zzso complexes of zzso zzso zzso code zzso zzso zzso code zzso and zzso zzso code zzso were determined and used to guide zzso zzso Multiple compounds exhibited potent zzso activity in zzso and zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso For example, compound zzso inhibited the growth of zzso cells with an zzso value of zzso zzso and showed zzso values of 2, 3, and zzso zzso against zzso zzso and zzso zzso These novel zzso zzso zzso efficiently interrupted the zzso of Bad in both zzso and zzso cell lines, indicating that their potent biological activities are zzso The zzso of zzso was studied in zzso mice and shown to exhibit zzso of zzso after oral zzso zzso profiling of zzso suggested a long zzso in both human and mouse liver zzso good zzso modest protein zzso and no zzso zzso below 20 zzso zzso
