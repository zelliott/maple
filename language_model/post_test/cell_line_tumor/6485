zzso binding protein is a cell adhesive protein whose level of expression has been correlated with zzso potential in many different tumor zzso The purpose of this investigation was to examine zzso expression in prostate cancer and to determine a possible role for zzso in cancer zzso 

zzso expression in prostate cell lines and tissue samples was evaluated by zzso zzso in cell lines was also evaluated by Western zzso analysis and real-time zzso zzso of zzso by zzso was evaluated by zzso 

Some of the human prostate cell lines studied expressed zzso zzso was zzso in zzso of prostate cancer tumor samples, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of normal zzso zzso was also shown to induce zzso expression in the prostate cell line, zzso 

These data demonstrate that zzso is zzso in a large fraction of zzso zzso The fact that zzso can induce expression of zzso indicates a possible role for zzso in cancer progression and zzso This suggests that zzso zzso may be a useful marker for examining prostate cancer zzso
