Free fatty acids zzso induce zzso zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the cellular processes by which zzso engages the core zzso machinery during zzso especially zzso of zzso zzso remain incompletely zzso Thus, our aim was to determine whether zzso mediates induction of zzso proteins during zzso zzso The saturated zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso zzso an increase in zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso induction of zzso was zzso in primary zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was inhibited by a dominant negative zzso and direct binding of a zzso zzso containing the zzso protein 1 complex to the zzso promoter was identified by zzso mobility shift zzso and a zzso zzso zzso Short hairpin zzso zzso of zzso attenuated zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, and cell zzso Similarly, the genetic zzso of zzso rendered zzso zzso resistant to zzso zzso expression was also increased in liver biopsy specimens from patients with zzso zzso as compared with patients with simple zzso or zzso zzso the data zzso zzso zzso expression as a mechanism contributing to zzso zzso
