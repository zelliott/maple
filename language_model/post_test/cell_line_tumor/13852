The zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in brain areas that regulate energy zzso and body zzso In contrast with peripheral zzso however, the impact of insulin on zzso plasma membrane zzso zzso in zzso is not zzso In this study, we examined the role of two zzso hormones zzso and zzso on zzso zzso in a human zzso cell line that express zzso insulin and zzso zzso We show that insulin and zzso both induce zzso zzso to the PM of zzso cells and activate zzso zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso totally abolished zzso and zzso zzso zzso and stimulation of zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso is a zzso zzso mechanism in zzso zzso Next, we investigated the impact of chronic insulin and zzso treatments on zzso expression and zzso zzso exposure of zzso cells to insulin or zzso zzso zzso proteins and zzso levels and zzso the acute stimulation of zzso zzso in response to acute insulin or zzso In addition, chronic treatment with either insulin or zzso impaired zzso zzso A zzso between insulin and zzso was apparent, where exposure to insulin affects zzso zzso zzso and vice zzso This zzso could be attributed to the increase in zzso of zzso zzso zzso which was demonstrated in response to each zzso These results provide evidence to suggest that zzso zzso to zzso PM is regulated by both insulin and zzso signaling zzso These pathways might contribute to an in zzso zzso zzso involving a zzso network and to the zzso effect of insulin and zzso
