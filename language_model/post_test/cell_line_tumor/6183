A relationship between the increased density of zzso zzso zzso and decreased survival was recently reported in zzso cancer zzso Among these tumors, zzso zzso cancer zzso is one of the most aggressive solid tumors in zzso zzso zzso zzso have been recognized as promoting tumor zzso The purpose of our study was to analyze with zzso the presence of zzso in a series of 27 zzso 

Several zzso markers such as zzso zzso complex zzso zzso and CD 68 were zzso zzso showed that zzso represent more than 50% of zzso cells in all zzso Moreover, these markers allowed the identification of zzso thin zzso zzso zzso bestowing a zzso appearance on these cells which we termed zzso zzso zzso In contrast, cancer cells were totally zzso Cellular zzso was highly simplified since apart from cancer cells and blood vessels, zzso were the only other cellular zzso zzso were evenly distributed and zzso with cancer cells, and were in direct contact with other zzso via their zzso Moreover, zzso displayed strong zzso for zzso zzso Long chains of interconnected zzso arose from zzso clusters and were dispersed within the tumor zzso When zzso the zzso zzso zzso was found in zzso and blood vessels, but rarely in cancer zzso 

zzso display a very dense network of interconnected zzso in direct contact with zzso cancer zzso To our knowledge this is the first time that such a network is described in a zzso zzso This network was found in all our studied cases and appeared specific to zzso since it was not found in differentiated zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso network is directly related to the aggressiveness of the disease via zzso and zzso functions which remain to be zzso
