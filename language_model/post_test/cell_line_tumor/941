The zzso zzso has been recognized as an important second zzso implicated in regulating diverse signaling pathways especially for zzso Very little is known, however, about the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso cell death induced by zzso In the present study, we first demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso cell death in zzso zzso zzso The cell death was accompanied by several specific features characteristic of zzso presence of numerous zzso zzso in the zzso development of the zzso zzso zzso zzso membrane association of zzso protein light chain 3 zzso and a marked increase in expression levels of two forms of zzso protein zzso and zzso We additionally demonstrate that zzso decreases zzso membrane potential and activates the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in increased expression levels of its zzso and protein in zzso zzso zzso Moreover, tumor cells zzso with zzso gene undergo zzso in the absence of zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso cell death in zzso zzso cells via zzso of zzso This study adds a new concept to characterize the pathways by which zzso acts to induce zzso zzso cell death in zzso zzso
