The soluble zzso and zzso zzso forms of human respiratory zzso virus zzso attachment protein were zzso by zzso zzso from cultures of zzso cells infected with zzso virus zzso expressing either zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso which is zzso into the culture zzso remains zzso whereas zzso is an zzso probably a zzso Nevertheless, zzso was capable of binding to the surface of cells in zzso as assessed by a flow zzso binding zzso The attachment of zzso to cells was inhibited by previous zzso treatment of living cells, and zzso did not bind to zzso cell zzso defective in zzso zzso Thus, zzso as previously reported for the G protein of intact zzso binds to zzso presented at the cell surface as zzso zzso of a previously reported zzso binding domain from zzso protein substantially inhibited its ability to bind to cells, but the remaining level of binding was still sensitive to zzso treatment, suggesting that other regions of the zzso zzso may contribute to attachment to zzso The significance of these results for zzso infection is zzso
