The targeted delivery of zzso labeled, zzso proteins into cellular zzso permits investigation of DNA damage and zzso function in living zzso zzso available protein delivery zzso cannot provide selective zzso transportation and primarily unload their cargo in the zzso Here we describe a simple approach for specific zzso transportation of zzso zzso protein based on its zzso The delivered protein can be observed and monitored by zzso zzso The technique is zzso and zzso It can be useful in live cell zzso
