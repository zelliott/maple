We explored the nature of the zzso cell in zzso a bone zzso that predominately occurs in zzso Previously, we observed expression of zzso an zzso zzso regulator, in zzso cell cultures and zzso To examine the relationship between zzso and zzso cells from an zzso biopsy zzso were zzso zzso with a zzso containing the human zzso promoter driving a green fluorescent protein zzso reporter to generate the transgenic line zzso In culture, only approximately zzso of the zzso cells were capable of zzso the transgenic zzso zzso yet, zzso tumors generated in zzso mice contained approximately zzso zzso cells, which selectively expressed the zzso stem zzso surface zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso capacity of zzso and zzso cell zzso revealed that the zzso zzso were at least zzso more zzso capable of forming tumors at doses of zzso cells, and formed zzso in the zzso zzso populations derived from a single zzso cell were capable of forming tumors zzso for zzso zzso These data are consistent with the cancer stem cell model of zzso in zzso and zzso a functional link between the capacity to activate an zzso zzso promoter and tumor zzso This zzso zzso cell appears highly prolific and constitutes a majority of the cell population in a primary zzso zzso which may provide a biological basis for the particular zzso of this type of zzso
