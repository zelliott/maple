To investigate the expression changes of zzso zzso cholesterol zzso 1 zzso on zzso zzso zzso induced foam cell zzso 

Human zzso cell line zzso was induced into zzso by 160 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for 48 zzso and were randomly allocated into four groups: negative control group zzso zzso LDL for 48 zzso positive control group zzso zzso zzso for 48 zzso zzso infection group zzso zzso LDL plus 1 zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso and 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso for 48 h or 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso for 0, 24, 48 and 72 zzso zzso inhibitor zzso plus zzso infection group zzso 5, 10 zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso for 1 zzso 50 zzso LDL and 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso for 48 zzso The zzso and protein expressions of zzso were determined by zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso droplets in zzso were observed by oil red O zzso The contents of zzso zzso zzso were detected by zzso 

The zzso and protein expressions of zzso were significantly zzso in positive control cells compared those in negative control cells and further zzso by zzso infection in a zzso and zzso manner (all P zzso zzso There were significantly increases in the zzso of zzso droplets and the ratio of zzso zzso to total cholesterol in positive control cells as compared with negative control cells and these were further aggravated by zzso (at the zzso of 5 zzso zzso and 1 zzso zzso zzso for 48 zzso and zzso infection induced increases in the zzso of zzso droplets and the ratio of zzso zzso to total cholesterol could be significantly attenuated by zzso inhibitor zzso (all P zzso zzso
