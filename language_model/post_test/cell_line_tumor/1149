zzso zzso has been the mainstay treatment for zzso cancer for the past few zzso However, as with other zzso development of zzso resistance has been a major obstacle in zzso cancer zzso The purpose of this study was to gain further understanding of the mechanisms underlying zzso resistance in zzso cancer zzso 

A zzso cell line was established from the human colon cancer cell line zzso zzso extracts from these two cell lines zzso and zzso were analyzed using comparative zzso to identify zzso expressed zzso 

zzso human colon cancer cells were found to zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso Other experiments showed cellular resistance to zzso zzso cell zzso was altered by the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and by the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso in that zzso 4 increased zzso resistance in zzso cells, whereas zzso 4 zzso zzso resistance in zzso zzso However, there was no significant effect of zzso 4 or zzso 4 on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 4 suppressed proliferation in both cell zzso 

We here report zzso expression in human colon cancer cell line, which provides further evidence for zzso nervous system expression of zzso zzso zzso of zzso may tentatively be responsible for zzso resistance and, although zzso by zzso promotes cell survival in the presence of zzso decreased zzso expression or zzso by zzso contributes to cell zzso
