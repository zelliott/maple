zzso zzso zzso zzso is the core component of the zzso zzso signaling pathway, which is frequently zzso in human zzso We designed and zzso a series of zzso compounds based on the zzso binding site of zzso and the most potent compound, zzso zzso was identified to inhibit zzso activity in zzso with an zzso of 153 zzso by a zzso resonance energy zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso was tested on human zzso and zzso cell lines and the zzso zzso zzso The results showed that zzso could obviously inhibit the proliferation of zzso and zzso cells via induction of zzso with the evidence of increases in zzso and zzso zzso cells, characteristic zzso changes of zzso in the nucleus, and zzso zzso Further study showed that zzso cells zzso with zzso activated zzso were more sensitive to zzso zzso cells with zzso of zzso expression by short hairpin zzso were more resistant to zzso Of more importance, zzso partially attenuated the zzso levels of zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso target of zzso in a zzso and zzso fashion and led to an increase in the nuclear zzso of zzso zzso in cancer zzso In addition, zzso at 20 zzso inhibited the zzso zzso tumor growth with a treated zzso group ratio of zzso accompanied by increasing terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso cells in the tumor zzso In addition, zzso induced a feedback loop to activate the zzso protein zzso zzso and treatment with zzso protein zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced cancer cell zzso These data provide validation for the development of zzso to treat zzso displaying elevated levels of zzso
