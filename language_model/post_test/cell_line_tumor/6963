zzso is a zzso protein that has multiple functions in the nucleus and the zzso Our earlier studies had shown that zzso zzso the activity of zzso zzso factors while enhancing zzso zzso At the same time, zzso has been implicated in zzso the proper folding of zzso zzso We had found that treatment of cells with zzso a zzso 1 zzso led to the export of zzso and zzso from the nucleus to the zzso Here we show that the zzso export of zzso occurs zzso in transformed cell lines, but not in zzso or primary zzso zzso that did not display the zzso of zzso were zzso to the zzso effects of zzso The zzso was zzso by a putative nuclear export signal at the zzso region of zzso fusion of the nuclear export signal zzso of zzso to green zzso protein led to its export from the zzso zzso B could inhibit the nuclear export of zzso showing that it was a zzso event driven by Ran zzso zzso this, zzso was found to physically interact with zzso and this interaction was significantly higher in transformed zzso zzso of a zzso corresponding to the zzso of zzso prevented the export of zzso to zzso and protected cells from zzso These results suggest that the regulated zzso of zzso from the nucleus to the zzso zzso its zzso functions and might contribute to its zzso and tumor zzso zzso
