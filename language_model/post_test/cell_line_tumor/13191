zzso protein 1 light chain 3 has an important role in zzso The human zzso gene family has five members, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Although a form of zzso modified by zzso zzso is localized in zzso it is not clear whether other zzso proteins also function in zzso Here, we examined the association between zzso and human zzso proteins during zzso or zzso zzso in zzso zzso In an analysis of the zzso distribution of each zzso protein fused with zzso zzso was frequently localized in zzso with a zzso pattern, similar to zzso Further, zzso zzso generated zzso and mostly localized in zzso zzso during the induced zzso Interestingly, zzso not zzso was frequently zzso at the zzso level in various human cancer cell lines zzso cell lines, zzso and its zzso was due to zzso DNA zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso cell lines and primary zzso Restoration of zzso expression in zzso cells, an zzso zzso cell line, showed the zzso of tumor growth in zzso These results suggest that zzso not only zzso functions in zzso and further, zzso may be crucial in zzso
