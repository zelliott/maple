zzso is a member of the inhibitor of zzso proteins that is expressed at high levels in most human zzso and may facilitate evasion from zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso occurring dietary compounds such as zzso have gained considerable attention as cancer zzso zzso Here, we discovered a novel function of the zzso agent zzso zzso is a potent zzso of tumor cells for tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso through zzso induction of zzso and zzso cell cycle arrest associated with zzso zzso zzso analysis of cell cycle, zzso zzso and zzso revealed that zzso zzso arrest was associated with zzso of zzso expression and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso arrest using the cell cycle inhibitor zzso or induced by zzso zzso reduced zzso expression and zzso cells for TRAIL zzso Likewise, zzso cell cycle arrest followed by zzso depletion and zzso for TRAIL was impaired in zzso deficient zzso Also, zzso of zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso cells for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso various tumor cell lines, but not normal human zzso for zzso induced by death zzso zzso or zzso zzso Thus, this combined zzso zzso zzso zzso strategy may be a novel approach to enhance the efficacy of zzso therapies in a variety of human zzso
