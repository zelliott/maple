zzso implicated in the cell cycle control of both normal and zzso cells, can be induced by zzso and independent zzso In some cells, zzso regulate zzso zzso while in others they also affect the zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso expression is also controlled by the zzso zzso factor zzso We have previously demonstrated that the zzso zzso cell line zzso growth arrest and zzso differentiation following treatments with zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso which respectively activate and inhibit the zzso zzso In this paper we attempt to clarify the mechanism of zzso and zzso growth arrest and zzso differentiation of zzso and zzso zzso cell lines, particularly as regards the expression of the cell cycle inhibitor zzso 

zzso expression and growth arrest are induced in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell lines following zzso or zzso inhibitor zzso treatments, whereas zzso differentiation is induced in zzso cells zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso mechanism of zzso expression in zzso cells is due to zzso of the zzso pathway, as shown by zzso with zzso active zzso or zzso which zzso zzso zzso and with zzso and zzso zzso which prevents zzso zzso By contrast, zzso zzso expression is controlled zzso by the zzso zzso Similarly, zzso and zzso expression is induced both by zzso and zzso and is prevented by zzso zzso Although zzso and zzso depletion by zzso prevents zzso zzso zzso the zzso of these two zzso factors is insufficient to induce zzso These data suggest that the zzso mechanism of zzso expression in zzso cells is rescued when zzso zzso zzso the functions of zzso zzso zzso zzso the forced expression of zzso in zzso cells causes growth arrest and the zzso of zzso zzso 

Our data provide evidence of the key role played by the zzso zzso in the growth arrest of zzso zzso The results of this study suggest that the targeting of zzso to rescue zzso expression and zzso zzso factor functions leads to the reversal of the zzso zzso
