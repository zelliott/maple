Several pesticides and zzso commonly used to control agricultural and indoor zzso are highly suspected to display zzso effects in animals and zzso zzso disruption is mainly caused by the interference of chemicals at the level of steroid zzso it is now well known that many of these chemicals can display zzso effects and/or zzso effects, but much less is known about the interaction of these compounds with other steroid zzso zzso a zzso zzso like its primary zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso is known to bind zzso zzso zzso Although zzso and its zzso were characterized as zzso relatively little is known about their effects on the function of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso receptors zzso and zzso zzso of the study were to determine the ability of zzso and its two primary zzso to activate zzso zzso zzso MR and zzso For this purpose, we used reporter cell lines bearing zzso gene under the control of wild type or zzso zzso fusion zzso zzso zzso MR or zzso We confirmed that all three were zzso for zzso whereas only zzso was found a partial zzso Interestingly, zzso was also a zzso zzso and MR zzso zzso while zzso was an MR and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso for both zzso with a lower affinity for zzso Although the zzso of the zzso and its zzso are low when compared to natural zzso their ability to act via more than one mechanism and the potential for additive or synergistic effect must be taken into consideration in the risk assessment zzso
