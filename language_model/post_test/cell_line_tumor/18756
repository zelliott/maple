zzso remains an attractive target for vaccine zzso It is zzso in the majority of human zzso and multiple zzso Clinical trials using zzso vaccines have demonstrated safety, clinical responses, and the induction of zzso responses directed against zzso Previous studies in experimental models and in clinical trials have demonstrated that altering the zzso acid sequence of a zzso zzso can lead to the generation of an zzso zzso zzso capable of zzso stronger zzso responses than the native zzso zzso 

We describe here the identification of six novel class I zzso zzso of zzso that reside outside of the variable number of tandem repeat zzso Each is shown to have the ability to activate human T cells as measured by zzso zzso One zzso zzso at zzso acid position zzso and designated zzso which demonstrated the highest level of binding to zzso and which induced the highest level of zzso in human T cells, was further studied for the generation of potential zzso zzso zzso Of four potential zzso identified, one zzso zzso designated zzso was identified as an zzso zzso Compared with the native zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso bound zzso at lower zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a higher zzso for zzso in zzso zzso zzso when used with zzso cells, induced the production of more zzso by T cells than with the use of the native zzso and zzso was capable of more efficiently generating zzso human zzso lines from normal volunteers and pancreatic cancer zzso Most importantly, the zzso lines generated using the zzso zzso were more efficient than those generated with the native zzso in the zzso of targets zzso with the native zzso and in the zzso of zzso human tumor cells expressing zzso 

In addition to the identification of novel zzso zzso outside the variable number of tandem repeat region, the studies reported here describe the first zzso zzso of zzso The employment of this zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso vaccines may well aid in the development of effective vaccines for a range of human zzso
