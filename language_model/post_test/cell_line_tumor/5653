zzso zzso zzso a family of gene regulatory factors found at only low zzso in normal cells, are almost universally zzso in cancer zzso zzso proteins are located in the zzso of normal cells except during the late zzso zzso of the cell cycle, when zzso one of the members of the family, zzso zzso to the zzso where it binds to zzso DNA zzso In many cancer cells, this controlled shuttling is lost and zzso is found in zzso throughout the cell zzso To investigate the effects of zzso on zzso we employed a genetically engineered line of human zzso cells in which the levels of transgenic zzso protein could be zzso zzso zzso and zzso time course experiments were performed with these cells to either increase or decrease zzso zzso levels, and various zzso changes were zzso zzso demonstrated that changes in both zzso levels and zzso mass zzso paralleled changes in zzso zzso strongly implicating zzso in the regulation of these zzso Additionally, the level of cellular zzso oxygen species zzso increased and the efficiency of repair of zzso damaged zzso decreased as consequences of elevated zzso zzso Increased zzso levels and reduced repair efficiency in zzso cells likely contribute to the increased occurrence of zzso in zzso frequently observed in cancer zzso
