To examine the expression of zzso in human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and investigate the effects of zzso gene silence on cell zzso zzso and invasion of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The expression of zzso was detected by zzso in normal zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso Control Duplex were constructed and zzso into zzso cells by zzso zzso The expression levels of zzso were detected by zzso and zzso The cell cycle and zzso rate were analyzed by flow zzso zzso The cell proliferation was detected by zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell invasion by zzso zzso 

The positive rate of zzso expression in zzso was significantly higher than that in normal zzso zzso tissue and zzso zzso ( zzso After zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso and protein expression of zzso were zzso the cell proliferation activity was zzso the zzso Phase cells were increased, and the zzso rate of zzso zzso zzso Duplex group was higher than that in control groups and cell invasion ability was zzso 

Over expression of zzso in human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may promote zzso development and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Duplex could efficiently zzso the expression of zzso zzso and partly inhibited proliferation of zzso cells, induce zzso and decrease invasion ability of these cells in zzso
