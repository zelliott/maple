This study examines differences between cultures of normal human oral zzso cells and two zzso cell zzso cell lines zzso and zzso in the expression of structural zzso zzso zzso plasma membrane zzso zzso and zzso zzso Based on zzso most normal cell cultures appeared to express more zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 14, zzso and zzso than SCC zzso By Western zzso analysis, normal cultures expressing high levels of zzso also expressed high levels of zzso and low levels of zzso Both SCC cultures demonstrated lower expression of zzso and zzso whereas only zzso cells showed high levels of zzso zzso of zzso an zzso associated protein with potential zzso function, did not vary among normal and SCC zzso zzso of saturated fatty acids zzso by thin layer zzso were higher in the normal cell cultures, than in both SCC cell zzso No zzso differences were evident by transmission electron zzso zzso between normal and SCC zzso zzso zzso Although no zzso was zzso observation suggested that normal cells form more zzso junctions zzso zzso and larger zzso bridges zzso zzso compared to both SCC cell zzso Of the factors zzso main variations between cultures of normal oral zzso and the two SCC cell lines examined include the expression of structural and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The extent of the differences varies according to the stage of terminal differentiation demonstrated by the normal cell zzso
