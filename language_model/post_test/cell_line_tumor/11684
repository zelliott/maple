zzso zzso expression in human zzso positively zzso with body mass index and may contribute to zzso dysfunction by zzso transforming growth zzso and/or zzso zzso Our objective was to determine how zzso is regulated in zzso and polarized zzso using a zzso system and to determine whether fatty zzso including the zzso fatty acid zzso acid zzso regulate zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso with zzso induced zzso gene expression in zzso (from zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced zzso gene expression in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein levels in the shared media of zzso and zzso cells were also strongly induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment during the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso zzso level zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso and this increase in zzso zzso expression was almost completely blocked with zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso thus, zzso expression closely paralleled zzso zzso Since zzso has been shown to regulate zzso in other cell types, we reduced zzso expression with zzso in the zzso cells and found that this caused zzso to be reduced in response to zzso zzso by zzso ( zzso suggesting that zzso regulates zzso expression in zzso zzso These results suggest that supplementation with dietary zzso fatty acids could potentially be beneficial to zzso tissue in obesity by reducing zzso and zzso
