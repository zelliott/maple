zzso interacts directly with zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso system, we identified zzso as an interacting partner of zzso zzso and zzso bind to overlapping regions of zzso thus competing for zzso zzso Imaging experiments demonstrated that zzso expression promoted zzso zzso to the plasma zzso whereas zzso expression failed to do zzso Given the role of zzso in the regulation of growth zzso zzso zzso we examined the contribution of the zzso interaction to zzso zzso zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells, a system that expresses all of the components zzso zzso of zzso levels led to regulation of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and decreased zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso attenuated subsequent zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression of zzso both diminished zzso zzso of zzso and blocked zzso zzso of zzso zzso These observations indicate that zzso interacts with zzso and zzso zzso from bound zzso Free zzso then in turn zzso growth factor zzso Thus, here we present a novel mechanism of how zzso receptors can inhibit growth factor signaling to zzso
