A zzso three-dimensional zzso cell culture zzso chip has been developed for real-time and zzso zzso monitoring of cell proliferation and zzso In this study, human oral cancer cells zzso were zzso in zzso zzso scaffold and cultured in a zzso chamber under zzso of tested zzso This setting provides a more in zzso zzso relevant zzso to better mimic the complex in zzso zzso A pair of vertical zzso was embedded at the opposite zzso of the culture chamber for the on-site zzso zzso Cell density in the zzso construct was shown to be zzso to the zzso magnitude of the entire zzso zzso zzso zzso cell culture was performed for up to 5 days and cell proliferation can be monitored by the zzso zzso Moreover, real-time zzso monitoring of cell viability under the zzso of zzso drug in different zzso was conducted and the zzso magnitude was directly correlated with the cell zzso From the confirmation of the zzso cell viability zzso a zzso effect was zzso however, the response of cell viability during the drug treatment was able to be traced by the zzso zzso The experimental results showed that cell proliferation and zzso in zzso cell culture format can be monitored by zzso zzso This zzso chip has a high potential to develop a powerful zzso platform for cancer zzso
