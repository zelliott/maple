zzso factor 2 zzso is a master zzso regulator that zzso cellular stress responses and is zzso regulated by zzso zzso protein 1 zzso at the zzso zzso In human zzso zzso stabilized zzso either by zzso of zzso or zzso plays a vital role in zzso and tumor cell growth through the zzso zzso of target zzso suggesting that targeted zzso of zzso is a potential therapy for zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso small zzso zzso that can zzso regulate gene expression by interfering with the translation or stability of target zzso Moreover, zzso zzso have been suggested to be useful for cancer zzso Here, a zzso zzso library screen identified four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that zzso regulate the zzso zzso zzso by directly targeting zzso zzso zzso of these zzso in addition to the zzso zzso of zzso or zzso is associated with stabilized zzso and poor prognosis in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso Furthermore, administration of a zzso alone or in combination with zzso inhibited tumor growth in zzso Thus, these findings reveal that zzso therapy is effective against zzso zzso zzso 

This study determines the potential of zzso molecular zzso and zzso in zzso zzso
