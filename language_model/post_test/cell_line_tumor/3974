zzso growth zzso zzso can be both a tumor promoter and zzso although the mechanisms behind the zzso switch remain to be fully zzso The zzso type I zzso zzso is zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso requires the combined activities of tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso factor 6 zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso event occurs selectively in cancer cells and generates an zzso domain zzso of zzso which enters the nucleus to mediate gene zzso zzso 1 zzso a zzso zzso core zzso mediates zzso zzso of zzso zzso such as zzso We showed that zzso increased both the abundance and activity of zzso zzso recruited zzso to the zzso complex and promoted zzso zzso of zzso which activated zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso in the zzso domain between zzso and zzso and zzso generation was inhibited when these zzso were zzso to zzso We also showed that, after entering the nucleus, zzso bound to the promoter and increased the zzso of the gene zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso promoted zzso invasion of various cancer cells in zzso Furthermore, when a mouse zzso model of prostate cancer was treated with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso generation of zzso was zzso zzso of the gene zzso the zzso zzso factor zzso was reduced, and tumor growth was zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso may be useful for treating aggressive prostate zzso
