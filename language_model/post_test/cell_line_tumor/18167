The dynamic turnover of zzso junctions zzso and tight junctions zzso is essential for zzso zzso during normal development and zzso Although the zzso recycling of zzso is characterized and implicated in zzso zzso the molecular basis for zzso turnover is poorly zzso zzso and zzso are distinct zzso proteins localized to the zzso Although zzso are an indispensable structural component of zzso zzso depletion of zzso in mice reveals well-developed zzso strands and complex zzso zzso To examine the zzso transport of zzso proteins to and from the cell surface, zzso zzso is a proven powerful zzso Using this method, we successfully demonstrated that zzso was zzso and recycled back to the cell surface in both zzso baby zzso kidney zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso recycling of zzso as well as the formation of functional zzso was dependent on zzso and a zzso zzso protein zzso interacting with zzso 2 zzso We describe the method to study the zzso transport of zzso to and from the cell surface in both zzso and zzso zzso
