zzso targeted therapy is a promising new method of treating pancreatic zzso To increase the efficacy and decrease the zzso we constructed a zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing human zzso with a human zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter for the regulation of the early stage of zzso expression of gene zzso and a zzso Response zzso zzso promoter to regulate the gene zzso 

A gene zzso technique was adopted to construct and generate the zzso zzso zzso cancer cells were studied both in zzso and in zzso Western zzso was adopted to observe the expressions of protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso was applied to observe the selective zzso capability of zzso zzso zzso zzso was applied to measure the lethal effects of virus on pancreatic cancer cells, and zzso was adopted to detect the human zzso gene zzso A pancreatic cancer transplantation tumor model of nude mice was constructed to observe the zzso effects of the zzso 

zzso duplicative zzso zzso genes were successfully zzso zzso and lethal zzso proved that zzso could replicate specifically in pancreatic cancer cells and kill zzso The zzso expression in a cultured zzso from tumor cells was significantly higher than that obtained from zzso zzso zzso carrying that zzso The animal experiment demonstrated that zzso has a high capability to limit pancreatic cancer zzso 

zzso has a special ability to duplicate and kill pancreatic cancer cells in in zzso and in zzso experiments, thus providing a new zzso treatment system for pancreatic zzso
