zzso zzso 2 zzso is a type 2 zzso protein expressed in zzso that binds zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cause one form of zzso zzso a disease in which excessive zzso of dietary iron can lead to liver zzso diabetes, arthritis, and heart zzso The function of zzso in iron zzso is zzso We have studied the regulation of zzso in zzso zzso Western zzso analysis shows that zzso increases in a zzso and zzso manner after zzso zzso is added to the culture zzso In cells exposed to zzso zzso the amount of zzso returns to control levels within 8 hours after the removal of zzso zzso from the zzso However, zzso does not increase when zzso iron zzso or zzso zzso is added to the zzso The response to zzso zzso appears to be zzso zzso zzso quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction zzso analysis shows that zzso zzso levels do not change in cells exposed to zzso zzso Rather, the increase in zzso is attributed to an increase in the zzso of zzso protein in cells exposed to zzso zzso Our results support a role for zzso in monitoring iron levels by sensing changes in the concentration of zzso zzso
