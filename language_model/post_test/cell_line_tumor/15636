zzso acts via two specific receptors to affect gene zzso in target zzso zzso zzso zzso B contains 933 zzso acids while zzso A is a truncated version lacking the initial zzso zzso zzso We have cloned a novel, truncated zzso from both human zzso and zzso zzso zzso This zzso encodes a predicted protein of 314 zzso zzso termed zzso zzso of zzso of zzso occurs in zzso 3, with the initial zzso identical to zzso 4 of the zzso zzso except for a novel 16 zzso acid zzso zzso consistent with a signal zzso The remainder of zzso is identical to the zzso zzso zzso for this protein was identified by zzso in human zzso zzso cells and zzso breast cancer zzso zzso of zzso in zzso 9 insect cells results in a zzso zzso demonstrated in human zzso zzso cells and zzso breast cancer zzso The function of zzso remains to be zzso The presence of a signal zzso and the lack of a DNA binding region suggests a zzso zzso
