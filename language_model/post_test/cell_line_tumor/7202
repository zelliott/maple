zzso zzso 2 zzso plays a critical role in iron zzso because patients carrying disabling zzso in the zzso gene suffer from zzso In this study, zzso regulation of zzso at the protein level was examined in zzso and in zzso zzso cell zzso protein levels were zzso after exposure to zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso treatment with zzso iron failed to elicit similar effects, suggesting that zzso regulation reflects interactions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein levels also reflected an zzso response to changing iron status in zzso Liver zzso protein levels were zzso and zzso in rats fed an zzso and a zzso diet, zzso zzso was also zzso in zzso mice, an animal model that displays liver iron zzso In contrast, zzso levels were reduced in zzso mice despite liver iron overload, supporting the idea that regulation of the zzso is dependent on zzso This idea is confirmed by zzso of zzso in zzso mice, which, like zzso mice, are anemic and incur iron zzso but have functional zzso Based on these combined results, we zzso that zzso acts as a sensor of iron status such that zzso levels reflect zzso zzso
