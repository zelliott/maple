zzso is one of the factors affecting sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso the current study was designed to investigate the role of zzso and zzso receptors in the zzso effects of zzso in zzso and cervical cancer cell lines zzso and zzso zzso Exposure of both cancer cells to zzso or zzso demonstrated growth zzso at a zzso manner as determined by the zzso zzso zzso reduction zzso Both laser scanning zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed typical zzso features in treated zzso The studies conducted seems to suggest that zzso zzso cell death by stimulating zzso better than zzso based on the significantly higher percentage of zzso cells in zzso treated cancer cells as compared to zzso In addition, zzso and zzso arrest cancer cells at zzso phase as analyzed by flow zzso Our results indicated that zzso significantly decreased the levels of zzso zzso by both cancer zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso cells were still sensitive to zzso and zzso even in the presence of zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso is still intact after zzso treatment as demonstrated using an zzso zzso This study concludes that the compound, zzso zzso both cancer cell growth through the induction of zzso arrests cell cycle at zzso phase and zzso the zzso levels of zzso in both cancer zzso zzso zzso is a potential candidate as a useful zzso agent in treating both cervical and zzso zzso in zzso
