zzso plays an important role in the retention of stem cells within the bone zzso zzso zzso is a zzso bio stable synthetic zzso which binds zzso with a greater affinity compared with zzso (4 zzso 84 zzso Studies in mice demonstrated the efficient and superior zzso and transplantation of stem cells collected with zzso compared with those obtained when using stem cells obtained with each one of these zzso agent zzso These results have served as a platform for the present clinical phase I zzso 

zzso patients with multiple myeloma who were preparing for their first zzso stem cell transplantation were zzso Patients received a standard multiple myeloma zzso regimen, consisting of 3 to 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso factor zzso at 5 zzso starting on day 5 and administered between 8 and 10 pm until the end of stem cell zzso A single injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was administered zzso on day 10 in the early morning, followed by zzso 12 hours zzso 

zzso was well tolerated at all zzso and none of the patients developed grade 3 and 4 zzso A single administration of zzso at the highest dose, zzso zzso resulted in a robust zzso and collection of zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which were obtained through a single zzso All transplanted patients received zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which rapidly zzso zzso zzso zzso The median time to zzso and zzso recovery was 12 and 14 days, respectively, at the highest dose zzso zzso 

When combined with zzso zzso is a safe and efficient stem cell zzso that enabled the collection of a high number of zzso cells in 1 and 2 zzso procedures, resulting in successful zzso
