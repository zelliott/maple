zzso acid zzso zzso the rates of zzso of numerous genes and thus plays key roles in multiple biological processes and is used in therapy of a number of zzso However, zzso therapy is often zzso by zzso raising the need for zzso for its ready zzso in biological zzso We describe a zzso method for zzso zzso that takes advantage of the high affinity and selectivity of the zzso zzso protein termed zzso and zzso and that uses them as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were generated, and the inserted zzso was zzso labeled with an environmentally sensitive fluorescent zzso The label was introduced into a region of the protein that zzso a zzso shift on zzso zzso zzso binding resulted in distinct changes in the zzso of the zzso probe, allowing direct zzso of zzso We show that the method can be used to monitor the zzso of zzso from its precursor retinal in cultured zzso cells as well as the detection of zzso zzso in zzso The zzso provides ease of use and sensitivity that enable zzso of zzso in biological samples of limited size, and it should prove to be useful in a variety of research and clinical zzso
