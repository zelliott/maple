zzso zzso zzso signaling is well established as important in zzso To date most studies have been focused on the zzso zzso which has been found to be zzso in several different zzso The aim of our study was to determine which specific zzso zzso are involved in pancreatic zzso zzso zzso and investigate the effects of these zzso on zzso survival, and induction of zzso zzso in pancreatic cancer zzso 

The expression of all zzso zzso and downstream targets was analyzed by zzso in human pancreatic cancer tissue and normal zzso zzso selective zzso and short interfering zzso zzso were employed to investigate the effects of the different zzso on zzso survival, and zzso signaling in zzso cell zzso 

zzso screening revealed high specific expression of the zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso of the zzso tissue stained positive for zzso whereas no stain was detected in normal pancreatic zzso zzso analyses after selective zzso and zzso zzso of zzso showed that zzso but not other zzso zzso was required for cell zzso zzso of zzso indeed increased cell numbers and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cell zzso Moreover, zzso was required for zzso zzso via zzso acid zzso 

These data represent the first identification of a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in human zzso Further, our results signify a critical role for zzso in pancreatic cancer, and we zzso that zzso zzso is a key event in the disease zzso
