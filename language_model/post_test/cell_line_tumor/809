zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso is a potent zzso acting through zzso in the zzso zzso zzso pool in the de zzso zzso to DNA zzso The activity of zzso zzso zzso a key zzso in the zzso zzso is known to increase in response to a lowering of zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso are incorporated into DNA after zzso by zzso zzso zzso by zzso depends on zzso zzso zzso we have investigated the zzso effect of the combination of zzso and zzso on zzso (a human colon cancer zzso and compared it to the effect of either drug zzso We zzso the effects of zzso and zzso on the zzso pools by zzso liquid zzso and measured whether the incorporation of zzso was increased by zzso using a zzso incorporation zzso The combination in zzso yielded zzso enhancement ratios of zzso significantly higher than those observed with zzso or zzso zzso zzso analysis of the combination indicated a zzso zzso This significant increase in radiation sensitivity with the combination of zzso and zzso could not be explained by changes in the zzso pattern since the addition of zzso to zzso did not further reduce the zzso However, the increase in the radiation sensitivity of zzso cells might be due to increased incorporation of zzso after zzso zzso Indeed, a specific and significant incorporation of zzso into DNA could be observed with the zzso incorporation zzso in the presence of 1 zzso zzso zzso when combined with zzso zzso
