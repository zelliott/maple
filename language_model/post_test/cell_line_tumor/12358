zzso is a large zzso zzso zzso produced by several tumor cell types, including zzso melanoma, which exists as four different zzso zzso The presence of zzso in the zzso zzso plays a role in tumor cell growth, zzso and migration, which could be altered by altering the ratio between zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso in human melanoma cell lines markedly reduces cell growth in zzso and in zzso since zzso zzso cultured cells as well as primary tumors arising from these cells grow slower than their zzso counterparts zzso In the present work, we have extended these observations to demonstrate that the delayed cell growth is due to multiple events since differences in zzso index as well as in zzso are observed in zzso cells and tumors compared to zzso For example, zzso melanoma cells exhibit delayed zzso of zzso in response to zzso we have also characterized further the primary tumors originated in nude mice from zzso melanoma cells to determine if other events affect the zzso tumor zzso For example, zzso content of zzso tumors was higher than in zzso tumors, whereas other related zzso components and zzso were zzso Furthermore, lung zzso in nude mice occurred only in animals carrying zzso tumors, indicating a dual role for this zzso both as an inhibitor of tumor growth and a zzso zzso
