Gene expression processes are now recognized as important targets of the toxic effects exerted by industrial zzso The transient zzso zzso is a powerful tool to evaluate such zzso Thus, we developed a versatile zzso system by constructing a basic reporter zzso in which the regulatory DNA sequence to be studied can easily be zzso To verify the performance of this system, reporter plasmids carrying any of the three distinct regulatory zzso zzso responsive element zzso zzso responsive element zzso and zzso responsive element zzso were zzso After zzso of human cells, these plasmids successfully expressed the relevant reporter genes in response to specific zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Several industrial chemicals were zzso using these reporter zzso and the ability of zzso to elevate zzso and zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso were also observed to increase the zzso zzso The zzso zzso system established here will be useful to evaluate the effects of a wide variety of industrial zzso
