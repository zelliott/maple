DNA zzso using long zzso zzso are widely used to evaluate gene expression in biological zzso These zzso are zzso and zzso to represent specific genes with minimal zzso to zzso zzso zzso length and concentration are critical factors for signal sensitivity, particularly when genes with various expression levels are being zzso We evaluated the effects of zzso probe length and concentration on signal intensity zzso of the expression levels of genes in a target zzso 

zzso genes of various expression levels in a single cell line were zzso to zzso zzso of four lengths and four zzso of zzso to determine how these critical parameters affected the intensity of the signal representing their zzso We found that zzso of longer length significantly increased the signals of genes with zzso in the zzso zzso gene signals were also zzso but to a lesser zzso zzso the probe zzso however, did not zzso increase the signal intensity for either low- or zzso zzso 

We conclude that the longer the zzso probe the better the signal zzso of low expressing genes on zzso zzso
