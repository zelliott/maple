zzso zzso is composed of different cell types including immune zzso Far from acting to eradicate cancer cells, these bone zzso components could be involved in zzso and/or tumor invasion and zzso Here, we describe an alternative approach to treat solid tumors based on the genetic modification of zzso stem and zzso cells with zzso zzso To achieve zzso expression in zzso tumor zzso zzso and to try to decrease systemic zzso we used the stress zzso human zzso zzso zzso of the promoter was characterized in zzso using zzso zzso efficacy was assessed by ex zzso genetic modification of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the human transforming growth zzso zzso II zzso driven by the zzso promoter, and zzso of cells into recipient zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso injected into bone zzso zzso As a result, a massive zzso response was observed in mice harboring zzso under the zzso promoter, without the need of any external source of zzso In zzso this study shows that stem zzso gene therapy in combination with spatial and zzso control of zzso expression in zzso zzso cells represents an alternative strategy for the development of novel zzso zzso
