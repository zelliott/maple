zzso zzso are the most common zzso event in zzso cancer zzso progression and their occurrence is associated with lack of response to anti zzso growth factor zzso zzso targeted zzso Using zzso models and patients' samples we recently reported that the emergence of zzso zzso but also zzso amplification is associated with acquired resistance to the zzso zzso zzso or zzso We reasoned that zzso amplification may also be responsible for primary resistance to these zzso Furthermore, while the prevalence of zzso zzso has been well established in zzso little is known about the frequency of zzso amplification in large zzso zzso We performed a screening of zzso zzso samples to assess the prevalence of zzso amplification in this tumor type and further evaluated the role of this genetic zzso on the sensitivity to anti zzso zzso We detected zzso amplification in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso specimens and cell lines, zzso zzso amplification was mutually exclusive with zzso zzso zzso or cell lines harboring this genetic zzso are not responsive to zzso zzso Although zzso amplification is an zzso event in zzso it might be responsible for zzso response to zzso treatment in a small proportion of zzso
