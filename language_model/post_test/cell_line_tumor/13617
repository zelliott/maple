Despite recent advances in the treatment of zzso zzso zzso the chemotherapy efficacy against zzso is still zzso The zzso target of zzso zzso has been emerged as an important cancer therapeutic zzso However, zzso cells often resistant to zzso because of the paradoxical zzso of zzso by zzso In this study, we investigated whether zzso could enhance the zzso effects of zzso 

The effects of zzso and zzso on zzso zzso zzso migration, and zzso in zzso were assessed by zzso analysis, flow zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Total and zzso protein levels of zzso were detected by Western zzso The effects of zzso and/or zzso on the zzso expression levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso family in zzso cells were evaluated by zzso The roles of zzso and zzso on zzso growth and zzso in zzso models were evaluated by tumor volumes and fluorescent zzso The effects of zzso and zzso on cell proliferation and zzso in zzso were test by zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso with zzso to reduce cell growth, induce zzso and inhibit cell mobility in zzso Further zzso studies showed that zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso which in turn enhanced zzso of zzso cell zzso The zzso of the zzso expression of cell cycle zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso associated genes zzso zzso were also involved in the synergistic zzso effects of zzso and zzso zzso inhibitor zzso significantly zzso the effect of zzso and zzso on cell zzso which indicated that the zzso effect of zzso and zzso may be zzso Treatment of zzso bearing nude mice with zzso and zzso significantly enhanced tumor growth zzso zzso comparing with either zzso zzso or zzso mice zzso In addition, the lung zzso was significantly suppressed in mice received the combination treatment zzso The combination treatment of zzso and zzso significantly inhibited tumor cell proliferation and tumor zzso in zzso 

The combination of zzso with zzso could be a novel and promising therapeutic approach to the treatment of zzso
