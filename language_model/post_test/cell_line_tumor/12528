Many tumor cells exhibit a disturbed zzso zzso state resulting in higher levels of zzso oxygen species zzso As these contribute to tumor initiation and zzso zzso zzso agents combining significant activity with zzso specificity promise high activity and selectivity against zzso stressed zzso zzso We describe here the design and synthesis of novel zzso based zzso zzso zzso Their selective zzso activity at zzso and low zzso zzso was established here in a range of tumor entities in various biological systems including cell lines, primary tumor cell cultures, and animal zzso In the zzso derived chronic zzso leukemia zzso for instance, such compounds zzso induce zzso in the cancer cells while peripheral blood zzso cells zzso from healthy donors and the subset of normal zzso remain largely zzso In support of the concept of zzso based zzso amplification, we are able to demonstrate that underlying this selective activity against zzso cells are pre-existing elevated zzso levels in the zzso cells compared to their zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso act in concert with certain zzso drugs in several zzso cell lines to decrease cell proliferation while showing no such interactions in normal zzso Overall, the high efficacy and selectivity of zzso zzso zzso compounds warrant further, extensive testing toward transfer into the clinical zzso
