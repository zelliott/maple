zzso zzso were used to create zzso zzso zzso having a zzso shell zzso and their acoustic and zzso properties were zzso The inclusion of zzso in the zzso shell increased the yield, improved the serum stability, and generated a narrow zzso size distribution with a peak size of zzso zzso zzso zzso Using an acoustic model, we calculated the zzso zzso to be 3-5 times greater than that of commercial zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to be zzso suitable for both ultrasound and zzso imaging with a resonance frequency of zzso zzso The distinctive properties of zzso zzso make them potentially advantageous for a broad range of biomedical imaging and therapeutic zzso
