zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso frequently loses its expression in primary pancreatic cancer zzso This evidence suggests that zzso zzso of zzso zzso induced by frequent zzso of zzso and the loss of function of zzso plays key roles in pancreatic zzso and zzso By profiling of gene expressions associated with zzso of zzso induced by zzso zzso of zzso in pancreatic cancer cells, we found that zzso the gene zzso zzso zzso which plays key roles in cellular zzso was among the zzso genes along with its related zzso which included zzso zzso and zzso An association of expression and promoter activity of zzso with zzso activity was zzso zzso of zzso resulted in a reduction of zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is a direct target of the zzso zzso and that its zzso in pancreatic cancer is induced by zzso of the pathway, at least via zzso
