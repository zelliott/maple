The specific application and transport of drugs into zzso tissue is a critical point during diagnosis and zzso zzso are known as excellent drug carrier systems and offer the possibility of surface modification with targeting zzso leading to a specific zzso in the targeted zzso First, the specificity of such a carrier system has to be zzso In this study, zzso zzso based on zzso human serum zzso zzso are investigated regarding their cellular binding and zzso zzso Different zzso colon zzso cells were used to test possible zzso potential, specific binding and zzso zzso A specific zzso targeting the zzso could be zzso These results emphasize that zzso zzso are a promising carrier system for later drug zzso To our knowledge, this is the first study investigating the specific zzso of zzso zzso into different zzso colon zzso zzso 

In this study, zzso zzso based on human serum zzso zzso are investigated regarding their cellular binding and zzso zzso The results suggest that these zzso are a promising carrier system for zzso zzso colon zzso zzso
