The zzso tumor zzso gene zzso has been identified as an zzso in many zzso diseases such as zzso breast cancer, zzso and lung zzso However, the role of zzso in zzso lung cancer zzso zzso remains zzso In this study, we compared zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso with paired corresponding adjacent zzso and identified significantly higher expression in zzso zzso Cell proliferation of three zzso cell lines positively correlated with zzso zzso moreover, these associations were identified in both cell lines and a zzso mouse zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that zzso of zzso D1 and the zzso zzso protein zzso was mechanistically related to zzso accelerating cells to zzso In conclusion, our findings demonstrated that zzso is an zzso and promotes zzso cell proliferation by zzso zzso D1 and zzso zzso
