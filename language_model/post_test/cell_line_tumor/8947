zzso zzso is known to regulate transcription, but its role in other processes is largely zzso We report a role for the zzso zzso zzso in the DNA damage response zzso We show that zzso is recruited directly to sites of DNA zzso zzso zzso a major zzso for zzso is reduced at sites of DNA damage in an zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso physically interacts with zzso and we find this interaction to be important for zzso recruitment to DNA damage zzso Although loss of zzso did not affect the initial formation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso complex recruitment were reduced upon zzso zzso zzso this was likely a result of compromised zzso zzso zzso in late zzso zzso with a role in the zzso zzso of zzso resulted in moderate hypersensitivity to zzso and increased zzso zzso Our findings uncover a direct role for zzso in the zzso and place zzso downstream of zzso in the zzso zzso
