zzso amplification was recently recognized as a zzso aberration in acute zzso leukemia zzso and zzso syndrome zzso associated with adverse prognosis and zzso zzso Here we present detailed results of zzso in zzso zzso zzso and expression analyses of zzso and 5 selected zzso candidate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in 31 patient samples and one cell line with zzso zzso FISH analyses revealed that the zzso zzso invariably zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas expression analyses identified zzso and zzso as the most zzso expressed genes among samples with and without zzso copy gain or zzso In zzso samples, a significant zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso Further zzso designed to zzso a possible role of the zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso samples, revealed a significant zzso of zzso in zzso Our findings confirm the zzso gene as a prominent target of zzso amplification and provide further evidence for an zzso role for zzso gain of function in zzso zzso In addition, our results indicate that the zzso program associated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso displays significant zzso
