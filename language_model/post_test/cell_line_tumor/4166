zzso zzso of blood flow and distribution of cancer cells in lungs is essential to analyze mechanism of lung zzso Such cancer zzso has been well known to induce zzso states and zzso In zzso tissue zzso however, it has been difficult to capture rapid phenomenon of zzso formation due to technical problems associated with much less retention of soluble serum components as well as dynamic zzso features reflecting their living zzso In this study, to achieve zzso of both zzso states and zzso induced by early zzso of mouse zzso melanoma, zzso zzso zzso zzso was used, which retained soluble components at their original zzso zzso quantum dots zzso were subsequently injected after melanoma cells via right zzso to examine plasma flow with zzso zzso At 5s after the melanoma injection, melanoma cells were mostly stacked and zzso in zzso zzso with changing their zzso Assembly of zzso initially appeared at zzso and they zzso around the stacked melanoma cells at zzso Such zzso zzso were zzso for both zzso zzso and zzso of zzso indicating their partial signal zzso zzso zzso were also zzso around both melanoma cells and zzso zzso and massive zzso deposits of zzso were also detected near the same areas, but more strongly detected around the melanoma cells, indicating initial zzso zzso In those areas, zzso were rarely zzso probably because of the lack of blood zzso Thus, zzso revealed zzso features of initial zzso under their circulatory zzso
