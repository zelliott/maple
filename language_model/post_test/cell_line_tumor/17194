DNA can cross the cell membrane by natural means, but the functional relevance of this phenomenon has not been fully zzso Here, we analyzed spontaneous zzso of human B cells using zzso DNA coding for a functional zzso zzso heavy chain gene under the control of a zzso zzso Using zzso chain reaction zzso reverse zzso and flow zzso in zzso spontaneous zzso was documented in zzso zzso cell lines, zzso zzso cell lines, and peripheral blood B zzso of the mature zzso zzso zzso By zzso zzso the zzso DNA was seen in the zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso spontaneously transgenic B cells processed and presented to major zzso complex zzso T zzso a zzso expressed in the transgenic zzso This is the first demonstration that primary B zzso possess a program for the spontaneous zzso of DNA, which in turn zzso the cell with new zzso zzso As spontaneous zzso is obtained using a zzso zzso does not require prior cell zzso and is not associated with zzso integration, the findings reported here open new possibilities for genetic zzso of mature zzso B zzso for therapy and zzso
