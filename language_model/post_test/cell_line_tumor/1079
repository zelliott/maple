zzso zzso zzso were prepared from zzso zzso cells and clone zzso of zzso cells expressing a large number of zzso hormone zzso zzso and zzso by zzso on zzso density zzso The intact cell structure was broken by zzso zzso or drastic zzso Three types of zzso zzso were resolved by two-dimensional zzso and analyzed for zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Four individual zzso signals of zzso protein were identified in zzso zzso cells indicating complete resolution of the long zzso zzso and short zzso zzso zzso of zzso All these were diminished by prolonged zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells, five different zzso signals were detected indicating zzso modification of G proteins of zzso zzso The two major spots corresponding to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso the minor spots diminished by hormonal zzso Parallel analysis by silver zzso of the total protein content indicated that no major changes in protein composition occurred under these zzso Our data thus indicate that zzso of target cells results in zzso of all different members of zzso and zzso zzso This zzso effect may be demonstrated in crude membrane as well as zzso preparations and it is not accompanied by changes in overall protein zzso
