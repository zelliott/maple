We present here a first characterization of zzso an unique integral inner nuclear membrane zzso zzso zzso is a highly zzso protein even in some bacteria and shares a zzso domain of unknown function with zzso from many zzso Assessing zzso zzso by using zzso protection of zzso zzso and zzso zzso accessibility zzso reveals that zzso contains four zzso zzso and a large zzso domain located between membrane spans 1 and zzso The large zzso domain is exposed to the zzso space whereas both zzso zzso reside zzso or zzso Nuclear envelope targeting of zzso mainly depends on the membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso also promote zzso zzso binds A- and zzso zzso and depends on zzso zzso for its zzso zzso Furthermore, it interacts with zzso Both zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso acting zzso fragments causes zzso of zzso We propose that zzso functions as a zzso membrane organizer and has the potential to contribute to the zzso of zzso diseases, such as zzso muscular zzso
