zzso cells and human zzso zzso cells expressing zzso receptors have the ability to attach and roll on zzso We investigated zzso the zzso behavior of zzso cell lines and zzso zzso cells on thin films of the zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso An applied flow enhances the interaction between zzso cells and zzso if a threshold zzso stress of zzso zzso is zzso At zzso stress zzso the cell rolling speed reaches a maximum of 15 zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells lacking zzso showed no zzso or rolling on the zzso whereas the zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells attached and rolled on zzso Interestingly, the observations of zzso cell rolling are related to those found in the recruitment of zzso to inflammatory sites and the mechanisms of stem-cell zzso into the bone zzso
