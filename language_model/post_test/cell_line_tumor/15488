The presence of zzso in zzso zzso is the key feature of progressive zzso inflammation in kidney stone zzso However, response of zzso to calcium zzso zzso zzso zzso the major zzso composition of kidney stone, remained zzso This study aimed to investigate zzso in the cellular zzso of zzso induced by zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso (by zzso zzso were incubated without or with 100 zzso zzso zzso for 24 zzso Their cellular proteins were resolved by zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso 5 were derived from 5 independent cultures in each zzso and zzso with Deep Purple fluorescent zzso Spot matching, quantitative intensity analysis, and statistics revealed 18 zzso expressed protein spots, which were successfully identified by zzso zzso and zzso zzso The altered levels of zzso zzso and zzso were validated by Western zzso zzso zzso interaction network analysis using STRING software showed that 90 zzso heat shock protein zzso was associated with zzso and zzso (all these three proteins were increased in the zzso zzso Multiple zzso zzso confirmed the associations of zzso with zzso form of zzso zzso and zzso However, only the association between zzso and zzso was found on the zzso membrane surrounding zzso zzso indicating that the association of zzso with zzso but not with zzso is important for zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso reduced expression of zzso proteins and zzso marker zzso and successfully diminished zzso zzso zzso and migration of zzso Our findings enlightened the significant role of these altered zzso especially zzso in enhanced zzso activity of the zzso zzso
