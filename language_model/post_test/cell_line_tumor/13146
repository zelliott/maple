zzso resistance zzso to zzso chemotherapy is often zzso by the zzso of the plasma membrane drug zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso resistance gene zzso Various zzso agents are able to inhibit zzso activity but their clinical application is limited by their zzso Furthermore, zzso related to chemotherapy causes delays of treatment in cancer patients and often requires supplementation of zzso therapy with zzso zzso In this in zzso study, we investigated the effectiveness of an zzso zzso agent, zzso zzso and a natural zzso compound, zzso zzso to inhibit zzso activity in order to evaluate their potential use as zzso zzso Human zzso zzso resistant zzso zzso cells zzso expressing high levels of zzso were treated with two zzso at various zzso zzso 5 and 10 zzso that are clinically achievable, in the presence or absence of three different zzso of zzso zzso 4 and 8 zzso In order to evaluate the effects of both zzso we measured the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso the cellular zzso level, zzso production and zzso zzso zzso We found that treatment with 2, 4 and 8 zzso zzso in the presence of zzso or zzso significantly increased the zzso zzso and zzso on zzso cells, when compared to control cells receiving zzso zzso Moreover, treatment with zzso or zzso significantly increased zzso content, greater than 80 percent and 60 percent, zzso and zzso activity greater than 60 and 150 percent, zzso in resistant cancer cells, while zzso production was below the values of corresponding zzso control zzso Our in zzso findings provide a rationale for the potential clinical use of these zzso both as zzso agents, to reverse zzso zzso and as antioxidants to protect normal cells from zzso zzso
