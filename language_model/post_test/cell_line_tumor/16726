To investigate the feasibility of zzso zzso imaging of head and neck cancer with targeted contrast agents both in zzso and in zzso We zzso that zzso of zzso contrast agent to zzso zzso may improve US detection of head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso 

zzso blinded assessment of zzso and zzso zzso contrast agents for US imaging of zzso 

Animal zzso 

zzso zzso 

zzso of targeted zzso 

zzso zzso in tumors as detected by zzso 

In zzso assessment of zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso in 6 head and neck cancer cell lines yielded a zzso improvement over normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of targeted agents had a positive correlation to both zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression among all cell zzso In zzso imaging of flank tumors in nude mice (N zzso 8) yielded enhanced resolution of zzso zzso zzso agents over zzso control zzso zzso zzso while zzso contrast agents offered enhanced imaging over zzso contrast agents zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso In a blinded in zzso assessment, targeted contrast agents increased zzso enhancement of flank tumors over zzso zzso US contrast agents to both zzso and zzso were zzso sensitive and zzso specific in the detection of flank zzso 

This zzso study demonstrates feasibility of using molecular US to target zzso for zzso imaging of zzso tumor in zzso
