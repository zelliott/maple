zzso A zzso is a zzso zzso inhibitor that causes growth zzso of zzso zzso The zzso goal was to evaluate its effect on cell growth and cell cycle regulation in a large panel of zzso cell lines, as well as in human zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Cell growth in response to zzso was evaluated using a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso Cell cycle effects were examined using flow zzso A DNA fragmentation zzso was used to evaluate induction of zzso zzso zzso status and the expression of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were studied using Western zzso zzso In the zzso cell lines, there was significant zzso of cell growth and detection of increased levels of zzso zzso after zzso zzso The mechanisms underlying the growth zzso include cell cycle arrest at the zzso phase and zzso zzso The expression of zzso was zzso with a temporally related decrease in levels of zzso zzso zzso was preceded by detection of zzso zzso and activated zzso The effects of zzso were less pronounced or absent in human zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso caused zzso of zzso cell growth by both cell cycle arrest and zzso Cell cycle arrest was associated with an increase in zzso expression and a decrease in zzso zzso zzso was zzso at least partly through the zzso of zzso Because of the differential effects in zzso cells compared with zzso cells, zzso may provide a novel strategy for achieving tumor growth zzso and zzso Further investigation is zzso
