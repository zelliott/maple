One important issue in the zzso development of an zzso drug is the assessment of the compound under investigation when administered in combination with other zzso Several experiments are routinely conducted in zzso mice to evaluate if drugs interact or zzso Experimental data are generally zzso analyzed on empirical zzso The ability of zzso from single drug experiments a reference response to the joint zzso assuming no interaction, and comparing it to real responses would be key to recognize zzso and zzso zzso zzso in this paper, the minimal model of tumor growth zzso zzso previously developed for a single drug, is reformulated to account for the effects of zzso drugs and zzso under this hypothesis, combination zzso The model is derived from a minimal set of basic assumptions that include and extend those formulated at cellular level for the single drug zzso The tumor growth dynamics is well zzso by the deterministic evolution of its expected value that is obtained through the solution of an ordinary and several partial differential zzso Under suitable assumptions on the cell death process, the model reduces to a lumped zzso model that represents the extension of the very popular zzso zzso model to the combined administration of zzso zzso
