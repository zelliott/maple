zzso zzso expression and subsequent zzso activity defines the transformation of many solid tumors including zzso cell zzso zzso Thus, the expression of novel zzso zzso has the potential to dramatically shape tumor cell zzso Further, identifying zzso zzso can lend insight into patterns of tumor growth and zzso Here, we report the identification of the zzso orphan zzso 2 zzso a new zzso zzso in zzso cell lines and primary zzso zzso is an orphan zzso zzso zzso with zzso expression normally seen in the embryonic zzso However, in zzso zzso expression correlated with expression of genes involved at the zzso zzso including Twist and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells was suppressed by zzso zzso placing zzso as a zzso of zzso regulation in zzso and a potential regulator of zzso zzso zzso The suppression of zzso not only inhibited cell migration, but also inhibited zzso growth in soft zzso and growth in an zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest a novel zzso of zzso activity by zzso within a subset of zzso zzso with significant implications for unraveling the zzso of zzso
