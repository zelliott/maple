Three series of novel zzso zzso derivatives containing zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been zzso zzso structurally determined, and their biological activities were evaluated as potential zzso zzso Among the zzso zzso compound zzso showed the most potent biological activity against zzso cancer cell line zzso zzso against zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso performed the best in the zzso derivatives zzso zzso against zzso and zzso zzso for zzso which was comparable to the positive zzso While compound zzso showed the most potent biological activity zzso zzso against zzso and zzso zzso for zzso among the zzso zzso zzso simulation by positioning compounds zzso zzso and zzso into the zzso structure active site was performed to explore the possible binding zzso The results of zzso demonstrated that compound zzso possessed good zzso activity against zzso cancer cell zzso zzso compound zzso with potent zzso activity in tumor growth zzso may be a potential zzso agent against zzso cancer zzso zzso the introduction of zzso zzso and zzso structures reinforced the combination of our compounds and the zzso resulting in progress of zzso
