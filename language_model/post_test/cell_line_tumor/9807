To investigate a possible regulator gene involved in the zzso zzso differentiation of rat zzso zzso zzso 

The global changes in the zzso expression pattern induced by zzso toxin were analyzed using gene chip zzso The selected gene was then silenced by zzso interference or zzso with an zzso zzso to determine its necessity in this zzso 

zzso a member of the orphan nuclear zzso family zzso was markedly zzso during the process of zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso attenuated the induction effect of zzso toxin on zzso cells, whereas zzso of zzso led to similarly differentiated behavior, including zzso and zzso changes, as well as cell cycle zzso 

zzso participated actively and essentially as an important regulator in the zzso zzso differentiation of zzso zzso
