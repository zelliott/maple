Little is known about the expression or role of zzso zzso and -5 and their zzso inhibitor zzso in the liver in zzso and pathological zzso Their expression was, therefore, investigated in the zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso using zzso and western zzso and their cellular zzso by zzso zzso treatments were used to assess zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso -5 and zzso zzso and protein were detected in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso treatments significantly modulated zzso zzso expression and zzso treatment zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso did not translate to increased protein zzso This study showed that zzso zzso -5 and zzso were expressed at differential levels in zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso induced changes in zzso zzso although these did not translate to the protein zzso
