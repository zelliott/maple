zzso is a zzso zzso in cell zzso zzso and zzso in many cell zzso However, the molecular mechanisms for zzso have not been clarified in zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso Under phase contrast zzso zzso cells clearly showed zzso changes, which were characteristic features of zzso Treatment with zzso at 10 zzso specifically resulted in the death of 50% of the cells after 48 h as assessed by zzso zzso To further investigate which genes contribute to cell death in zzso cells, we used the reverse zzso chain reaction to assess zzso levels for five genes in the zzso family and five genes in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso levels of zzso Bad and zzso were not significantly changed for 48 h of zzso zzso The increases of zzso levels of zzso and zzso were observed for the first 3 h of zzso treatment and the last 24 h between 24 and 48 zzso We also found that in zzso cells, zzso increased zzso levels of the zzso family from 6 to 24 zzso These results suggest that in the zzso cells, zzso promote cell death by zzso the induction of zzso and that zzso mouse zzso zzso cells paradoxically zzso the expression of zzso and zzso to prevent zzso cell zzso
