A rise in zzso zzso concentration is used as a key zzso signal in virtually all animal cells, where it triggers a range of responses including neurotransmitter release, muscle contraction, and cell growth and proliferation zzso During zzso zzso zzso zzso rapidly take up significant amounts of zzso from the zzso and this stimulates energy production, alters the spatial and zzso profile of the zzso zzso zzso and triggers cell death zzso zzso zzso zzso occurs via a zzso zzso channel found in the inner membrane zzso In spite of its critical importance, little is known about how the zzso is zzso Here, we report that the zzso zzso zzso is gated by zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso is a zzso process with a requirement for functional zzso However, zzso zzso subsequently zzso the zzso preventing further zzso zzso The zzso zzso and the zzso process have relatively low zzso affinities of approximately zzso zzso However, numerous zzso are within zzso zzso of the zzso zzso thereby enabling rapid and efficient transmission of zzso release into adjacent zzso by zzso receptors on the zzso zzso zzso zzso control of zzso zzso zzso by zzso provides a novel basis for complex zzso patterns of zzso zzso zzso
