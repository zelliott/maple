zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging with copper zzso for zzso zzso has provided valuable clinical information, but investigations in animal models of prostate cancer have shown some zzso As a defense mechanism in prostate cancer cells, the fatty acid synthesis zzso zzso its zzso power for improving the zzso balance despite conditions of extreme zzso potentially altering zzso zzso zzso 

Human prostate zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso were treated with a fatty acid zzso zzso inhibitor zzso 100 zzso under zzso The zzso zzso in these treated cells and zzso zzso cells was then zzso zzso acid zzso expression level in each cell line was subsequently zzso by zzso An additional study was performed in zzso cells to examine the relationship between the restoration of zzso zzso selectivity and the concentration of zzso zzso 20, 4 or zzso zzso administered to the zzso 

zzso of fatty acid synthesis with zzso resulted in a significant increase in zzso retention in prostate tumor cells in zzso under zzso over 60 zzso zzso studies demonstrated higher zzso values of zzso zzso zzso and zzso at 15 zzso over control values for zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells, zzso A correlation was seen zzso with zzso expression plotted against percentage change in zzso zzso with zzso zzso 

Although zzso has clinical relevance in the PET imaging of zzso in many tumor types, its translation to the imaging of prostate cancer may be limited by the zzso of zzso associated with zzso zzso
