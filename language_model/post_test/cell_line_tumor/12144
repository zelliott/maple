The prion diseases are zzso neurodegenerative disorders linked to a zzso zzso zzso of the normal prion protein zzso zzso of zzso occurs via a poorly defined process in which zzso complexes with and converts zzso zzso to nascent zzso Recent experiments have focused on the highly charged first alpha zzso zzso of zzso It has been proposed that two putative zzso zzso salt bridges stabilize zzso in zzso yet form zzso zzso bonds with adjacent zzso molecules during conversion of zzso to zzso zzso zzso Morrissey and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso zzso work zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2003 using a zzso zzso of zzso conversion suggested that rather than promoting conversion, the salt bridges stabilize zzso against zzso However, the role of individual zzso charges in zzso generation has not yet been zzso To approach this question, we systematically reversed or neutralized each charged zzso in zzso and tested the effect on conversion to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We find that replacements of charged zzso zzso with like charges permit conversion, while charge zzso hinder zzso zzso of charges in the zzso zzso acids 143 to zzso but not the zzso zzso acids 147 to zzso half of zzso permits conversion, while complete reversal of charge orientation of the putative salt bridges produces a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies and zzso zzso zzso zzso studies indicated that charge zzso did not alter the secondary structure or cell surface expression of zzso These data support the necessity of specific charge zzso in zzso for a productive zzso zzso
