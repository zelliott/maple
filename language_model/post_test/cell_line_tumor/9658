zzso modification with zzso is one of the most important mechanisms in the regulation of protein stability and zzso However, the high zzso of this modification is the main obstacle for the isolation and characterization of zzso zzso To overcome this problem, we have developed zzso zzso entities zzso based on zzso zzso zzso zzso recognize zzso with a markedly higher affinity than single zzso zzso allowing zzso proteins to be efficiently zzso from cell extracts in native zzso More significant is the fact that zzso protect zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso both from zzso degradation and zzso activity present in cell zzso as well as from existing zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso these new zzso zzso should become valuable tools for zzso zzso zzso zzso thus contributing to a better characterization of many essential functions regulated by these zzso zzso
