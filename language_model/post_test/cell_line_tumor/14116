zzso cells have a remarkable capacity to zzso the brain and migrate long distances from the zzso making complete surgical zzso zzso Yet, little is known about how zzso cells interact with the complex zzso of the zzso To investigate the patterns and dynamics of zzso cell zzso and migration, we zzso injected zzso and zzso labeled rat zzso zzso cells into zzso rat zzso and used zzso zzso to observe zzso cell migration and proliferation in slice cultures generated from these zzso In this model, zzso cells extensively infiltrated the brain by zzso along the zzso surface of blood zzso zzso cells zzso their processes between the zzso cells and the zzso zzso end feet, but did not invade into the blood vessel zzso Dynamic analysis revealed notable similarities between the migratory behavior of zzso cells and that previously observed for zzso zzso zzso zzso cells had a characteristic leading process and migrated in a zzso fashion, with bursts of migration separated by periods of zzso and maximum speeds of over 100 zzso zzso zzso cells proliferated en route, pausing for as short as an hour to divide before the daughter cells resumed zzso zzso the majority of zzso cell divisions took place at or near vascular branch points, suggesting that zzso is triggered by local environmental zzso This study provides the first dynamic analysis of zzso cell zzso in living brain tissue and reveals that the migration and proliferation of transplanted zzso cells is directed by interactions with host brain zzso
