zzso cancer is the most frequent zzso cancer in zzso zzso outcomes for patients with advanced stage or zzso disease are zzso zzso molecular therapy against the vascular zzso growth factor zzso and its receptors constitute a new therapeutic option for these zzso The goal of our study was to assess the potential effectiveness of zzso of zzso signaling in a zzso model of zzso cancer using zzso zzso a humanized zzso against zzso We also aimed to identify molecular markers of sensitivity or resistance to this zzso We show that zzso zzso tumor growth in zzso mice by zzso molecular components of signaling pathways that sustain cell survival and zzso We also demonstrate that resistance to zzso may involve zzso of zzso genes and certain zzso We propose that zzso of zzso and zzso transcripts indicates that tumors are sensitive to zzso whereas zzso of zzso or zzso signaling and zzso of zzso or zzso and zzso mark a developing resistance to zzso zzso Interestingly, the significant zzso of zzso zzso detected in zzso tumors suggests that, in zzso zzso the zzso zzso contribute to zzso zzso
