zzso of growth arrest and zzso are, in part, controlled by the tumor zzso zzso after its zzso which causes a zzso role in its functional zzso Moreover, zzso regulate many functions such as proliferation and zzso We compared the biological activity of zzso with zzso and zzso plant steroids structurally close to zzso on proliferation rate, cell cycle distribution and zzso in human zzso zzso zzso We found that all three molecules have an zzso effect but gel shift analysis demonstrated that none of the plant steroids zzso zzso in human zzso zzso cells whereas these molecules induced zzso binding to zzso Although these plant steroids have a very close structure, only zzso caused a cell cycle arrest associated with strong zzso This biological action seems correlated with a large increase of zzso protein zzso This fact was showed by zzso analysis which confirmed that zzso strongly enhanced the zzso of zzso in contrast to zzso and zzso zzso
