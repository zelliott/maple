zzso growth zzso zzso signaling has been implicated in tumor growth, invasion, and zzso zzso of this signaling zzso by targeting the Met protein zzso zzso may be an ideal strategy for suppressing zzso tumor zzso Using zzso interference technology and zzso zzso carrying zzso zzso zzso zzso Met zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso and human Met, we can knock down zzso zzso We show a dramatic dependence on Met in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso and human tumor cell zzso Mouse zzso tumor zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso cells, as well as both human and canine prostate cancer zzso and zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso and gastric cancer zzso cells, all display a dramatic reduction of Met expression after infection with Ad Met zzso zzso In these cells, we observe suppression of tumor cell growth and viability in zzso as well as zzso of zzso growth zzso zzso scattering and invasion in zzso whether Met zzso was zzso dependent or zzso zzso Ad Met zzso zzso led to zzso cell death in many of the tumor cell lines, especially zzso and zzso but did not adversely affect zzso canine kidney zzso Met zzso zzso also zzso downstream Met signaling to molecules such as zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso We further show that zzso infection with zzso zzso zzso zzso results in a substantial reduction in tumor zzso Thus, Met zzso zzso zzso are reliable tools for studying Met function and raise the possibility of their application for cancer zzso
