To study the expression of zzso among prostate cancer cells, establish high expression cell lines of zzso and to provide potential cell mode for prostate cancer zzso and zzso 

zzso and development of prostate cancer cells, zzso zzso m zzso 22 zzso zzso and normal prostate zzso cells in the zzso zzso expression level were detected by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso method was used to package zzso zzso and zzso and zzso the prostate cancer cells, a stable high expression of zzso prostate cancer zzso zzso cell lines of zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso expression was detected by zzso and Western zzso Change of cell invasion ability was detected by zzso 

The expression level of prostate cancer cells zzso were higher than control group zzso zzso Among zzso the expression of cell line PC 3 transfer potential zzso the zzso and high transfer cell line zzso express was the zzso zzso fluorescent quantitative zzso and western zzso results showed that after zzso the seventh generation of cell zzso protein and zzso expression levels were higher than the control group zzso zzso experimental results showed that the zzso of zzso could promote the invasion ability of zzso prostate cancer zzso 

zzso expressed in prostate cancer cells is in disorder, and its action may be associated with the invasion and zzso of prostate cancer zzso successful establishment of stable high expression of zzso prostate cancer cells primarily confirm the zzso ability of zzso on prostate cancer, and lay down the Foundation for exploring the zzso role in the occurrence and development of prostate cancer zzso
