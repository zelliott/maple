zzso zzso has potent zzso zzso activity by zzso type I DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso It has not been used clinically because it is zzso and highly zzso As a result, zzso zzso a zzso analogue of zzso has been developed and used as salvage chemotherapy in patients with zzso lymphoma, but with only modest zzso Recently, we have developed a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso In this study, we evaluated the zzso zzso efficacy of zzso as compared with zzso 

We determined an in zzso zzso of zzso zzso and their zzso against multiple human zzso cell zzso In human zzso zzso the zzso inhibitions of tumor DNA zzso I zzso activity, and zzso activities of these compounds were zzso 

zzso and zzso had very high in zzso zzso against all zzso cell lines zzso As compared with zzso and zzso zzso and zzso had longer release zzso and significantly inhibit higher tumor DNA zzso I zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso showed significantly prolonged the survival of animals bearing zzso and zzso human zzso when compared with zzso at its maximum tolerated dose in zzso 

The promising present results provide the basis for a phase I clinical trial in patients with zzso zzso
