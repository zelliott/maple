zzso expression systems are useful tools for the study of gene function but the use of these systems in prostate cancer cells is limited by the zzso biological effects of the inducing zzso The zzso system employs zzso zzso 1 zzso a zzso analog of the insect hormone zzso to activate a modified nuclear zzso zzso that controls target gene expression via zzso response zzso This system has not been tested in prostate cancer zzso 

We established zzso human prostate cancer cell lines that zzso express zzso zzso factors to zzso zzso expression and assess the effects of zzso on cell proliferation and zzso gene zzso Potential zzso genes were identified using zzso zzso and validated by Northern zzso zzso A zzso format was developed to establish cell lines that zzso produce a zzso zzso 

zzso cell lines displayed tight and potent (over several orders of zzso zzso regulation of a zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso zzso did not affect zzso or zzso cell proliferation and exerted minimal effects on the expression of zzso zzso Cell lines established using the zzso system also displayed strictly zzso production of the zzso protein zzso by the zzso integrated zzso expression zzso 

The zzso system is well suited for conditional gene expression in prostate cancer zzso The zzso format should facilitate the production of stable cell zzso This system should be useful for the study of proteins involved in prostate cancer in both cell and animal models of the zzso
