zzso C zzso is a zzso drug that requires an zzso zzso to exert its biological zzso Upon reduction, zzso is converted into a highly zzso zzso intermediate that zzso cellular zzso zzso of DNA is the most favored mechanism of action for zzso but other modes of action, such as zzso cycling and zzso of zzso may also contribute to the biological action of the zzso In this work, we show that zzso zzso zzso is also a cellular target for zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso in zzso using zzso zzso and in zzso using cancer cell zzso The zzso presents distinctive parameters of zzso zzso it is zzso and zzso and zzso Additionally, zzso experiments zzso circular zzso show that the zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso On the basis of kinetic and zzso data, we propose a chemical mechanism for the zzso of the zzso that starts with a reduction of the zzso ring of zzso by the zzso active site of zzso and a subsequent zzso of the active site by the activated zzso We also report that zzso zzso zzso in cancer cell cultures and that this zzso zzso directly with the zzso of the drug, indicating that zzso of zzso may play a major role in the biological mode of action of the zzso
