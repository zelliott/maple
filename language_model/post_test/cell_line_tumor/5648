zzso protein is present in six different zzso forms in the human brain and interacts with zzso via either 3 or 4 zzso binding zzso An increased ratio of 3 repeat to 4 repeat zzso is associated with zzso in inherited forms of zzso zzso zzso zzso diminishes zzso transport in several systems, but differential effects of 3 repeat and 4 repeat zzso have not been zzso We examined the effects of zzso on zzso transport and found that both 3 repeat and 4 repeat zzso change normal zzso distribution within the cell body and reduce zzso zzso to zzso 4 repeat zzso has a greater effect than 3 repeat zzso Further, we observed that the 3 repeat and 4 repeat zzso cause different zzso in retrograde and zzso transport dynamics with 3 repeat zzso having a slightly stronger effect on zzso transport zzso Our results indicate that zzso changes in zzso transport may be an underlying theme in neurodegenerative diseases associated with zzso specific changes in zzso interaction with zzso
