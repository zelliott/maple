Gene therapy is a promising approach for the treatment of zzso Strategies for gene zzso delivery include systemic and zzso zzso zzso delivery of zzso has generally employed direct injections into single or multiple locations throughout the tumor zzso However, this approach leads to zzso zzso of zzso within tumors and becomes cumbersome as the required number of injections is zzso We have investigated the effectiveness of an zzso zzso gene delivery based on using tiny metallic seeds zzso analogous to technology used for zzso zzso for zzso use of zzso was demonstrated expressing reporter plasmids zzso zzso protein or zzso in human zzso prostate zzso zzso analysis confirmed effective zzso delivery, zzso zzso and zzso of reporter genes within zzso zzso of zzso for delivery of zzso zzso was examined by generating a zzso zzso necrosis zzso zzso expressing zzso under the zzso promoter and zzso zzso zzso with this zzso into prostate cancer zzso zzso protein expression was observed around the ends of seeds and decreasing in an exponential zzso as a function of zzso The expression of zzso resulted in tumor growth delay of a human prostate cancer zzso These results demonstrate the feasibility of applying zzso delivery of gene expressing zzso for the treatment of human zzso
