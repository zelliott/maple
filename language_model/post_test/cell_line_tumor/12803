The zzso properties of zzso zzso have attracted extensive attention after successfully inducing zzso of acute zzso leukemia zzso However, the therapeutic spectrum should not only be restricted to acute zzso zzso but should also extend into other types of tumor zzso In this study, we aimed at investigating its potential application to clinical zzso in oral zzso In this zzso animal test, primarily cultured cells from the tumor sites and normal sites of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plus 500 zzso zzso oral cancer zzso zzso mice model were examined for their zzso after treatments of zzso zzso zzso other zzso In this model, the mice were treated with zzso plus zzso zzso in their drinking water for eight weeks zzso and the drugs were withdrawn for another 10 or 20 weeks zzso and zzso zzso The results showed that 2 zzso of zzso zzso zzso treatment suppressed the zzso of cells primarily cultured from the tumor sites of zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice to zzso zzso and zzso However, it also suppressed the zzso of cells from the zzso mice of zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso treatment for 24 zzso which suppressed the zzso of cells primarily cultured from the tumor sites of zzso zzso and zzso mice to zzso and zzso was examined for its synergistic effects on the two primarily cultured cell lines with other zzso The results showed that zzso zzso zzso enhanced the zzso effects of zzso zzso to zzso better than those of 4 zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso or 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso At the same time, zzso zzso zzso plus zzso zzso zzso zzso treatments caused only zzso and zzso of cell death in the control zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso zzso combination on primarily cultured cells from this oral cancer model should be confirmed in human oral cancer cell lines before its application in clinical therapy, and the detailed mechanism is worth further zzso
