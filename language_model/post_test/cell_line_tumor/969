zzso labeling of zzso is an zzso method for labeling large quantities zzso zzso of target zzso for zzso zzso We have developed an efficient labeling system that uses T4 zzso zzso to attach a zzso donor zzso to target zzso zzso analyses indicate that directly labeled zzso is zzso labeled, has higher signal intensity than comparable labeling methods and achieves high transcript detection zzso The labeled donor zzso we have developed allows the attachment of multiple zzso which increases target signal intensity up to zzso We have used this zzso method to detect previously discovered class predictor genes for two types of zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso and acute zzso leukemia zzso In order to test the sensitivity of direct zzso zzso we analyzed the zzso and ALL expression profiles for predictor genes that were previously found to show elevated expression in the disease zzso zzso labeling of zzso zzso zzso detects zzso of the class predictor genes that are detected by the zzso target amplification method used to discover the zzso These results indicate that the detection sensitivity, simplicity zzso tube zzso and speed (2 zzso of this direct labeling protocol may be ideal for diagnostic applications that do not require target zzso
