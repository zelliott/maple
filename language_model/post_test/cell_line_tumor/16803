Our previous results demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides zzso and zzso inhibit vascular zzso growth factor production and tumor zzso The present study was designed to test whether zzso zzso peptides inhibit the expression and activity of zzso zzso zzso which plays a critical role in the production of zzso factors and zzso zzso zzso was used to examine the expression of zzso in tumor zzso zzso real-time zzso chain reaction, zzso and zzso activity zzso were used to determine the expression and activity of zzso in human zzso cancer cell zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso treatment dramatically decreased zzso expression in mouse zzso tumor zzso zzso inhibited the expression and activity of zzso induced by low oxygen zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso acid, and insulin in two human zzso cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso zzso had no effect on the zzso zzso of zzso but inhibited the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso leading to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso dramatically accelerated the zzso protein degradation of zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso on zzso expression is in part zzso by the zzso oxygen zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso peptides inhibit the expression and activity of zzso in both in zzso and in zzso models, suggesting the zzso of zzso may be a critical mechanism responsible for the suppression of tumor progression by zzso zzso zzso
