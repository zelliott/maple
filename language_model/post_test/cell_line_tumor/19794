zzso zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso recognizes zzso zzso sequences of several cell surface zzso We demonstrate zzso that the zzso recognizes appropriate zzso on the zzso and zzso zzso layer from second zzso human zzso and on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso cells was diminished by the zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso also inhibited zzso cell proliferation in a zzso zzso Similar zzso effects were also observed with an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we conclude that zzso of zzso and zzso zzso on zzso cells may have regulatory effects on cell zzso
