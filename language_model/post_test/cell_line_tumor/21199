To develop a zzso drug zzso zzso zzso zzso 1000 zzso zzso was employed as a carrier of zzso zzso to enhance its therapeutic effects and reduce its side zzso zzso was chemically zzso to zzso The molecular structure, drug loading efficiency, drug release zzso and stability of the zzso were zzso The cellular zzso zzso distribution, and zzso were zzso by using zzso breast cancer cells and zzso zzso cells as in zzso cell zzso The zzso showed higher cellular zzso efficiency and broader distribution within the zzso Judged by zzso the zzso was found zzso zzso zzso more effective with zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso more effective with zzso cells than the parent drug after 24, 48, 72 h culture, zzso The in zzso zzso and zzso were investigated after an zzso administration at 5 zzso zzso body weight in zzso zzso zzso increase in the zzso and zzso increase in the zzso zzso of zzso were achieved for the zzso zzso compared with the free zzso The drug level in heart, gastric and zzso was significantly reduced, which is an indication of reduced side zzso Our zzso zzso showed great potential to be a zzso of higher therapeutic effects and fewer side effects than zzso zzso
