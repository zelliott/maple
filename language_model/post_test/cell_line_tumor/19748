zzso zzso is an important human and animal zzso During infection, this zzso is able to attach to and enter host cells by using its cell zzso factors to bind to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we determined that a protein exported by zzso zzso zzso can interfere with the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso by human lung zzso cells zzso The zzso of zzso production significantly increased bacterial zzso and invasion into the zzso zzso In contrast, bacterial zzso and invasion was inhibited by both overproduction of zzso and the addition of zzso to the culture zzso Moreover, our results showed that the quantitative effects on invasion closely parallel those of zzso This suggests that the effect on invasion is probably secondary to, and a consequence of, the reduced adherence caused by zzso zzso Specifically, we demonstrated that zzso interacts with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which indicates that zzso may be a potential zzso of zzso on zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicate that exported zzso zzso the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso by interfering with zzso zzso cell zzso
