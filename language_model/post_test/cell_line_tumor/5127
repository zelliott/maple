Despite the prevalence of anemia in cancer, zzso zzso zzso has declined in use because of recent Phase III trials showing more rapid cancer progression and reduced survival in subjects zzso to zzso Since zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso of zzso signaling in zzso cells, we hypothesized that zzso might be especially harmful in patients whose tumors express high levels of these zzso Because of the zzso of zzso for detecting low level zzso zzso we developed zzso to measure levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso We tested 23 archival breast tumors as well as 136 archival head and neck zzso from zzso a Phase III trial of zzso patients zzso to zzso versus zzso zzso with zzso following complete zzso partial zzso or no zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels varied zzso zzso and zzso across the breast zzso and zzso zzso and zzso across the head and neck zzso zzso zzso zzso survival zzso did not differ among patients whose head and neck zzso expressed zzso versus zzso levels of zzso zzso or zzso except in the zzso of patients with zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso where zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels were all associated with significantly poorer zzso Our results provide a framework for exploring the relationship between zzso cancer zzso and survival using archival tumors from other Phase III clinical zzso
