Increased expression of zzso zzso in several zzso zzso promotes tumor zzso however, the mechanism underlying its zzso regulation remains zzso Here, we show that depletion of zzso protein zzso 2 zzso activates zzso zzso that results in a strong increase of zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso growth, and zzso In contrast, stabilization of zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso cells but not in zzso cells or cells expressing zzso zzso indicating that zzso requires a zzso to inhibit zzso zzso zzso with our in zzso findings, a strong correlation between zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso was observed in zzso human breast zzso Under loss of function of zzso or zzso the zzso family members zzso and zzso strongly activate zzso zzso These data, by revealing that zzso expression is zzso zzso in tumors by zzso and zzso to impair zzso tumor zzso suggest that loss of zzso function favors the formation of zzso complex with the zzso members of the zzso family to allow zzso zzso
