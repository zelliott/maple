zzso the zzso of zzso from existing blood vessels, is central to zzso growth and zzso however the molecular regulation of this process remains to be fully zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is one potential zzso factor, and clinical studies have demonstrated zzso cells within a number of zzso types to express high levels of zzso compared to those in normal zzso Additionally, zzso can increase zzso cell survival, proliferation and migration, as well as induce zzso cell tube formation in zzso This study aims to zzso the processes involved in the zzso effects of zzso in zzso and also how zzso levels may be regulated within the zzso zzso 

It has previously been demonstrated that zzso can induce tube formation on growth factor reduced zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso enhances the zzso effects of zzso and that zzso does not stimulate zzso cell tube formation through zzso of the zzso zzso We also show that cell contact between zzso and the zzso breast cancer cell line increases zzso cell zzso zzso and protein zzso levels in in zzso zzso These increases in zzso cell zzso zzso were dependent on zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso had no effect on zzso zzso zzso 

These findings suggest that the zzso zzso zzso is not involved in zzso the zzso effects of zzso on zzso cells in zzso Additionally, we show that breast cancer cells cause increased levels of zzso expression by zzso cells, and that direct contact between zzso cells and zzso cells is required in order to increase zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso of zzso zzso was shown to involve zzso zzso and zzso zzso
