In multiple myeloma zzso zzso is strongly correlated to disease progression and zzso outcome, and may be promoted by bone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we here identified the zzso factor zzso zzso as the most highly zzso gene in zzso cells exposed to zzso zzso plasma cells from the majority of zzso patients, belonging to distinct genetic subgroups, zzso express zzso Already under zzso conditions, a subset of zzso highly expressed and zzso zzso which could not be further enhanced by zzso or zzso zzso stabilization of zzso factor zzso In line with this, expression of AM did not correlate with expression of a panel of established zzso genes in zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso promotion of zzso cell proliferation and tube formation is zzso by zzso expression of AM and strongly zzso by zzso of zzso and zzso AM zzso Together, our results demonstrate that zzso cells, both in a zzso and zzso fashion, zzso express and zzso zzso which can mediate zzso zzso Thus, AM zzso can be a major driving force for the zzso switch observed during zzso evolution, which renders AM a putative target for zzso zzso
