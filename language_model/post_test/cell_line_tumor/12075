zzso zzso of zzso is responsible for zzso syndrome, an zzso dominant disorder characterized by benign zzso of the zzso tract and an increased predisposition to certain zzso including zzso zzso zzso in zzso are rarely observed in most sporadic tumor types except for zzso of the lung where up to 50% harbor zzso zzso In this study, we focused on zzso zzso in lung cancer cell lines originating from large cell zzso We identified a novel zzso zzso deletion within zzso gene in zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso analysis showed that the deletion is accompanied by zzso of one parental zzso indicating zzso zzso of zzso This deletion results in an zzso transcript lacking zzso 2 and 3 and a predicted zzso deletion of 58 zzso acids within the zzso domain of the zzso zzso The truncated transcript was expressed at relatively low levels, and the truncated zzso protein was virtually zzso in this cell zzso To determine the impact of zzso protein zzso on its function, we examined zzso a downstream target of zzso zzso activity triggered by low energy stress zzso zzso of zzso was attenuated in zzso cells treated with zzso and could be rescued by expression of an zzso zzso fusion zzso zzso our data suggest that zzso function is compromised in zzso Of the four cell lines and six primary tumors of large cell lung zzso origin that have been evaluated in this and other studies, zzso zzso have been found in three zzso These results suggest that, in addition to zzso acquired loss of function zzso in zzso may also be frequently involved in the zzso of large cell lung zzso
