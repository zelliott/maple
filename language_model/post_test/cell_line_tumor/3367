zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso acts as a zzso zzso zzso Although zzso cellular differentiation and growth zzso have been mostly studied on human zzso expressing zzso it is unclear if the zzso zzso of zzso is the main mechanism of growth zzso In this study, we investigated whether there is a link between growth zzso effect and zzso zzso of zzso in several gastrointestinal zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso potential of zzso was assessed by reporter gene zzso employing a zzso zzso and growth zzso effect of zzso was investigated by zzso incorporation zzso in the presence or absence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso As expected, in the case of cell lines positive for the zzso zzso potential of zzso zzso zzso and zzso both the zzso induced growth zzso However, in case of some other cell lines negative for the zzso zzso potential of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso still showed a growth zzso zzso Administration of the zzso zzso zzso did not reverse this growth zzso activity of zzso The introduction of dominant negative zzso of zzso did not suppress the activity zzso These observations suggest that while zzso zzso cellular growth predominantly through zzso zzso of zzso zzso can induce it both in zzso and zzso zzso
