zzso zzso zzso is an aggressive zzso its mechanisms of development and progression are poorly zzso We used an zzso approach to identify zzso driver zzso defined as genes whose copy numbers associate with gene expression and cancer zzso 

We combined data from zzso zzso comparative zzso zzso and zzso analysis of zzso samples from 76 patients with zzso B virus infection with data on patient survival zzso zzso genes were functionally validated using in zzso and in zzso zzso 

zzso analyses of array comparative zzso zzso data associated loss of zzso zzso with poor outcome zzso survival zzso zzso copy number zzso correlated with expression of zzso of genes zzso We associated expression levels of 10 of these genes with patient survival times in 2 independent zzso zzso 319 cases of zzso with mixed zzso and 3 breast cancer zzso zzso zzso Among the zzso signature, a cluster of 6 genes on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were deleted in zzso from patients with poor zzso In zzso and in zzso analyses indicated that the products of zzso zzso and zzso have zzso activities, along with the known tumor zzso gene zzso 

We used an unbiased approach to identify 10 genes associated with zzso zzso These might be used in assisting diagnosis and to stage tumors based on gene expression zzso
