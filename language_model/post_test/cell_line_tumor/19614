zzso zzso acid interactions between zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso domain are critical for the formation of the zzso zzso Core zzso a short zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso region, containing two positively charged zzso zzso is known to inhibit zzso function in zzso and in zzso The aim of this study was to examine peptides corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso region binding to zzso for their ability to inhibit zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso Three peptides matching the zzso sequence of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and tested in different biological in zzso and in zzso systems for their effect on zzso zzso The zzso had no impact on zzso function in zzso but surprisingly, decreased signs of inflammation in the zzso arthritis rat model in zzso zzso evidence suggests that peptides with zzso zzso sequences can inhibit an immune response as assessed by zzso zzso The lack of in zzso activity may lead to a wasteful disregard of active compounds in the process of drug discovery and zzso
