zzso zzso chemotherapy is an effective way of treating local and regional zzso confined in the zzso cavity such as zzso zzso However, a persistent major challenge in zzso chemotherapy is the need to provide effective drug zzso in the zzso cavity for an extended period of zzso We hypothesized that zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso would serve as a carrier of zzso zzso particles to improve their zzso retention and therapeutic zzso zzso gel degradation and release zzso studies demonstrated that zzso gels could zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and release the drug over 10 days, gradually zzso by zzso but had limited effect on retention of zzso a zzso zzso form of zzso When administered zzso to zzso nude mice, zzso was best retained in the zzso cavity as zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso whereas zzso and other zzso zzso left negligible amount of zzso in the cavity after 14 zzso Despite the increase in zzso retention of zzso zzso did not further decrease the tumor burdens than zzso zzso presumably due to the limited dissolution of zzso This result indicates that spatial availability of a drug does not necessarily translate to the enhanced zzso effect unless it is accompanied by the zzso zzso
