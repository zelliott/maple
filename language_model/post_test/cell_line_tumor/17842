The zzso VI zzso zzso protein is a key zzso for synthesis of zzso Lewis X and Lewis X in zzso zzso Despite its importance, how zzso VI expression is regulated has not previously been zzso In this work, we examined zzso regulation of the zzso VI gene in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso amplification of zzso ends analysis revealed zzso start sites of zzso VI in zzso cells at zzso and zzso zzso zzso downstream of the position registered in the Data Base of Human zzso Start zzso We determined promoter regions for zzso VI in zzso cells using a zzso reporter gene zzso The promoter activities of zzso located zzso of the zzso start site decreased when the zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso regions were zzso zzso zzso of these regions revealed that two zzso nuclear zzso alpha zzso zzso and one zzso binding zzso zzso zzso binding sites are essential for zzso VI zzso Furthermore, transient zzso of zzso alpha but not zzso enhanced both zzso VI promoter activities and zzso VI zzso levels in zzso zzso These results suggest that two defined regions in the zzso region of the zzso VI zzso start site are critical for zzso VI zzso in zzso zzso
