New zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and their zzso effect on the growth of tumor cell lines was zzso The human tumor cell lines used were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso transitional cell zzso The in zzso zzso activity of the new zzso was discussed in terms of zzso zzso zzso zzso studies with zzso zzso were also carried out with the zzso compounds in order to evaluate the potential of these compounds to interact with the zzso group of the zzso The results have demonstrated that the linear compounds have the most pronounced activity against tumor cell lines and this might be related to the better accessibility that these compounds have to the active site in relation to the angular ones that have shown in the majority of the cases multiple binding poses in the active site of zzso
