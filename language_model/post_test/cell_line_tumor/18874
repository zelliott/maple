zzso is a potent and highly selective zzso zzso inhibitor from a novel zzso zzso structural class that blocks the proliferation of zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells but does not affect the growth of zzso zzso Treatment of human cancer cells with zzso inhibited zzso of functionally important zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso and blocked downstream signal zzso pathways responsible for proliferation and zzso A single dose of compound reduced zzso of zzso receptors in zzso mice, demonstrating target suppression in zzso zzso distribution studies show that zzso crosses the zzso barrier and zzso into tumors, where it is able to accumulate to higher levels than those found in the zzso zzso showed oral zzso activity in human tumor zzso models that zzso zzso and zzso In an zzso zzso tumor model, zzso extended survival relative to zzso zzso The brain is a primary site of zzso for zzso lung zzso and zzso breast zzso zzso the ability to penetrate into the brain could be an advantage over existing therapies such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are zzso and do not cross the zzso zzso These results show that zzso is orally zzso has activity against zzso and zzso tumor zzso and can penetrate into the brain and inhibit zzso tumor zzso
