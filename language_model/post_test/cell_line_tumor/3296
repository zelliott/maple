The aim of this study was to examine the potential usefulness of a zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso and a zzso sandwich zzso as diagnostic tools in breast zzso 

We studied peripheral blood samples from 147 zzso zzso women with zzso breast cancer and gathered patient information regarding zzso and clinical staging of zzso The samples were tested for zzso and three breast zzso gene transcripts by a zzso real-time zzso zzso and for serum zzso protein by a sandwich zzso zzso 

In zzso of the breast cancer blood samples, a positive signal was obtained in the zzso zzso zzso detecting zzso and three complementary transcribed zzso Fifty samples from healthy female donors tested zzso zzso correlations were found between zzso protein in serum, presence of zzso zzso cells in blood, stage of disease, and tumor zzso zzso zzso protein was detected in zzso of the breast cancer zzso and was increased in 38% in comparison with a mixed control zzso The zzso zzso and the zzso for zzso produced a combined sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso 

The zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso cells could be valuable tools for diagnosis and prognosis of breast zzso
