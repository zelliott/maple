The zzso significance of zzso has been well established in zzso zzso cancer zzso Clear cell and zzso zzso are especially generally accepted to result in an adverse outcome because of their poor chemotherapy zzso Previous reports suggested that class III zzso induced zzso resistance in association with a reduced effect on zzso dynamic zzso Thus, this study aimed to evaluate class III zzso expression and examine whether the protein level of class III zzso was correlated with the zzso difference in zzso Class III zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso scored into 4 groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso class III zzso expression was detected in 30 of 35 clear cell zzso in 8 of 10 zzso zzso 5 of 11 zzso zzso and 5 of 24 zzso zzso zzso patients were zzso for zzso In 5 responders, high-level class III zzso expression was not zzso On the other hand, it was detected in 10 of 14 zzso In some zzso cancer cell lines, we evaluated class III zzso expression by Western zzso zzso Class III zzso expression in zzso zzso tended to be higher than that in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells showed high-level class III zzso expression compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity differing among zzso zzso in zzso is associated with the expression of class III zzso
