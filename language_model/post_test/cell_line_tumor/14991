zzso zzso zzso of zzso and is a leading cause of zzso morbidity and zzso Although the cause is unknown, the reduced zzso of zzso zzso is generally regarded as a key feature of zzso zzso The present study examined the expression of zzso zzso zzso tissue inhibitor of zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in severe zzso zzso and normal zzso using real-time zzso and zzso The expression levels of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso while zzso and zzso levels were decreased in severe zzso zzso when compared with normal zzso To explore the underlying molecular mechanisms, zzso cells were zzso with an zzso construct as well as a zzso against zzso The zzso of zzso decreased the invasive abilities of zzso zzso zzso induction was followed by the induction of zzso and zzso and a significant reduction of zzso and zzso Whereas in zzso zzso cells, we observed the decreased expression of zzso and zzso and the increased expression of zzso and zzso We zzso that zzso may suppress zzso invasion by repression of zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso thus leading to shallow zzso in severe zzso
