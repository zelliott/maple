zzso of nearly all zzso viruses depends on a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our earlier work found that zzso zzso zzso C virus zzso zzso zzso was able to initiate zzso synthesis de zzso by using zzso (A and zzso but not zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For most human zzso zzso the initiation zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso were found to be either an zzso zzso or zzso zzso To determine the zzso used for initiation and control of zzso zzso zzso a genetic zzso analysis of the zzso at the very zzso and 3' ends of zzso zzso was performed by using a zzso zzso zzso replication zzso Either a G or an A at the zzso end of zzso zzso zzso was able to efficiently induce cell colony formation, whereas a zzso C at the zzso end dramatically reduced the efficiency of cell colony zzso Likewise, the zzso zzso zzso zzso did not significantly affect the efficiency of cell colony zzso In contrast, a zzso zzso at the 3' end caused a remarkable decrease in cell colony formation, and a zzso zzso resulted in a complete abolition of cell colony zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso recovered from zzso zzso cells revealed several interesting zzso First, the zzso zzso G of the zzso zzso was changed to an A upon multiple rounds of zzso Second, the zzso A at the zzso end was zzso maintained among all zzso zzso isolated from zzso cells zzso with an zzso with a zzso zzso Third, initiation of zzso zzso replication with a zzso resulted in a zzso reduction in the levels of zzso zzso suggesting that initiation of zzso replication with zzso was very zzso Fourth, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were all reverted back to a zzso zzso zzso In addition, extra U and zzso zzso were identified at the 3' ends of zzso recovered from zzso cells zzso with an zzso with a zzso G at the 3' zzso We also determined the zzso zzso of zzso zzso of some clinical zzso zzso Either G or A was identified at the zzso end of zzso zzso zzso depending on the specific zzso zzso zzso these findings demonstrate that replication of zzso zzso zzso was zzso initiated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso replication is invariably initiated with an zzso
