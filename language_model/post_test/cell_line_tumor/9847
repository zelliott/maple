zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the protein product of the zzso zzso type 1 zzso encodes a zzso zzso that zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso result in zzso zzso due to zzso in zzso formation, suggesting that zzso is a key player in the zzso of zzso To address the function of zzso in zzso zzso we have used zzso zzso and combined zzso and zzso methods to investigate zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and expression in human pigmented zzso zzso zzso loss of function leads to decreased pigmentation and causes formation of enlarged zzso zzso harboring zzso zzso structures and displaying proteins of mature zzso and zzso at their zzso Moreover, we show that zzso interacts zzso with the zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso by zzso leads to a decreased stability of zzso and is accompanied by similar defects in zzso zzso and zzso These data show for the first time that zzso composition and identity are regulated at early stages by zzso and that zzso likely acts as an escort protein for this zzso
