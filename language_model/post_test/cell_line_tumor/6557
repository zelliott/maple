Long chain zzso zzso zzso zzso the initial step in long chain fatty acid zzso Of the five zzso zzso zzso cloned and zzso zzso is the only zzso found to be located, in part, on zzso and thus was hypothesized to be involved in fatty acid zzso To zzso the specific roles of zzso in fatty acid zzso we used zzso zzso of zzso zzso in rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso to both zzso and zzso zzso When compared with cells infected with zzso zzso cells at 24 h after infection had zzso higher zzso zzso activities and zzso higher rates of fatty acid zzso when incubated with 500 zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso acid to cellular zzso zzso increased zzso in zzso cells, but when compared with control cells, metabolism to zzso zzso zzso and medium zzso did not differ zzso The incorporation of zzso and zzso into zzso was similar in zzso cells, thus indicating that zzso increased zzso synthesis through both de zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso acid incorporation into cellular lipids showed that, when compared with control cells, zzso cells did not increase the metabolism of fatty acids that were derived from de zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso of fatty acids into cells is regulated by metabolism and that zzso zzso partitions zzso derived fatty acids toward zzso synthesis and zzso
