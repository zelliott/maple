To investigate the effects of combined radiation and subsequent zzso treatment on the human zzso zzso cell line zzso and its zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso cells were treated with various zzso doses (5 zzso zzso followed 60 zzso later by zzso treatment and subsequently zzso for survival using a conventional colony zzso For zzso the subsequent zzso treatment was zzso 1, 10 and 20 zzso for 1 zzso For the more zzso zzso cells, the subsequent zzso treatment was 10 and 50 zzso for 1 zzso 

The zzso zzso cells were not zzso to zzso zzso treatment with an zzso concentration of zzso (10 and 50 zzso for zzso and zzso zzso resulted in zzso for zzso but not for zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells followed by treatment with 10 and 50 zzso zzso for 1 h resulted in radiation survival zzso displaying a significant zzso hypersensitive region followed by increased zzso at higher zzso A total of 10 zzso zzso resulted in zzso confined to the zzso region zzso and zzso zzso whereas the higher zzso treatment of 50 zzso resulted in the appearance of a hypersensitive region together with a reduction of the increased zzso zzso In contrast, zzso treatment zzso 1, 10 and 20 zzso for 1 zzso of zzso cells had no significant effect on survival following zzso or zzso zzso and actually resulted in an increased zzso radiation survival zzso zzso and 1 zzso when survival was corrected for zzso treatment ( zzso for all zzso zzso zzso 

The significant zzso for zzso given subsequent treatment with 50 zzso zzso indicates zzso can inhibit the increased zzso response in zzso zzso In contrast, the subsequent zzso treatment of zzso cells can enhance their survival following low radiation zzso
