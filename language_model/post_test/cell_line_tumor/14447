The zzso fusion zzso a product of the zzso zzso zzso is detected in zzso of Ewing zzso and primitive zzso zzso It is thought to be a zzso zzso that plays a significant role in zzso In this study, we developed a novel zzso blockade system using zzso interference and tested its application for zzso the proliferation of Ewing zzso cells in zzso and the treatment of mouse tumor zzso in zzso We designed and zzso a small interfering zzso zzso possessing an aromatic compound at the zzso targeting the zzso of zzso As this sequence is present only in tumor cells, it is a potentially relevant zzso We found that the zzso targeting zzso significantly suppressed the expression of zzso protein sequence specifically and also reduced the expression of zzso protein in Ewing zzso zzso We further demonstrated that zzso of zzso expression efficiently inhibited the proliferation of the zzso cells but did not induce zzso cell zzso In addition, the zzso possessing the aromatic compound at the zzso was more resistant to zzso degradation than the unmodified zzso Administration of the zzso with zzso significantly inhibited the tumor growth of zzso a Ewing zzso cell line, which had been zzso zzso into zzso Moreover, modification of the zzso with an aromatic compound improved its efficiency in zzso Our data suggest that specific zzso of zzso by zzso interference is a possible approach for the treatment of Ewing zzso
