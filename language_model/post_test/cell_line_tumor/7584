zzso zzso zzso is a tumor zzso gene that encodes a zzso belonging to the zzso factor family of zzso zzso Although zzso expression is frequently lost in gastric zzso zzso the zzso pathways that are affected have yet to be zzso The aim of the current study was to identify the zzso by which the zzso gene is regulated in gastric zzso In this study, zzso was shown to be silenced or zzso in gastric tumor tissue compared with matched zzso zzso In addition, human gastric cells zzso expressed zzso The zzso status in the promoter zzso islands appeared to be correlated with zzso expression levels in gastric cell lines or zzso zzso Further molecular analysis indicated that the zzso islands play a role in the promoter activity of the zzso zzso The expression of zzso and DNA zzso of its promoter affected cell proliferation and zzso The expression of zzso in gastric cell lines was restored with a zzso agent, zzso Low expression of zzso in gastric cell lines and cancer tissue is associated with zzso In conclusion, the current study demonstrates that DNA zzso is a key mechanism of zzso zzso expression in human gastric cells and zzso gene zzso of the zzso islands is a potential zzso for zzso
