Despite vast improvements in our understanding of cancer zzso a large percentage of cancer cases present without knowledge of the zzso genetic zzso zzso zzso are frequently implicated in the zzso of numerous types of cancer, but identification and validation of zzso zzso targets in cancer can be a time-consuming zzso We report the establishment of an efficient, functional screening zzso using zzso technology to directly assess and compare the effect of individually targeting each member of the zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso screening can identify zzso zzso targets containing zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso in zzso cells and zzso zzso in zzso zzso In addition, this zzso identifies targets that do not contain zzso such as zzso and the focal zzso zzso zzso that are crucial to the survival of the cancer zzso This technique, with additional development, might eventually offer the potential to match specific therapies with individual patients based on a functional zzso
