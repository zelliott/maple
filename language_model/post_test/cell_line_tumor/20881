The production of zzso oxygen species zzso exerts an additional tier of control over zzso zzso signal zzso by zzso zzso the zzso activity of specific protein zzso zzso zzso zzso the ability to detect zzso zzso of zzso in zzso is critical to understanding the complex biological role of zzso in the control of cellular zzso Here, we describe an zzso for identifying those zzso that are zzso oxidized in zzso which zzso the unique chemistry of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in labeling the active site with zzso small molecules under mildly zzso zzso We have applied this zzso zzso to the study of zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling in an zzso cell zzso Doing so has allowed us to detect zzso zzso of several proteins in response to sustained zzso zzso As in other cell systems, we have observed the zzso zzso of the classical zzso zzso and the tumor zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso Furthermore, we detected zzso zzso of members of two other zzso of zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso These data demonstrate the broad selectivity of the zzso allowing us to detect representatives of all of the major zzso of the zzso zzso We anticipate that this zzso enrichment strategy can be applied broadly to study zzso zzso as a mechanism of harnessing zzso zzso activity in a variety of signaling zzso
