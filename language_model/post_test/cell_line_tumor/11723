The zzso of A zzso and zzso 10 zzso has been found to be closely associated with the development and progression of various types of zzso However, zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso and its significance remain largely zzso The present study aimed to investigate the expression of zzso in human zzso and the effect of zzso gene zzso by zzso on the zzso invasion and migration of zzso human zzso zzso zzso was performed to examine the expression of zzso in human zzso zzso and in the adjacent zzso zzso from 30 patients with zzso zzso interference was used to knock down zzso expression in zzso human zzso cells and the proliferation and migration as well as the invasive ability of the treated cells were observed in zzso The expression of zzso protein in zzso zzso was significantly higher when compared to that in adjacent zzso zzso ( zzso The high expression of zzso in cancer was significantly correlated with clinical outcomes ( zzso zzso of zzso resulted in zzso of proliferation and migration as well as invasion of zzso human zzso cells ( zzso These studies suggest that zzso plays an important role in regulating zzso invasion and migration of zzso zzso High expression of zzso may be a valuable zzso factor for zzso zzso and zzso is potentially an important therapeutic target for the prevention of tumor development and progression in zzso
