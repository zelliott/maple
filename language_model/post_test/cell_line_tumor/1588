In a previous study, we showed that a combination of an oral zzso zzso agent zzso and zzso zzso had synergistic effects on cell growth and cell cycle arrest in the pancreatic cancer cell line zzso zzso zzso we conducted further zzso studies using the pancreatic cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso The combined effect of zzso and zzso in zzso cells was evaluated using an zzso zzso zzso zzso and the effects of zzso zzso and zzso plus zzso on cell cycle regulation were assessed using flow zzso We also examined the expression of several cell cycle regulatory proteins in both zzso zzso and zzso cells by western zzso Classical zzso analysis of the zzso zzso results showed that the combination of zzso and zzso had a synergistic effect in zzso cells, and flow zzso analysis of the cell cycle showed that the combination of zzso plus zzso induced zzso arrest to a greater degree than did either zzso or zzso zzso Also, the combination of zzso and zzso resulted in the zzso of zzso D1 expression and zzso of zzso A, zzso and zzso expression zzso Treatment of zzso zzso and zzso cells with a combination of both drugs also led to the increased zzso of checkpoint zzso zzso Combined treatment with zzso and zzso resulted in more prolonged zzso arrest than with either treatment zzso This difference is shown to be potentially due to the higher levels of zzso checkpoint zzso 1 in pancreatic cancer cell lines treated with the two zzso
