zzso zzso gene expression is under the control of zzso factor 1 zzso and is zzso regulated by zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso which increase the binding activity of zzso and inhibit zzso promoter activity, are increased in patients with anemia of chronic disease zzso We previously demonstrated the ability of zzso (a zzso zzso when injected zzso to improve zzso production that had been inhibited by zzso or zzso zzso In the present study, we examined the ability of both zzso which zzso zzso and enhances zzso binding activity, and zzso which has no effect on zzso or zzso binding activity, to improve zzso production following zzso by zzso or zzso in zzso cells in zzso and in an in zzso mouse zzso zzso administration of zzso reversed the decreases in zzso and serum zzso zzso zzso counts, and numbers of zzso zzso units zzso induced by zzso or zzso These results raise the possibility of using orally administered zzso for treating patients with zzso
