Human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso protein plays an important role in zzso zzso zzso and zzso death are two hallmarks of zzso infection of the central nervous system zzso However, whether there is a direct link between zzso zzso zzso and subsequent zzso death is not zzso In this study, we expressed zzso in zzso and examined zzso effects on zzso function and subsequent zzso zzso The results showed that zzso expression resulted in a significant increase in zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso a cellular marker of zzso zzso or zzso The zzso zzso reporter gene zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso expression at the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso expression markedly impaired zzso zzso by zzso zzso cell culture zzso from zzso zzso induced dramatic zzso zzso Taken together, these data provide evidence for the first time to directly link zzso expression in zzso to zzso zzso dysfunction, and subsequent zzso zzso In addition, these data suggest that zzso dysfunction zzso at least in part, to zzso zzso and subsequently zzso zzso
