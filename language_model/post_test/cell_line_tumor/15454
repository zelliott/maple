zzso is the most common zzso solid tumor of childhood, and accounts for zzso of all childhood cancer zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso previously known as zzso is strongly expressed in zzso and zzso zzso with poor patient zzso zzso differentiation in zzso cells has previously been shown to down regulate zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso has been reported to be zzso in several human zzso and zzso zzso was reported as a putative target of zzso in colon zzso We hypothesized that zzso might have a zzso role in zzso zzso via zzso of zzso Indeed, low levels of zzso expression in primary zzso correlated with poor patient zzso zzso zzso in zzso cell lines increased zzso and decreased cell viability and zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso in zzso cells, and was validated as a direct target of zzso using reporter zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso We conclude that zzso directly targets zzso zzso in zzso cells, and activates cell properties consistent with tumor zzso zzso strategies to zzso zzso in zzso could be useful to reduce tumor zzso
