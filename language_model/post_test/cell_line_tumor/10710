The novel tight junction protein zzso contains a zzso zzso zzso and related proteins for zzso trafficking and membrane zzso domain like zzso and zzso However, little is yet known about the detailed role and regulation of zzso in normal zzso cells and cancer cells, including pancreatic zzso In the present study, we investigated zzso expression in well and poorly differentiated human pancreatic cancer cell lines and normal pancreatic duct zzso cells in which the zzso gene was introduced into human pancreatic duct zzso cells in primary culture, and the changes of zzso during zzso zzso transition zzso under zzso zzso treatment and zzso of zzso in well differentiated pancreatic cancer zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso in poorly differentiated pancreatic cancer cells and during zzso zzso of pancreatic cancer cells in which Snail was highly expressed and the fence function zzso whereas it was maintained in well differentiated human pancreatic cancer cells and normal pancreatic duct zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso in zzso cells resulted in zzso of barrier functions indicated as a decrease in zzso electric resistance and an increase of zzso to fluorescent zzso zzso whereas it did not affect fence function of tight zzso In conclusion, zzso is zzso zzso in zzso zzso during the progression for the pancreatic zzso
