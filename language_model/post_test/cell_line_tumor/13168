Several recent reports have demonstrated that small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complementary to promoter regions can zzso gene expression in zzso cells, a phenomenon termed zzso zzso zzso However, the mechanism of zzso remains obscure with regard to what is the target zzso for zzso zzso and what are the proteins involved in this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso an important zzso zzso zzso is among the genes that can be activated by zzso in zzso zzso In the present study, we provide direct evidence that zzso zzso zzso interact with its intended target on the zzso promoter to activate zzso zzso This process is associated with recruitment of zzso zzso II and zzso zzso 2) protein to the zzso zzso Additionally, we found that several zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso and zzso are associated with zzso Further studies show that zzso interacts with the zzso in zzso and in zzso and is required for zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso results from specific targeting of promoters and reveals additional zzso details of zzso
