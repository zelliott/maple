The pathological hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease zzso include zzso of zzso zzso zzso forming zzso senile zzso zzso zzso made of zzso zzso protein with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso total zzso zzso and zzso zzso at zzso 181 zzso levels in the zzso fluid zzso are now validated zzso The zzso zzso R zzso is activated by zzso accumulates in zzso zzso in zzso brains and controls protein synthesis and indirectly zzso zzso 

In a prospective cohort study, the zzso of 91 patients were studied zzso 45; zzso mild cognitive zzso zzso neurological disease control subjects zzso zzso The levels of total zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were assessed by zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso operating characteristic zzso were used to examine the zzso power of zzso zzso and zzso ratio between zzso and zzso zzso 

Total zzso and zzso zzso were elevated in zzso and zzso mild cognitive impairment zzso We have determined a zzso value zzso density zzso that could discriminate zzso patients from control subjects with a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso Among zzso patients, zzso and zzso levels correlate with zzso zzso zzso Some zzso patients with normal zzso zzso zzso or zzso levels had abnormal zzso and zzso zzso 

The evaluation of zzso zzso and zzso can discriminate between zzso patients and zzso and could help to improve the zzso diagnosis of zzso
