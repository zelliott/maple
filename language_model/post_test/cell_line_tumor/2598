In our previous work, we showed for the first time that the zzso zzso channel zzso is specifically expressed in highly zzso human breast tumor zzso and cell zzso However, the contribution of zzso to breast zzso is not well zzso In this study, we showed that zzso expression was significantly correlated with the tumor size zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso status zzso zzso zzso clinical stage zzso zzso zzso and zzso status zzso zzso zzso High zzso expression was associated significantly with shorter overall zzso zzso zzso and recurrence-free survival zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso expression in the highly zzso zzso cells decreased the cell proliferation and zzso inhibited the cell zzso zzso and zzso pH recovery, and blocked the cell capacity of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso activity in zzso cells that suppressed zzso was zzso In zzso the breast tumor size of the zzso of the zzso zzso in nude mice that were knocked down by zzso was dramatically smaller than that in the control zzso The results demonstrated that the zzso of zzso function via zzso of zzso expression can effectively zzso the cancer growth and suppress the cancer zzso by the decrease of zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso Based on these results, we came to the conclusion that zzso is a potential zzso for prognosis of breast cancer and a potential target for zzso drugs in breast cancer zzso
