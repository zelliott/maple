Type 2 diabetes zzso and zzso disease are degenerative diseases that may share common zzso zzso zzso dysfunction in zzso patients has been linked to zzso of the zzso zzso 5 zzso and its zzso zzso Both of these proteins are expressed in the zzso beta cells of the zzso Further, zzso enhances zzso gene zzso promoting the formation of active zzso complexes that regulate the expression of the insulin zzso In zzso chronic zzso of zzso zzso impair beta cell zzso We therefore zzso that zzso and zzso may be responsible for this beta cell impairment and that zzso of zzso might have a beneficial zzso To test this hypothesis, the pancreatic cell line zzso was selected as a known in zzso model of zzso and zzso (10 zzso was used as a zzso zzso zzso exposure of zzso cells to high zzso zzso zzso reduced both insulin zzso levels and the activity of an insulin promoter reporter zzso zzso of zzso prevented this decrease of insulin gene zzso We used DNA binding zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso to demonstrate that cellular levels of the zzso factor zzso normally decreased by zzso were preserved with zzso zzso as was the binding of zzso to the insulin zzso zzso of nuclear and zzso zzso protein levels revealed that zzso zzso restores nuclear zzso without affecting its zzso zzso suggesting that zzso regulates the zzso zzso of zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso we showed that the zzso of zzso from the nucleus to the zzso during zzso conditions was prevented when zzso was zzso These studies indicate that zzso plays a role in the loss of beta cell function under zzso conditions and that zzso zzso could have therapeutic value for zzso
