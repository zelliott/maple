The zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in the neurodegenerative process of Parkinson's zzso The current study was designed to zzso the zzso effects of zzso on energy metabolism in zzso zzso zzso The toxicity of zzso zzso to the total collapse of zzso cell function, unlike other zzso toxins such as zzso that target specific loss of zzso zzso The toxicity of zzso paralleled the loss of zzso oxygen zzso consumption zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso zzso membrane potential and zzso of the zzso product, hydrogen zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso yielded partial zzso The rapid removal of zzso with zzso or zzso restored only zzso zzso but did not reverse the loss of zzso indicating zzso impairment is independent of zzso The zzso generated by zzso contributed toward the loss of zzso zzso through zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso The ability of zzso to maintain oxidized zzso c zzso in its reduced form zzso appears to play a role in zzso zzso The reduction of zzso by zzso was extensive, occurred within minutes, preceded formation of zzso and was unaffected by zzso or zzso zzso At similar zzso zzso readily altered the zzso state of iron zzso to zzso which would also theoretically sustain zzso in its reduced zzso In isolated zzso zzso had negligible effects on complex I, inhibited complex II and zzso with complex III by maintaining the zzso zzso in a reduced zzso zzso caused a transient and potent surge in isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, with rapid recovery as a result of zzso recycling zzso to zzso Typical zzso toxins such as zzso zzso and zzso appeared to inhibit the zzso activity of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso alters the zzso of the zzso resulting in loss of zzso availability and obstruction of zzso zzso Complete zzso against zzso toxicity and restored zzso was achieved by combining zzso with zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso reducing properties are unique to zzso zzso and may play a significant role in selective vulnerability of zzso zzso to zzso zzso
