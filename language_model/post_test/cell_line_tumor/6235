To investigate the zzso effect of zzso toxin zzso in zzso zzso zzso in zzso and the mechanisms underlying the zzso 

Human zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso which expressed moderate and high level of zzso zzso respectively, were zzso zzso level in the cells was evaluated using zzso zzso and cell proliferation was investigated using zzso zzso zzso expression was determined using Western zzso zzso activity in the zzso medium was measured using zzso a fluorescent zzso zzso zzso as zzso 

Exposure to CT zzso and 10 zzso significantly inhibited the cell growth, decreased zzso of zzso zzso zzso and promoted zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso CT at 10 zzso markedly suppressed zzso expression in zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso acid zzso were found to be crucial for growth of the cancer zzso CT could inhibit zzso expression and zzso of zzso that led to decreased activity of zzso D, thus decreasing the conversion of zzso to zzso 

CT zzso zzso zzso cell growth in zzso via regulating the zzso zzso
