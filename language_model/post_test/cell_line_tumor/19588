zzso is a zzso zzso that recognizes human zzso zzso zzso zzso and it was generated for the therapy of human multiple zzso In a severe combined zzso zzso zzso model of human multiple zzso zzso significantly prolonged the survival of mice with either early or advanced stages of zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso exerted its zzso effect remained zzso As reported previously zzso could mediate zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso in zzso zzso fragments of zzso had therapeutic efficacy in zzso suggesting that zzso functions were not zzso The purpose of this study was to further define the importance of the zzso portion of zzso for its zzso activity in zzso To this end, we examined the effect of an zzso preparation of zzso zzso to treat zzso mice zzso with either zzso cells, a human multiple myeloma cell line, or zzso cells, a human zzso zzso cell zzso In addition, we evaluated different doses of zzso zzso G zzso in these mice to determine the minimum amount of zzso that would produce a therapeutic zzso Data obtained from this study suggest that zzso the zzso portion of zzso is critical for its zzso activity in zzso zzso low levels of zzso zzso in a preparation of zzso fragments account for all of its in zzso activity in multiple myeloma and most of its activity in lymphoma, and zzso zzso zzso significantly zzso the survival of zzso mice as well as zzso zzso
