The aim of this study was to investigate possible mechanisms of zzso gene effects on invasion and zzso of breast cancer cells by zzso zzso 

zzso was zzso zzso and then zzso into a breast cancer cell line zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was determined by real-time zzso and protein expression of zzso by Western zzso Cell migration and zzso were assessed with zzso zzso A total of 111 cases of breast cancer zzso zzso normal breast zzso and 20 cases of benign zzso zzso were assessed by zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso and protein was zzso and the expression of zzso and zzso was significantly lower in the zzso group than the control group ( zzso after zzso was zzso into zzso zzso zzso and invasion abilities were obviously zzso The expression of zzso protein in breast cancer, zzso normal breast zzso and benign breast tumor were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, associations being noted with clinical stage, zzso zzso zzso tumor size and zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso protein was positively correlated with zzso and zzso 

zzso displayed an important role in invasion and zzso of breast cancer by regulating zzso and zzso expression which probably exerted synergistic effects on the zzso zzso zzso
