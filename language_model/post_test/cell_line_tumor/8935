zzso failure is a major problem in patients with advanced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso is a well-established target gene of the zzso zzso and is a bona fide marker of zzso cancer stem cells zzso Our previous study showed that zzso patients with higher zzso level are associated with poor response to zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the mechanisms underlying zzso zzso in cancer stem cells derived from cultured zzso zzso 

Cancer stem cells were isolated from zzso cell lines by zzso zzso The effect of zzso on zzso cancer stem cell was investigated using both zzso and zzso zzso zzso property was evaluated using sphere formation zzso side population analysis, and stem cell marker zzso zzso and zzso expression in zzso zzso was determined using zzso zzso 

zzso expression of zzso increased the zzso zzso efficiency and zzso size while depletion of zzso reduced the stem cell property in cultured zzso zzso zzso of zzso also reduced the sensitivity of cultured zzso cells, including adherent and zzso towards zzso and zzso In addition, zzso positively regulates the expression of zzso in both adherent and zzso zzso zzso Finally, in human zzso zzso higher expression levels of zzso were associated with higher zzso zzso 

The present study demonstrated that zzso plays an active role in promoting the cancer stem cell property and that zzso zzso zzso to zzso cells via zzso zzso
