In zzso cells zzso the induction of signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso by zzso factors zzso renders zzso zzso and suppresses their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso is beneficial for cancer zzso We have shown that zzso zzso in zzso zzso melanoma by zzso zzso of zzso zzso or its zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso cell death in zzso and in zzso Here, we investigated the physical zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso had an average diameter of zzso to 390 zzso and a zzso potential of zzso to zzso zzso zzso The zzso efficiency zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso was zzso and zzso zzso In both zzso types, zzso release followed a zzso pattern, but it was faster in zzso Our zzso study by zzso zzso confirmed DC zzso and zzso zzso of both zzso zzso After exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso showed high zzso and low zzso expression indicating impaired zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso of zzso zzso restored DC maturation and functionality as evidenced by the zzso of zzso zzso high zzso of zzso and significant zzso T cell zzso Moreover, zzso in zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso toxicity on zzso We propose this zzso as a strategy for targeted zzso delivery to zzso The potential of this approach is not limited to zzso zzso in zzso but can be used to target the expression of other proteins as zzso Moreover, it can be combined with other means for cancer zzso like cancer vaccine zzso
