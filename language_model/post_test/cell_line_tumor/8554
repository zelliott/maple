To study melanoma cell fusion and find a highly efficient fusion method for tumor zzso 

zzso cells were labeled with green fluorescent protein and red fluorescent zzso respectively, and fused by a modified zzso zzso fusion zzso zzso fusion cells were selected by the zzso activated cell zzso DNA content was determined by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cells were labeled with green fluorescent protein and red fluorescent protein markers and successfully fused through zzso fusion zzso The fusion efficiency zzso was much higher compared with zzso zzso method zzso zzso fusion cells were successfully obtained by the zzso activated cell zzso content was doubled in melanoma fusion cells compared to zzso melanoma zzso The proliferation rate of melanoma fusion cells was significantly decreased in zzso and in zzso 

We successfully obtained the melanoma fusion cells by the improved zzso fusion zzso The proliferation rate of melanoma fusion cells dramatically zzso
