zzso is a zzso zzso that plays crucial roles in the zzso of allergy, asthma and zzso zzso The high affinity zzso for zzso zzso may act as a decoy zzso for zzso The zzso effect of zzso and its soluble zzso zzso have been examined in different tumor zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso enhances zzso responses in some model systems, whereas zzso prevents zzso zzso suppression of tumor zzso in a different model zzso In this study, we have used a zzso zzso gene therapy approach and studied the immune responses zzso by zzso and zzso in poorly zzso zzso melanoma and zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso We find that zzso reduces the zzso of zzso melanoma and zzso zzso cells in zzso most likely through the recruitment of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso responses do not lead to the generation of zzso T zzso Neither zzso gene zzso nor in zzso treatment with soluble zzso has a statistically significant effect of tumor zzso zzso deficient host background does not alter tumor growth, suggesting that zzso levels of zzso do not contribute to an zzso response in these zzso We conclude that zzso but not soluble zzso has zzso activity in the models described here, possibly by enhancing innate zzso zzso
