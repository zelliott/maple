In this study, an attempt was made to zzso the combined effect of zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso with a water extract of zzso zzso zzso on the growth zzso of mouse melanoma and lung zzso zzso zzso cells were harvested with an zzso zzso solution, and zzso to appropriate zzso in zzso containing zzso fetal bovine zzso Using zzso zzso zzso in each well of a zzso culture plate, cells were incubated for 24, 48 and 72 h in the presence of zzso alone, or zzso plus zzso in a CO2 incubator at 37 degrees zzso zzso samples of viable cells were zzso with a Coulter zzso The zzso effect of zzso on the growth zzso of tumor cell lines increased over zzso in combination with zzso These results suggest that zzso has a remarkable reinforcement effect on the zzso activity of zzso zzso is a potent zzso for zzso
