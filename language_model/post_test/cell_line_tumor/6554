zzso is one of the zzso virus zzso nuclear zzso that is indispensable for zzso transformation and sustained proliferation of zzso The molecular mechanisms responsible for the function of zzso are poorly zzso We previously found that zzso interacts with an zzso protein zzso which in zzso cells is known to interact with the zzso zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso factor that mediates cellular responses to environmental pollutants, such as zzso zzso In this study, we show that zzso interacts specifically with zzso The stability of this interaction is determined by the zzso state of zzso and its association with zzso We and others have demonstrated that zzso retains the zzso zzso in the cell zzso However, in the presence of zzso the effect of zzso on the zzso zzso of zzso was zzso by zzso resulting in nuclear zzso of the zzso In addition, zzso enhanced zzso function by the zzso zzso in cells, as assessed by reporter gene zzso Our data suggested that zzso plays a role in zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso Following zzso of the zzso we also observed that zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso on the growth of zzso zzso Taken together, our studies revealed a novel interaction between zzso and zzso cellular pathways that control cell proliferation and zzso
