The regulation of cell surface zzso expression is essential for immune cell differentiation and zzso At the plasma membrane zzso is an important zzso mechanism for regulating expression of a wide range of surface zzso zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso major zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso To identify novel zzso zzso we used high zzso flow zzso and quantitative mass zzso by stable isotope labeling by zzso acids in cell culture zzso to determine the differential expression of plasma membrane proteins in a zzso B cell zzso This combined approach identified 13 potential new zzso zzso All of the zzso targets for which zzso were available were subsequently confirmed by flow zzso zzso the zzso zzso A close correlation zzso zzso zzso between zzso zzso as determined by zzso and flow zzso was found, with no false positive hits zzso The potential new zzso zzso cover a wide range of functions and include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso and polio virus zzso zzso The identification of plasma membrane targets by zzso with confirmation by flow zzso represents a novel and powerful approach to analyze changes in the plasma membrane zzso
