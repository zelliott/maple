This study aimed to characterize zzso zzso expression and signaling in head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso cell lines and patient zzso and to evaluate zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso expression and signaling in zzso cell lines were assessed by zzso In zzso proliferation and invasion were evaluated in zzso cell lines in response to zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein expression in patient zzso was assessed by zzso zzso 

zzso protein zzso zzso levels were significantly increased following combined zzso and zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso and zzso significantly increased cell invasion compared with either treatment alone, whereas zzso these two pathways resulted in reduced invasion compared with zzso either zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso P zzso zzso levels were significantly increased in zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso compared with adjacent zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas nuclear zzso zzso beta zzso zzso levels did not differ zzso zzso zzso Patients with high zzso zzso and zzso tumor levels had significantly reduced zzso survival compared with patients with low tumor zzso zzso and zzso levels zzso ratio, zzso P zzso zzso Cox zzso zzso In contrast, high zzso zzso tumor levels were not associated with reduced zzso survival alone or when combined with zzso 

zzso alpha and zzso beta were expressed in zzso and stimulation with zzso zzso zzso resulted in both zzso signal zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso zzso these studies indicate that zzso zzso and zzso together may contribute to zzso development and disease zzso
