Recent findings indicate that prevalent human zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso Factor 1 zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso and plays a crucial role in zzso adaptation of cancer cells to enhanced zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso in colon cancer cells triggers zzso zzso and the subsequent production of zzso zzso a zzso oxygen species zzso zzso are required to promote the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso results in a cellular zzso response that includes proliferation and zzso zzso resistance to drug-induced cell zzso zzso the zzso production of zzso prevents the zzso of zzso and zzso the zzso cellular zzso zzso Overall, our findings provide evidence linking the activity of a zzso protein with retrograde signaling to the nucleus to promote cellular proliferation and zzso
