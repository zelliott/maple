Cell zzso induced by zzso zzso is a highly complex process in which different molecular signaling pathways are zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been proposed as an important regulator in zzso zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanism through which zzso regulates zzso especially how zzso activates zzso X protein zzso in response to zzso zzso is still zzso In this study, by using real-time zzso analysis and zzso resonance energy transfer, we investigated the zzso zzso among zzso zzso and zzso in living human lung zzso cells zzso to illustrate how zzso promotes zzso zzso to initiate zzso Our results show that the interaction between zzso and zzso increased zzso with zzso zzso to zzso and zzso with zzso after zzso zzso indicating zzso promotes zzso zzso zzso zzso the interaction increased markedly between zzso and zzso and decreased significantly between zzso and zzso after zzso treatment, suggesting zzso competitively binds to zzso to activate zzso zzso The zzso results were further confirmed by zzso zzso In addition, zzso (a zzso zzso and zzso (a protein synthesis zzso could inhibit zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso Together, these studies create an important conclusion that zzso promotes zzso zzso by both by directly interacting with zzso and by competitive binding to zzso in zzso zzso
