zzso and zzso induce zzso and zzso responses, respectively, and often display zzso actions against each zzso To zzso the molecular mechanism of zzso we have investigated the signal interception by zzso and zzso employing a human zzso line Ramos, sensitive to both zzso In these cells, zzso effectively inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso whereas zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso The zzso action by zzso and zzso proceeded with a delayed zzso requiring zzso zzso zzso did not affect the zzso zzso zzso of zzso but induced a zzso zzso zzso of zzso and a corresponding decrease in nuclear zzso By zzso analysis and zzso zzso we demonstrated the zzso and molecular interaction of zzso zzso with zzso zzso in the zzso In addition, the zzso of zzso or zzso induced the zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso leading to the suppression of zzso zzso or zzso zzso gene zzso zzso Our data suggest that the signals zzso by zzso and zzso induce zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in B cells through the formation of zzso complex, which provides a novel mechanism by which zzso and zzso zzso their signaling into the zzso
