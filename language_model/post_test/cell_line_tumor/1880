zzso zzso an important zzso zzso has been implicated in the development of multiple solid tumors, yet, its role in gastric cancer cells has not been fully zzso In this study, we find that zzso was significantly zzso in gastric cancer cell lines compared with an immortalized gastric zzso cell line zzso zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso gastric cancer cells dramatically suppressed cell migration, invasion and zzso in zzso zzso of zzso significantly reduced the protein levels of zzso and zzso the activity of a zzso reporter containing one of the two predicted zzso binding sites in zzso zzso indicating that zzso may be a zzso target zzso zzso expression was also remarkably restored by a DNA zzso agent zzso in zzso and zzso gastric cancer zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso may function as a tumor zzso to regulate gastric cancer cell zzso by targeting zzso and its zzso in gastric cancer cells may be partly ascribed to DNA zzso
