zzso protein A zzso is an essential zzso protein complex that binds to zzso DNA zzso in zzso cells and is involved in various aspects of cellular DNA zzso including replication and zzso Although zzso is zzso expressed throughout the cell cycle, it zzso to DNA replication zzso during S phase, and is recruited to sites of DNA damage when regions of zzso are zzso During DNA zzso break zzso repair by zzso zzso zzso zzso recruitment to DNA damage sites depends on a process termed zzso zzso zzso zzso recruitment to zzso regions bearing zzso has been used as zzso for zzso and for ongoing zzso zzso of zzso recruitment by zzso zzso techniques is time consuming and requires extensive image analysis of relatively small populations of zzso Here, we present a zzso zzso method that allows the use of zzso zzso to measure cell proliferation and zzso repair by zzso in an unprecedented, unbiased and quantitative zzso
