zzso growth factor zzso is known to be involved in the proliferation and zzso of zzso cell zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso zzso must also contribute to SCC zzso In combination with conventional zzso drugs, agents that block zzso may represent an efficient means of zzso proliferation and inducing zzso in SCC zzso We investigated the effects of combining an zzso zzso zzso zzso or an zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso with the conventional zzso drug zzso on the oral SCC zzso cell lines zzso and zzso We detected zzso expression of zzso on the cell zzso of both cell zzso zzso cell proliferation was inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso The combination of zzso or zzso with zzso at zzso zzso zzso inhibited cell proliferation and induced zzso in these zzso Furthermore, treatment with zzso or zzso zzso reduced zzso of zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso expression levels of the zzso proteins cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas those of the zzso proteins zzso and zzso were zzso and neither zzso nor zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso can provide partial regulation of zzso zzso in zzso cells by modulating expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso may represent a novel strategy for overcoming resistance to zzso zzso via the zzso zzso zzso
