zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso which adds zzso acid in zzso on zzso zzso of zzso is frequently zzso in cancer, but its relationship with zzso remains zzso In this study, we have investigated the zzso changes induced by the expression of zzso zzso chains in the human colon cancer cell line zzso which was originally devoid of zzso zzso derived from zzso with the zzso zzso were compared with zzso cells and mock zzso The zzso clones show zzso increased adherence to zzso and collagen IV but not to zzso zzso Treatment with zzso zzso zzso reduces the binding to zzso and collagen IV of zzso cells but not that of zzso zzso zzso zzso and more focal distribution of zzso zzso on the cell surface; zzso different distribution of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and reduced tendency to zzso zzso zzso improved ability to heal a scratch zzso zzso reduced ability to grow at the subcutaneous site of injection in nude zzso Our data suggest that the presence of zzso zzso acid on membrane zzso increases the binding to zzso zzso zzso resulting in a membrane stabilization of zzso zzso further strengthening the zzso This mechanism can provide a basis for the zzso zzso and the reduced tendency to zzso growth, resulting in a more ordered tissue zzso These data indicate that in the cell line zzso the effect of zzso expression is consistent with the zzso of the zzso zzso
