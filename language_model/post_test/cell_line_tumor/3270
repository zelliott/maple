zzso is a zzso zzso that is frequently used for total zzso zzso in the treatment of advanced prostate zzso We investigated the effect of this zzso on the expression of protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that are involved in cell growth, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and independent zzso human prostate cancer cells were cultured in a medium that contained fetal bovine serum zzso or zzso serum zzso and treated with 10 zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were analyzed by Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso steroids zzso regulate the expression of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso These results were not zzso reproduced in the presence of zzso We observed an opposite effect of zzso compared to zzso on zzso zzso expression in zzso suggesting that this zzso exerts an zzso zzso In zzso cells zzso zzso the expression of the four zzso zzso in almost all conditions tested zzso and zzso zzso Such effect of zzso in zzso cells is independent of zzso since no expression of zzso was zzso These results provide new evidence on zzso responses of prostate cancer cells to zzso drugs that are widely used in therapy and show that zzso can elicit responses in prostate cancer cells that do not express zzso
