We report that lung zzso peptides isolated from a zzso library can be used to deliver an active zzso in a zzso zzso The peptides were removed from the context of the zzso and placed on a zzso zzso zzso The zzso peptides were shown to block zzso of their zzso zzso The zzso peptides were coupled to zzso and their zzso against a panel of different cell lines was zzso Our data demonstrate that these targeting peptides can deliver an active zzso agent in a zzso fashion, resulting in an increase of the therapeutic index of the targeted drug compared to systemic zzso The efficacy of the zzso zzso zzso to the affinity of the targeting zzso for a particular cell zzso As such, we have demonstrated that zzso targeted drugs can be zzso even when the cell surface target is zzso
