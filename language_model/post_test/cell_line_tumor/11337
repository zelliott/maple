We collected paired samples of tumor and adjacent normal zzso zzso from 22 patients with zzso zzso to compare the differences in the expression of zzso specific zzso 1 zzso in these two zzso The results showed that in 19 paired samples zzso zzso is more highly expressed in tumor tissue than in normal zzso To explore the role of zzso in zzso zzso we used zzso cell gene targeting to generate an zzso knockout zzso zzso 116 human zzso cancer cell line as a research zzso The analysis of zzso changes showed that zzso zzso zzso cancer cells are less zzso both in zzso and in zzso The differential expression analysis of the cells by zzso sequencing zzso yielded zzso zzso expressed zzso and 28 of these genes had highly significant differences zzso zzso We then selected the 4 zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso for quantitative real-time zzso zzso The results showed that the differences in the expression of zzso zzso and zzso were consistent with those measured using the zzso zzso As zzso was the gene with the most significant differential zzso we analyzed the key proteins of the zzso zzso signaling zzso and found that, after knocking out zzso the amount of free zzso zzso to the nucleus was significantly reduced and that the zzso of the signaling zzso target gene zzso was zzso Our studies show that zzso activates the zzso signaling zzso by zzso the zzso zzso zzso which may be one of the mechanisms leading to zzso zzso
