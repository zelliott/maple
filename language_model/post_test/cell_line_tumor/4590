We have previously shown that zzso a zzso zzso zzso agent, zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso (2005) zzso mechanism of zzso of zzso zzso by the zzso sequence selective zzso zzso agent, zzso evidence of zzso zzso associated with drug zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we report that treatment of cancer cells with zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and promoter zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso followed by in zzso zzso experiments identified a zzso zzso DNA element zzso to zzso designated as zzso that mediates a major effect of zzso on the zzso of zzso promoter zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso binds to zzso and abrogates zzso zzso zzso there is a highly zzso zzso motif for growth factor independence 1 zzso a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that either the cold zzso zzso DNA zzso or the cold zzso specifically competes with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is able to zzso the zzso complex on the zzso zzso Lastly, our data reveal that zzso of zzso by zzso is involved in cancer drug zzso We propose that hindrance of zzso interactions in the zzso promoter, initiated by zzso contributes to zzso of zzso transcription, and as a consequence, zzso zzso zzso
