zzso zzso zzso is a significant cause of mortality zzso The molecular mechanisms of zzso remain poorly zzso Our aim was to zzso the functional activity of the zzso identified zzso zzso 1 and zzso in zzso Digital zzso Display was used to identify genes altered expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso levels of a subset of genes were zzso by zzso in a panel of cell lines and zzso zzso The effect of zzso and zzso stimuli on gene expression was zzso Cell proliferation and invasion were measured using in an zzso zzso model following zzso of expression using zzso In all, 23 genes not previously reported in association with zzso were zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso were selected for further analysis and increased expression was detected in zzso tissue compared to paired normal tissue using quantitative zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso resulted in decreased proliferation and invasion of gastric cancer cells in zzso These functional studies highlight a putative role for zzso and zzso in the development and progression of gastric zzso These genes may provide important targets for intervention in zzso evidenced by their role in promoting invasion and zzso key zzso hallmarks of cancer zzso
