Gold zzso zzso with near infrared zzso zzso resonance have been zzso used in zzso cancer therapy as a less invasive zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso to act as a zzso to zzso zzso zzso on zzso by the zzso region, resulting in optimal orientation of zzso for efficient cancer zzso zzso studies showed that zzso zzso breast cancer cells, zzso were efficiently targeted and zzso at a laser power of 900 zzso (5 zzso for 3 zzso However, as a means of enhancing treatment efficacy by increasing cellular sensitivity to zzso agents, we showed that zzso exposure to lower power laser resulted in small disruptions of cell membrane due to localized zzso This did not lead to cell death but provided a mechanism for killing cancer cells by providing enhanced zzso of drug molecules thus leading to a new avenue for zzso drug combined cancer zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was used as a zzso to zzso the orientation of zzso providing zzso zzso properties to gold zzso used in zzso cancer zzso The system demonstrated excellent properties in cancer therapy, with the hope and expectation of future clinical zzso
