To investigate the effects of zzso on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and the proliferation of zzso zzso 

The total protein was extracted from zzso cells treated without or with different zzso of zzso ( 50, 25, zzso zzso and zzso zzso for different time zzso 4, 8, 12, 24 zzso Western zzso analysis was performed to determine the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed to examine the growth zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso 

zzso could inhibit the proliferation of zzso cells in a zzso and zzso dependent manner, with the zzso at 24 h and 36 h of 40 zzso and 25 zzso zzso The levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso were increased zzso 

zzso functions as a zzso zzso could increase the level of zzso zzso zzso enhance the expression and activity of tumor zzso zzso and inhibit the proliferation of zzso zzso
