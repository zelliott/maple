The human zzso zzso zzso are considered important zzso zzso in zzso The aim of the current study is to demonstrate gene expression of zzso in zzso cancer zzso and to correlate the relative zzso expression level with zzso factors of zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was examined in nine zzso cancer cell lines by real-time zzso chain zzso The expression levels of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and paired normal zzso zzso of zzso patients were also zzso 

Six of the nine cell lines expressed the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression levels in cancer zzso were significantly higher than those in normal zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso zzso expression level in cancer was an independent zzso factor, especially in liver zzso 

We provide evidence suggesting that zzso zzso expression is correlated with prognosis in zzso patients, especially in liver zzso
