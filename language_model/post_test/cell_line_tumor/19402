zzso of cancer therapy is improved by the use of zzso zzso zzso that target membrane proteins unique to zzso tumor zzso Although zzso zzso activity in zzso can always be improved with larger doses, clinical restriction on the dose zzso makes it critical to explore how zzso zzso activity can be zzso without resorting to dose zzso In this work, a mathematical model was developed to explore functional correlations between the properties of several zzso zzso and their zzso zzso in zzso zzso were compared with experimental data of human tumor zzso grown on nude mice to assess parameters critical to optimal zzso zzso We dissected out or held constant as many parameters of the model as possible to investigate the effect of the remaining parameters on the behavior of the system as a zzso zzso correlations between zzso binding affinity and the target binding site density were obtained for several zzso zzso targeting either human zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso reinforced the idea of binding site barrier for drug diffusion and suggested that optimal zzso activity was achieved when the binding affinity is zzso dependent on the target binding site zzso
