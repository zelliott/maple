zzso C virus zzso particles are known to be in complex with zzso As a result of this interaction, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been proposed as a potential entry factor for zzso however, its implication in virus entry remains zzso Here, we zzso the role of the zzso in the zzso life cycle by comparing virus entry to the mechanism of zzso zzso A small interfering zzso targeting the zzso in zzso cells reduced zzso zzso confirming that this zzso plays a role in the life cycle of zzso generated in cell zzso However, zzso of zzso were much faster for zzso than for infectious zzso zzso Furthermore, a decrease in zzso zzso replication was observed by blocking the zzso with a specific zzso and this was associated with an increase in the ratio of zzso to zzso in host zzso Nevertheless, a soluble form of the zzso inhibited both zzso entry into the zzso and its binding to the zzso expressed on Chinese zzso zzso cells, suggesting a direct interaction between the zzso particle and the zzso Finally, we showed that modification of zzso particles by zzso zzso zzso reduces zzso zzso and increases zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso treatment also induced an increase in zzso zzso suggesting that zzso at least in some conditions, leads to zzso zzso of zzso 

The zzso is not essential for infectious zzso particle entry, whereas the zzso function of this zzso is important for optimal replication of the zzso zzso
