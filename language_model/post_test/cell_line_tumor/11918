Resistance of colon cancer cells to zzso zzso due to loss of zzso receptors and zzso of zzso zzso zzso contributes to their evasion from immune attack by zzso and zzso zzso zzso we investigated the effects of zzso zzso on zzso and zzso expression of colon cancer cells, and its influence on the sensitivity of colon cancer cells to zzso zzso 

zzso cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso were incubated with zzso for different periods of zzso zzso of the cells to zzso zzso was assessed by measuring their zzso after treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso levels were examined by zzso and zzso expression of zzso and zzso was investigated by zzso 

zzso incubation increased zzso zzso in all colon cancer cell lines in a zzso manner zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression on zzso and zzso cells at both protein and zzso levels zzso zzso zzso which were low before treatment, while high expression of zzso on zzso cells remained zzso Additionally, zzso zzso zzso zzso expression on zzso and zzso cells, which was high before treatment zzso zzso zzso However, low expression of zzso on zzso cells remained stable after zzso zzso 

zzso enhances zzso of colon cancer cells to zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso levels and by zzso zzso zzso which accounts for its therapeutic effects on abolishing immune evasion in colon cancer zzso
