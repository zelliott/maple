We have reported previously that zzso of zzso protein 78 zzso promotes the invasion of zzso zzso However, whether zzso zzso affects the zzso zzso degradation has not been zzso Here we are going to determine whether zzso zzso affect the zzso degradation and the role of zzso and zzso in these process in zzso zzso zzso 

Human zzso zzso cell line zzso and zzso were cultured in zzso supplemented with zzso zzso zzso and western zzso were used to detect the zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso using zzso zzso zzso and wound healing zzso were used to analyze the invasion of each zzso zzso zzso and zzso degradation zzso were employed to investigate the capabilities of zzso degradation of each zzso zzso zzso was used to determine the proliferation zzso Western zzso was employed to detect the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso focal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

According to the expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso we used zzso as the in zzso invasion model for further functional zzso Using this model, we found that zzso zzso decreased the invasion of tumor cells, and this zzso effect was independent of cell zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso inhibited zzso degradation and the decreased activity and expression of zzso but not zzso contributed largely to this zzso Further analysis revealed that the decreased activity and expression of zzso is zzso by zzso 

zzso of zzso decreases zzso degradation, and zzso the expression and activity of zzso and zzso These results further demonstrate that zzso is a potential target for zzso the invasion of zzso zzso zzso
