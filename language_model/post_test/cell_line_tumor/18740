Although various mechanisms have been recognized as being associated with the development of resistance to zzso zzso in zzso and in clinical situations, their relative significance and contributions remain poorly zzso as is the sequence of events leading to the selection of the resistant zzso Experimental in zzso systems involving well defined cell lines and conditions can be used to some advantage to answer specific questions and to develop in zzso models of zzso resistance that would reflect its potential zzso 

Two cell lines, zzso and zzso which expressed zzso zzso and which differed in their inherent sensitivity to zzso the number of copies of the zzso fusion zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso were grown in zzso in the presence of increasing zzso of zzso The resistant cells were analyzed for cell cycle zzso zzso response after exposure to zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso activity, and the presence of zzso within the zzso zzso zzso coding domain of zzso At various levels of resistance, the cells were transferred into drug-free media, and the stability of the resistant zzso was determined in the absence of the zzso 

In zzso cells, the development of resistance was characterized by loss of zzso response to the drug, amplification of zzso increased levels of expression of zzso zzso and decreased zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity by zzso No zzso within the zzso domain of zzso were identified, and resistance remained stable in the absence of the zzso In zzso cells, which previously were found to be characterized by the acquisition of a single zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso at high levels of resistance, this same zzso was detected at an intermediate level, but not at a low level, of zzso The response of zzso cells to zzso was characterized by a low level of zzso response, a marginal increase in zzso copy number, a modest increase in zzso zzso and a highly zzso zzso zzso zzso reversal of resistance was observed in highly resistant zzso cells, which continued to display the zzso zzso In zzso cells with an intermediate level of resistance, the zzso zzso was no longer zzso upon their reversal to the sensitive zzso 

zzso amplification with subsequent zzso of zzso zzso loss of zzso response, or point zzso of the zzso site of zzso was associated alternatively with the acquisition of the resistant zzso supporting the notion that multiple mechanisms are involved in the induction of resistance to zzso The initial number of zzso copies itself was not related directly to the degree of zzso The zzso of the resistance may be complete, zzso or zzso depending on the zzso involved and the degree of zzso Both cell lines serve as models for further zzso of various aspects of zzso zzso
