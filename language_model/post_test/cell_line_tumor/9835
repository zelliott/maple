Novel zzso targeted agents, given in combination with zzso have the potential to increase tumor response rates and the survival of patients with lung zzso zzso is a potent and selective inhibitor of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso a critical zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso that regulates the proliferation and survival of tumor zzso 

This study examined the potential benefit of combining zzso with zzso zzso using human lung and colon zzso zzso zzso 

zzso reduced zzso zzso in zzso lung cancer cells in zzso Administration of zzso for 10 days zzso zzso twice daily zzso inhibited the tumor growth of zzso zzso with regrowth occurring on zzso of drug zzso When zzso zzso zzso (5 zzso 2 zzso was combined with zzso treatment, the tumor growth delay was enhanced significantly when compared with either zzso alone, and this effect was also seen in a colon tumor zzso We examined the effect of zzso zzso on the molecular responses to zzso a potential interaction that could contribute to zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso in zzso shown using zzso dual clone cells that zzso express a zzso zzso gene under the control of a zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor levels were reduced by zzso and there was a significant decrease in vascular zzso in the tumors given combination treatment when compared with the other treatment zzso 

These data provide support for the clinical development of zzso in combination with zzso and indicate a potential role for zzso in zzso the tumor zzso zzso
