Since bacterial invasion into host cells is an important step in the infection process, using the agents to interfere with bacterial zzso is an attractive approach to block the infection zzso In this work, we describe a new, previously zzso role of the human zzso host defense zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso Our results revealed that the zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso into cultured zzso zzso cells zzso was significantly reduced at zzso zzso that were unable to produce any zzso or zzso zzso Using zzso and follow-up studies, we demonstrated that zzso affected the zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso by zzso the attachment of bacteria, and then decreasing zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which might contribute to bacterial zzso into zzso zzso This disruption of bacterial zzso implied that zzso could provide protection against zzso zzso zzso
