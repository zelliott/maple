zzso in Parkinson's disease zzso affects mainly zzso zzso in the zzso zzso where zzso increasing percentages of cells lose zzso respiratory activity associated with depletion of intact zzso DNA zzso zzso of zzso might improve zzso zzso function and prevent further cell zzso We developed a technology zzso that uses zzso human zzso zzso factor A zzso engineered with an zzso protein zzso domain zzso followed by the zzso zzso zzso signal zzso to deliver zzso cargo to the zzso of living zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binds zzso and rapidly zzso it across plasma zzso to zzso For therapeutic zzso we tested zzso technology in Parkinson's disease zzso cells, using zzso generated from commercially available human zzso DNA zzso zzso Nine to 11 weeks after single zzso to zzso + zzso complex, zzso zzso cells with impaired zzso and reduced zzso genes increased their zzso gene copy numbers up to zzso zzso zzso up to zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso movement zzso zzso cells with no or minimal zzso zzso zzso showed reduced or no responses to treatment, suggesting the possibility of therapeutic zzso Exposure of zzso but not control zzso cells to zzso protein alone or zzso + zzso complex increased expression of zzso suggesting zzso of zzso zzso zzso technology for zzso gene therapy holds promise for improving zzso function in impaired zzso zzso and needs additional development to define its zzso and delineate its molecular zzso It also is unclear whether zzso zzso for generating zzso would be a preferred therapeutic compared with the pooled zzso used in this zzso
