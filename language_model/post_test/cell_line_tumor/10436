zzso therapy for cancer zzso zzso is difficult and generally renders a poor clinical zzso zzso zzso of zzso the most widely used synthetic metal complexes, show toxic zzso and tumor cell zzso Recently, palladium complexes with increased stability are being investigated to circumvent these limitations, and a zzso zzso complex zzso zzso zzso zzso named zzso efficiently controls the subcutaneous development of zzso zzso melanoma in zzso zzso zzso we investigated the melanoma cell killing mechanism induced by zzso and extended zzso zzso 

zzso cells were treated in zzso with zzso in the zzso of zzso and several parameters related to zzso induction were zzso zzso studies were performed, and mice were zzso zzso with zzso cells, zzso treated with zzso and lung zzso zzso were zzso The zzso effects and the respiratory metabolism were also determined in human tumor cell lines treated in zzso with zzso 

zzso complex interacts with zzso groups on the zzso membrane zzso causes dissipation of the zzso membrane potential, and zzso zzso zzso from the zzso to zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso also induced an increase in zzso calcium zzso mainly from zzso zzso and a significant decrease in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA degradation, suggested that zzso activates the zzso intrinsic zzso in zzso melanoma zzso In the zzso studies, the zzso complex protected against zzso zzso melanoma and induced death in several human tumor cell lineages in zzso including zzso zzso The zzso cell death was also induced by zzso in human tumor zzso 

The zzso zzso complex is an effective zzso zzso compound against primary and zzso zzso and human tumors, including zzso cells, inducing zzso cell death via the intrinsic zzso
