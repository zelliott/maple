zzso zzso is a multifunctional, zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the human immune zzso Here, we identified the role of zzso in zzso the zzso induction activity of zzso in zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso and chemical zzso of zzso suppressed zzso production in response to zzso zzso zzso were required for the downstream zzso of zzso but zzso and zzso induction were zzso Through systematic zzso zzso of zzso members, a requirement for Lyn in zzso zzso activity was zzso The involvement of Lyn in zzso activities was further confirmed using zzso mouse zzso The role of zzso and Lyn was also demonstrated in the activities of the synthetic zzso zzso zzso developed as novel, zzso zzso These findings zzso the common molecular mechanisms zzso the zzso induction activity of natural and synthetic zzso peptides in zzso cells and identify zzso as a potential target for modulating zzso zzso
