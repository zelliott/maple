Outcomes from the Women's Health Initiative have demonstrated adverse effects associated with hormone therapy and have zzso the need to develop new alternative treatments for the management of menopause and zzso To this end, we have been investigating natural herbal medicines used by Costa Rican women to manage zzso zzso 

zzso plant species were collected and extracted in Costa zzso To establish possible mechanisms of action and to determine their potential future use for menopause or zzso we investigated the zzso activities of the herbal extracts in an zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells and in reporter and zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso 

Six of the plant extracts bound to the zzso Four of the six extracts zzso reporter gene expression in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All six extracts modulated expression of zzso genes in zzso cells, with four extracts acting as zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acting as partial zzso by enhancing zzso zzso zzso expression but reducing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced a zzso reporter gene in transient zzso zzso cells, which was inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This work presents a plausible mechanism of action for many of the herbal medicines used by Costa Rican women to treat zzso zzso However, it further suggests that studies of safety and efficacy are needed before these herbs should be used as alternative therapies to hormone zzso
