zzso resistance zzso is considered a zzso zzso which prevents a successful clinical cancer zzso This phenomenon is mainly associated with mechanisms that include drug zzso by zzso zzso zzso and resistance to zzso derived by members of the inhibitor of zzso proteins zzso such as zzso Studies have proposed the use of compounds that are able to inhibit or zzso zzso function, with no changes in the zzso expression of this zzso Based on that, the present study aimed to evaluate the reversal of zzso zzso through zzso of zzso zzso pump activity in leukemia zzso cells, using a low dose of zzso A zzso We showed that zzso of zzso activity by using zzso did not induce zzso effects in leukemia cells, independently of zzso zzso However, during the zzso condition, we could observe that zzso zzso was significant in resistant cells, which was also coupled with decreasing expression of the inhibitor of zzso protein zzso In zzso our data suggest that zzso is able to reversing zzso zzso in zzso inducing sensibility in zzso cells with no zzso in zzso zzso These findings contribute to our knowledge for the zzso of zzso in cancer cells and could be helpful for new treatment zzso
