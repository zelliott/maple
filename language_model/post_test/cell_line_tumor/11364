In tumors the process of zzso occurs over an zzso of time after zzso It is important to determine the best time for detecting zzso by in zzso zzso In this study, we evaluated the dynamics and feasibility of imaging zzso cell lung cancer zzso zzso induced by zzso treatment using a zzso zzso V zzso with ten consecutive zzso zzso zzso in a mouse zzso 

zzso V was prepared by one step direct zzso zzso purity zzso and zzso was zzso The binding of zzso V to zzso cells was validated in zzso using zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso was determined in mice by zzso The human zzso zzso tumor cell line zzso zzso mice were treated with intravenous zzso 24, 48 and 72 hours zzso zzso V was injected zzso and zzso images were acquired at 2, 4 and 6 hours zzso on a zzso gamma camera fitted with a pinhole zzso zzso tissue ratios zzso were calculated by zzso analysis and they reflected specific binding of zzso zzso Mice were sacrificed after zzso zzso as the zzso zzso was determined by flow zzso and DNA fragmentation was analyzed by the terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso labeling zzso zzso zzso zzso of protein was estimated using bovine serum zzso zzso The imaging data were correlated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso V had a zzso zzso zzso and high stability 2 hours after zzso and it could bind to zzso cells with high zzso zzso of zzso V showed zzso zzso in zzso relatively low zzso in zzso liver and gastrointestinal zzso and rapid clearance from blood and kidney was zzso The zzso was significantly increased after zzso treatment, whereas it was low in zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity in Group 2 (24 hours), Group 3 zzso zzso and Group 4 zzso zzso after treatment was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Whereas in the zzso group, Group 1, zzso was zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was positively correlated to the zzso index zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso as well as zzso activity zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

This study addresses the dynamics and feasibility of imaging zzso cell lung tumor zzso using zzso zzso zzso
