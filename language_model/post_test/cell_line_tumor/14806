There are several strategies that can be zzso to improve zzso efficiency while reducing the zzso of zzso zzso as a promising zzso gene delivery zzso In this study, we evaluated the potential use of zzso zzso peptides in zzso the zzso zzso structure and enhancing its efficiency while maintaining low toxicity of zzso zzso zzso was modified with zzso acid zzso to increase its zzso Then, zzso zzso was attached to the zzso groups of zzso to restore the primary zzso of zzso zzso six different zzso short peptides were zzso to zzso and evaluated for the effect of the zzso sequence on zzso zzso efficiency and zzso The zzso efficiency of zzso zzso with a zzso reporter gene zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells showed that the zzso zzso to zzso zzso had a significantly higher rate of gene zzso efficiency in comparison with other zzso zzso This zzso was zzso to zzso and zzso and significant improvement in efficiency with minimal zzso was zzso The results obtained suggest that the sequence and content of zzso peptides will have a significant impact on the zzso efficiency of modified zzso zzso
