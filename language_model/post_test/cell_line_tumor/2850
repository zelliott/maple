zzso of appropriate zzso progression and of closely related zzso process is a basic feature of zzso cells, and development of new zzso agents focus on zzso either during zzso arrest or following premature zzso checkpoint zzso Increasingly, zzso and experimental studies suggest that zzso protects against cancer, not only because of its well-known zzso properties, but also because it zzso zzso zzso which is related to cell proliferation and zzso zzso and zzso are zzso drugs in treatment of many types of zzso cancer and their combination with other zzso are under investigation to limit their side effects and resistance to zzso 

The aim of this study was to evaluate effects of a combined treatment using zzso with zzso or with zzso in a human zzso cancer cell line zzso and in its zzso zzso zzso 

zzso per zzso caused zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso reduction in cell zzso as well as altered cell cycle parameters and induced zzso in both cell zzso When zzso cells were simultaneously exposed to zzso and to zzso or zzso (at zzso lower than zzso cell viability was reduced more than with zzso zzso Moreover, dose and time related effects of zzso when combined with platinum drugs, were linked to consistent reduction in cell cycling and increased zzso in comparison with zzso zzso These effects were significant both in wild type and in zzso cells, indicating that zzso was also able to increase sensitivity of resistant zzso cancer cells to zzso 

The data suggests that zzso is an interesting natural compound capable of limiting cell proliferation and possibly increasing clinical impact of platinum drugs, in zzso cancer zzso
