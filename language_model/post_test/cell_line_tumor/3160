Among zzso zzso highly aggressive zzso or zzso zzso still await effective therapeutic zzso zzso is a novel zzso zzso inhibitor in clinical trials as zzso zzso We have investigated the effects of zzso on proliferation and zzso of 4 zzso cancer cell lines with different degrees of zzso zzso induced cell cycle arrest in zzso phase in all cells analyzed possibly by zzso the zzso B1 zzso However, the compound was unable to induce a significant cell zzso zzso has been shown to sensitize cancer cells to zzso zzso We report that zzso zzso zzso cell lines to zzso zzso with the highest degree of zzso observed in the most zzso cancer zzso zzso was associated with the zzso of zzso In zzso zzso zzso is zzso activated contributing to the proliferation of zzso zzso zzso we observed that zzso inhibited zzso expression and nuclear zzso Moreover, zzso zzso inhibited zzso and zzso zzso The combined treatment also caused zzso of zzso proteins zzso regulated by zzso Finally, zzso zzso expression of zzso TRAIL zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso cells can be effectively killed by a combination treatment of zzso doses of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso appears to be zzso by the zzso of the zzso zzso leading to zzso of zzso genes and zzso of TRAIL death zzso The combination of zzso and TRAIL may represent a novel approach to the treatment of zzso zzso zzso resistant to conventional zzso
