To investigate the expression of zzso zzso factor zzso and its receptors in multiple myeloma zzso cells and the biological effects of zzso on zzso zzso 

zzso and protein expression of zzso and its receptors zzso and zzso in human myeloma cell lines zzso was determined with zzso and Western zzso zzso levels in culture zzso was determined with zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso and zzso by myeloma cells was studied with zzso in bone zzso biopsy samples from 15 patients with zzso The effect of zzso on the in zzso proliferation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was examined with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso on zzso migration was studied with modified zzso chamber zzso 

zzso was expressed and zzso by zzso in high zzso up to zzso zzso Furthermore, expression of its high affinity zzso zzso was observed in zzso zzso expression by myeloma cells was demonstrated in 12 of the 15 patients with zzso zzso zzso expression was demonstrated in all the 15 patients zzso whereas control bone zzso samples showed weaker expression of zzso in 2 of 9 zzso and zzso in 4 of 9 zzso zzso studies demonstrated that zzso has strong zzso effects on zzso and proliferation of zzso zzso was enhanced by zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso has zzso properties on zzso The zzso responses were seen at 50 zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 25 zzso for zzso cells zzso zzso zzso as compared with zzso zzso 

zzso and its high affinity zzso zzso are zzso by zzso zzso zzso appears to have a major contribution to the zzso of zzso leading to proliferation and migration of zzso zzso These provide the framework for novel therapeutic strategies targeting zzso signaling in zzso
