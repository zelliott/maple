zzso expression in melanoma is zzso correlated with patient zzso zzso mice harboring zzso zzso of zzso exhibit increased zzso to zzso melanoma and zzso zzso To understand the zzso basis for zzso zzso we investigated the effects of zzso on the zzso of human zzso and melanoma zzso We found that zzso zzso enhanced migration on zzso and invasion through zzso whereas zzso zzso under zzso conditions blocked migration and zzso In zzso zzso zzso activated the zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso was required for zzso migration and invasion, whereas zzso zzso was required only for enhanced zzso In both zzso and melanoma cells, zzso zzso was associated with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso blockade or zzso zzso zzso of which blocked zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso but zzso of zzso zzso prevented zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso Together, our results showed that zzso enhanced the migration and invasion of zzso cells and suggested that zzso may promote melanoma zzso by supporting zzso zzso of zzso zzso
