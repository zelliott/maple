zzso zzso that predict resistance to DNA damaging agents may improve therapeutic outcomes by guiding the selection of effective therapies and limiting morbidity related to ineffective zzso zzso zzso is an essential component of several DNA repair pathways and zzso cells are exquisitely sensitive to DNA damaging zzso The purpose of this study was to determine whether zzso expression levels predict clinical response to DNA damaging agents in head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was used to measure zzso expression in tumors from a cohort of 80 patients with newly diagnosed zzso treated with radiation therapy with or without zzso zzso samples were collected zzso zzso DNA isolated from blood samples was analyzed for nine single zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene by using a custom zzso The primary zzso was zzso survival zzso 

zzso expression was higher in tumors from the oral cavity than from the other sites zzso zzso zzso High zzso expression correlated with early time to progression both by zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso analysis zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The one year zzso for high zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for low zzso In addition, we identified four zzso zzso that showed marginal association with treatment zzso 

zzso level of zzso in zzso tumors zzso with clinical response to DNA damaging zzso zzso has potential to guide next generation personalized cancer zzso
