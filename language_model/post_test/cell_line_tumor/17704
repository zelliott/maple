zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso that zzso zzso degradation of zzso to form zzso carbon monoxide and free iron, may protect tumor cells against zzso stress, thus contributing to rapid tumor growth in zzso Here, we discuss whether zzso zinc zzso zzso a potent HO zzso zzso the zzso response of tumor cells to treatment that generates zzso oxygen species zzso zzso is a zzso HO inhibitor that accumulates in tumor zzso after intravenous zzso zzso of zzso agents in zzso was determined by means of zzso and zzso V zzso using human colon zzso zzso zzso Mice bearing zzso 180 tumors were used as an in zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso which behaves as an zzso zzso agent by generating toxic zzso at tumor zzso was administered with its zzso zzso to mice with or without zzso zzso zzso zzso cells became vulnerable to insults caused by various zzso zzso the 50% lethal doses were reduced by zzso zzso zzso and zzso for hydrogen zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso treated with zzso plus zzso zzso exhibited marked production of zzso zzso which paralleled the zzso of zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced tumor growth in mice receiving zzso compared to no zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso may become an attractive target for zzso zzso Further study of the effect of zzso plus conventional zzso drugs that generate zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso C and zzso is zzso
