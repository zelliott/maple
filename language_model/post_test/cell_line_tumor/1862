A family of light rare earth complexes, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (10) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been zzso and structurally zzso zzso interactions of these complexes with zzso and their zzso DNA zzso activity with zzso zzso DNA are also zzso These complexes have strong DNA binding interaction zzso and zzso the binding propensity to zzso decrease with the order: zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, DNA zzso experiments indicate that these complexes are efficient DNA zzso agents in zzso zzso zzso and ambient light in the absence of any external zzso zzso radical zzso and zzso oxygen zzso are the major zzso active species from the zzso zzso Moreover, cell zzso studies of these complexes on zzso zzso and zzso cells indicate that they have the potential to act as effective zzso zzso zzso
