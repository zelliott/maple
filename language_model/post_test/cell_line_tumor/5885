zzso loaded zzso were prepared by zzso method using zzso zzso zzso which is pH sensitive, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Mean diameter of the zzso zzso was about 20 zzso with a zzso zzso zzso % drug zzso efficiency at pH zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that the simple zzso zzso was taken up rapidly at the same level at pH zzso and pH zzso However, the zzso zzso entered the tumor cell less at pH zzso and significantly increase at pH zzso After 1 h incubation at pH zzso the amount of the zzso zzso taken up by cancer cell zzso was almost similar to simple zzso zzso The zzso zzso indicated that the zzso zzso entered the zzso cells at pH zzso more than at pH zzso It was indicated that the zzso zzso could shield zzso zzso at normal pH zzso and zzso it at pH zzso zzso zzso peptides lead the zzso zzso into the tumor cells and killed them zzso The zzso zzso may provide a novel strategy for design of cancer targeting drug delivery zzso
