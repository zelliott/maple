zzso zzso cell zzso zzso is one of the most common zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been reported to contribute to the development of zzso zzso cell zzso zzso the objective of our study was to identify the molecular mechanisms of zzso underlying the invasion and zzso of zzso We zzso zzso in zzso cells to examine the role of zzso in the regulation of the cell zzso In addition, using zzso reporter zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso we evaluated the binding of zzso to the promoter of zzso We found that zzso zzso promotes zzso of the human zzso zzso cell line zzso This effect was accompanied by zzso of the zzso cell marker zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso reporter zzso showed that zzso inhibited the promoter activity of zzso and that this was dependent on zzso zzso and zzso We also found that Snail and zzso bound the zzso in the promoter of zzso and recruited zzso and zzso to suppress zzso zzso as confirmed by zzso mobility shift and zzso zzso zzso zzso promotes tumor invasion by zzso of zzso These results demonstrate a novel role for zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso cell zzso invasion and provide insight into the mechanisms involved in this zzso
