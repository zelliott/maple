The zzso zzso zzso zzso has been characterized as a zzso and tumor zzso in prostate zzso In order to investigate the zzso by which the zzso functions as a zzso zzso in prostate cancer cells, we characterized the zzso expression of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the type IV collagen zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso human prostate cancer zzso zzso expression of zzso greatly reduced protein levels and zzso activities of zzso zzso and zzso as shown by zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso exhibited an increase in protein levels with an increase in zzso levels, whereas zzso was not zzso zzso zzso with an zzso dominant negative zzso zzso rescued zzso zzso and zzso protein levels and zzso activities, and zzso suppressed zzso zzso Since zzso signal zzso occurs via the zzso and zzso zzso antagonism of signaling zzso in these zzso using dominant negative zzso or dominant negative zzso respectively, was shown to further decrease expression of zzso zzso and zzso protein and zzso activity levels, and zzso zzso levels of zzso These results indicate that expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are directly regulated by expression of zzso and its downstream signal zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso activity of zzso is zzso in part, by zzso of specific zzso zzso type IV zzso implicated in cell migration and zzso
