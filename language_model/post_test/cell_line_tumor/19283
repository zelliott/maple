To investigate the combined effect of the major tea zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso on cervical zzso 

Cell growth rate was examined after treatment for 4, 7 and 10 days with zzso zzso zzso and/or 1 zzso zzso in two cervical zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso The effect of zzso treatment was examined for the induction of zzso by DNA zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity in cell zzso zzso activity was detected by stretch zzso zzso extension zzso zzso expression levels were zzso by a real-time zzso zzso 

Combining zzso and zzso increased the zzso effect in zzso cell lines, whereas zzso or zzso treatment alone caused a less sensitive response in these zzso Neither zzso nor zzso treatment alone affected zzso and zzso zzso The combination treatment of zzso and zzso induced zzso and inhibited zzso activity in zzso cell zzso These results were consistent with those of an zzso effect of zzso and/or zzso in cervical zzso zzso 

Our data suggest that zzso and zzso combined to prevent the zzso of cervical zzso induce zzso and inhibit zzso zzso The treatments of combining zzso and zzso may be effective in preventing or treating cervical zzso
