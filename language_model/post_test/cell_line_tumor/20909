zzso protein zzso C zzso generally plays crucial roles in the establishment of cell polarity in various biological zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso essentially works towards the transition of primordial zzso zzso junctions zzso into continuous zzso zzso also called zzso zzso lined with zzso zzso zzso To reveal the mechanism underlying this zzso function, we investigated the functional relationship between zzso and zzso II, the essential role of which in zzso development was recently zzso Despite its deleterious effects on junction formation, zzso of a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso did not interfere with the initial phase of zzso zzso triggered by the formation of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, cells zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso organization of zzso along the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso contributes to junction development without affecting the zzso contraction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses using zzso directly revealed that the zzso zzso cables were zzso expanded and developed into zzso zzso belts during zzso zzso and that zzso zzso specifically compromised this zzso Taken together, we conclude that zzso is required for zzso the zzso zzso contraction of the zzso zzso cables, thereby efficiently zzso the zzso activity with junction development and cell zzso The present results provide novel insights into not only the site of action of zzso zzso activity but also the role of zzso contraction in zzso zzso
