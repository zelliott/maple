zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso factor that belongs to the nuclear zzso zzso In the presence of its specific zzso zzso zzso into the nucleus, interacts with zzso at hormone response elements zzso and recruits a variety of zzso and zzso zzso factors to regulate zzso Using green fluorescent protein zzso zzso and the tandem gene array system of mouse zzso zzso virus zzso the interaction of zzso with zzso can be zzso and studied in live zzso The zzso array in zzso can be specifically detected by DNA zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and thereby specific binding of zzso to the array can be confirmed in the presence of specific zzso The zzso activity of zzso at the zzso array can be zzso by zzso FISH in combination with interactions of zzso or its zzso or different components of the zzso initiation complex, by indirect zzso zzso Finally, using zzso recovery after zzso zzso dynamic interactions of zzso with the zzso template can be zzso zzso to carry out these experiments are described zzso
