Different cell culture models were already used to analyze the molecular base of the zzso activities of the zzso zzso extract zzso zzso after a single or short-term zzso In these previous studies cells were severely injured with agents that promptly induce fatal cellular damage, like vast zzso stress or zzso dysfunction, and the protective effects of zzso zzso on such acute damage were zzso Our present study aimed to test zzso zzso action in cell cultures, where cellular functions are only moderately impaired by a longer zzso but relatively modest zzso stress, reduction of zzso function and reduced zzso energy levels, thereby causing only slow zzso of cellular damage over a time period of zzso To this end we used zzso cells zzso that were treated with low doses of a combination of zzso A1 and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso to the culture medium efficiently zzso the cells from progressing injury by reduced zzso oxidized zzso state, zzso zzso damage and zzso damage of zzso zzso As a result the cells were protected from zzso death that was observed in cultures without zzso zzso after zzso of damage zzso This cell culture system characterizing moderate cellular stress will be applied in future studies to further investigate the mode of action of single zzso zzso zzso
