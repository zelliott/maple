zzso structured zzso zzso zzso has opened up new possibilities to study nuclear architecture at the zzso level down to the zzso zzso zzso We present first results and assess the potential using zzso in combination with zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso for the topographical analysis of defined nuclear zzso Our study also deals with the concern that artifacts produced by FISH may counteract the gain in zzso We address the topography of zzso DNA in zzso before and after zzso nuclear pores and the zzso zzso territories, zzso zzso and individual gene zzso We also look at the replication patterns of zzso and the topographical relationship of zzso within the inactive zzso These examples demonstrate that an appropriately adapted zzso approach preserves key characteristics of the nuclear zzso and that the gain in information obtained by zzso yields new insights into the functional nuclear zzso
