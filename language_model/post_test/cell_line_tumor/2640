zzso regulatory zzso proteins 1 and 2 zzso and zzso are important regulators of genes involved in cholesterol and fatty acid zzso but have also been implicated in the regulation of the cell cycle and have been associated with the zzso of type 2 diabetes, zzso and zzso among zzso In this study, we aimed to characterize the binding sites of zzso and zzso zzso II through zzso zzso and zzso analysis in zzso of the human zzso as defined by the zzso of DNA zzso zzso in a zzso zzso cell line zzso Our data identified novel binding sites for zzso in genes directly or indirectly involved in cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The most interesting biological findings were the binding sites for zzso in genes for host cell factor C1 zzso involved in cell cycle regulation, and for zzso A zzso For zzso zzso II, we found binding sites at classical zzso but also in zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, we found evidence of zzso binding of zzso and zzso zzso II to zzso and zzso From the results of this work, we zzso that zzso may be involved in processes other than zzso zzso
