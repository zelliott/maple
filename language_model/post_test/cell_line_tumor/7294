zzso is an zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and other families of medicinal zzso The purpose of the present study was to investigate the effects of zzso on zzso channels and big zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso channel currents in human embryonic kidney cells zzso which were zzso with zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso but not that with zzso zzso zzso zzso At 25 zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso currents zzso from zzso to zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso expressed zzso zzso channel currents in zzso cells were not affected by zzso zzso zzso although zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited the expressed zzso currents zzso zzso In zzso zzso selectively inhibited zzso channels by targeting on zzso zzso This discovery may help design specific agents to selectively zzso the function of zzso channel complex and facilitate the understanding of the zzso relationship of specific zzso of zzso zzso
