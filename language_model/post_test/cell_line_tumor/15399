zzso has been used as zzso treatment in patients with type 2 diabetes, and is reported to reduce cancer risk and progression by zzso the liver zzso B1 zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso remains the main drug for treating advanced zzso lung zzso However, drug resistance often develops through several mechanisms during the treatment course, including one mechanism zzso by the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso pathway, related to the generation of zzso oxygen species zzso This study demonstrated a correlation between zzso zzso and zzso zzso using zzso zzso cell lines zzso that contained zzso active zzso plasmids as a zzso A zzso inhibitor zzso enhanced the zzso sensitivity in zzso cells, whereas zzso inhibited zzso zzso and enhanced zzso zzso By contrast, another zzso zzso zzso failed to produce these zzso zzso zzso by small, interfering zzso or zzso target of zzso zzso zzso by zzso or zzso did not alter the effect of zzso on zzso activity suppression, suggesting that zzso can zzso the zzso zzso through an zzso and probably zzso zzso zzso also inhibited zzso zzso production and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Both mechanisms contributed to the ability of zzso to suppress zzso zzso in cancer cells, which resulted in the decreased zzso of vascular zzso growth factor by cancer zzso The growth of subcutaneous tumor zzso was significantly delayed by a combination of zzso and zzso This is the first study to demonstrate that zzso suppresses zzso zzso via zzso but zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso helps to overcome tumor drug resistance by targeting zzso
