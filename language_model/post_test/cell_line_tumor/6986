For over a decade our laboratory has developed and used a novel zzso zzso using zzso zzso beads to examine the surface properties of various cell zzso Most recently, we have used this zzso to examine zzso binding zzso on two human cell types, zzso a colon cancer cell line, and zzso a zzso colon cell zzso We found that zzso cells bound specific zzso better than zzso and this information was used to test for possible differential toxicity of these zzso in culture, as a possible approach in the design of more specific zzso zzso Although we have examined the zzso of the zzso zzso in sea zzso cell systems, we have not previously validated this technique for zzso zzso Here the binding results of the zzso zzso are compared with conventional zzso zzso using zzso from three species zzso zzso zzso zzso and Lens zzso on the two colon cell zzso These zzso were chosen because they seemed to interact with the two cell lines zzso zzso results obtained using both zzso were compared for frozen, thawed and zzso cultured and zzso and live zzso Both qualitative and quantitative zzso results generally correlated with those using the zzso zzso Similar results were also obtained with all of the three different cell preparation zzso The zzso zzso was able to detect lower zzso binding zzso levels than the zzso zzso while the zzso zzso because it can so rapidly detect cells with large numbers of zzso binding zzso is ideal for initial screening studies that seek to identify cells that are rich in surface zzso for specific zzso The direct use of frozen, thawed and fixed cells allows rapid mass screening for surface zzso without the requirement for costly and time consuming cell zzso
