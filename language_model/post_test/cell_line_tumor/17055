zzso zzso is an zzso growth factor zzso protein that has been shown to signal through zzso zzso and/or zzso pathways in zzso cells, and that is frequently expressed in human primary breast zzso In the present study, the human zzso zzso positive, zzso breast cancer cell line, that expresses low levels of zzso zzso was zzso with a zzso expression zzso zzso zzso cells expressed high levels of a 25 zzso zzso zzso protein that was not detected in zzso cells zzso with a control zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not induce an zzso independent zzso in zzso zzso In fact, zzso zzso cells showed a response to zzso zzso that was similar to zzso zzso cells, and failed to grow in zzso mice in absence of zzso zzso However, zzso zzso cells showed a rate of proliferation in serum free conditions, and an ability to form colonies in zzso that were higher as compared with zzso zzso zzso More importantly, zzso of zzso enhanced the resistance to zzso and the invasion ability of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells showed levels of zzso of both zzso and zzso that were significantly higher as compared with zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso might be associated with the progression towards a more aggressive zzso in breast zzso through the zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso
