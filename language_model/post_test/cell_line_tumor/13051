zzso the primary zzso for zzso acid, plays an important role in tumor growth and zzso zzso acid interactions can be exploited for targeted delivery of zzso agents specifically to cancer zzso Although various zzso zzso of zzso are expressed on the plasma membrane of cancer cells, the zzso acid binding domain zzso is highly zzso among the zzso zzso zzso Using a novel zzso process, we have identified zzso zzso zzso that specifically bind to the zzso zzso with high zzso zzso affinities of the selected zzso for the zzso were in the range of zzso zzso an affinity significantly higher than that of zzso acid zzso above the zzso zzso The selected zzso bound to zzso positive human zzso cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso but failed to bind the zzso negative zzso cell zzso Our results indicated that zzso substitution at specific positions of the DNA zzso backbone results in specific and zzso binding of zzso to zzso The selected zzso will be of great interest for further development as a targeting or imaging agent for the delivery of therapeutic zzso for cancer zzso
