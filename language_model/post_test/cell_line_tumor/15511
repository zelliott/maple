The purpose of this work is intended to investigate the potential of zzso zzso drug delivery system for enhanced oral zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso The components of zzso zzso were zzso by their zzso and zzso zzso The zzso phase zzso provided zzso existence ranges and the corresponding zzso were developed and evaluated via zzso and zzso zzso The successful zzso were characterized for various parameters including time required for zzso percentage zzso zzso size, surface zzso zzso potential and in zzso zzso The zzso loaded zzso zzso showed zzso and zzso higher zzso zzso in zzso to zzso direction across zzso zzso as compared to the zzso and plain drug solution, zzso The zzso loaded zzso zzso showed a higher zzso at the highest tested concentration compared to the blank zzso zzso and the free zzso Furthermore, an in zzso zzso study of zzso in zzso zzso showed zzso and zzso increase in relative oral zzso compared with that of zzso in zzso and drug suspension, zzso Thus, the developed zzso drug delivery system could be a valuable tool for the effective oral delivery of zzso
