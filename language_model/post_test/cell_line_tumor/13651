zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso is a leading cause of gastric zzso zzso zzso which arises from abnormal cell differentiation of the zzso in the gastric zzso However, the mechanisms involved in zzso zzso IM remain zzso The aim of our study was to explore the effects and the underlying mechanisms of zzso zzso on the abnormal expression of zzso and zzso and to reveal its relationship to the development of gastric zzso We found that zzso and zzso were zzso in gastric IM zzso zzso expression was zzso whereas zzso zzso which was independent of the zzso zzso factor, was zzso in gastric zzso cells and coincided with increased zzso and zzso levels in the culture zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso was induced by zzso expression in the gastric zzso zzso Although zzso and zzso levels correlated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso before and after zzso zzso zzso in the gastric zzso only the blocking of zzso zzso zzso using zzso or zzso zzso interference altered zzso zzso Additionally, we found that zzso zzso zzso zzso which is a direct downstream target gene of zzso signaling and a zzso of zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso induced inflammation zzso zzso expression via zzso zzso zzso while suppressing zzso which provides a novel molecular connection between a zzso zzso infection and zzso zzso
