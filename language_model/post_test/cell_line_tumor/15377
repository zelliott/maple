zzso zzso zzso factor zzso was recently reported to be a zzso factor for pancreatic cancer zzso Here, we demonstrate a novel role for zzso as a potent zzso zzso promoting both zzso and vascular zzso zzso of zzso in a mouse pancreatic cancer model resulted in increased tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso migration and zzso tube formation of human zzso cells zzso consistently with increased zzso in zzso zzso also increased zzso zzso through the disruption of vascular zzso zzso junctions in zzso and induced vascular leakage in mouse zzso These effects were attenuated upon treatment with an zzso against zzso Moreover, zzso evoked a zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso NO zzso zzso in zzso which are closely linked to zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso in zzso and zzso the in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso responses to zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso for zzso Taken together, these data demonstrate that zzso has a novel function in promoting zzso and vascular zzso Our findings suggest new possibilities for zzso role in the zzso of zzso zzso
