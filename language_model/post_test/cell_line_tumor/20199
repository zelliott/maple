zzso zzso coli zzso causes zzso zzso and poor growth in zzso Human breast milk decreases zzso bacteria by zzso nutrients and zzso factors such as zzso zzso milk with and without human zzso zzso may improve the repair of zzso barrier function damage induced by zzso This work investigates the effect of the zzso on zzso barrier function repair, bacterial adherence in zzso and zzso cells, zzso cell zzso migration, viability and zzso in zzso cells in the absence or presence of zzso 

zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso Rockville, zzso were used for zzso migration and viability zzso and human colon zzso zzso zzso Rockville, zzso and human zzso zzso zzso zzso Rockville, zzso cells were used for bacterial zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso in their milk were generated and express zzso in milk at concentration of zzso zzso zzso were incubated with pasteurized milk from either transgenic zzso expressing zzso or zzso control zzso in the presence and absence of zzso strain zzso zzso 

Cellular proliferation was significantly greater in the presence of both zzso transgenic and control goat milk compared to cells with no zzso Cellular migration was significantly decreased in the presence of zzso alone but was restored in the presence of zzso Milk from zzso transgenic zzso had significantly more migration compared to control zzso Both zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso to zzso cells and transgenic milk resulted in less colonization than control milk using a zzso zzso Both zzso had significantly increased cellular viability as well as less zzso in both the absence and presence of zzso 

These data demonstrated that goat milk is able to repair zzso barrier function damage induced by zzso and that goat milk with a higher concentration of zzso offers additional zzso
