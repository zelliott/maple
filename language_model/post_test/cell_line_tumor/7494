Only a few techniques are currently available for zzso systemic zzso in zzso zzso Cancer cell expression of naturally zzso zzso zzso zzso provides a useful circulating zzso that enables the monitoring of zzso tumor burden and of treatment response from minimal drops of zzso This zzso zzso zzso exhibits several distinct zzso zzso It is highly sensitive in zzso zzso tumor growth, particularly when compared to zzso zzso imaging zzso alone; zzso It is quantitative by nature and reflects viable tumor burden in a minimally invasive manner; zzso Through zzso collection of blood samples, treatment response can be monitored in zzso and zzso zzso zzso provides a means to zzso and assess zzso colonization using zzso By zzso the progression of systemic zzso and therapeutic response in animal models, the zzso zzso zzso is emerging as a valuable quantitative tool for novel drug zzso
