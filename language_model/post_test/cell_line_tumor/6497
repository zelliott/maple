zzso and acquired drug resistance are major obstacles to the successful treatment of zzso 

We used an integrated resistance model and zzso tools to globally explore molecular factors and cellular pathways zzso resistance to zzso agents in zzso zzso 

We identified a zzso signature that predicts a common in zzso and in zzso resistance zzso to these agents, a proportion of which is imprinted zzso by gene dosage changes in the resistant zzso zzso This signature was highly enriched for genes with functions in cell death, compromise, and zzso zzso was a zzso organizational principle of the signature, with functions being carried out by groups of interacting molecules in overlapping zzso A highly significant network was built around nuclear zzso zzso which included the persistent zzso of various zzso zzso zzso zzso necrosis zzso protein 3 zzso was identified as a new regulatory component of a putative zzso signaling cascade that mediates zzso zzso in response to DNA damage caused by zzso zzso zzso of the corresponding zinc finger protein zzso closely mirrored the expression of the zzso transcript, and was zzso related to zzso zzso status in the resistant zzso A prediction model based on the resistance signature enabled the zzso of an independent, validation cohort of 31 zzso into two outcome groups zzso zzso zzso and revealed zzso as part of an zzso zzso predictor associated significantly with patient survival zzso zzso zzso 

Our results offer strong evidence for zzso as a key regulator of the zzso signaling to activate zzso en route to zzso agent resistance in zzso zzso This zzso may be an attractive target for therapeutic zzso of zzso
