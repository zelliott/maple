zzso derived growth factor zzso zzso activity is zzso in human zzso due to amplification and zzso of the zzso gene locus or zzso of the zzso zzso resulting in the zzso of downstream zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso target of zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling is observed in approximately zzso of human zzso which are frequently zzso classified as the zzso zzso It would be valuable to understand how zzso driven zzso respond to zzso and zzso zzso 

Using genetically engineered zzso and zzso zzso mouse models of zzso that closely mimic the zzso and zzso of the human zzso zzso we investigated the effect of zzso zzso and zzso alone or in combination in zzso and in zzso We used zzso and zzso to inhibit zzso and zzso zzso Here, we show in zzso data demonstrating that the most effective zzso of zzso and zzso activity in both zzso and zzso primary zzso cell cultures is obtained when using both zzso in zzso We next investigated if the effects we observed in culture could be duplicated in zzso by treating mice with zzso for 5 zzso The in zzso treatments with the combination of zzso and zzso resulted in decreased zzso and zzso zzso which correlated to decreased proliferation and increased cell death independent of zzso status, as monitored by zzso analysis, zzso and zzso 

These findings underline the importance of simultaneously targeting zzso and zzso to achieve significant zzso of the zzso zzso and support the rationale for testing the zzso and zzso combination in the human zzso of zzso
