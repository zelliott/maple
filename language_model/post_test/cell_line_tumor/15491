Bone zzso is the most common distant zzso in breast zzso The identification of key proteins involved in the zzso zzso would represent a major step toward the development of new zzso markers and therapeutic zzso The aim of this study was to characterize functional zzso that favor bone zzso in human breast zzso We used the human breast cancer cell line zzso and its zzso zzso zzso to identify crucial proteins in bone zzso zzso We identified 31 zzso 15 zzso and 16 zzso in zzso cells compared with parental zzso We employed a zzso approach in which these 31 candidate proteins were zzso with respect to their potential in zzso formation, based on the zzso of the zzso interaction network and differential zzso The zzso interaction network provided a framework to study the functional relationships between biological molecules by zzso functions to genes whose functions had not been zzso The combination of expression profiles and protein interactions revealed an zzso zzso zzso zzso functioning as a hub that retained four zzso zzso involved in zzso presentation associated with the human major zzso complex class I zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso Further analysis of the interaction network revealed an inverse correlation between zzso and zzso which influences zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso in zzso cells confirmed its bone zzso zzso zzso Altogether, zzso appears as a zzso zzso that can regulate diverse biological processes to maintain the zzso of breast cancer cells and promote the development of bone zzso
