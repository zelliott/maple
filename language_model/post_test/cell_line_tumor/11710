zzso zzso have been reported to play a crucial role in regulating a variety of genes pivotal for tumor zzso zzso is well known as one of the zzso regulatory zzso Recent studies have reported controversial roles of zzso in tumor zzso In this study, we sought to investigate the potential roles of zzso in zzso cancer zzso By real-time zzso zzso was shown to be zzso in primary zzso zzso and cell zzso Restoration of zzso in zzso cells inhibited cell growth, migration and zzso Using both in zzso prediction and zzso we found that vascular zzso growth factor zzso was a target of zzso The interaction of zzso on the zzso of zzso zzso was validated by zzso reporter zzso zzso we found that the zzso of zzso was induced by promoter zzso of its host zzso zzso Treatment with zzso restored zzso expression and thereby led to a decline in zzso zzso zzso due to suppression of zzso enhanced zzso expression inhibited tumor zzso triggered by zzso zzso In conclusion, our findings suggest that DNA zzso zzso of zzso zzso at least in part, to tumor invasion and zzso in zzso through zzso of zzso zzso zzso may be a potential target for the therapeutic strategy against zzso
