zzso zzso zzso lack a functional zzso zzso pathway, so must acquire zzso from the environment to zzso However, the molecular zzso responsible for zzso acquisition by these organisms is zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso functions in zzso zzso zzso zzso localized to the plasma membrane and to zzso zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso deprivation in zzso zzso increased zzso transcript levels, promoted zzso of the fluorescent zzso analog zzso and increased the total zzso zzso content of zzso zzso deletion of one zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso and the zzso zzso pool by approximately zzso indicating that zzso is a major zzso importer in zzso zzso zzso zzso with correct replacement of both zzso zzso could not be obtained despite extensive attempts, suggesting that this gene is essential for the survival of zzso zzso zzso expression allowed zzso zzso to import zzso from the environment, and rescued growth of a strain deficient in zzso zzso zzso genes with high sequence identity to zzso are present in the zzso of several species of zzso and also zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicating that therapeutic agents targeting this zzso could be effective against a broad group of zzso zzso that cause serious human zzso
