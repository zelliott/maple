The inflammatory response and the zzso signaling zzso induced by severe acute respiratory syndrome zzso zzso were studied in lung zzso cells and zzso zzso spike zzso zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso promoter and zzso but not zzso in these zzso zzso of the zzso not the zzso site, abolished the zzso S zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso release was effectively induced by zzso a zzso exhibiting the zzso zzso zzso of S zzso and this induction was attenuated by the zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso expressing different deletion and zzso fragments identified the functional region of S protein from zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso which is responsible for zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso binding and zzso after zzso zzso were demonstrated, and zzso S zzso zzso promoter activity was inhibited by the specific zzso of zzso zzso These results suggested that the S protein of zzso could induce release of zzso in the lung cells via zzso of zzso and zzso The identification of the functional domain for zzso release will provide for the drug design on targeting specific sequence zzso of S protein responsible for initiating the inflammatory zzso
