A series of novel zzso zzso were zzso and screened for zzso and zzso activities at Emory University and at the National Cancer Institute zzso These compounds are symmetrical zzso and saturated zzso The majority of the zzso demonstrated a moderate degree of zzso zzso zzso 10, 11, and 14 exhibited a high degree of zzso in the zzso in zzso zzso cell line zzso In addition, this screen revealed that these compounds inhibit tumor cell growth with a higher potency than the commonly used zzso drug, zzso In independent in zzso screens conducted at zzso the same compounds plus 4, 5, 8, 9, and 13 exhibited a high degree of zzso to tumor zzso zzso that were effective in the zzso screens were also effective in in zzso zzso zzso zzso 4, 9, 11, and 14 were most effective in the zzso zzso run at zzso In the zzso conducted by the zzso compound 14 was almost as potent as the zzso drug zzso which has undergone clinical zzso Based on the favorable in zzso zzso and zzso results with 14, further in zzso tests were zzso This compound effectively reduced the size of human breast tumors grown in female zzso nude mice and showed little zzso This data, coupled with the remarkable in zzso data, suggests that compound 14 may potentially be an effective zzso zzso As a zzso a zzso quantitative structure relationship based on 14 has been zzso It shows a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis suggests the compound to be a possible zzso zzso but also implies that the zzso zzso may arise from a presently unknown zzso
