Although zzso of zzso can be found in both benign and zzso zzso tumors, they are mostly seen in zzso zzso including zzso The aim of this present study is to develop a molecular imaging contrast agent for selective identification of zzso zzso in human zzso tumor zzso ex zzso and in human zzso cells in zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso binding zzso zzso was designed to mimic natural protein zzso property in zzso A zzso zzso dye zzso zzso zzso was zzso to characterize zzso on human zzso tumor tissue sections ex zzso and to selectively image zzso zzso in human zzso cells in zzso 

Using a zzso molecular imaging probe, we have shown that it is possible to selectively image zzso zzso in zzso zzso ex zzso and in human zzso zzso cells in zzso 

zzso zzso were selectively detected in zzso zzso ex zzso and in the early stage of the zzso process of zzso human zzso in zzso using our zzso molecular imaging zzso This new zzso molecular imaging probe makes it possible to study the earliest events associated with zzso deposition in various zzso zzso at the cellular and molecular zzso 

It potentially could be used to diagnose and treat zzso cancer or to anchor therapeutic agents directing the local distribution of desired therapy at zzso zzso
