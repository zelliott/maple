We investigated the expression pattern and clinical significance of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and their zzso zzso and zzso in pancreatic zzso Gene expression of all examined zzso molecules was significantly zzso in pancreatic cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein was zzso in pancreatic cancer zzso Only the expression of zzso significantly correlated with zzso survival ( zzso zzso was zzso in cultured pancreatic cancer cells by zzso and significantly correlated with the level of zzso expression in human pancreatic cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso positive tumors showed an increased prevalence of zzso regulatory T cells zzso compared to zzso negative zzso Among the investigated zzso molecules only zzso zzso seems to be of zzso relevance in pancreatic zzso zzso might, therefore, be involved in the zzso of zzso responses through regulation of zzso in pancreatic zzso Our findings also suggest a dual role of zzso in zzso zzso Through induction of zzso in pancreatic cancer cells zzso might contribute to the evasion of zzso zzso
