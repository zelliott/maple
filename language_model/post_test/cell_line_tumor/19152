To investigate the persistence of side population zzso cells in pancreatic cancer and their role and mechanism in the drug zzso 

The presentation of side population cells in pancreatic cancer cell line zzso and its proportion change when cultured with zzso was detected by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The expression of zzso and zzso was detected by real-time zzso in either SP cells or zzso zzso 

SP cells do exist in zzso with a median of zzso and a range of zzso After cultured with zzso for 3 zzso the proportion of SP cells increased significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expressed at higher zzso in SP as compared with zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso which may contribute to the zzso of fluorescent zzso and drug zzso 

SP cells with inherently high resistance to zzso agents do exist in pancreatic zzso which may be candidate cancer stem cells contributing to the zzso of the zzso
