zzso plays a pivotal role in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso expression are common in pancreatic cancer, which is an extremely aggressive zzso with a notably poor zzso In this report, we analyzed the zzso activity of zzso zzso a zzso zzso that was zzso from an Indian medicinal plant, zzso zzso and its underlying mechanism of zzso zzso induced zzso in pancreatic zzso zzso cells by prompting zzso arrest at the zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso signaling in these cells regardless of disease grade, zzso status, and zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso in most cells, thereby supporting the inversion of the zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso cascade was identified as a critical zzso of zzso regulation and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which failed to promote zzso zzso zzso zzso activated zzso facilitated zzso destruction in pancreatic zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso further activated zzso and reversed the molecular zzso Taken together, the results of the current study represent the first evidence of zzso signal zzso during the zzso phase by functionally zzso zzso via zzso treatment in pancreatic cancer zzso In conclusion, this finding suggests the potential identification of a new lead zzso in the treatment of pancreatic zzso
