zzso are zzso membrane zzso through which invasive cancer cells degrade the zzso zzso They are thought to function in the migration of cancer cells through tissue zzso which is necessary for cancer invasion and zzso Although many protein components of zzso have been identified, the organization and the role of membrane lipids in zzso are not well zzso In this study, the role of zzso zzso which are zzso membrane zzso in the assembly and function of zzso in human breast cancer cells was zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso and zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso of zzso raft formation due to depleting or zzso membrane cholesterol blocked the zzso degradation of the gelatin zzso zzso zzso a resident protein of zzso zzso and zzso accumulates at zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso raft zzso zzso type 1 zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso associated with zzso is localized at zzso zzso membrane zzso and zzso and zzso with zzso at zzso The small interfering zzso zzso of zzso inhibited the zzso and zzso degradation of the gelatin zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso are zzso in invasive human breast cancer cell lines that have an ability to form zzso These results indicate that zzso are the sites where enrichment and trafficking of zzso zzso occur and that zzso is an essential regulator of zzso function and zzso breast cancer cell zzso
