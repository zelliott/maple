In zzso studies show that sodium zzso is a potential zzso in normal cell cultures, but not tumor zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the zzso potency of sodium zzso during conventional zzso zzso of rat zzso zzso but also on tumor response and zzso frequency of zzso zzso 

The zzso area of male zzso rats and the tumor in the flank were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (15 zzso body zzso was applied through a zzso port 30 zzso before zzso zzso of a control group were treated in the same manner with an equal volume of zzso sodium zzso In the course of treatment the zzso zzso were zzso at different stages and examined zzso The evaluation of the zzso function was performed prior to and after zzso by zzso zzso volume was measured during zzso and plotted in zzso zzso zzso body weight was determined zzso to estimate the general constitution of the animal during the zzso 

zzso caused zzso damage in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (16 zzso zzso (30 zzso zzso zzso zzso and necrosis of the zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso delayed the development of the described damage, and the amount of zzso zzso cells after the application of 60 zzso was reduced zzso zzso vs sodium zzso zzso confirmed by the zzso zzso The loss in zzso function in the control group was zzso vs zzso ( zzso in the sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso had no influence on the response of zzso tumors to radiation and general zzso 

Based on zzso and zzso findings, a zzso effect on acute toxicity of rat zzso zzso could be detected under zzso with zzso application of sodium zzso In addition, no effects on tumor response and zzso frequency were zzso The general animal constitution was not affected by additional medication with sodium zzso during zzso
