The zzso zzso zzso zzso by human zzso gene functions as a pump to zzso zzso drugs from cancer zzso zzso of zzso is closely related to primary and induced drug resistance zzso of tumor zzso Recent studies have demonstrated that expression of zzso zzso is positively correlated with the zzso level, suggesting a potential of zzso specific zzso in regulation of zzso of zzso zzso zzso is one of the specific zzso of zzso and has been widely used in zzso However, its function in the response of cancer cells to zzso drugs and the related mechanism are still waiting to be zzso To explore the correlation of zzso and the zzso drug resistance, the role of zzso in drug response of cancer cells was analyzed with flow zzso high performance liquid zzso zzso and colony formation zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to significantly enhance the sensitivity of zzso and zzso cells to tamoxifen and zzso respectively, by zzso of zzso expression and increase in zzso zzso of the zzso However, zzso did not affect pump function of zzso zzso activity and zzso analyses demonstrated that the zzso effect of zzso on zzso was independent on zzso but closely related to zzso of zzso gene zzso Our study suggested that zzso was a potential agent for enhancement of the sensitivity of cancer cells to zzso zzso It also provided a links between zzso change of zzso and drug response of cancer zzso
