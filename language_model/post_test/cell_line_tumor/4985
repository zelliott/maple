To investigate the zzso stress and zzso induced by 2, zzso 4, zzso zzso zzso zzso in human zzso zzso cells, and to explore the involved role of zzso oxygen species zzso on zzso 

The rate of cellular survivors, zzso zzso level, zzso zzso content and percentage of zzso were measured respectively after the zzso cell were exposed to 2, 4, 8 zzso zzso for 24 h in zzso 

The rate of cellular survivors in the low dose zzso group was higher than the control group zzso zzso zzso but the moderate and high dose zzso groups were significantly lower than the control group zzso zzso zzso The zzso contents in the moderate and high dose zzso groups were significantly higher than the control group zzso zzso zzso and increased with increase of zzso exposure zzso Compared with the control group, the levels of zzso were significantly increased with increase of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the moderate and high dose zzso groups, the percentages of zzso were significantly higher than that of the control group zzso zzso zzso 

zzso can induce zzso stress and zzso in zzso zzso zzso may play an important role in the zzso induced by zzso
