The emergence of drug resistance is a primary concern in any cancer treatment, including with targeted zzso zzso as exemplified by the appearance of zzso point zzso in chronic zzso leukemia zzso patients treated with zzso In zzso approaches to identify resistance zzso in zzso have yielded zzso zzso that faithfully zzso clinical zzso To predict resistance zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso that could emerge during inhibitor treatment in patients, we conducted a resistance screen in zzso zzso cells using the novel selective zzso inhibitor zzso The observed spectrum of zzso in resistant cells was dominated by zzso of zzso 1230 but also included other zzso zzso and partially overlapped with zzso zzso zzso that were previously described in cancer zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain in complex with zzso revealed a key role for zzso in binding of zzso as previously reported for multiple other selective zzso zzso A second resistance screen in the same format with the zzso inhibitor AMG zzso yielded a distinct spectrum of zzso rich in zzso zzso which is consistent with a different predicted binding zzso Our findings suggest that zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso domain of cancer patients need to be carefully monitored before and during treatment with zzso zzso as resistance may zzso or zzso zzso binding in the same manner as zzso might be particularly susceptible to the development of resistance through zzso in zzso a condition that may be addressed by zzso zzso with alternative binding zzso
