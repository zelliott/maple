zzso transport is important for zzso acid synthesis in cells that cannot zzso zzso de zzso and for entry of many zzso zzso analog drugs used in zzso This study demonstrates that various steroid hormones induce zzso of zzso transport in zzso zzso We analyzed the zzso effects of zzso zzso on zzso transport using zzso human zzso zzso We observed zzso effects after acute treatment with zzso which lasted in the presence of zzso However, when zzso was removed, the effect immediately disappeared, suggesting that zzso effects are not zzso through the zzso regulatory zzso of steroid hormones, such as zzso zzso We also discovered that zzso could competitively inhibit zzso zzso and binding of the labeled zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso binds to zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso of zzso zzso We then tested the effects of various steroids on zzso zzso in zzso cells, zzso and zzso cells zzso rat zzso We found zzso and zzso clearly inhibited both zzso and insensitive zzso at zzso zzso Taken together, we concluded that steroid hormones function as novel zzso transport zzso by competition with zzso for their zzso
