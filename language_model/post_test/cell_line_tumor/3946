zzso zzso have poor overall survival despite recent zzso in early detection methods, zzso zzso techniques, and chemotherapy zzso zzso viral therapy has had promising therapeutic potential for various zzso and has a great safety zzso We investigated the therapeutic efficacy of a novel zzso zzso virus carrying the human sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on gastric zzso and its potential utility for imaging with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was tested against five human gastric cancer cell lines using zzso and standard viral plaque zzso In zzso subcutaneous flank tumors were generated in nude mice with human gastric cancer cells, zzso zzso were subsequently injected with either zzso zzso or PBS and followed for tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso imaging were zzso 

zzso zzso a surrogate for viral zzso confirmed viral infection by 24 zzso At a zzso of infection zzso of 1, zzso zzso achieved zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso over 9 days, and zzso zzso in zzso 45 and zzso In zzso zzso zzso was effective in treating zzso zzso zzso zzso after 2 weeks of zzso zzso zzso tumors were readily zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso imaging 2 days after zzso 

zzso zzso is an effective zzso virus expressing the zzso protein that can efficiently zzso gastric tumors and allow zzso zzso These data encourages its continued investigation in clinical zzso
