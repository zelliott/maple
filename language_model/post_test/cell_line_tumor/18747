The zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso has been shown to facilitate zzso zzso zzso In multiple zzso zzso is an important factor in the promotion of growth and survival of the zzso zzso Studies have shown that enhanced zzso levels in myeloma patients correlated with aggressive zzso zzso we investigated the effect of zzso human zzso on the zzso behavior of myeloma cells across the zzso barrier of the major disease zzso zzso human bone zzso zzso zzso In the presence of zzso we observed significantly increased migration both in established myeloma cell lines and in plasma cells from myeloma zzso zzso of zzso 2 zzso but not zzso 1 zzso was detected in myeloma cell zzso zzso cells of patients also showed expression of zzso but not zzso The effect of zzso could not be explained by altered expression of zzso molecules or zzso Instead, we found an zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso and confirmed that myeloma cells express the relevant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of myeloma cells with zzso human zzso also enhanced cell migration, and this effect, as well as the effect of zzso was abolished by treatment with zzso zzso In contrast, migration of myeloma cells in the direction of an zzso zzso zzso zzso could not be observed in the cell lines zzso Additionally, the zzso level of zzso was zzso by the zzso treatment, which points to an zzso loop zzso and/or stabilizing the zzso zzso In zzso our data clearly support additional investigations using zzso zzso in myeloma zzso
