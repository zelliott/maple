The zzso property of zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an essential role in the zzso of various zzso and serves as an important therapeutic zzso In this study, we identified frequent zzso loss of zzso and six novel driver zzso within zzso in lung zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso leads to zzso of zzso and zzso of its downstream zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulted in enhanced cell zzso colony formation, cell migration, and tumor growth in zzso zzso Furthermore, the activated zzso zzso was increasingly detected in 13 human lung cancer cell lines and 263 lung cancer specimens regardless of tumor stages and zzso Treatment of two different zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulted in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso shrinkage of zzso and suppression of zzso and significantly improved survival of zzso zzso zzso Together, we identified that novel zzso point zzso possessed zzso effects mainly through zzso of zzso and zzso of downstream zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso could serve as a diagnostic zzso for lung zzso Furthermore, targeting zzso zzso zzso with zzso could be a promising strategy to improve the therapeutic efficacy of fatal lung zzso
