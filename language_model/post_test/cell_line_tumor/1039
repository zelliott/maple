Human zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with both zzso and zzso deleted zzso zzso zzso were used to study the role of the zzso proteins during zzso zzso zzso with either zzso or zzso zzso of which the latter zzso normal zzso zzso of the zzso showed no obvious differences in their ability to differentiate to a zzso zzso upon treatment with zzso acid zzso A defined pattern of zzso expression was observed during differentiation with both zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to increase dramatically within zzso h of zzso zzso zzso gave an earlier and longer lasting increase in full-length zzso zzso The zzso distribution pattern of zzso was markedly altered following zzso zzso Within zzso zzso was highly zzso throughout the cell body around the zzso Between 2 and 4 weeks zzso zzso appeared zzso and also zzso to the zzso zzso in zzso expression upon treatment with zzso and zzso were blocked by treatment with zzso indicating a role of zzso protein synthesis in this zzso zzso expression remained unchanged during zzso zzso of full-length zzso were also seen to increase during zzso and zzso differentiation in the zzso of first zzso human zzso between zzso and 11 zzso These combined observations support the idea that zzso is involved in zzso differentiation by a mechanism likely independent of zzso of the zzso
