To zzso the mechanisms underlining zzso collagen chain zzso we performed an initial analysis of the structure and function of the core promoter of the human zzso zzso The core promoter, which lacks a typical zzso motif and has a high zzso content, was defined within the zzso zzso immediately upstream from the major zzso start site by transient zzso zzso In this region, we identified four zzso complexes, named A, B, C, and D, by a combination of zzso I zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso zzso mobility shift zzso using zzso zzso revealed that the complexes A, B, C, and D bind to zzso to zzso the zzso to zzso the zzso to zzso and the zzso to zzso zzso zzso The competition zzso using consensus zzso and zzso zzso with specific zzso showed that complex A consists of zzso In a zzso zzso zzso zzso protein directly bound to this region, in zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso activated the zzso whereas the proteins of complexes B and C zzso its zzso Furthermore, zzso of a zzso form of the zzso zzso which forms zzso with zzso and zzso zzso inhibited promoter zzso
