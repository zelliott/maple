zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso that suppresses the zzso activity of zzso factor complex through zzso of zzso zzso zzso signaling is thought to play a critical role in human zzso so it is possible that zzso acts as a tumor zzso by regulating the zzso zzso In the present study we investigated zzso expression in human zzso in order to better understand its potential value as a therapeutic target for this zzso zzso from 70 human zzso were subjected to zzso and western zzso zzso We found that zzso expression was directly but zzso correlated with zzso zzso A low zzso expression level was associated with poor patient zzso We also analyzed the effect of zzso of zzso on cell zzso using a cell counting kit and western zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells via zzso of zzso zzso may be a useful independent zzso indicator for zzso Gene therapeutic approaches aimed at zzso zzso expression could be developed for treatment of zzso
