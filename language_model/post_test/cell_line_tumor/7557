zzso zzso cell zzso zzso is a common zzso in China; however, zzso available zzso cell lines are few and not established from Chinese zzso zzso novel and zzso zzso cell lines of Chinese origin are urgently needed to provide researchers with a comprehensive database for zzso zzso From 40 cases of zzso we established a novel cell line that was maintained for more than 100 passages in zzso and was found to have typical zzso zzso and zzso zzso characterization analysis revealed zzso in DNA zzso a doubling time of some zzso high zzso in zzso zzso higher invasive potential and more sensitive to radiation and zzso compared with zzso cell line; zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso negative infection of human zzso zzso and zzso expression of head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso 5 and zzso a zzso zzso with complex structural zzso and dozens of zzso genes and zzso Cell zzso testing by the American Type Culture Collection zzso confirmed the human origin of this cell zzso Our findings indicate that a novel and zzso zzso cell line zzso the primary zzso zzso characteristics is established and well zzso It does not match any cell lines within the zzso database and helps to zzso the molecular zzso of zzso
