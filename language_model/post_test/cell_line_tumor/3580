We investigated the effects of consensus zzso zzso a zzso occurring type I zzso with higher specific activity than other type I zzso on the growth of human liver cancer zzso 

The effect of zzso on the proliferation of 13 liver cancer cell lines was investigated in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso and zzso were transplanted zzso into the back of nude mice, then zzso was zzso administered to the mice once a day for 2 weeks, and tumor volume and zzso were zzso 

zzso expressed a zzso growth zzso effect in all cell lines in zzso zzso tumor volume in mice that received zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso to the clinical dose for chronic zzso zzso was zzso of the control, zzso resulted in zzso and 1 zzso resulted in zzso zzso tumor volume under the same treatment was 61, 24 and zzso of the control, zzso The number of zzso cells significantly increased and the number of blood vessels significantly decreased with the increase in zzso zzso 

zzso suppressed zzso growth in nude zzso These data indicate the potential clinical application of zzso in the prevention and treatment of zzso
