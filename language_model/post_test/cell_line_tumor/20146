The type II zzso zzso zzso zzso are a family of cell surface zzso zzso contributing to a number of zzso such as zzso invasion and zzso Within the zzso zzso is a relatively newly identified member and this zzso has been shown to play a key role in cancer zzso zzso has long been regarded as an zzso The deregulation of the zzso zzso zzso plays a significant role in the progression and possibly the development of zzso However, little is known about the role of zzso in prostate zzso This study aimed to examine the correlation between zzso and zzso zzso was knocked down in the normal prostate cells, zzso and zzso using a zzso zzso targeting zzso The altered cells were used in a number of zzso experiments designed to investigate the involvement of zzso with zzso and to further zzso its zzso The zzso of zzso had no effect on cell growth or zzso but significantly reduced cell zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso respective control zzso and invasive capability zzso cells, zzso zzso cells, zzso The zzso also caused a large increase in zzso protein expression at the cell membrane in zzso and zzso cells and a decrease in zzso cells zzso zzso but did not affect the zzso zzso zzso may have an important impact on prostate cancer zzso The data gained from this study suggest that zzso protects against the development and progression of prostate cancer by regulating the zzso and invasive capabilities of prostate cancer zzso zzso also reduces the levels of zzso at the cell zzso As zzso is highly involved in the regulation of cellular zzso including zzso and invasion, the reduction of zzso expression by zzso may be a possible mechanism by which zzso zzso
