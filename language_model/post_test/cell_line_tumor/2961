Twenty zzso acid zzso derivatives zzso including 13 new zzso derivatives were zzso and evaluated as zzso and zzso zzso zzso 7 and 20 with a zzso and compound 6 with a zzso zzso showed potent zzso effect on zzso zzso generation in rat zzso response to zzso and zzso zzso zzso 6 with a zzso zzso revealed stronger zzso effect on zzso activity than those of compounds 13 and 14 with a zzso zzso 14, a zzso zzso exhibited potent zzso effect on NO zzso and zzso protein expression while compounds 3, 10, 13, 15, 17, and 21 revealed potent zzso effect on tumor necrosis zzso zzso formation in zzso zzso cells in response to zzso zzso The zzso of ring A of 3 attenuated the zzso effect on zzso formation in zzso zzso cells in response to zzso except for zzso The present results suggested these compounds were potential to be served as zzso and zzso zzso
