Gene therapy is a candidate approach for treating cancer patients whose tumors have developed resistance to some zzso Our study aims to examine possible zzso in zzso zzso expression in a zzso cells zzso derived from the human zzso zzso cell line zzso and the underlying zzso zzso 

zzso zzso expression in zzso and zzso cells was measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to evaluate attachment of zzso to the cell surface and zzso zzso into zzso After zzso of cells with zzso DNA, promoter activity was measured by zzso zzso 

We show here that zzso cells exhibited increased zzso zzso zzso despite moderately decreased zzso attachment and zzso as compared with zzso zzso The increased zzso expression was also observed with a virus zzso that does not use the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that increased zzso expression is independent of zzso Upon zzso of zzso cells with a zzso expressing a reporter gene under the control of the zzso promoter or a zzso containing the complete zzso zzso zzso promoter activity was zzso and zzso higher, respectively, than in zzso zzso 

The increased zzso zzso expression in the zzso cells is due to the increased zzso promoter activity in zzso zzso Our results point out that zzso zzso may be accompanied with an zzso in promoter zzso zzso the proper choice of promoter could contribute to a decrease in the zzso dose required to achieve a therapeutic effect during gene zzso
