zzso has long been implicated as a contributor to zzso in many zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso is the zzso that causes zzso disease and it is known to zzso induce the production of inflammatory zzso in a variety of zzso In experiments where zzso zzso was zzso in zzso with primary zzso we observed robust expression and release of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but we detected no induction of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso expressed negligible amounts of inflammatory zzso and also remained resistant to zzso When zzso cells were zzso with zzso and zzso zzso significant zzso zzso consistently zzso zzso zzso imaging of these cell cultures stained for zzso and with cell zzso markers confirmed that it was predominantly the zzso cells that were zzso zzso analysis demonstrated an intense zzso inflammatory response to zzso zzso including zzso in gene transcripts for zzso and zzso Surprisingly, a zzso that exhibited profound changes in regard to inflammatory signaling was triggering zzso expressed on zzso zzso zzso zzso transcript zzso in essential zzso zzso genes also occurred in zzso cells cultured in the presence of zzso and zzso zzso which indicated a shift from cell survival to preparation for zzso when compared to zzso cells cultured in the presence of zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these findings indicate that zzso zzso is not directly toxic to zzso zzso rather, these cells become distressed and die in the inflammatory surroundings generated by zzso through a bystander zzso If, as we hypothesized, zzso zzso is the key zzso event in zzso zzso then targeting zzso responses may be a significant therapeutic approach for the treatment of this form of zzso zzso
