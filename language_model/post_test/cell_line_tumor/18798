zzso zzso cells have a defined life span and undergo terminal differentiation as they mature and migrate to the zzso zzso The differentiation process can be induced in cultured colon cancer cells by sodium zzso which zzso expression of various differentiation markers followed subsequently by cell zzso In the present study, zzso zzso zzso cells were shown to undergo zzso zzso zzso that was mainly produced through a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso either by zzso pan zzso inhibitor zzso by zzso 9 inhibitor zzso or by zzso of zzso also inhibited the expression of differentiation zzso These findings suggest zzso that terminal differentiation of zzso colon zzso cells is tightly linked to zzso zzso and zzso that increased expression of zzso members of the zzso family of zzso as well as other zzso of zzso zzso has the potential to inhibit terminal differentiation and thereby may contribute to the progression of colon zzso
