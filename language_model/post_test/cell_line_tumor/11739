zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso are heavily zzso in semiconductor devices, gas zzso zzso solar energy zzso zzso and heat transfer zzso It has been reported that liver is one of the target zzso for zzso after they gain entry into the body through any of the possible zzso Recent studies have shown zzso response of zzso zzso in liver zzso However, the underlying mechanism of zzso in liver cells due to zzso zzso exposure is largely zzso We explored the possible mechanisms of zzso induced by zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso in shape with a smooth surface and had an average diameter of 22 zzso zzso zzso zzso range zzso zzso were found to induce zzso in zzso cells in zzso manner, which was likely to be zzso through zzso oxygen species generation and zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso gene zzso were zzso due to zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso membrane potential with a zzso increase in the gene expression of zzso ratio suggested that zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso induced zzso This study has provided valuable insights into the possible mechanism of zzso caused by zzso zzso at in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso due to zzso zzso exposure should be further invested at in zzso zzso
