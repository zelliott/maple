To determine the zzso of, and zzso by, zzso on a zzso cell line grown as a zzso and as zzso zzso 

We used a human zzso cell line, zzso which originated from a biopsy zzso of a patient with a zzso zzso zzso of zzso were prepared by seeding a single cell suspension on zzso zzso zzso zzso and growth delay zzso were used to determine zzso of zzso zzso The growth delay zzso was used to determine that of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cultures were found to be more resistant to zzso zzso without zzso than zzso zzso Whereas zzso significantly enhances the radiation effect of zzso growing zzso zzso cultures at minimal zzso zzso (10 zzso 24 zzso no enhancement was seen in zzso zzso cultures and in large zzso at the same zzso In small zzso no enhancement was observed at a zzso zzso (10 zzso for 24 zzso but an enhancement was observed at higher zzso zzso zzso for 24 zzso 

zzso can lead to enhancement of the effects of zzso in both zzso as zzso zzso zzso The lack of enhancement in zzso zzso cultures supports the view that cell cycle distribution of cells is important in zzso by zzso
