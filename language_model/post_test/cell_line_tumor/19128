Three kinds of zzso zzso zzso I, zzso II, and zzso were isolated from an zzso hydrolysate and their effects on zzso evaluated based on mushroom zzso zzso and zzso the zzso contents in zzso Although none of the compounds had an effect on zzso activity, zzso II and zzso both effectively inhibited the zzso contents with an zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Whereas zzso II was obtained from a reaction with zzso and zzso the zzso was not completely converted into zzso zzso Thus, for the zzso production of zzso II, the reaction was zzso using the response surface methodology, where an zzso concentration of zzso zzso pH 7, zzso degrees zzso and 8 h reaction time were selected as the central conditions for the central composite design zzso for the zzso zzso of zzso into zzso II using zzso zzso models were developed to describe the relationships between the operating factors and the response zzso II zzso A statistical analysis indicated that all four factors had a significant effect ( zzso on the zzso II zzso The zzso of determination zzso was good for the model zzso and the optimum production conditions for zzso II was an zzso concentration of zzso zzso pH 5, 50 degrees C, and 12 h reaction zzso A good agreement between the predicted and experimental data under the designed optimal conditions confirmed the usefulness of the zzso A laboratory pilot scale was also zzso
