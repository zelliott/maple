zzso cell lung cancer zzso is the leading cause of zzso death worldwide, and only zzso of lung cancer patients live more than 5 zzso zzso zzso are zzso expressed zzso zzso and zzso of zzso is a common feature in human zzso including lung zzso In this study, we describe the zzso regulation of zzso and its zzso value in zzso Due to zzso of the zzso zzso region, the expression levels of zzso were decreased in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression was associated with zzso zzso zzso advanced clinical stage and shortened zzso survival and overall survival in zzso and was an independent zzso factor for overall survival in zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso significantly suppressed the migratory and invasive abilities of zzso and zzso lung cancer zzso zzso expression of zzso in lung cancer cell lines resulted in a significant reduction in the expression of zzso This, in turn, led to a decrease in DNA zzso of the zzso gene zzso and induced an increase in the protein levels of zzso By understanding the function and molecular mechanism of zzso in zzso zzso may have therapeutic potential to suppress lung cancer zzso
