Four novel zzso complexes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso is zzso zzso is zzso and zzso is zzso were successfully zzso and zzso The complexes were produced in high zzso purity and yield (more than zzso without the need for further zzso Their zzso values and serum zzso were measured and in zzso behavior was observed in cultured zzso zzso The zzso values zzso standard zzso obtained were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Complex 3 demonstrated the highest serum stability, with approximately zzso of the complex still intact after zzso zzso Complex 2 showed a rapid zzso with zzso cells, with more than zzso association at 2 zzso This association was significantly higher zzso zzso zzso than for the other three compounds after a zzso incubation zzso zzso 3, zzso 4, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was undertaken with 1 in mice bearing zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso was high at 1 h zzso zzso zzso zzso and decreased slowly over 24 h (4 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 24 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso images show that the zzso tumors can be zzso at all time zzso In this zzso study, we have successfully zzso and characterized a novel series of versatile zzso zzso complexes containing zzso zzso We also report the use of 1 as a building block for new zzso perhaps the first time such a method has been used in the production of copper zzso
