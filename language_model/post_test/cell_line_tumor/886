zzso protein 61 zzso is a growth zzso zzso gene that has multifaceted activities in various zzso In a previous study, we found that zzso inhibited the growth of the zzso and zzso zzso lung cancer zzso cell zzso In further studies, we now report that zzso plays a pivotal role in zzso cellular growth zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso resulted in the zzso of expression of zzso and zzso as well as partially reversing the growth suppression of zzso zzso zzso of zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso having a zzso zzso were not suppressed by zzso zzso of zzso zzso by either human zzso virus type 16 E6 or a zzso zzso resulted in the rescue of the growth suppression zzso by zzso in the zzso zzso The enhanced levels of zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso cells, were also inhibited by blocking zzso showing that zzso and zzso were induced by zzso in these zzso In addition, levels of both zzso and zzso increased in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso was zzso into the nucleus in these zzso zzso of zzso expression in the zzso cells with zzso zzso resulted in their decreased levels of zzso zzso cells with a zzso zzso factor zzso the specific inhibitor of the zzso complex, zzso the expression of zzso Taken together, the data suggest that zzso suppressed the growth of zzso cells by triggering a signal zzso zzso through zzso In this pathway, zzso activated the zzso complex, which promoted the expression of zzso and the latter induced expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulting in growth zzso
