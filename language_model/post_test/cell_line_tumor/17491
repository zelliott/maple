zzso was first identified as an zzso zzso zzso protein able to inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso zzso family implicated in zzso reorganization and cell zzso gene transcription, zzso and cell zzso We investigated the zzso basis for zzso of zzso signaling by zzso We compared the zzso activity of zzso with two other well characterized members of the zzso family, zzso and zzso Like zzso zzso possesses a zzso zzso zzso activity that, unlike zzso is not modulated by the binding of active zzso or zzso zzso In order to test the involvement of zzso zzso activity in suppression of zzso transcription, we generated zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso We show that zzso zzso activity is required for effective zzso repression of zzso zzso zzso does not depend upon zzso binding to zzso and is not zzso by the closely related zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso extended to the enhanced zzso zzso seen in the presence of zzso molecules and to the action of zzso zzso Active zzso inhibited nuclear zzso of the zzso zzso suggesting a possible mechanism for zzso of zzso zzso Finally, we observe that zzso active zzso protein is differently expressed among prostate cancer cell zzso zzso of zzso activity may be responsible for regulation of zzso signaling in various forms of prostate zzso
