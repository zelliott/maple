Clear cell zzso cell zzso zzso is the most common zzso zzso of the zzso The majority of zzso and sporadic zzso cases are associated with zzso and zzso zzso in the Von zzso gene zzso zzso Gross deletions at the zzso locus can result either in zzso or in a mild clinical zzso with the absence of zzso zzso Our goal in this study was to identify the molecular basis responsible for these differences in the clinical behavior in order to predict patients' zzso Using multiplex zzso amplification zzso we identified and characterized gross zzso deletions in Spanish zzso zzso A candidate gene related to this clinical association, zzso was identified and depleted by zzso zzso It was possible to narrow the zzso region related to the mild clinical zzso down to approximately 14 zzso that included zzso zzso a regulator of zzso dynamics and zzso zzso Whereas 9 out of 10 families with zzso retained zzso in the zzso loss of the zzso locus was associated with mild clinical presentation of the disease in 6 out of 8 zzso In fact, genetic depletion of zzso resulted in zzso abnormalities and zzso arrest in several tumor cell lines including zzso cells, suggesting that tumor cell proliferation was compromised in the absence of zzso These clinical and functional data indicate a relevant function of zzso in tumor cell zzso and suggest future therapeutic strategies based upon the zzso of zzso in zzso cell zzso and possibly on other zzso
