The zzso zzso of zzso zzso significantly limits its zzso zzso One of the ways to augment the zzso of zzso at a relatively low cumulative dose is to use a chemical zzso Here, we demonstrated that zzso B zzso zzso significantly enhanced zzso zzso of zzso a human zzso zzso cell line, and of zzso a human breast cancer cell zzso This enhancement was irrelevant to the action of zzso B on zzso or other zzso but associated with the zzso of zzso rather than zzso The loss of zzso membrane potential was observed when cells were treated with zzso and zzso B zzso On the other hand, at the same experimental conditions, zzso B did not enhance the zzso zzso of primary rat zzso and primary human zzso zzso it is speculative that zzso B may bring benefit to clinical chemotherapy by reducing significantly the cumulative doses of zzso and its associated zzso
