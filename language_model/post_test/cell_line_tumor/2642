zzso high doses of zzso inhibit the growth of various human cancer cell zzso However, the mechanisms by which such high-dose zzso zzso cell proliferation and zzso cell death are not fully zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in high-dose zzso zzso of zzso cells in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso led to zzso oxygen species zzso generation via the zzso zzso transition zzso because the zzso inhibitor zzso A significantly inhibited zzso zzso zzso in turn exerted feedback regulation on zzso zzso as shown by the observations that zzso A and the zzso zzso significantly inhibited the zzso of zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso induced zzso c release and zzso zzso through enhancement of expression of the zzso protein zzso and reduction of expression of the zzso protein zzso All of these effects of zzso could be suppressed by the zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso The key role of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso was further confirmed by the observation that decreased levels of zzso in cells zzso with specific small interfering zzso resulted in resistance to the zzso effect of zzso Thus, the present study clearly shows that zzso zzso in zzso cells involves zzso zzso of the zzso death pathway, and that zzso signaling exerts positive feedback regulation of zzso zzso
