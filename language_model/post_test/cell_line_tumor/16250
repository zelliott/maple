We present the development of a three-dimensional zzso zzso cell culture array device featured with integrated zzso zzso zzso mixer and cell culture zzso The device is designed for zzso screening of multiple compounds simultaneously on a zzso zzso The final assembled device is composed of a porous membrane integrated in between a zzso 3-D zzso chip and a zzso zzso zzso The membrane turned the cell culture chambers into zzso zzso to facilitate cell loading and to maintain cells in a diffusion dominated space during device zzso zzso we first characterized the combined compound concentration profile at each chamber using a zzso zzso We then successfully demonstrated the functionality of the quantitative zzso zzso by zzso zzso rat zzso cells on this device and screening the ability of three compounds zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso cell death caused by zzso hydrogen zzso In another experiment, we zzso for the zzso effects of three zzso compound zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on human breast cancer cells, zzso The same technology will enable the construction of inexpensive zzso devices with zzso zzso mixer for performing zzso zzso zzso and highly parallel and zzso chemical or zzso zzso
