A potential therapeutic strategy for targeting cancer that has gained much interest is the zzso of the zzso binding and zzso activity of the molecular zzso zzso We have determined the structure of the human zzso zzso domain in complex with a series of zzso The structures provide the molecular details for the activity of these zzso One of these zzso zzso 34, causes a structural change that affects a mobile loop, which adopts a zzso similar to that seen in complexes with zzso rather than the zzso generally seen with the zzso class of zzso Competitive binding to the zzso zzso domain was observed in a zzso zzso and these compounds showed zzso activity and induced zzso in the zzso human colon cancer cell zzso These zzso also caused induction of the heat shock response with the zzso of zzso and zzso protein expression and the depletion of zzso clients, zzso zzso and zzso thus confirming that zzso activity was through the zzso of zzso The presence of increased levels of the zzso product of zzso indicated zzso in response to zzso zzso This work provides a framework for the further zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso we demonstrate that the zzso zzso display a more limited core set of interactions relative to the clinical trial candidate zzso and consequently may be less susceptible to resistance derived through zzso in zzso
