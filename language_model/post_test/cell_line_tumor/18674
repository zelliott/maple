Human zzso type 16 zzso zzso plays an zzso role in human zzso zzso zzso is closely associated with various biological processes including zzso This study investigated how zzso 16 zzso E6 and zzso affect zzso in human zzso cancer zzso We established two human zzso cancer cell lines that expressed zzso 16 E6 and zzso zzso Using these two cell lines, we found that both E6 and zzso exhibited an zzso effect on zzso induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha and zzso In both zzso cell lines, the expression of zzso zzso was reduced and that of zzso zzso was zzso However, the expression of zzso and zzso was not significantly different between the zzso and zzso cells and the control cells without zzso zzso zzso zzso was not detected in either the zzso or the zzso zzso Our study indicates that: zzso zzso 16 E6 and zzso zzso are capable of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the mechanism modulated by E6 and zzso involves the zzso of zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso is not related to the level of zzso zzso or zzso These results suggest that the zzso of zzso molecules zzso and zzso by zzso 16 E6 and zzso plays a role in the zzso of cell survival, which may subsequently contribute to the development of human zzso zzso
