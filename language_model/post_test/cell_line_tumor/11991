The zzso group D zzso zzso zzso is located at zzso where loss of zzso zzso is frequently observed in many kinds of zzso including breast zzso zzso of zzso in breast and prostate cancer has been reported using serial analysis of gene expression zzso and DNA zzso zzso We previously reported that zzso zzso the expression of zzso In the present study, we investigated the roles of zzso in zzso First, we investigated the expression of zzso in 11 cancer cell zzso No zzso transcript was observed in 4 tumor cell lines, and no zzso protein was detected in 8 tumor cell zzso We zzso zzso expression zzso into zzso and zzso that lacked zzso zzso and protein expression of zzso zzso efficiency in soft zzso was significantly suppressed in all of the zzso zzso These results suggest that suppressed zzso expression is associated with zzso zzso
