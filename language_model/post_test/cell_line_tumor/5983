In this study, zzso zzso exhibited a potent cell growth zzso effect with zzso features in a zzso manner in various cancer cell lines zzso zzso of the expression profiles of zzso zzso zzso stress-related genes in zzso multiple myeloma cells after treatment with zzso and the zzso stress zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicated that although zzso and zzso zzso induced zzso zzso factor zzso zzso within 8 h of treatment, zzso induced almost no zzso within 48 h of treatment in zzso zzso However, zzso embryonic zzso zzso cells and other cancer cell lines zzso zzso lung cancer cells and zzso acute leukemia zzso exhibited zzso of zzso after treatment with zzso The potency of zzso induction in response to zzso appeared to be partially correlated with the zzso sensitivity of zzso among various cell lines zzso zzso cells derived from zzso knockout mice were more resistant to zzso than zzso zzso zzso Since zzso has been shown to induce zzso of zzso a zzso factor functioning as a zzso of zzso we further treated zzso cells with a combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso This enhanced zzso along with zzso of zzso in zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso zzso induction by zzso is involved in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression appears to be a potent therapeutic target for cancer zzso
