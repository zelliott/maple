The pathways underlying zzso breast cancer are poorly zzso and as yet, there is no approved targeted therapy for this zzso We investigated the role of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as targeted therapies for zzso breast zzso 

We used zzso analysis of a large panel of breast cancer cell lines with detailed accompanying molecular information to identify molecular zzso of response to a potent and selective inhibitor of zzso and also to define molecular mechanisms underlying combined zzso and zzso targeting in zzso breast zzso zzso were confirmed by testing in multiple tumor zzso zzso 

We found that zzso breast cancer models have an activated zzso zzso program and show greater sensitivity to a selective inhibitor of zzso compared with models representative of other breast cancer zzso We also showed that loss of zzso is a negative predictor of response to zzso zzso that treatment with a selective zzso inhibitor caused zzso of zzso zzso zzso and that dual blockade of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso to zzso impair the growth of zzso breast cancer models in zzso and in zzso 

Our studies suggest that zzso zzso zzso is a promising therapeutic zzso for zzso breast zzso with intact zzso and also provide a basis for rational combination of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso with both intact and deleted zzso
