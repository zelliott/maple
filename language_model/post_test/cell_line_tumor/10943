To study the effects and possible mechanism of Vitamin zzso zzso in the treatment of zzso cells, the changes of zzso features of zzso cells were investigated by zzso the zzso of zzso cells was observed by transmission electron zzso cellular proliferation was determined by the zzso zzso cell zzso cell cycle shift and expression of zzso differentiation zzso zzso zzso were analyzed by flow zzso zzso The expression of zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso were detected by zzso zzso chain reaction zzso the activity of zzso was determined by zzso zzso The results showed that the typical zzso zzso features appeared in cells treated with zzso for 72 hours; zzso induced zzso of zzso cells and in a zzso manner, zzso cell arrest and significantly zzso the expression of zzso and zzso but had no effect on the expression of zzso the activity of zzso significantly zzso It is concluded that zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells through zzso zzso pathways and the zzso genes zzso zzso may play an important role in this zzso
