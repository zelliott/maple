zzso is a zzso disease with a poor outcome that accounts for zzso of primary liver zzso We characterized its zzso and genetic features and associated these with patient responses to zzso 

We zzso the zzso from 104 surgically zzso zzso samples collected from patients in Australia, Europe, and the United States; zzso and zzso compartments from 23 tumors were laser capture zzso We analyzed zzso in zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso in samples from 69 zzso Changes in gene expression were validated by zzso and zzso zzso zzso combined data from the patients with data from 7 human zzso cell lines, which were then exposed to zzso and zzso 

Patients were classified into 2 zzso based on zzso survival rate zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso time to recurrence zzso vs zzso zzso P zzso zzso and the absence or presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso Class comparison identified 4 survival zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso was characterized by genes associated with zzso activity and the worst zzso The tumor zzso was defined by deregulation of the zzso network and frequent zzso of zzso the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso was enriched in inflammatory zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso and zzso was more effective in zzso growth of zzso cell lines than zzso 

We provide insight into the zzso of zzso and identify previously zzso zzso of patients, based on zzso zzso and increased levels of zzso and zzso zzso who might benefit from zzso zzso zzso zzso The group of patients with the worst prognosis was characterized by zzso enrichment of genes that regulate zzso activity, indicating new therapeutic zzso
