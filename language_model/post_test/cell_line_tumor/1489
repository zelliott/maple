To observe the in zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso in mice and to study the related zzso 

zzso mice were zzso with mouse zzso zzso cells zzso then divided into 5 groups zzso per group), and treated with zzso zzso 100, or 150 zzso or zzso (4 zzso for 10 zzso zzso rate of zzso body weight gain, and influence zzso on internal zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The zzso expressed genes between the zzso group, and the control group were analyzed using zzso zzso and quantitative real-time zzso zzso zzso 

Compared with the tumor weight of the control group zzso zzso zzso significantly suppressed zzso zzso growth in mice zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso g for the tumor weight in the low, moderate, and high dose treatment group, zzso The moderate dose led to the highest zzso rate, zzso Observation of body weight gain and influence on three zzso showed that compared with zzso zzso produced fewer side effects in zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed that the most significant zzso expressed genes in the tumor samples of zzso mice were mostly involved in regulating zzso with the zzso zzso gene being the most significantly zzso 

zzso was a promising compound for developing drugs against zzso zzso and its zzso effect was probably related to zzso zzso
