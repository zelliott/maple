zzso insulin degradation decreases in type 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a key role in insulin degradation and its gene is located in a zzso zzso zzso We zzso that zzso may be regulated by insulin and/or zzso in a liver cell zzso To validate the observed regulation of zzso in zzso we zzso zzso of human zzso tissue during different clamp experiments in zzso 

Human zzso zzso cells were incubated in normal (1 zzso or high zzso zzso zzso medium and treated with insulin for 24 zzso zzso activity, zzso and protein levels of zzso were zzso zzso zzso levels were measured in zzso of human subcutaneous zzso tissue before and at 240 zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

In zzso cells, insulin increased zzso activity under normal zzso conditions with no change in zzso zzso or protein zzso Under conditions of high zzso insulin increased zzso levels of zzso without changes in zzso zzso Both in normal and high zzso zzso insulin increased levels of the zzso more active zzso zzso zzso compared with the zzso zzso In subcutaneous zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were not significantly zzso after zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso increases zzso activity in zzso cells in normal but not in high zzso zzso This zzso cannot be explained by corresponding zzso in zzso protein levels or zzso zzso The loss of zzso regulation of zzso activity under zzso may contribute to the reduced insulin extraction and peripheral zzso in type 2 zzso
