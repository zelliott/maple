zzso 26 zzso encodes a gap junction protein and is a putative tumor zzso zzso We evaluated the effect of forced expression of zzso on three human prostate cancer cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso The three cell lines were infected with a zzso zzso zzso zzso or a control zzso or were mock zzso We tested cell growth, cell cycle, zzso and the efficacy of combined treatment with zzso zzso infection suppressed the growth of all the cell lines compared with controls and induced cell cycle arrest at the zzso phase and zzso zzso decreased the expression of zzso zzso cell growth was dramatically suppressed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso had greater growth suppression with combined gene therapy and chemotherapy than with either zzso or zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso suppresses the growth of prostate cancer cells and decreases the expression of zzso Combining zzso gene therapy with zzso results in greater growth zzso
