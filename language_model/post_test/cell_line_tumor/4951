Human zzso leukemia virus type I zzso is the zzso agent of adult zzso zzso The viral transforming protein Tax regulates the zzso of viral and cellular genes by interacting with cellular zzso factors and zzso The effects of Tax on cellular gene expression have an important impact on zzso cellular zzso zzso of the zzso cellular zzso is regulated by serum response factor zzso and Tax is known to induce zzso gene expression by zzso zzso zzso zzso activates cellular gene expression by binding to a consensus DNA sequence zzso zzso located within a serum response element zzso Since zzso activates zzso of many growth regulatory zzso this zzso is likely to have a significant impact on zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that Tax interacts with zzso and enhances the binding of zzso to zzso located in the zzso zzso and viral zzso Also, we establish that in the presence of Tax, zzso selects more divergent zzso box sequences than in the absence of Tax, revealing a novel mechanism for regulating zzso gene zzso Finally, increased association of zzso with zzso and specific promoters was observed in zzso cells, zzso with increased zzso and zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso These results suggest that Tax activates zzso zzso by enhancing its binding affinity to multiple different zzso zzso
