zzso evidence suggests that enteric zzso cells zzso are critical for enteric zzso survival and zzso In particular, zzso exert direct zzso effects zzso in part by the release of zzso However, other zzso factors such as those identified as regulating the zzso zzso barrier and in particular the zzso fatty acid zzso zzso zzso zzso could also be involved in zzso zzso zzso our study aimed to assess the putative role of zzso zzso in their zzso zzso We first showed that zzso of primary cultures of enteric nervous zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso dose zzso prevented hydrogen zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso effects of zzso were significantly inhibited following genetic zzso in zzso of the key zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso We next showed that zzso effects were zzso by an zzso dependent zzso but were not blocked by zzso inhibitor zzso in zzso cells and enteric zzso Finally, zzso induced a significant increase in zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso in zzso cells and enteric zzso In conclusion, we identified zzso as a novel zzso zzso with zzso effects in the zzso This study further supports the concept that zzso derivatives such as zzso might be used in preventive and/or therapeutic strategies for the treatment of enteric zzso
