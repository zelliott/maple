Korean red zzso has been used as traditional medicine in East zzso Recent scientific research revealed multiple effects of Korean red zzso including zzso zzso To evaluate the effect of Korean red zzso extract zzso in acute zzso leukemia zzso and zzso its molecular zzso 

zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso for 48 h and examined for cell proliferation and zzso Cell cycle distribution of zzso cells was analyzed and the expression level of zzso phase regulators was zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso and its effect on zzso and zzso gene zzso cell zzso cell cycle and differentiation was evaluated in zzso zzso 

zzso alone was sufficient to induce zzso differentiation accompanied with growth zzso zzso treatment resulted in cell cycle arrest at the zzso phase with zzso zzso proteins without changes in transcript zzso zzso treatment revealed reduced degradation of zzso protein by zzso In addition, zzso treatment reduced expression of zzso and zzso zzso both at zzso and protein zzso Upon zzso expression of zzso the effect of zzso was reversed with lesser reduction and induction of zzso gene and zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest a sequential molecular mechanism from zzso reduction, zzso reduction, zzso protein stabilization, zzso phase arrest to zzso differentiation by zzso in human zzso 

zzso zzso zzso proliferation to differentiation transition in zzso through zzso of the zzso zzso
