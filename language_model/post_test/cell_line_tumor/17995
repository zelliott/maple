A major goal in drug delivery is to be able to design a zzso entity that zzso an zzso zzso to deliver a zzso payload into a malfunctioning zzso However, the effectiveness of this approach may be constrained by insufficient information regarding the fate of the delivery zzso within the confines of the zzso zzso zzso drug delivery through this mechanism is therefore dependent on an equal high level of understanding of the specific zzso pathways that are inherent in the target cell and the traffic and fate of the zzso within zzso zzso Cell penetrating peptides zzso are promising candidate zzso for delivering zzso however, there is little consensus regarding their exact mechanism of zzso This review highlights the numerous zzso pathways and sorting mechanisms that may deliver zzso to a number of cellular zzso Our use of zzso zzso cell lines to study the cellular dynamics of zzso zzso and zzso is also zzso
