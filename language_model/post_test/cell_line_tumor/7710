The purpose of this study is to identify target proteins that may play important functional roles in oral cancer zzso cells zzso using mass zzso quantitative zzso 

zzso zzso were performed on highly invasive zzso and lowly invasive zzso oral cancer cell lines, which were derived from the same tongue zzso cell zzso to enrich zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso zzso cells was carried out using tandem mass tagging and two-dimensional liquid zzso with zzso mass zzso 

zzso cancer cells were found to be present in the highly invasive zzso cell line but absent in the lowly invasive zzso cell zzso Stem cell markers zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso whereas zzso alpha and zzso were zzso in zzso zzso cells versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that many proteins in cell cycle, zzso G protein signal zzso zzso zzso development, and zzso zzso pathways were zzso expressed between the two cell zzso Both zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso were found to be significantly zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cells can be enriched from the highly invasive zzso oral cancer cell line but not from the lowly invasive zzso oral cancer cell zzso There are significant zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso In particular, zzso and zzso zzso were significantly zzso in zzso zzso cells versus zzso zzso cells, suggesting that the zzso zzso is activated in the zzso zzso
