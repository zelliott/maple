zzso zzso has been found to play an important role in tumor zzso in recent zzso Our previous studies have shown that zzso is zzso in zzso human zzso zzso cells zzso isolated from tissue samples of patients with zzso zzso In the present study, we aimed to further determine the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

We knock down zzso expression in zzso and human zzso cancer zzso zzso cells using the small interference zzso method, and then evaluate the effects of zzso on zzso zzso zzso by in zzso mouse studies and in zzso zzso 

Our results revealed that zzso activity of zzso and zzso cells in zzso was not affected by zzso with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression in zzso reduced the cell migration, with the percentage of repaired area of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated zzso and zzso decreased zzso compared with controls, respectively ( zzso The number of zzso points per well was obviously lower in zzso than that in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso formed smaller tumor in mice and led to a lower zzso density, zzso zzso in transplanted tumors of mice than scrambled zzso controls zzso zzso zzso vessels per zzso zzso 

These data confirm the positive role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso and might be of great benefit for finding rational approach in zzso cancer zzso
