Our previous studies have demonstrated the preference of zzso for zzso rather than the zzso zzso structures, while zzso has selectivity for zzso over zzso zzso zzso However, it was not clear whether the difference in the selectivity between two different zzso agents could determine the corresponding biological effects in cultured human tumor zzso Here we evaluated the biological effects of both zzso and zzso in the human pancreatic zzso cell line zzso using zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of these agents against zzso cells is quite different, and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso is about 100 times less than that of zzso zzso zzso At zzso zzso zzso induced zzso bridge formation in zzso cells, while zzso failed to induce zzso bridge zzso At zzso zzso zzso induced zzso cell growth arrest, zzso zzso and zzso length zzso within 5 weeks, while similar biological effects were evident after 12 weeks following treatment with zzso Our data suggest that binding of zzso agents to distinct zzso could induce different biological effects in human cancer zzso
