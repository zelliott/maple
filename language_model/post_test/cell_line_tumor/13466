Six zzso glass zzso (in the system zzso were produced with fixed zzso and calcium content at 24 and 16 zzso zzso zzso and zzso were varied between zzso and zzso zzso respectively, with the balance being zzso zzso analyses confirmed the final composition of the glasses investigated to within a 1-2 % error zzso zzso analyses showed a linear increase in zzso with increasing zzso and zzso zzso with zzso showing a greater effect than zzso This was proposed to be due to the formation of zzso bonds and an increase in the zzso density of the glass network enhancing the durability of the zzso The glasses that were investigated revealed a decrease in degradation rate with increasing zzso and zzso contents and again the effect of zzso was zzso All the above characteristics correlated well with structural changes measured by zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies showed good cellular zzso response to the glasses up to zzso h in terms of cell zzso proliferation and zzso zzso analysis revealed that all the zzso with the exception of zzso gave a comparable response to the control zzso which suggested that after a threshold level of glass durability is achieved the degradation rate has no or minimal effect on zzso However, it was seen that the glass chemistry can also affect cellular response, since increasing the zzso content promoted zzso expression that was not related to degradation rate but to the degradation zzso This was supported using an zzso zzso
