It is becoming increasingly apparent that the majority of zzso display defects in the zzso class I zzso processing pathway, particularly low levels of the zzso with zzso processing zzso and zzso Thus, zzso approaches targeting such zzso with zzso zzso T zzso zzso requires strategies to overcome these zzso Previously we had identified an zzso processing zzso by which zzso derived zzso peptides could be presented in the absence of zzso Here we show in the zzso cell line zzso that a number of these zzso zzso peptides can also be presented in a zzso zzso Yet when these experiments were extended to zzso cell lines derived from small cell lung cancer zzso which we show to be zzso deficient in addition to zzso the zzso zzso peptides were not zzso This lack of presentation could be zzso by zzso of zzso cells with zzso zzso by directing the zzso zzso peptides into the zzso zzso zzso via an zzso signal zzso these peptides were presented efficiently by zzso zzso We zzso from this data that the zzso zzso for presentation of zzso peptides generates a low concentration of zzso in the zzso and, for zzso cells which also lack zzso this concentration of zzso zzso is insufficient to load onto zzso class I zzso Thus, for zzso approaches to target zzso and other zzso with defects in the zzso class I zzso processing zzso it will be important to consider strategies that address zzso
