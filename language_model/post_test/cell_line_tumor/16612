zzso zzso zzso is a type of cancer with a very poor zzso Although zzso zzso is the most effective marker available to detect zzso the sensitivity and specificity are not zzso zzso there is a need for the development of more sensitive and specific methods that can supplement zzso in the early detection of this zzso In this study, zzso responses to zzso protein 78 zzso were evaluated by zzso zzso zzso zzso western zzso and indirect zzso zzso in zzso from patients with zzso liver zzso and chronic zzso zzso as well as from normal human zzso zzso zzso with tissue array slides was also zzso to analyze protein expression profiles of zzso in zzso and control zzso The prevalence of zzso against zzso was zzso zzso in zzso which was significantly higher than that in zzso zzso and normal human zzso zzso zzso The average zzso of zzso against zzso in zzso zzso was higher compared to that in zzso zzso and zzso zzso When both zzso against zzso and zzso were used simultaneously as diagnostic zzso sensitivity reached zzso Our data indicate that zzso zzso may be potential diagnostic markers for zzso especially in conjunction with zzso
