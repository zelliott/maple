To zzso the gene expression level of prostate stem cell zzso zzso in human clear cell zzso cell zzso zzso and its relationship with conventional zzso manifestations, to evaluate its zzso value for patient outcome, and to determine the effect of zzso on the progression of zzso 

We zzso zzso zzso level in human zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and in 154 surgical tissue samples zzso from zzso 73 from normal zzso using real-time reverse zzso chain reaction zzso The findings were zzso in relation to zzso zzso zzso expression was examined using zzso laser scanning zzso 

zzso was zzso in all zzso cell zzso zzso zzso levels were significantly higher in zzso than in normal kidney tissue samples zzso zzso zzso in zzso than in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in advanced disease zzso than in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There was significantly higher zzso zzso expression in patients with zzso than in those with zzso disease zzso zzso zzso Patients in whom the zzso had high zzso expression levels had a significantly worse prognosis than those with low zzso expression levels zzso zzso zzso Using zzso analysis there was markedly greater zzso expression in zzso than in normal zzso and in zzso high-grade zzso than in zzso zzso zzso 

A significant correlation was detected in the gene expression level of zzso with zzso grade, zzso stage and prognosis in zzso Our data indicate that zzso is associated with zzso and progression of zzso
