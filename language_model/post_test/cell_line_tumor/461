zzso resistance, aggressiveness and accelerated zzso metabolism are hallmarks of zzso and have motivated the development of new PET zzso like zzso an analogue of zzso Our aim was to study the relationship of zzso resistance of cultured zzso cell lines and zzso zzso zzso 

We used an in zzso zzso zzso zzso model composed of sensitive parental zzso and derived resistant cells zzso and zzso zzso zzso metabolism and transport were zzso particularly the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transport studies were assessed in our zzso zzso 

As expected, the resistant cell lines express zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso 1 zzso and elevated zzso zzso content and are also more mobile and more invasive than the sensitive zzso zzso Our results show an zzso of zzso and zzso in the resistant cell lines compared to the sensitive cell zzso We found an increased zzso of zzso (in % of zzso per 200,000 zzso in the resistant cells compared to the sensitive ones zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in line with accelerated zzso metabolism and aggressive zzso 

zzso zzso is not influenced by the two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso would be an interesting probe for zzso imaging which would not be zzso from the resistant cells by the classic zzso ABC zzso Our results clearly show that zzso zzso reflects accelerated zzso metabolism and is related to zzso aggressiveness and drug zzso
