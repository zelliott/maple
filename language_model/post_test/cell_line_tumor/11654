zzso virus zzso is a zzso human zzso that causes zzso upon primary infection, establishes zzso in multiple zzso zzso and can reactivate to cause zzso Live attenuated zzso vaccines are zzso however, they can also establish zzso infections and zzso Studies of zzso zzso have been limited to the analyses of human zzso removed at autopsy, as the virus is strictly a human zzso Recently, terminally differentiated human zzso have received much attention as a means to study the interaction between zzso and human zzso however, the short zzso of these cells in culture has limited their zzso zzso we describe the construction of a model of normal human neural zzso cells zzso in zzso zzso zzso which can be successfully maintained for at least 180 days in three-dimensional zzso culture, and exhibit an expression profile similar to that of human zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso resulted in a persistent infection that was maintained for three months, during which the virus zzso remained zzso zzso early and late zzso genes were zzso and zzso of infectious zzso were zzso detected in the culture zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso are an effective system to investigate long-term interactions of zzso with complex zzso of human zzso zzso
