To investigate the effects of zzso zzso Formula zzso a compound Chinese herbal medicine, on vascular zzso growth factor zzso expression induced by zzso zzso zzso in human gastric cancer cells, and to explore the possible zzso 

Human gastric zzso cancer cells were infected with standard zzso zzso by zzso and the cells were divided into 7 groups: normal control group, zzso group, zzso inhibitor group, blank serum group, and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The expressions of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in human gastric cancer cells infected by zzso were evaluated by real-time zzso quantitative zzso chain reaction zzso After zzso the expression of zzso with zzso specific inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression induced by zzso in human gastric cancer zzso cells was evaluated by real-time zzso quantitative zzso 

zzso zzso quantitative zzso results showed that zzso zzso expression increased significantly after zzso cells were infected with zzso for 6 h ( zzso and zzso zzso expression also increased significantly after zzso cells were infected with zzso for 12 h as compared with the normal control group ( zzso After zzso zzso expression with zzso specific inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso expression significantly reduced ( zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso all zzso zzso and zzso zzso expressions induced by zzso in a zzso manner as compared with the zzso infection zzso 

zzso could induce the expressions of zzso and zzso in human gastric cancer cells, and zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso by zzso zzso which might be one of the important mechanisms of its prevention and treatment of gastric zzso
