Recent reports suggest that targeting the unique zzso highly expressed in several zzso may be a promising approach in the development of new cancer therapeutic zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the roles of zzso as therapeutic targets in human zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We evaluated the differential expressions of zzso in zzso and normal zzso zzso using zzso and cluster zzso After validation of zzso expressed zzso in another set of zzso and normal zzso zzso we performed the in zzso experiment using zzso cancer cells with zzso zzso to evaluate the roles of zzso that are highly expressed in zzso for cell proliferation and zzso 

A zzso zzso showed that the zzso family, including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso in zzso as compared with that in normal zzso zzso When we treated zzso cancer cells with specific zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso we found that zzso zzso zzso and zzso significantly inhibited the growth of zzso cells and zzso zzso and zzso significantly inhibited the growth of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso with zzso enhanced the zzso effect of zzso in zzso zzso 

These results indicate that the zzso family is highly expressed in zzso compared with that of normal zzso zzso and could play an important role in cancer zzso Specifically, zzso could enhance the zzso activity with zzso in zzso zzso the zzso family may offer new candidate targets to be exploited in therapeutic strategies for patients with these zzso
