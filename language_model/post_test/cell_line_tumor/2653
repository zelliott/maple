zzso are the most aggressive forms of primary brain tumors with their tendency to invade surrounding healthy brain zzso rendering them largely zzso In this report, we used zzso zzso technology to knock down the expression of protein zzso C zzso zzso which resulted in specific and massive impairment of zzso cell migration and zzso We also explained the fundamental molecular processes of zzso migration and invasion in which zzso is a zzso The silence of zzso expression likewise impaired the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso protein domain zzso zzso and zzso which is a critical step in zzso recycling and zzso zzso zzso with the defects in cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso was also zzso zzso zzso regulated both zzso zzso and cell zzso which contributed to cell zzso Additionally, there was zzso of zzso zzso expression in zzso cells, which coincided with decreased invasion both in zzso and in zzso These results indicate that zzso is involved in the control of zzso cell migration and invasion by regulating the zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso these findings suggest that zzso is a potential therapeutic target for zzso zzso
