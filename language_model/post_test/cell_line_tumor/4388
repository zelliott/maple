zzso are generally stored at low temperature which slows their cellular zzso However, the stress induced by cold shock can lead to cell injury or zzso Here, we found that exposing human leukemia zzso cells to cold shock followed by zzso zzso increased the number of dead cells with remodeled zzso structures in which DNA fibers fully unfold and zzso into zzso space, similar to zzso zzso traps zzso The unfolded DNA was associated with zzso marker zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso and could trap significant numbers of zzso zzso We also found that zzso oxygen zzso requisite for zzso zzso during zzso in zzso zzso This treatment of zzso cells to trigger global DNA structural zzso has not been reported before, and helps to zzso the mechanisms of human cellular response to cold zzso
