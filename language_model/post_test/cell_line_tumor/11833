The zzso zzso zzso zzso is emerging as an attractive cancer therapeutic target due to its central position in the zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso in response to other zzso therapies has been implicated in resistance to zzso Here, we report the development and characterization of zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso designed to block zzso zzso zzso zzso and mediate enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso of the zzso zzso zzso studies and X-ray zzso revealed that zzso bound zzso and selectively to domain 1 of human zzso zzso binding was prevented by zzso at zzso more than 1 zzso as was nearly complete zzso of zzso zzso and zzso thereby preventing downstream zzso zzso In zzso zzso treatment inhibited zzso tumor growth up to zzso relative to controls in a manner accompanied by zzso of cell surface zzso zzso efficacy was further enhanced in combination with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso potency of zzso was enhanced compared with the zzso parental zzso both in zzso and in zzso tumor zzso models, where an increased median survival was zzso zzso degree achieved in zzso correlated with zzso expression levels on tumor zzso In zzso the combination of strong signaling zzso and enhanced zzso capability rendered zzso a highly potent zzso agent suitable for clinical zzso
