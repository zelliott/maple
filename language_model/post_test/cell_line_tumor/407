Analysis of zzso in three genes zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in Finnish families with familial low zzso zzso zzso levels (N zzso zzso or familial combined zzso (N zzso zzso revealed suggestive linkage of zzso zzso zzso zzso with extreme end high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by this initial finding, we carried out association analysis in a zzso syndrome zzso zzso of zzso examination survey (N zzso zzso revealing association of multiple zzso zzso with high serum zzso levels zzso zzso To investigate whether zzso could be the gene underlying the observed linkage and association, we carried out functional experiments in the human zzso cell line zzso zzso of zzso increased the incorporation of zzso into cholesterol and both zzso and zzso into zzso and enhanced the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in growth zzso suggesting that the zzso protein zzso suppresses zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to associate zzso with zzso consistent with its involvement in zzso transport or zzso zzso The data introduces zzso as a gene whose variation may contribute to high zzso levels in zzso Finnish subjects and provides evidence for zzso as a regulator of cellular zzso zzso
