zzso especially zzso are emerging as zzso of zzso in a wide range of zzso cells, zzso their therapeutic application in zzso In the present study, a zzso rich zzso fraction zzso here as zzso isolated from an attenuated strain of zzso zzso zzso was tested for its zzso activity taking melanoma, the zzso form of skin cancer cells, as zzso ALL was found to induce zzso zzso zzso DNA fragmentation and zzso zzso with enhanced cell population in zzso region in both mouse and human melanoma systems, namely zzso and zzso zzso These are the hallmarks of cells undergoing zzso Further analysis demonstrated that ALL treated melanoma cells showed significant increase in zzso generation, zzso membrane potential zzso release of zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are the events closely involved in zzso These findings indicate that one or more zzso zzso present in ALL could be the zzso zzso for the induction of zzso in melanoma zzso Further studies are thus necessary to identify these specific zzso zzso and to establish their mechanism of action, in order to explore their use as zzso zzso
