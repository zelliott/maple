zzso of surface zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso receptors has emerged as a key mechanism for the control of synaptic zzso Regulatory elements for synaptic zzso receptors zzso are, however, largely zzso We have found that zzso is critical for the synaptic removal of zzso acting via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with protein complexes containing zzso zzso and zzso and zzso with zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and blocking peptides caused a zzso run-up of zzso zzso zzso recorded from zzso zzso zzso when included in the patch zzso and prevented zzso long-term depression of zzso As zzso zzso zzso interactions are zzso regulated by zzso
