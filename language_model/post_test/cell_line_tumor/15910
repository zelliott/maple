zzso resistance to zzso therapy in breast cancer is a major clinical zzso Previous reports have demonstrated that cell models of acquired zzso resistance have altered zzso zzso and a highly migratory zzso features which may impact on zzso spread in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso that regulates zzso pathways central to cell zzso migration and survival and its expression is frequently zzso in breast zzso In this study, we have used the novel zzso inhibitor zzso to address the role of zzso in the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was similar between zzso and zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso status zzso or zzso was altered in zzso zzso promoted a zzso zzso of zzso zzso at zzso but did not affect other zzso zzso sites zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells were more sensitive to these zzso effects versus zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso cells, zzso zzso of zzso zzso was associated with a reduction in zzso and zzso zzso to, and migration over, zzso zzso zzso as a single agent zzso did not affect the growth of zzso cells or their zzso zzso However, treatment of zzso cells with zzso and tamoxifen combined resulted in greater suppression of proliferation versus single agent zzso Together these data suggest the importance of zzso in the process of zzso resistance, particularly in the development of an aggressive, migratory cell zzso and demonstrate the potential to improve zzso response through combination zzso
