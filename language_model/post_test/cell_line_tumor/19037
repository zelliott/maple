Upon encountering zzso zzso can adapt to produce a highly specific and potent zzso zzso zzso zzso which introduces point zzso in the variable regions of zzso zzso can increase the affinity for zzso and zzso zzso functions can be altered by class switch zzso zzso which changes the expressed constant region zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso diversification zzso that is essential for both zzso zzso and zzso The zzso AID zzso has to be tightly zzso Here, we show that engagement of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which signals that good zzso affinity has been reached, zzso AID gene expression and that calcium zzso signaling is essential for this zzso Moreover, we show that zzso of the zzso sensor protein zzso zzso AID gene zzso and that the zzso factor zzso is required for regulation of the AID gene by the zzso zzso zzso in the binding site for zzso and thus showing zzso DNA zzso makes AID expression resistant to the zzso through zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso AID gene expression through zzso zzso of zzso
