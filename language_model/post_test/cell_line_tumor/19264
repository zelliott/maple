zzso of packed red blood cells zzso suppresses zzso but the mechanisms are incompletely zzso zzso contain zzso an zzso which converts zzso to zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso depletion suppresses proliferation of zzso T cells in other zzso We zzso that zzso zzso zzso depletion will suppress proliferation of T zzso 

A zzso model was designed adding zzso to culture zzso media with or without an irreversible zzso blocker zzso zzso for zzso hours and then removing the zzso zzso acid zzso in the media were measured using liquid zzso mass zzso T cells were then added to the zzso media, cultured for 24 hours, and proliferation was zzso 

zzso depleted zzso significantly and increased zzso in media compared to baseline zzso treated zzso and significantly decreased T cell zzso These effects were enhanced with volume of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso restored T cell proliferation in zzso treated zzso 

zzso T cell proliferation was impaired by zzso in clinically relevant zzso The mechanism influencing T cell impairment appears to result from zzso depletion by zzso zzso depletion by zzso zzso may be a novel mechanism for zzso after zzso
