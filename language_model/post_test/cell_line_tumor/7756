The absence of highly sensitive and specific serum zzso makes mass screening for zzso cancer zzso The zzso proteins are frequently zzso in zzso zzso but their potential as zzso zzso or detection markers remains zzso Here, we have explored the possible use of these proteins as screening zzso for zzso cancer zzso 

zzso protein shedding from cells was examined by zzso of zzso culture zzso The presence of zzso in zzso released from zzso cancer cells was demonstrated by zzso zzso separation and zzso electron zzso zzso zzso zzso in the plasma of zzso cancer patients were evaluated in a pilot panel of 63 zzso cancer patients and 50 healthy zzso The zzso marker was also assessed in these samples and compared with zzso zzso 

We show that full-length zzso can be shed from zzso cancer cells in culture and found in the media as part of small zzso zzso known as zzso Moreover, 32 of 63 plasma samples from zzso cancer patients exhibited the presence of zzso zzso In contrast, only one of 50 samples from individuals without cancer exhibited zzso zzso In our small panel, at a specificity of zzso the zzso and zzso tests had sensitivities of 51% and zzso zzso The two tests did not appear to be independent and were strongly zzso 

Our work shows for the first time that zzso can be released from zzso cancer cells and can be detected in the peripheral circulation of zzso cancer zzso The development of sensitive zzso for the detection of zzso in blood will be crucial in determining whether this approach can be useful, alone or in combination with other screening methods, for the detection of zzso zzso
