zzso infection with the zzso C virus zzso is a major risk factor for the development of liver zzso and zzso zzso With an estimated about zzso of the world population infected with this virus, the lack of a zzso vaccine and a selective therapy, chronic zzso C currently is a main indication for liver zzso The establishment of zzso replication and virus production systems has led to first insights into the functions of zzso zzso However, the role of zzso protein zzso zzso in the viral replication cycle is so far not zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein assumed to be involved in zzso zzso zzso Its numerous interactions with the host cell suggest that zzso is also an important zzso for zzso and zzso In this study we show that zzso is a key factor for the assembly of infectious zzso zzso We specifically identify the zzso domain III as the primary zzso in zzso for particle zzso We show that both core and zzso zzso on the surface of zzso zzso a proposed site for zzso particle zzso zzso in domain III of zzso zzso this zzso abrogate infectious particle formation and lead to an enhanced zzso of core protein on the surface of zzso zzso Finally, we show that zzso in zzso causing an assembly zzso can be rescued by zzso These data provide novel insights into the production of infectious zzso and identify zzso as a major zzso for zzso zzso Since domain III of zzso is one of the most variable regions in the zzso zzso the results suggest that viral zzso may differ in their level of zzso production and thus in their level of fitness and zzso
