The system zzso acid zzso is a major zzso transport system that is responsible for zzso transport of neutral zzso acids including several essential zzso zzso We have compared and examined the expressions and functions of the system zzso acid zzso in both rat zzso cultures and zzso zzso zzso The rat zzso cultures expressed the zzso zzso acid zzso 2 zzso with its zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso acid zzso 1 zzso was not expressed in these zzso The zzso zzso cells expressed zzso but not zzso with zzso The zzso zzso by the rat zzso cultures and zzso zzso cells were zzso and were completely inhibited by the system zzso selective zzso zzso These results suggest that the transport of neutral zzso acids including several essential zzso acids into rat zzso cultures and zzso zzso cells are for the most part zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso the rat zzso cultures and zzso zzso cells are excellent tools for examining the properties of zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, the specific zzso of zzso in cancer cells might be a new rationale for zzso zzso
