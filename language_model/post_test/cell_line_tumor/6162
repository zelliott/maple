We previously demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso under zzso deprivation against cells with an zzso class I zzso background different from that of the host and the zzso are depleted of zzso zzso and can eradicate B cell chronic zzso leukemia cells in zzso or in an zzso mouse zzso We demonstrated in the current study that human zzso or zzso zzso zzso can also efficiently eradicate primary zzso B cell zzso by inducing slow zzso of the pathological zzso Using zzso zzso cell line as target cells, which are unrecognizable by the zzso zzso we demonstrated directly that this killing is zzso zzso zzso this unique zzso killing is induced through zzso zzso zzso We further showed that this killing mechanism begins with durable zzso formation between the zzso and the tumor cells, through rapid binding of tumor zzso to the zzso zzso zzso This zzso is followed by a slower second step of zzso zzso requiring the binding of the zzso zzso C region on tumor cells to the zzso zzso zzso for killing to zzso By comparing zzso killing of zzso zzso cells zzso surface zzso zzso to zzso cells with zzso surface zzso we demonstrated directly for the first time to our knowledge, in zzso and in zzso a novel role for zzso in the induction of zzso cell zzso by zzso Additionally, by using different knockout and transgenic zzso we further showed that mouse zzso zzso also kill zzso cells using similar unique zzso mechanism as human zzso while sparing normal zzso B zzso
