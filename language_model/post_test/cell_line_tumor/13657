The present study aimed to evaluate the potential toxicity and the general mechanism involved in zzso carbon zzso zzso zzso in zzso rat zzso cell zzso Two kinds of zzso which were coded as zzso zzso zzso zzso in diameter and 2 zzso in average zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in diameter and 10 zzso in average zzso were used in this zzso To zzso the possible mechanisms of zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso analysis for zzso and cell cycle, zzso and zzso zzso for zzso stress were zzso zzso The exposure of zzso rat zzso cells to different sizes of two kinds of carbon zzso at zzso between 25 and 400 zzso decreased the cell viability in a zzso and zzso zzso The exposure of zzso rat zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso resulted in a concentration dependent cell zzso and zzso cell cycle arrest, and increased the level of zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that smaller size of zzso seems to be more toxic than that of larger zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells is probably due to the increased zzso zzso
