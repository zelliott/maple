The mechanisms by which zzso zzso virus zzso tumor cell death are poorly zzso We have evaluated cell death pathways following infection of zzso cancer cells with both zzso and zzso zzso zzso Lister strain zzso We show that death does not rely upon classical zzso despite the appearances of some limited zzso features, including zzso zzso and appearance of zzso DNA zzso zzso infection zzso marked zzso of zzso zzso but there is no general zzso of the zzso process and cell death does not rely upon zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso zzso on transmission electron zzso accompanied by marked by reductions in zzso zzso zzso altered zzso zzso and release of high mobility group box 1 zzso zzso This zzso cell death appears zzso as infection zzso formation of a zzso interacting protein zzso zzso In addition, pharmacological zzso of both zzso and zzso downstream of zzso including zzso significantly zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso however, does not alter virus zzso suggesting that necrosis does not result from zzso zzso zzso Overall, these results show that, in zzso cancer cells, zzso virus causes zzso cell death that is zzso through a programmed series of zzso
