The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso belongs to a zzso complex involved in the cellular response to DNA zzso zzso zzso in cell cycle arrest following DNA damage by allowing zzso to activate zzso zzso zzso We show here that zzso and the zzso zzso protein zzso which belongs to the zzso complex, are also required for DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of some zzso zzso target genes most likely through the stimulation of zzso DNA binding zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells, thereby allowing cell cycle progression and DNA zzso zzso zzso and zzso have thus opposite effects on zzso expression in the absence of DNA zzso We further found that this antagonism relies on the zzso of zzso function by zzso a property that is abolished following DNA zzso zzso taken together, our results indicate that zzso and zzso play distinct roles in DNA zzso zzso and underline the importance of the zzso complex and its regulation in the proper control of cell zzso
