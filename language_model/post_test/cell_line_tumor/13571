The purposes of this study were to investigate the effects of the zzso gene on the growth, zzso zzso zzso and zzso potential of lung cancer cells and explore the potential use of zzso for the treatment of human lung zzso The zzso gene was cloned into the zzso zzso expression zzso and zzso zzso were designed and zzso The resulting zzso were zzso into zzso human lung cancer cells, and the changes in the relevant biological characteristics of the cells zzso zzso and cells with zzso expression of zzso were analyzed using the zzso zzso zzso invasion zzso and flow zzso The effects of the zzso gene on the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso zzso In the zzso cells from the zzso zzso group, cell zzso zzso and migration were significantly reduced compared to the control cells zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and a cell cycle arrest in zzso was zzso The zzso cells zzso with the zzso zzso demonstrated significantly higher cell zzso zzso and migration compared to the control cells zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Additionally, the percentage of zzso cells undergoing zzso was significantly higher in the zzso zzso cells and significantly lower in the zzso zzso zzso cells compared to the control cells zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein expression levels were significantly lower in the zzso cells and were significantly higher in the zzso zzso cells than that in the control zzso The zzso gene may inhibit zzso cell growth and proliferation as well as promote cellular zzso The zzso of the zzso gene may also be related to the decreased migration of zzso human lung cancer zzso
