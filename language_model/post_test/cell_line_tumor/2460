zzso chemotherapy using zzso a powerful zzso drug, can be used as an alternative with reduced systemic toxicity when treating skin zzso The aim of the present work was to use zzso zzso studies to develop zzso solid zzso zzso containing zzso further investigations into the influence of these particles on the drug's zzso and cellular zzso in zzso zzso melanoma cells were zzso A 32 full zzso design was applied for two different zzso zzso one phase used zzso acid and the other used a zzso mixture of zzso acid and zzso zzso The two factors investigated included the ratio between the zzso and the water phase and the ratio between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso It was observed that the studied factors did not affect the mean diameter or the zzso of the obtained zzso however, they did significantly affect the zzso potential zzso zzso zzso with particle sizes ranging from 251 to zzso zzso and positive zzso zzso were selected for zzso zzso High zzso efficiencies were achieved zzso in zzso with higher amounts of zzso acid, suggesting that zzso charges on zzso molecules may interact with the negative charges in zzso zzso zzso culture cell experiments showed that zzso solid zzso zzso without drug were not zzso to melanoma zzso The zzso of zzso significantly increased zzso indicating the potential of these zzso for the treatment of skin zzso
