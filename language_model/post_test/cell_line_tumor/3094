Human head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso in addition to zzso skin, zzso and other zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso receptors on both individual tumor cells and zzso cells within the tumor zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate whether zzso gene therapy could redirect zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso gene zzso to zzso receptors on tumor and zzso cells with the intent of improving both the efficiency of zzso expression and the zzso zzso 

An zzso zzso consisting of a zzso of zzso linked to a zzso zzso against the zzso zzso region was directly delivered to human zzso zzso tumors in nude mice, which were subsequently zzso with zzso zzso specimens were assessed for zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso for zzso zzso zzso to estimate tumor zzso density, and tumor volume zzso 

zzso zzso gene therapy demonstrated significant increases in both zzso zzso expression and cellular zzso levels, and a significant decrease in tumor volume size compared with all other zzso Furthermore, zzso density was significantly lower in the zzso zzso group, indicating a strong zzso zzso 

These data suggest that zzso zzso produces a combination of expected direct zzso zzso and a newly reported zzso effect that could prove promising as a novel therapeutic approach in the treatment of zzso zzso zzso
