The zzso compartment of the cell is involved in a number of functions zzso zzso zzso membrane proteins to zzso bodies and zzso zzso producing zzso that are zzso from the cell zzso and zzso generating zzso zzso that, especially in times of zzso zzso supply zzso components to the zzso for degradation and recycling of zzso The zzso protein responds to various stress signals by initiating a zzso program that restores cellular zzso and prevents the zzso of errors in a zzso As part of this process, zzso regulates the zzso of a set of genes zzso proteins that populate the zzso compartment and impact upon each of these zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso regulates zzso of the genes zzso and zzso which enhance zzso production, and zzso and zzso which produce a more rapid zzso clearance of the zzso growth factor zzso from the plasma zzso Each of these zzso zzso functions results in the slowing of cell growth and division, the zzso of zzso resources and zzso communication by zzso after a stress signal is detected by the zzso zzso These processes avoid errors during stress and restore zzso once the stress is zzso
