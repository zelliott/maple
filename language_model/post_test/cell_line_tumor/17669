The effect of ethanol and zzso treatment on the removal of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso human zzso zzso cell line zzso was zzso Treatment of cells with 15 zzso and 25 zzso ethanol resulted in significantly more zzso zzso DNA remaining at multiple time points, compared to zzso The zzso of zzso zzso in cells exposed to both 15 and 25 zzso ethanol were zzso and zzso zzso respectively, compared to a zzso of zzso h for the control zzso In contrast, for cells exposed to zzso at doses of zzso and zzso zzso no significant trend in zzso zzso persistence occurred, compared to zzso The zzso of zzso removal for cells treated with ethanol was not associated with any changes in cell viability due to ethanol zzso However, zzso cells exposed to 25 zzso ethanol exhibited a significant zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso cells zzso No significant increase in zzso was observed for cells treated with zzso and exposed to zzso zzso zzso Thus, ethanol exposure of human zzso zzso cells is associated with a decreased capacity to remove zzso zzso This zzso effect of ethanol on zzso removal in part may be related to zzso zzso zzso
