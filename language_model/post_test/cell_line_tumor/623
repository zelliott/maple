Alzheimer's disease zzso is characterized by the cerebral zzso of zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso Disease symptoms can be zzso in zzso and in zzso by zzso zzso zzso that reduce plaque zzso However the zzso nature of these compounds, made them biologically unstable and unable to penetrate zzso with high zzso The main goal of this study was to use zzso methods to identify small zzso zzso with better zzso zzso For this purpose, the zzso zzso of the active peptides were used to identify compounds with similar zzso A series of related zzso breaker peptides were zzso to solid state zzso structures of a zzso form of zzso The lowest energy zzso of the active peptides were used to design three zzso zzso suitable for screening the zzso database with zzso Small molecular weight compounds with zzso features and a zzso similar to the active peptides were selected, ranked by zzso and zzso zzso Of 16 diverse compounds selected for experimental zzso 2 prevented and reversed zzso zzso at zzso zzso as measured by zzso T zzso zzso and zzso zzso They also prevented the toxic effects of zzso zzso on zzso zzso Their low molecular weight and zzso zzso makes them promising lead compounds for treating zzso
