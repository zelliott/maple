Air trapped within the zzso of zzso zzso surfaces bearing zzso zzso zzso controls formation of protein zzso but not cell zzso zzso binding from either zzso zzso zzso or zzso serum zzso solutions to zzso zzso is blocked in the presence of trapped air, leading to clear protein binding contrast between zzso and zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso when air is displaced by zzso leading to more protein binding to zzso zzso than to zzso with zzso blurred protein binding zzso The overall contrast obtained in formation of cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso depends on the cell type and protein composition of the fluid zzso All cell types zzso attach to zzso zzso from each fluid phase tested zzso zzso and zzso media containing no zzso All cell types do not attach to zzso zzso from zzso solutions, zzso trapped air, creating a zzso cell attachment zzso However, cells attached to zzso zzso from zzso media suspensions, zzso trapped air, creating a blurred cell attachment zzso Cell attachment from zzso solutions gave mixed results depending on cell zzso Thus, trapped air does not necessarily block cell attachment as has been suggested in the zzso Rather, cell attachment is controlled by zzso tensions between cells, surfaces, and fluid zzso in a manner that can be understood in terms of the zzso zzso zzso Cell attachment patterns developed within the initial attachment phase persist for up to two days of continuous culture but zzso thereafter, zzso trapped air, showing that trapped air does not block cell overgrowth over time of continuous zzso
