zzso zzso zzso is a leading cause of zzso deaths zzso zzso dissemination to the zzso region of the portal zzso zzso zzso lungs or bones contributes to the high mortality seen in zzso yet, the molecular mechanisms responsible for zzso zzso remain zzso Prior studies have suggested a potential link between accumulated zzso zzso and tumor zzso Here we report that zzso enhances zzso zzso in zzso cells - zzso zzso expression increased cell migration in zzso and lung colonization after intravenous injection, whereas zzso of zzso zzso reduced cell zzso Interestingly, analysis of zzso zzso indicated that the zzso interaction domain is required for stimulation of zzso cell zzso however, zzso of zzso and zzso showed that these proteins are zzso for this zzso zzso we found that in zzso zzso samples, zzso protein is predominantly localized in the zzso In addition, we identified a potential role for zzso shuttling in zzso migration, consistent with the predominantly zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso Finally, we determined that zzso cell migration requires the zzso zzso Our results demonstrate for the first time a zzso role for zzso and suggest a potential mechanism for the observed association between zzso zzso and tumor progression in diverse tumor zzso
