The key steps in the evolution of full zzso color vision in primates include zzso of the ancestral zzso gene to form the L and M zzso gene array on the X zzso mutually exclusive expression of the L and M zzso genes in cone zzso and formation of a retinal mosaic with randomly distributed L and M zzso Previous work using transgenic mice has indicated that a locus control region adjacent to this array of genes plays an important role in their mutually exclusive expression in respective cone cells zzso et zzso zzso However, the mechanism by which this is accomplished is zzso We searched for a cellular model system to investigate the mechanism of this mutually exclusive zzso We previously showed that the zzso human zzso cell line zzso expresses L and M cone zzso but not rod zzso zzso We now show that zzso cells express the L and M zzso genes in a mutually exclusive manner, in that either L or M zzso zzso is expressed in a single zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that single zzso cells that express either L or M zzso upon cell division produce, a mixed population of zzso or zzso zzso These results zzso first, that cell division zzso L or M zzso gene zzso most likely due to zzso and zzso of zzso zzso complexes during cell zzso Second, a retinal mosaic with zzso distribution of L and M cones may have been generated automatically after zzso of the ancestral gene to form the L and M zzso zzso Third, determination of L and M cone identity may not require external molecular cues during zzso and is consistent with the idea that L and M cones are not zzso zzso
