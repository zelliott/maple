zzso one of the causes of zzso death in humans, is an aggressive zzso via the rapid growth of abnormal white blood zzso The aim of this study was to determine the zzso effect of zzso acid zzso on a mouse leukemia cell line, zzso zzso an active compound in zzso zzso has been proven to induce zzso effects in many cancer cell zzso In the current study, we investigated the effects of zzso in mouse leukemia cells zzso The results indicated that zzso induced zzso changes, zzso phase arrest, zzso and DNA damage in zzso cells as determined by phase contrast zzso zzso flow zzso and comet zzso The results from the flow zzso zzso showed that zzso increased zzso levels, reduced the zzso membrane potential zzso and zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso regulated the intrinsic and zzso zzso protein expression which was determined by western zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso stress responses were observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso promoted the trafficking of zzso factor zzso zzso and zzso G zzso zzso in zzso zzso Based on this evidence, zzso zzso occurs through the death zzso zzso and zzso stress multiple signaling zzso
