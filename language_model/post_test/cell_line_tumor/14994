The aim of this study was to investigate how zzso promotes proliferation and zzso zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso wound healing zzso and cell cycle showed that proliferation and migration of zzso cell line zzso cells were increased in zzso mimics group, and decreased in zzso zzso zzso group after zzso into zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso and scramble zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso indicated that cell zzso can be obviously inhibited by zzso of zzso and promoted by zzso of zzso Meanwhile, zzso results showed that zzso expression was elevated in zzso mimics group, whereas decreased in zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso a key component of zzso signaling pathway, was knocked down, and zzso successfully using zzso and zzso plasmids containing full length zzso of zzso zzso It was observed that zzso can significantly decreased the level of zzso zzso while zzso of zzso can zzso expression of zzso As further confirmation, zzso cells were treated with zzso concentration of zzso a kind of zzso zzso and expression of zzso was subsequently zzso It was found that zzso can significantly decreased zzso expression of zzso In zzso zzso decreased cell zzso migration and increased the zzso in zzso cells, with the expression of zzso being reduced significantly in zzso group as compared with control zzso Our findings indicated that zzso promoted the zzso migration and inhibited zzso of zzso cells through zzso zzso pathway, and that targeting zzso could be a promising therapeutic strategy in zzso
