In zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso the zzso fusion protein promotes zzso by recruiting class I zzso zzso zzso zzso complex to the promoter of zzso target zzso zzso acid zzso a commonly used zzso and mood stabilizer drug, has been shown to cause growth arrest and induce differentiation of zzso cells via zzso zzso zzso causes selective zzso degradation of zzso but not other class I zzso zzso zzso 1, 3, and zzso zzso we raised the question of whether this drug can effectively target the zzso activity of the zzso fusion protein that also recruits zzso a key regulator of normal and zzso zzso zzso We report here that zzso treatment zzso the zzso physical interaction, stimulates the global zzso of zzso complex from the promoter of zzso target zzso and zzso relocation of both zzso and zzso protein from nuclear to zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that mechanistically these effects associate with a significant zzso of zzso activity, zzso zzso and zzso zzso and recruitment of zzso zzso II, leading to zzso zzso of target genes zzso zzso otherwise silenced by zzso fusion zzso Ultimately, these pharmacological effects resulted in significant zzso activity zzso by partial cell differentiation and zzso zzso Taken together, these data support the notion that zzso might effectively target zzso zzso through disruption of zzso zzso function and that zzso should be integrated in novel therapeutic approaches for zzso zzso
