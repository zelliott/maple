zzso is a common toxicity associated with zzso for zzso zzso T zzso zzso against melanoma commonly target zzso zzso zzso which are also expressed by zzso To zzso zzso from melanoma destruction, it is important to understand if zzso can respond against melanoma and zzso at different zzso 

To understand the zzso role of zzso zzso we characterized the functional zzso of established zzso clones directed to zzso against melanoma and zzso cell zzso 

zzso clones generated from melanoma patients were capable of zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso cell lines as well as melanoma zzso Among the tested zzso zzso zzso zzso evoked equal to slightly higher zzso and zzso responses as compared to melanoma zzso Moreover, zzso T cells from vaccinated patients responded directly ex zzso to melanoma and zzso zzso cells express slightly higher levels of zzso and zzso than zzso as measured by quantitative zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso 

Our data suggest that zzso respond to melanoma and zzso equally in zzso and directly ex zzso
