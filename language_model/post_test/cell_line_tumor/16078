Combination therapy is usually desirable for successful cancer treatment, especially in zzso that are resistant to single forms of zzso 

To achieve an optimal therapeutic effect against glioblastoma, we tested a strategy that combines zzso transfer of the zzso tumor zzso gene with the use of sodium zzso a zzso zzso zzso This strategy was designed based on the findings that the zzso efficiency of zzso in zzso cells can be markedly enhanced by the addition of zzso zzso zzso and that these zzso are effective in inducing cell cycle arrest, zzso or zzso in tumor zzso 

We observed a synergistic effect of the combination of the two treatments in provoking zzso in zzso cells with zzso zzso In a mouse zzso zzso model, the tumor zzso effect of zzso zzso was significantly enhanced by zzso of sodium zzso 

These findings suggest a new approach to treat zzso using zzso gene transfer in combination with administration of zzso zzso zzso
