zzso the procedure of exposing cells to a temperature between 42 degrees and 49 degrees C, has been shown to be a promising approach for cancer zzso To understand the underlying mechanisms of zzso killing of cancer cells, it is critical to have an accurate temperature measurement technique and a heating method with high zzso To this end, we have developed a method using fine zzso with fast response time to measure the temperatures in multiple zzso of a zzso zzso The accuracy of temperature measurement was zzso zzso degree zzso Such a capability allows a complete record of the time and temperature of the treatment procedure and helps define an accurate zzso zzso We have also compared several methods for heating zzso plates and found that use of copper blocks in contact with the lower surface of the zzso plate in an incubator provides a highly zzso heating zzso The common method of using water bath to heat cells in zzso resulted in a decrease of cell viability even at the control temperature of 37 degrees C and a decrease in the zzso of certain biological zzso In zzso using these improved techniques, proposed zzso dose can be defined more precisely, and highly zzso heating in zzso can be zzso
