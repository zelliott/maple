A zzso platform for comparative zzso zzso was constructed from a library of zzso clones providing complete zzso coverage, and evaluated by screening for DNA copy number changes in 10 breast cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and one cell line derived from zzso disease of the breast zzso These were also characterized by gene expression analysis and found to represent all five recently described breast cancer zzso using the zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso Three cell lines, zzso and zzso derived from zzso zzso carriers and zzso were of zzso zzso and characterized by a high frequency of low-level gains and losses of typical pattern, including limited deletions on zzso Four zzso zzso positive cell lines were of zzso A zzso and characterized by a different pattern of aberrations and high-level zzso including zzso and other zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso cells, characterized by a complex zzso including zzso amplification, massive high-level zzso on zzso and a zzso deletion of zzso at zzso had an expression signature closest to zzso B zzso The effects of gene zzso were verified by gene expression analysis to distinguish targeted genes from silent zzso zzso zzso derived from an zzso amplified zzso resistant zzso was of the zzso zzso zzso deletions included other known targets such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but also new candidate zzso genes such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as regions without known zzso The zzso zzso constitute a powerful tool for high-resolution zzso profiling suitable for cancer research and clinical zzso
