zzso compound K zzso is an zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso a major constituent in American zzso However, previous zzso zzso observations were largely focused on zzso parent compounds but not zzso and zzso cancer studies on zzso were zzso This study investigated the zzso effects of zzso when compared to those of zzso and the related mechanisms of action, in zzso and zzso zzso cancer zzso The effects of zzso and zzso on the proliferation of zzso and zzso human zzso cancer cells were compared using an zzso zzso Cell cycle and cell zzso were zzso using flow zzso zzso activities of zzso were determined by zzso zzso and interactions of zzso and zzso were explored by zzso zzso zzso showed significant zzso effects in zzso and zzso cells at zzso of zzso zzso At the same zzso zzso did not show any effects, while zzso arrested the cells in the zzso phase, and significantly induced cell zzso Compared to zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso cell line zzso was more sensitive to zzso as assessed by cell cycle regulation and zzso zzso zzso activated expression of zzso 8 and 9, consistent with zzso zzso The zzso data suggested that zzso forms hydrogen bonds with zzso zzso and zzso in zzso 8, and with zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso but not its parent zzso zzso showed significant zzso and zzso effects in human zzso cancer zzso These results suggest that zzso could be a potentially effective zzso cancer zzso
