The preventive effect of human zzso zzso zzso differentiation on experimental zzso zzso has been reported to be due to the zzso of cell zzso increased DNA repair capabilities of the zzso zzso decreased binding of the zzso to the DNA and zzso of programmed cell death genes leading to zzso To further our understanding of the molecular zzso of the zzso action on zzso zzso cells we have analyzed gene expression profiles of zzso cells treated with zzso for 24, 48, and 96 zzso using a DNA zzso consisting of zzso zzso zzso of expression between the treated and not treated cells enabled us to identify 48 genes that are affected by this zzso zzso there is a cluster of genes that are zzso during the first 24 h and level off thereafter, whereas other genes are zzso expressed at 96 h of zzso The results obtained in this study demonstrated that genes regulating cell zzso zzso cell trafficking, and DNA repair are significantly affected by zzso in human breast cancer cells in zzso
