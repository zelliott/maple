A hallmark zzso feature of Alzheimer's disease zzso is zzso of zzso senile plaques in the brain zzso zzso plaque zzso are composed predominantly of zzso zzso peptides of 40 and 42 zzso acids in zzso formed by sequential zzso of zzso precursor protein zzso by zzso and zzso There is a great interest in approaches to zzso zzso zzso production and develop therapeutic interventions to reduce zzso levels to halt or slow the progression of zzso 

We characterized and present the zzso human zzso cell line as a novel in zzso model of the zzso cascade to support future zzso functional studies of molecular regulators in zzso production, and zzso zzso screening zzso of new zzso 

In zzso cells, both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein analyses zzso Western zzso zzso show zzso expression of critical components of the zzso pathway, zzso zzso zzso and zzso and final zzso products zzso and zzso We further report effects of zzso zzso differentiation on zzso and gene expression in this cell zzso 

In contrast to primary zzso or other cell lines reported in current literature, zzso not only sustains baseline expression of the full contingent of zzso zzso but also remains zzso adherent during culture, zzso experimental zzso 

Our evidence supports the use of zzso as a novel, human, zzso model of the zzso processing zzso that offers a potential streamlined approach to dissect molecular functions of zzso regulatory zzso and perform zzso studies to identify zzso of zzso zzso
