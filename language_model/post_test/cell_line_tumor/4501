The zzso failures in drug discovery campaigns, the asymmetry between the enormous financial investments and the relatively scarce results have fostered the development of strategies based on complementary zzso In this context in recent years the rigid zzso binding concept had to be revisited in zzso of a dynamic model of molecular recognition accounting for zzso changes of both the zzso and the zzso The high level of complexity required by a dynamic description of the processes underlying molecular recognition requires a multidisciplinary investigation zzso In this perspective, the combination of nuclear magnetic resonance zzso with molecular zzso zzso searches along with molecular dynamics simulations has given new insights into the dynamic mechanisms governing zzso zzso zzso thus giving an enormous contribution to the identification and design of new and effective zzso zzso a zzso overview on the applications of both zzso and zzso methods to the structural and dynamic characterization of zzso interactions will be zzso
