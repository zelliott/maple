zzso play important roles in the cell proliferation and invasion of zzso human zzso zzso zzso has been also reported in zzso and zzso zzso zzso compared with normal liver but its details in these zzso disorders have remained zzso zzso in this study, we first zzso zzso using zzso in patients with liver zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso liver zzso zzso in order to study the detailed status of zzso zzso zzso zzso was predominantly detected in zzso zzso around tumor zzso We then evaluated the effects of an interaction between zzso and zzso cells upon zzso zzso zzso using zzso as a substitute model of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso levels in zzso were significantly increased by zzso with all zzso cell lines zzso We also evaluated alternative zzso of zzso zzso 1 but the same zzso zzso was used in zzso cells regardless of zzso cell lines employed in the zzso zzso These findings obtained in zzso indicated that zzso cells, whether zzso or primary, induced zzso expression in adjacent normal zzso possibly through the soluble zzso zzso factors in human zzso zzso
