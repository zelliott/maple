Breast cancer is the most diagnosed and second leading cause of cancer deaths in the zzso female zzso An estimated 5 to 10 percent of all breast zzso are zzso caused by zzso in the breast cancer zzso genes zzso As many as zzso of all zzso are nonsense zzso causing a truncated zzso zzso A popular and low cost method of zzso detection has been the protein zzso test zzso where target regions of zzso are zzso zzso zzso in a zzso protein synthesis system and analyzed for truncated zzso by sodium zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and zzso We previously reported a novel High zzso zzso zzso zzso based on an zzso zzso zzso zzso format that eliminates the need for zzso zzso and zzso interpretation of the zzso Here, we report the next generation zzso using zzso proteins and zzso for the first time, its efficacy on clinical zzso DNA samples for zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso 11 of zzso open reading frames were zzso amplified from either blood derived zzso DNA or cell line zzso zzso zzso incorporate elements for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expressed nascent proteins are then zzso onto the zzso of a zzso plate and the relative amount of truncated zzso measured using zzso against the zzso and zzso zzso tags in an zzso zzso 

zzso diagnostic sensitivity and zzso specificity for zzso zzso in zzso 11 of zzso was achieved on one hundred zzso clinical zzso DNA samples which were previously zzso using the conventional gel based zzso zzso of full gene coverage for zzso using zzso source material is also zzso 

Overall, the zzso provides a simple, zzso objective, low cost and high zzso method for analysis of zzso zzso as an alternative to gel based zzso for zzso zzso The technology is readily accessible to virtually any laboratory, with the only major zzso required being a zzso zzso and a basic zzso plate zzso When compared to conventional gel based zzso the zzso provides excellent zzso
