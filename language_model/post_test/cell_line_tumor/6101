A dynamic light scattering technique is implemented using optical zzso zzso zzso to measure the change in zzso motion as cells undergo zzso Acute zzso leukemia cells were treated with zzso and zzso at a frame rate of 166 zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso system at various times over a period of 48 zzso Time correlation analysis of the zzso zzso indicated a significant increase in zzso motion 24 h after zzso This rise in zzso motion correlated with zzso findings of zzso shaped and fragmented cells indicative of cell membrane zzso and zzso
