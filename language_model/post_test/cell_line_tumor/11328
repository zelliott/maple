zzso zzso Cancer zzso is characterized by persistent zzso zzso tumor growth in the apparent absence of systemic zzso Current evidence suggests that zzso cells can produce their own zzso from zzso zzso precursors that act in an zzso manner to stimulate tumor zzso The mechanisms by which zzso cells become zzso during tumor progression are not well zzso zzso we describe a novel link between the elevated cholesterol zzso of zzso and the zzso tumor zzso zzso a zzso that zzso vitamin zzso which is a potent zzso zzso for the SXR nuclear hormone zzso We show that 50% of primary and zzso prostate cancer specimens exhibit a loss of zzso expression and we establish a correlation between zzso expression and cholesterol in the zzso zzso cell model of the zzso zzso cells also lack zzso zzso and show elevated cholesterol synthetic rates, higher steady state levels of cholesterol, and increased expression of zzso in the de zzso cholesterol zzso pathways than the zzso prostate cancer zzso zzso cells also show decreased expression of the SXR nuclear hormone zzso and a panel of directly regulated SXR target genes that govern cholesterol zzso and steroid zzso Thus, a combination of increased zzso along with decreased zzso and zzso likely zzso the zzso zzso SXR might zzso regulate this zzso Moreover, zzso controls synthesis of vitamin zzso which is a potent zzso zzso for SXR zzso strongly suggesting a link between zzso levels, zzso synthesis and SXR target gene zzso We demonstrate that following zzso zzso expression or induction of zzso zzso the elevated cholesterol levels in zzso cells are zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso expression in zzso cells zzso SXR and switches on a suite of SXR target genes that zzso promote both cholesterol zzso and zzso zzso Thus, loss of zzso during tumor progression reduces zzso levels resulting in reduced zzso of SXR target zzso We propose that zzso controls the zzso zzso by regulating the zzso levels of Vitamin zzso and hence the zzso control of a suite of zzso genes via the SXR zzso These data zzso the zzso protein as a previously zzso link affecting cholesterol and zzso zzso that could govern acquisition of the zzso zzso
