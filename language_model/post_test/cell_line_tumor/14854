The zzso zzso factor zzso plays an essential role during embryonic brain zzso It is normally silenced in the adult brain, but is zzso by zzso amplification or other mechanisms in the majority of zzso zzso zzso acids zzso can suppress zzso expression and inhibit zzso zzso In this study, zzso zzso most zzso inhibited zzso cell zzso zzso zzso functions through the zzso of zzso zzso which subsequently zzso zzso differentiation of zzso zzso Treatment with zzso zzso reduced the growth of zzso flank zzso tumors in zzso In an zzso model, however, zzso tumors showed resistance to zzso zzso treatment, and we implicated zzso growth factor zzso as a potential zzso of resistance to zzso zzso These findings suggest a mechanism for zzso zzso effect on zzso zzso cells and indicate that therapeutic targeting of zzso might be effective if zzso zzso resistance can be zzso
