To explore the zzso effects of zzso on the experimental tumor zzso of a zzso zzso cell line zzso in zzso 

zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso and the positive clones zzso were screened in the presence of zzso The parental zzso cells and zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso were used as zzso The expression of zzso zzso was examined with zzso The zzso activity of the zzso zzso for the activated zzso was assessed with zzso zzso All zzso mice were divided into 3 equal groups: zzso parental zzso and zzso (6 mice in each zzso Seven days after mice were zzso with 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso cells, 1 zzso zzso zzso cells were injected into mice in tail zzso On day 14 tumors were zzso On day 28 mice were sacrificed and the lung weight, zzso zzso on the lung surface, zzso zzso in the lungs and the number of zzso zzso of zzso cells were zzso The zzso were isolated from zzso mice, and the zzso of the zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso zzso increased in zzso cells compared to parental zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso zzso Moreover, accumulated zzso migrated to the zzso of zzso cells, which can be zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared to controls, zzso of zzso cells resulted in the decreased zzso zzso as indicated by dramatically reduced lung zzso zzso on the surface of the lungs; the lung weight was lighter zzso zzso zzso zzso g zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso g and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso the number of zzso zzso zzso cells zzso in ten fields decreased greatly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 34 zzso zzso and zzso 33 zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso was not found in the lungs of the zzso of mice in zzso group, and was seen in all the mice of parental zzso and zzso zzso The zzso from the mice zzso with zzso cells exhibited stronger zzso activity against zzso target cells at different ratios of zzso versus target cells zzso zzso zzso than controls zzso zzso zzso 

zzso expressed locally could inhibit zzso zzso of circulating zzso tumor cells by enhancing zzso cellular immune zzso
