In zzso zzso cancer imaging is an important tool in understanding tumor growth and therapeutic monitoring and can be performed either with zzso produced fluorescent proteins or with zzso introduced fluorescent zzso bound to targeting zzso However, zzso zzso proteins cannot be altered after zzso thus requiring zzso of cell lines for each desired color, while zzso targeted zzso zzso are limited by the zzso expression of naturally occurring cellular zzso In this study, we adapted the zzso zzso zzso system to in zzso cancer imaging, by introducing highly expressed zzso receptors zzso in cancer cells coupled with a range of zzso injected zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso arising from a single zzso cell line were zzso labeled with zzso varying in zzso zzso from green to zzso After establishing and zzso a zzso cell line zzso zzso with zzso zzso in zzso spectral zzso imaging studies were performed in live animals using a zzso dissemination zzso The tumor zzso arising from zzso could be successfully labeled by four different zzso zzso each emitting light at different zzso These zzso could be zzso on serial imaging sessions permitting assessment of zzso zzso Fluorescence was retained in zzso specimens after zzso Thus, this tagging system proves versatile both for in zzso and in zzso imaging without requiring modification of the underlying cell zzso Thus, this strategy can overcome some of the limitations associated with the use of zzso fluorescent proteins and zzso targeted optical agents in current zzso
