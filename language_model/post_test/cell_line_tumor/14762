Composite zzso fiber structures loaded with the zzso drugs zzso or zzso zzso were developed and zzso The latter is a specific nontoxic Ras inhibitor with a mild zzso nature, which can also be used for local cancer treatment and zzso zzso The fibers were composed of a dense zzso core and a porous zzso zzso zzso zzso prepared using freeze drying of zzso zzso Our study focused on the release profile of the zzso drugs from the zzso the shell zzso and its degradation and zzso The zzso zzso effect of the drugs was tested in a cell zzso The process parameters were found to affect the zzso profile via two zzso zzso zzso through water zzso and swelling of the structure leading to zzso release, or through degradation of the host zzso leading to zzso release at a later zzso zzso indirect effect of the zzso on the release zzso The fabrication process did not reduce the pharmacological activity of either zzso or zzso zzso composite fibers proved to effectively induce growth zzso or cell death by a zzso effect and zzso zzso The combined effect of the targeted mechanism of zzso as a Ras inhibitor together with the localized and controlled release characteristics of the fiber is an advantageous zzso zzso It is therefore suggested that our zzso fibers may be used in biomedical applications that require short release zzso or prolonged release zzso zzso
