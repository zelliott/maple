The water extract of zzso zzso have been found to be protective against zzso zzso cellular DNA damage, but the biological function of the zzso extracts of zzso zzso zzso is still zzso In this study, the effect of zzso on oral zzso cell cancer zzso zzso cell line was examined in terms of the cell proliferation and zzso stress zzso The cell viability of zzso zzso cells was significantly reduced in a zzso manner zzso zzso zzso The zzso V intensity and zzso activity of zzso zzso cells were significantly increased in a zzso manner zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso significantly increased the zzso oxygen species zzso level zzso zzso zzso and decreased the zzso zzso level zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso membrane potential zzso of zzso zzso cells was significantly decreased in a zzso manner zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, we have demonstrated that zzso induced the growth zzso and zzso of zzso cells, which was accompanied by zzso increase, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso may have potent zzso effect against oral cancer zzso
