zzso acid zzso zzso an active component of zzso has been implicated in the regulation of cell growth and zzso although the exact mechanism of this activity has not been zzso In this study, we explored the effects of zzso acid zzso zzso on growth, cell cycle, zzso and zzso factor signaling in human colon cancer zzso Using two human sporadic colon cancer cell lines zzso and zzso we zzso for cell growth zzso cell cycle and zzso zzso We also zzso for zzso and downstream target genes zzso D1 and zzso zzso and protein expression by reverse zzso chain reaction and Western zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected by indirect zzso zzso factor zzso activity was determined by transient zzso and reporter gene zzso zzso acid zzso zzso completely inhibited growth, and induced zzso phase arrest and zzso in a zzso manner in both zzso and zzso zzso Treatment of human colon cancer cells with zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso zzso resulted in a zzso and zzso loss of total zzso zzso associated with decreased nuclear zzso zzso acid zzso zzso reduced the expression of zzso D1 and zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso We proved that zzso acid zzso zzso markedly suppressed the zzso activity of zzso factor in both zzso and zzso cells depending on the concentration of zzso acid zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso acid zzso zzso is an excellent inhibitor of zzso factor signaling in colon cancer cell lines and suggest that zzso acid zzso zzso merits further study as an agent against zzso zzso
