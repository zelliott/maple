zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso that can trigger inflammation and induce zzso immune zzso To test possible roles of zzso in zzso we isolated small zzso mainly zzso from mouse zzso and examined their activities to stimulate the zzso responses in zzso mice, a model for human type 1 zzso We demonstrate that the zzso contains strong innate stimuli and expresses candidate diabetes zzso They can induce zzso of inflammatory zzso through a zzso pathway, and activate zzso zzso and result in T cell zzso To address whether zzso or the zzso zzso are possible zzso targets causing zzso zzso we monitored the T cell responses spontaneously developed in zzso zzso mice for their zzso to the zzso and compared this zzso between zzso and zzso zzso mouse zzso We found that older zzso zzso which have advanced zzso destruction, accumulated more zzso zzso zzso than younger females or zzso zzso and that pancreatic zzso zzso from the zzso zzso but not from the resistant mice, were also enriched with zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso development in zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso or small zzso can be recognized by the zzso zzso T cells, supporting that zzso might be a possible zzso target and/or zzso trigger in zzso or zzso mouse zzso
