zzso zzso zzso zzso is an important regulatory zzso in zzso and zzso zzso We cloned the mouse gene zzso and established its relationship with the human zzso zzso The two genes share similar size and contain two zzso zzso zzso but exhibit different zzso zzso An internal region could be alternatively spliced producing a longer mouse transcript, zzso zzso and a shorter human transcript, zzso zzso The spliced region is entirely made from zzso zzso 7 and encodes the zzso zzso located upstream of the second zzso motif zzso Mouse and human proteins also differ in zzso acid composition at the zzso due to an additional zzso between zzso 13 and 14 in zzso The zzso zzso analyses and subsequent cloning of the promoter regions demonstrated that the zzso and zzso promoters are located immediately upstream of the first zzso There is no sequence zzso between the two promoters but they are both zzso have zzso zzso boxes at a matching distance zzso zzso from the zzso start site and contain zzso for zzso factors of the zzso zzso and zzso family, all in accordance with ubiquitous expression of both zzso The zzso gene is highly expressed in liver, brain, zzso zzso heart, skeletal muscle, zzso lungs and zzso In zzso and zzso cells, zzso expression could vary with the stage of cell zzso zzso reporter analyses show that the zzso and zzso promoters are strong promoters similar to other ubiquitous zzso such as those of zzso and zzso
