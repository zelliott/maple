Several studies have indicated that zzso zzso often occurs in response to zzso stress, and that many zzso products including zzso zzso are formed when zzso zzso break zzso In order to clarify the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso death in the nervous system, we investigated zzso and zzso cell death pathways in zzso cells, a mouse zzso cell line, under the same experimental zzso Treatment with zzso and zzso decreased the viability of these cells in a zzso and zzso zzso In the cells treated with zzso significant increases in the zzso of zzso and nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were observed in the nuclear zzso zzso also induced an increase in the zzso concentration of zzso and zzso zzso zzso a zzso channel zzso suppressed the zzso cell zzso In zzso cells, none of these phenomena were zzso however, zzso zzso proteins were formed after exposure to zzso but not to zzso zzso zzso suppressed both zzso cell death and zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso cell death was not zzso These findings suggest that the mechanisms of cell death induced by zzso different from those induced by zzso in zzso cells, and that zzso zzso proteins play an important role in zzso cell zzso It is also suggested that the zzso for zzso cell death in zzso cells does not involve zzso zzso
