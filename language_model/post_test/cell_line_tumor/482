zzso zzso is a humanized zzso zzso that is approved for the treatment of zzso breast cancer patients whose tumors zzso zzso zzso Up to zzso of zzso breast zzso demonstrate a response to zzso therapies, but resistance almost inevitably arises within a year of the initial zzso To help understand the mechanism of zzso resistance, we isolated zzso zzso of zzso zzso human breast cancer cells zzso that are highly resistant to zzso These cell lines exhibit sustained zzso signaling as an essential component of zzso zzso Several genes in the protein zzso A zzso signaling network have altered expression in zzso cells, including zzso which encodes a 32 zzso protein known as zzso and its zzso truncated zzso zzso The purpose of the current work was to determine the role of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso 

We determined expression of zzso and zzso in zzso cells selected for resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso the two zzso of zzso were zzso separately and together, into zzso zzso breast cancer zzso zzso cells were tested for resistance to zzso and zzso zzso of zzso DNA binding activity by the zzso response element binding protein zzso was also zzso We found that zzso cells zzso zzso but not zzso Moreover, zzso zzso in zzso cells was sufficient for zzso resistance to zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso reversed zzso effects on zzso resistance and zzso zzso zzso zzso led to increased zzso binding activity, which was also zzso by zzso 

zzso and zzso appear to have zzso effects on zzso zzso We present a unified model by which these effects might be zzso via the zzso regulatory zzso
