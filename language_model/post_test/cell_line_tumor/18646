zzso cells are key regulators in zzso and zzso and release zzso zzso and other zzso zzso In the classical view, zzso acts merely to prime mast cells, attaching to zzso but not evoking any cell signaling response until zzso by the presence of a zzso zzso However, several recent studies have reported that zzso alone can promote cell survival and zzso production in the absence of zzso by zzso In this study we demonstrate that acute addition of zzso zzso elicits a wide spectrum of responses in the rat zzso zzso mast cell line, including zzso of zzso zzso and D, a rise in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and membrane zzso within zzso zzso zzso persist for hours as long as zzso is present resulting in the maintained zzso of the zzso factor zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso reverses the signaling zzso Our results indicate that, far from simply preparing the cells for a response to zzso zzso zzso can stimulate signaling pathways that lead to zzso membrane zzso and zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso is likely to be via zzso of the zzso because zzso by zzso can be inhibited with zzso zzso
