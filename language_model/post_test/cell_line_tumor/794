To detect the expression and status of zzso regulatory zzso 1 and 2 zzso and its upstream zzso zzso proteins in four breast cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso and study the effects of zzso and zzso on the growth of the cell lines and on the expression and status of the signaling zzso 

Western zzso was used to examine the expression and status of zzso and zzso proteins in these cells and the effects of these two drugs on zzso The effects of the two drugs on the proliferation of these breast cancer cell lines were detected by zzso zzso 

The levels of expression and zzso of zzso and zzso proteins in four breast cancer cell lines increased notably as compared with those in zzso zzso Both drugs could inhibit the proliferation of breast cancer zzso And the levels of expression and zzso of zzso and zzso proteins in breast cancer cell lines treated with the drugs were markedly lower than those in zzso breast cancer zzso 

zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso may play an important role in the generation and development of human breast zzso The zzso effect of zzso and zzso on proliferation of the breast cancer cells may be by means of zzso expression and zzso of zzso and zzso
