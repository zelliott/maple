This study was designed to investigate changes in the zzso in the zzso fluid of the pancreatic zzso line zzso to identify potential early and late zzso for predicting zzso cell zzso zzso cells were incubated under zzso conditions zzso air, zzso zzso or hypoxic conditions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for 2, 4, 6, 12, or 24 zzso The biological changes indicating the process of cell death were analyzed using the zzso zzso flow zzso Western zzso and zzso Changes in the zzso profiles from cell zzso were identified using zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso and the zzso were analyzed by the zzso model zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso Cell viability decreased approximately zzso after zzso h of zzso zzso with a high level of zzso zzso A high level of zzso was detected in the zzso h hypoxic zzso The zzso profiles were altered according to the degree of exposure to zzso A spectral analysis showed significant differences in zzso compounds at the early stage zzso zzso and zzso compounds at the late stage zzso zzso with the detection of zzso and zzso zzso in cells exposed to zzso compared to zzso zzso decreased during the early stage zzso The change in zzso and zzso compounds and zzso species could be involved in the zzso death process as zzso or zzso of cell zzso Our results imply that assessment by zzso zzso zzso would be a useful tool to predict the cell death process and to identify molecules regulating zzso cell death zzso
