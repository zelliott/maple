In response to DNA damage in zzso zzso cells must avoid entry into zzso and instead initiate DNA zzso Here, we show that, in response to zzso stress in zzso the zzso zzso zzso from the zzso to the zzso and zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso degradation of zzso a prominent zzso zzso This process zzso the stabilization of zzso an zzso of the zzso checkpoint, and zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso and allows an efficient zzso zzso As a zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, zzso which we show to be an zzso zzso in zzso is targeted for zzso However, this process is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso to permit zzso zzso of zzso in response to DNA zzso These findings define a novel zzso that is crucial for the zzso zzso zzso
