zzso is an insect virus that is zzso to humans and has emerged as a promising gene therapy zzso Since solid tumor zzso critically relies on zzso and zzso a fusion protein zzso human zzso and zzso exhibits potent zzso and zzso efficacy in mouse zzso this study aimed to evaluate the feasibility of zzso for zzso expression and zzso cancer gene zzso Toward this end, we constructed zzso that zzso transient zzso expression and zzso that exploited the zzso virus zzso terminal repeats zzso for prolonged zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso analyses showed that both zzso and zzso expressed zzso in zzso zzso cells, yet zzso only marginally prolonged the zzso zzso In comparison with zzso nonetheless, zzso significantly enhanced the zzso expression level that concurred with zzso zzso properties, as demonstrated by cell zzso migration and zzso network formation zzso zzso zzso injection of zzso into prostate cancer mouse models, when compared with zzso exerted stronger zzso effects in zzso more zzso inhibited tumor growth and significantly prolonged mouse zzso This study collectively supported the notion that zzso is an effective zzso protein and proved the potential of zzso as a zzso for zzso cancer therapy, which may be combined with chemotherapy, zzso or gene therapies using other zzso
