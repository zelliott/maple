zzso zzso zzso zzso is believed to be associated with aggressive zzso characterized by a rapid bone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has a similar structure to zzso coli zzso and they are zzso zzso 4 zzso Bone zzso zzso is an early marker of zzso zzso To investigate the effects of zzso zzso zzso on bone formation, we targeted zzso as a marker for zzso differentiation and bone zzso zzso zzso levels were decreased by zzso zzso and increased by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 6 h in zzso zzso zzso In transient zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso activities of the construct zzso to zzso Introduction of 2 zzso zzso to the zzso showed that the effects of zzso zzso zzso were zzso by a zzso response element zzso a zzso response element zzso and a zzso zzso site zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso participated in the effects of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The results of gel shift showed that zzso zzso decreased while zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso and zzso protein complexes formation at 6 zzso and revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso targeting those response zzso These studies therefore indicated that zzso zzso suppressed and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso gene zzso zzso through zzso zzso and zzso elements in the rat zzso gene zzso
