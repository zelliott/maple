zzso 9 zzso is a major zzso of zzso zzso zzso and plays a key role in proliferation of cells, their differentiation and zzso via zzso zzso zzso The study described here was designed to investigate zzso activity and zzso effect of zzso on human breast cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso 

zzso and expression of zzso were examined using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and real-time zzso methods zzso zzso concentration was also zzso zzso viability test, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity zzso were used to detect zzso 

Treatment of both cell lines with BAY zzso lead to reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso BAY zzso significantly reduced cell proliferation in a zzso and zzso manner and caused marked increase in zzso through zzso zzso 

Our results revealed that BAY zzso induced zzso in these breast cancer cell lines through the zzso zzso These data suggest that BAY zzso could be zzso as an agent in treatment of breast zzso
