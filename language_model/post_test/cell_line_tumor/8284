zzso zzso tumor zzso cells zzso have been defined as zzso However, although previously classified relative to zzso cells, the zzso of zzso zzso with respect to the standard zzso model, established zzso cell lines, has not been zzso zzso to better understand the zzso of this cancer stem cell, we have used established cell lines as a framework for defining their in zzso zzso 

The intrinsic zzso of zzso zzso cultures and established zzso cell lines was determined by zzso zzso The zzso and established cell lines were also compared in terms of DNA zzso break zzso repair capacity and cell cycle checkpoint zzso 

Based on zzso analysis, each of the six zzso cultures evaluated was more sensitive to radiation than the established zzso cell zzso zzso with increased zzso the zzso repair capacity as defined by neutral comet zzso and zzso and zzso zzso was significantly reduced in zzso compared with the cell zzso Although zzso checkpoint zzso was intact, in contrast to the cell lines, DNA synthesis was not inhibited in zzso after zzso indicating the absence of the zzso zzso 

These data indicate that the mechanisms through which zzso zzso respond to radiation are significantly different from those of the traditional zzso in zzso model, established zzso cell zzso If zzso play a critical role in zzso treatment response, then such differences are likely to be of consequence in the development and testing of zzso zzso
