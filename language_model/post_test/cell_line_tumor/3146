zzso zzso and their zzso play important roles in membrane trafficking between cellular compartments in zzso zzso In the present study, we examined the roles of zzso and its zzso in insulin zzso in pancreatic zzso In the mouse zzso cell line zzso zzso was zzso with zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso or the zzso form of zzso significantly inhibited regulated zzso indicating involvement of zzso in regulated insulin zzso To determine the downstream signal of zzso insulin zzso we examined the effects of various zzso proteins on insulin zzso and found that zzso is involved in zzso insulin zzso but not in zzso insulin zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso revealed zzso to be zzso with insulin zzso The zzso effect of the zzso zzso was not altered in zzso cells lacking zzso which mediates protein zzso A zzso zzso of insulin zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso was found to be zzso by zzso in zzso zzso The present study shows that both zzso and its zzso zzso participate in insulin zzso zzso and that zzso as a zzso of zzso regulates the zzso of zzso by zzso in pancreatic zzso
