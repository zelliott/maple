The purpose of this study was to determine zzso changes in zzso incorporation at the zzso tumor cell level in response to conventional and novel chemotherapy agents and examine how these changes relate to factors involved in zzso zzso 

zzso cells were treated with zzso concentration of 50% zzso doses zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells were treated with zzso doses of zzso zzso and zzso plus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso content, zzso V zzso and cell cycle distribution were determined after zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso treatments with and without subsequent incubation in drug-free medium were also zzso A zzso zzso was used to determine the zzso ability of treated zzso 

zzso was evident in zzso cells, especially after treatment with zzso and zzso zzso incorporation was increased in zzso cells after zzso or zzso treatments with some agents and in zzso cells after zzso treatment but was decreased in all zzso treatments or zzso combinations including zzso Treatment of zzso cells for 8 h followed by 64 h in drug-free medium also resulted in decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso incorporation broadly corresponded to zzso transport in zzso cells and to zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso of zzso transport decreased zzso incorporation into zzso but not into zzso zzso zzso levels were decreased by zzso treatment and increased at 48 or 72 h after zzso zzso 

zzso incorporation is modulated by zzso changes in both zzso transport and zzso activity depending on the tumor zzso zzso cells treated with zzso doses of zzso also exhibit decreased zzso
