zzso proteins zzso zzso regulate zzso zzso Here, the zzso value of zzso a zzso zzso was assessed in combination with zzso a stabilizing zzso in order to evaluate zzso stabilization as a potential zzso 

zzso and zzso expression levels were measured in a breast cancer cohort zzso zzso zzso using the tissue zzso format and quantitative zzso zzso technology, then correlated with clinical and pathological characteristics and zzso zzso 

zzso Cox zzso hazard models indicated that high zzso expression predicts worse overall survival zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Survival analysis showed 10-year survival of zzso for patients with high zzso expression versus zzso for low zzso zzso P zzso zzso Cox zzso analysis showed high zzso expression was independent of age, zzso status, zzso status, nuclear grade, tumor size, and zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso growth factor zzso 2 expression zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The ratio of zzso to zzso expression showed a positive correlation to zzso survival zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso with a 10-year survival of zzso for patients who had a high ratio of zzso to zzso versus zzso 10-year survival rate for those with a low ratio zzso P zzso zzso Cox zzso analysis showed the ratio of zzso to zzso was an independent predictor of overall survival zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

Low zzso and high zzso are associated with increased zzso stability and better prognosis in breast zzso
