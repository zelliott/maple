The zzso zzso gene is one of the most frequently zzso genes in zzso and its zzso affect various biological actions, such as tumor growth, zzso and so zzso During zzso zzso is stabilized by interaction with zzso zzso zzso This interaction raised the possibility for regulating zzso activity by zzso which is still to be zzso 

First, we introduced various types of the zzso zzso gene into zzso and evaluated the role of zzso in hypoxic responses, including vascular zzso growth factor zzso production and zzso zzso Second, zzso cells and zzso cells were zzso injected into zzso zzso mice, and tumor progression and the hypoxic responses were zzso Finally, we investigated the role of the zzso zzso genes in the level of zzso in human pancreatic zzso 

Here, we showed that expression of zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso significantly suppressed zzso activity and production of zzso which mostly depends on the zzso protein zzso In a tumor zzso model, we consistently found that loss of zzso promotes zzso production, zzso and tumor progression via zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, in clinical pancreatic zzso tumors with zzso zzso have significantly higher levels of zzso than those with zzso zzso 

These results indicate that loss of zzso contributes to zzso through regulation of zzso
