zzso zzso with zzso recruitment domain zzso an inhibitor of zzso is primarily expressed in terminally differentiated zzso Recent studies have revealed that ARC is highly expressed in a variety of human cancer cell lines and zzso zzso which suggests that ARC plays an important role in the process of zzso However, whether ARC is involved in the development of zzso zzso zzso and the various roles it plays in zzso remain zzso In the present study, we examined the expression of ARC in zzso cell lines and zzso zzso and the relationship between its zzso expression and zzso zzso moreover, we explored the effect of this protein on radiation resistance and zzso in zzso zzso We found that zzso ARC was expressed at high levels in zzso zzso at moderate levels in severe zzso zzso and at low levels in benign zzso zzso High expression of zzso and nuclear ARC was correlated with advanced local zzso However, only a small amount of nuclear ARC was expressed in zzso in contrast to zzso zzso We also found that zzso of ARC expression by zzso resulted in decreased zzso and zzso resistance in zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of ARC resulted in increased zzso and zzso resistance in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that ARC appears to be critical for blocking the zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso cells subjected to zzso or zzso These results suggest that high expression of ARC plays an important role in the zzso of zzso and leads to zzso and zzso resistance in zzso
