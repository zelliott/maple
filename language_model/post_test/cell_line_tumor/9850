zzso zzso zzso has been proposed as a new candidate in the zzso of zzso but most of the information stems from studies performed in zzso and in zzso zzso 

The main aim of the study was to compare serum levels of zzso and its expression zzso levels and zzso in zzso tissue and the liver between obese and zzso zzso The relationship between zzso and insulin resistance was also zzso 

This was a zzso zzso 

The study was conducted at a university referral zzso 

zzso of serum, zzso zzso tissue zzso visceral zzso tissue zzso and liver were obtained from 20 obese subjects during zzso zzso zzso from 10 zzso patients matched by age and gender were used as a control zzso zzso zzso levels were determined by zzso zzso zzso levels were measured by real-time zzso and protein content by Western zzso The effect of insulin on liver production of zzso was assessed using zzso zzso 

zzso concentration of zzso zzso per zzso was significantly lower in obese subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso expression was significantly lower in the zzso tissue zzso and zzso and liver of obese patients than in control zzso zzso negative correlations between body mass index and circulating zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso as well as between body mass index and zzso zzso levels in SAT zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso were detected zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso No relationship was found between zzso and zzso model assessment for insulin resistance and insulin had no effect on zzso production in zzso 

A zzso of zzso in SAT, zzso and liver exists in obese patients but seems unrelated to insulin zzso
