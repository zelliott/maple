zzso X protein is a zzso of several cellular signaling pathways including zzso which contributes to zzso associated zzso The zzso zzso is associated with zzso zzso Here we perform a functional screen for host factors involved in the zzso properties of zzso We identify zzso zzso coli zzso as a binding partner of zzso and further determine that zzso competitively binds zzso to zzso zzso from its degradation zzso This results in zzso zzso in the nucleus and the zzso of zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso and zzso target downstream zzso activity and effectively repress zzso regulation of zzso and zzso Our results provide a pathological mechanism of zzso induced zzso zzso
