This study investigated the potential clinical utility of circulating free DNA zzso as a source of zzso zzso detection in patients enrolled into a phase II study of zzso a specific zzso zzso in patients with advanced zzso 

zzso zzso were detected using zzso zzso zzso System zzso zzso zzso zzso status was assessed in zzso zzso from 126 patients enrolled into the study and from 94 matched zzso zzso 

Of 94 zzso samples, 45 zzso were found to be zzso zzso positive zzso zzso zzso was zzso in 33 of 126 zzso samples, including in five samples for which zzso data were zzso Of zzso zzso 25 of 45 zzso were zzso in zzso In three cases in which the zzso was negative, zzso was zzso zzso survival zzso of patients with zzso zzso and zzso was not significantly different compared with zzso zzso but zzso zzso patients, indicating that zzso zzso detection is not associated with poorer prognosis on zzso in stage zzso advanced zzso 

These data demonstrate the feasibility of zzso zzso detection in zzso of patients with advanced zzso Future studies should aim to incorporate zzso zzso testing in zzso to further validate this zzso for patient zzso
