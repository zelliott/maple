Promising clinical results have been achieved with zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso that block zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso However, systemic administration of these agents also has the potential for severe zzso adverse zzso Thus, local production might allow higher zzso at the target while reducing systemic side zzso We generated a zzso and zzso targeted zzso zzso zzso expressing complete human zzso specific for zzso and tested it in zzso in zzso and in peripheral blood zzso cells zzso of normal donors and patients with advanced solid zzso zzso expression was confirmed by western zzso and zzso Biological functionality was determined in a zzso line and in zzso from cancer zzso T cells of patients, but not those of healthy donors, were activated by an zzso produced by zzso In addition to zzso effects, a direct zzso zzso effect was observed in zzso and in zzso Local production resulted in zzso higher ( zzso tumor versus plasma zzso zzso Plasma levels in mice remained below what has been reported safe in zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso higher ( zzso tumor zzso levels as compared with a zzso zzso This is the first report of an zzso zzso producing a full-length human zzso High zzso zzso were seen at tumors with lower systemic zzso zzso of T cells of cancer patients by zzso suggests feasibility of testing the approach in clinical zzso
