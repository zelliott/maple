zzso growth factor 1 zzso has been implicated in promoting zzso zzso and zzso zzso in several types of zzso But little is known about the signal interaction of IGF-1 and zzso in the regulation of cervical cancer development and zzso This study is to investigate the regulatory mechanism of IGF-1 zzso zzso signaling and its importance in cervical cancer zzso The growth and zzso of cervical cancer cells zzso and zzso were zzso zzso by IGF-1, whereas those of normal cervical zzso cells were zzso The zzso showed that zzso proteins were abundant in cervical cancer cell zzso In contrast, zzso protein was nearly zzso in normal cervical zzso zzso zzso invasion and proliferation were abolished by zzso zzso zzso against zzso whereas these cellular functions were unaffected by either zzso or zzso zzso to insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso inhibited the zzso invasion and proliferation in cervical cancer zzso zzso zzso modulated zzso zzso by altering the rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recruitment to the activated zzso The zzso of zzso occupancy also affected the zzso of zzso zzso zzso including zzso of zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso 1/2 zzso The treatment of blocking zzso of zzso zzso or zzso significantly inhibited tumor growth and caused tumor zzso in zzso mice zzso zzso of tumor zzso confirmed that the zzso of zzso and downstream targets of zzso and zzso were remarkably decreased in zzso mice treated with blocking zzso of zzso or zzso Thus, these data suggest that the signal interaction between zzso and zzso zzso plays an important role in promoting the development and progression of cervical zzso
