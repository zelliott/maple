To screen long zzso zzso which influences zzso of zzso zzso cell lines and investigate the zzso 

Under different doses of radiation, colony formation zzso and zzso zzso model were conducted to draw zzso curve and zzso value of zzso zzso cell zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso chips were used to screen zzso genes and protein coding genes with expression differences more than 2 folds between zzso zzso cell lines and zzso cell line receiving zzso zzso The main action zzso was zzso by Gene zzso analysis combined with zzso analysis in order to explore the mechanism which zzso the effect of zzso on zzso of zzso zzso cell zzso Further experiment on zzso zzso zzso D1 expression contents of zzso cell line was confirmed by real-time zzso 

zzso was more sensitivity to radiation than zzso according to the outcome of colony formation zzso zzso zzso chips identified a total of 268 zzso genes and zzso protein coding zzso Gene zzso analysis showed that the expression of genes associated with cell cycle process were significantly different zzso There was a significant relationship between expression of several zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed no significant differences of zzso and zzso expression in zzso and zzso cell zzso while zzso D1 expression of zzso cell line was higher than that of zzso cell zzso zzso After exposed to 2 zzso doses of radiation, there was an obvious decrease of zzso D1 expression in zzso cell zzso zzso while zzso and zzso expressions were not zzso 

The possible mechanism is that zzso compose zzso compound to combine with zzso gene and influence zzso of zzso zzso cell lines by regulating expression of zzso zzso which is independent of zzso D1 zzso
