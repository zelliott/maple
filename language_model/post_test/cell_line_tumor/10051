Although zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso has been shown to inhibit cell growth, the mechanism of its action is not completely zzso In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of the effects of zzso on cell growth, differentiation and zzso in relation to zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso as zzso is known to be a possible target for cancer zzso 

The effects of zzso on the growth of immortalized human oral zzso zzso and primary oral cancer cells zzso was investigated using zzso zzso Western zzso cell cycle analysis, DNA fragmentation and expression of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso inhibited cell proliferation in a zzso and zzso manner in zzso and zzso zzso zzso treatment decreased the expression of differentiation zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso The major mechanism of growth zzso by zzso treatment was induction of zzso which is supported by zzso phase arrest, zzso zzso zzso and DNA fragmentation zzso zzso treatment increased the zzso level of zzso c and resulted in zzso zzso zzso treatment also resulted in a strong zzso of zzso Furthermore, specific zzso zzso blocked the zzso growth zzso effect, as well as zzso 

These results demonstrate that zzso blocks immortalized and zzso zzso cell proliferation and differentiation by inducing zzso through the zzso and zzso zzso On the basis of these zzso we propose that a strategy combining zzso and zzso zzso could be developed into a novel zzso zzso in oral zzso
