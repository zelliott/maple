Breast cancer is one of the most common zzso among zzso To discover molecular targets that are zzso for development of novel breast cancer therapy, we previously did zzso expression profile analysis of 81 breast zzso and found dozens of genes that were highly and commonly zzso in breast cancer zzso Among them, we here focused on one gene that encodes zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso including a zzso zzso Northern zzso analyses using zzso of normal human zzso breast cancer zzso and cancer cell lines indicated this zzso to be a novel zzso zzso Reduction of zzso expression by small interfering zzso resulted in significant suppression of cell growth probably due to dysfunction in the zzso zzso zzso analysis with zzso zzso implicated a critical role of zzso in an early step of zzso zzso could zzso zzso zzso at zzso in zzso and in zzso and zzso its zzso effect through zzso zzso zzso Because zzso is the zzso zzso and its zzso function is likely to be related to its zzso activity, we suggest zzso to be a promising molecular target for breast cancer zzso
