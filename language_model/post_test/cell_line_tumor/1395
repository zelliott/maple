zzso resistance zzso of tumor cells is one of the major problems encountered during cancer zzso In this paper, we isolated eight zzso from zzso zzso and evaluated their effects on reversing zzso of zzso zzso Eight zzso increase significantly zzso zzso in drug-resistant zzso cells at the zzso of zzso zzso and 25 zzso zzso acid showed the best reversal effect: it increased zzso zzso induced by zzso and inhibited zzso function through enhancing the zzso and retention of fluorescent zzso zzso zzso 123 in zzso cells but had no effect on zzso zzso
