To understand how zzso genes are regulated from their natural zzso environment, we have zzso the molecular events occurring throughout a 150 zzso zzso segment containing the alpha zzso gene locus as it changes from a zzso silent state in zzso zzso to the fully activated state in late, zzso zzso Active zzso requires the late recruitment of general zzso factors, zzso and Pol II not only to the promoter but also to its remote regulatory zzso Natural zzso of the alpha cluster show that whereas recruitment of the zzso complex to the upstream elements occurs zzso recruitment to the promoter is largely dependent on the regulatory zzso An improved, quantitative zzso zzso capture analysis demonstrates that this recruitment is associated with a zzso change, in zzso zzso the promoter with its remote regulators, consistent with a zzso looping zzso These findings point to a general mechanism by which a gene can be held in a poised state until the appropriate stage for zzso zzso the level and timing of gene expression during terminal zzso
