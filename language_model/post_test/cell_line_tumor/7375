Industrial and municipal processes may produce and release zzso compounds zzso into the environment, but the exact nature of their effects is difficult to zzso zzso typically exert their effect by affecting gene expression zzso To determine if gene expression profiles could be used to detect and distinguish zzso zzso an zzso zzso positive human breast cancer cell line zzso was exposed to known zzso compounds, suspected zzso and extracts from three zzso zzso A set of specifically zzso genes was identified by zzso zzso Nine zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and two zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso were consistently zzso in response to zzso and other zzso zzso Gene expression patterns in cells that were exposed to zzso sample extracts were compared to gene expression patterns in cells that were exposed to known zzso Using this technique, two of the zzso samples were shown to have zzso zzso This approach could easily be extended to screen for other types of zzso zzso zzso For example, cells expressing zzso or zzso hydrocarbon receptors could be used in gene expression profiling zzso to detect zzso effects or for the presence of zzso aromatic zzso Gene expression profiling is emerging as a sensitive and specific method to screen complex samples for zzso zzso zzso
