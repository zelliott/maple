In cancer biology, most molecular regulatory mechanisms are casually treated as zzso switches for specific cancer zzso despite the lack of compelling evidence that cancer hallmarks can be exclusively attributed to specific regulatory zzso To consider a novel paradigm for the basis of regulating a set of zzso genes for zzso versus zzso zzso we used a zzso approach to ascertain differences between the zzso factor binding site zzso in the two sets of zzso zzso indicated that there are more binding sites per zzso for zzso factors that regulate both proliferation and zzso among the zzso genes than among the zzso zzso zzso genes also had more open zzso zzso We also applied this paradigm to the question of why zzso and zzso regulatory zzso zzso first activate cell cycle arrest genes followed by zzso zzso with results indicating the cycle arrest genes are bigger zzso and zzso zzso These data support the idea that, as a set of zzso factors becomes active, there is a zzso component leading to the zzso of these zzso factors on genes that effect an initial zzso before their zzso on genes that effect a subsequent zzso
