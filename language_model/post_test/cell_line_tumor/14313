We developed an artificial lung and zzso system for zzso zzso tumors in zzso that dramatically zzso zzso delivery zzso Our investigations demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso inhibit growth and metabolism in several zzso and human zzso These zzso agents function in a zzso manner to suppress tumor zzso of zzso acid zzso the principal tumor zzso fatty acid, and its conversion to the zzso agent zzso acid zzso Using this zzso system and zzso human breast zzso we examined the efficacy and timing of zzso delivery to zzso zzso were zzso with rat donor blood to establish baseline LA zzso values; after 36 zzso of zzso we supplemented the zzso with zzso zzso or zzso and collected zzso zzso samples over zzso intervals for a total zzso period of 70 zzso zzso blood zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso none of these values varied during the zzso zzso LA zzso and zzso production were zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and were completely suppressed within 5 zzso after delivery of zzso agents to the zzso This new system provides rapid zzso delivery for use with both normal and zzso zzso while maintaining normal zzso tissue zzso
