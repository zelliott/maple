The zzso zzso factor zzso is a zzso regulator of gene expression in embryonic stem zzso Recent studies demonstrated that zzso is zzso expressed in multiple types of human zzso however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains largely zzso In this study, we report that zzso a zzso of zzso is zzso activated in zzso zzso zzso The expression level of zzso is positively correlated with that of zzso and both gene transcripts can be directly targeted by a zzso zzso zzso zzso We find that the zzso zzso zzso is biologically active, as it can zzso zzso protein level in zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso functions as a natural zzso zzso sponge to protect zzso transcript from being inhibited by zzso In addition, our study also showed that zzso can promote growth and zzso of zzso cells, thus exerting an zzso role in zzso Furthermore, survival analysis suggests that high zzso level is significantly correlated with poor prognosis of zzso zzso Taken together, our finding adds a new layer of zzso regulation of zzso and sheds new light on the treatment of human zzso
