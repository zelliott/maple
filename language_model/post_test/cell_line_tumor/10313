zzso zzso is regulated by a number of zzso of which vascular zzso growth factor zzso its zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso play an zzso zzso zzso zzso is regulated by zzso and its zzso zzso Currently for treating zzso diseases such as zzso zzso and cancer, a number of zzso therapies are approved for clinical zzso Although clinical zzso achieved are zzso they are found to be zzso in nature, followed by restoration of zzso therapy resistant zzso Recently the regulatory role of zzso in initiating and zzso zzso has been zzso Although the interactive nature of zzso and C is known, the dynamics of their expression under zzso conditions is yet to be zzso Here in this study we have zzso zzso to zzso both zzso and C either independently or in zzso Analysis of zzso and C expression zzso in cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso but not in the zzso cell line zzso has shown enhanced expression levels of zzso with increase in zzso of zzso However, zzso zzso has resulted in decreased expression levels of zzso both in zzso and zzso cells in a dose dependent zzso In addition, zzso zzso also resulted in decreased expression of zzso Further, zzso studies of zzso even with supplementation of zzso or A has resulted in decreased zzso cell proliferation and stress fiber formation, indicating that zzso does promote zzso via zzso zzso zzso
