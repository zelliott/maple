The zzso zzso zzso capable of modulating zzso zzso responses and serving as a putative zzso for zzso C virus zzso might influence the outcome of zzso zzso This study characterized the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso levels in healthy subjects and zzso chronic zzso patients were zzso with the results showing that the two groups had comparable surface zzso levels for total peripheral blood zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso treatment could suppress the zzso expression from both zzso zzso we compared the in zzso zzso zzso effects on zzso zzso from patients having received zzso therapy with either sustained zzso response zzso or without zzso There was a significant zzso of the zzso zzso only in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was further investigated using zzso zzso cell line, showing declined surface zzso levels following treatment with zzso zzso or zzso Thus, zzso could directly decrease zzso zzso The zzso effect could be restored by zzso suggesting that zzso zzso activated zzso might be involved in the suppression of zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso is a primary host response to zzso therapy and an zzso associated with zzso zzso
