zzso zzso is a novel treatment for several zzso zzso However, resistance to the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso is an emerging clinical zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso the primary target of zzso have been associated with drug zzso However, the exact mechanism by which these zzso contribute to zzso resistance, is still largely zzso Toward this end, we here developed zzso multiple myeloma zzso and acute zzso leukemia zzso cell line models by exposure to zzso increasing zzso of zzso zzso of the various zzso cells revealed zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso These newly identified zzso zzso along with previously described zzso formed a zzso cluster region in the zzso pocket of the zzso zzso that of the zzso specificity pocket in zzso Moreover, we provide the first evidence that the mechanism underlying zzso resistance in these tumor cells is impaired binding of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso We propose that zzso zzso zzso is an essential zzso mechanism for the impaired zzso activity of these zzso zzso Our findings further suggest that second-generation zzso zzso that target the zzso zzso of the zzso can overcome this drug resistance zzso
