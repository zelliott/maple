To investigate the role of zzso in regulating zzso of gastric cancer cells zzso by gene zzso through zzso interference zzso 

zzso interference technique was used to inhibit zzso expression in zzso zzso The expression levels of zzso zzso and protein were measured by real-time quantitative zzso and Western zzso respectively and cell zzso changes were investigated by reverse zzso In addition, cell cycle distribution and cellular proliferation were determined by zzso and zzso zzso zzso Finally, the zzso zzso of zzso cells was studied by zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso gene by zzso interference was confirmed by marked decrease of zzso zzso and protein levels in the treated zzso zzso This zzso correlated with zzso of the cells, decreasing of DNA content in zzso phase zzso zzso zzso and a lowered proliferation index zzso zzso zzso along with zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso gene may play a key role in regulating cellular zzso and its zzso by zzso interference leading to zzso arrest in zzso zzso
