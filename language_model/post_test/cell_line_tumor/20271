The zzso zzso factor 1 zzso gene is associated with the differentiation of lung zzso cells and has been reported to be an independent zzso factor for lung zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to detect the expression of zzso in human lung cancer cell lines and to evaluate the association of zzso zzso with zzso and zzso in the zzso cell zzso We also investigated the expression of zzso and zzso in zzso lung zzso zzso zzso expression was evaluated in 10 zzso cell lung cancer zzso cell lines by quantitative real-time zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells was achieved by transient zzso The zzso and zzso proteins were detected by zzso and zzso was detected by flow zzso We also investigated zzso the expression of zzso and zzso in 62 zzso cases of zzso lung zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso in the 10 cell lines was zzso zzso of zzso zzso was found only in 3 zzso of 10 zzso cell lines, including 1 zzso of 4 zzso cell zzso zzso cells zzso zzso were found to have zzso expression of zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso cases of zzso lung zzso zzso showed the expression of zzso in 58 zzso of 62 and zzso in 22 zzso of zzso Patients with strong zzso expression zzso were statistically associated with zzso zzso zzso and inverse correlation with zzso expression zzso These data suggest that zzso may serve as a tumor zzso gene based on its inverse correlation with zzso zzso activity and increase of cellular zzso
