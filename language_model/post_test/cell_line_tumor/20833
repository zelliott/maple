zzso cancer represents the cancer with the highest worldwide prevalence in zzso zzso zzso has shown suggestive genetic linkage to zzso familial prostate cancer and is frequently deleted in cancer cells of the zzso zzso Within this locus some zzso genes (among them zzso zzso zzso are zzso which are arranged in a gene cluster shown to exhibit an extensive copy number variation in the zzso This structural variation considerably zzso genetic zzso In a new approach considering both sequence as well as copy number variations we aimed to compare the zzso locus at zzso in prostate cancer patients and zzso 

We apply zzso zzso and zzso copy number determination methods which allow assessment of both individual zzso and gene copy numbers not accessible to conventional zzso zzso 

We demonstrate association of four common zzso zzso with the risk of prostate cancer in two independent patient zzso Moreover, we show that high copy numbers zzso of the zzso gene cluster are significantly underrepresented in both patient zzso 

Our findings imply a role of the zzso zzso in prostate zzso qualifying distinct gene zzso and copy numbers as potential tumor zzso
