zzso and zzso are highly related zzso zzso but zzso control cellular zzso We combined zzso zzso and zzso experiments to zzso differences between these highly similar zzso Our findings demonstrate that enhanced expression of zzso results in a striking increase in the migration and invasion of pancreatic zzso cells, whereas forced expression of zzso decreases these zzso These zzso functions correlate with differences in the cellular activity of zzso and zzso in human cells, with zzso being more active than zzso in activity zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso is predominantly zzso in the zzso zzso whereas zzso is mainly zzso in the zzso zzso These differences are not zzso by a different interaction with zzso In zzso zzso binding analyses demonstrate different affinity of zzso for zzso and faster intrinsic and zzso zzso exchange factor zzso zzso exchange rates compared to zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso are zzso zzso for zzso zzso expression of zzso is markedly enhanced in advanced pancreatic cancer zzso and thus the differences discovered between zzso and zzso might provide explanations for their different influences on cell migration and zzso zzso
