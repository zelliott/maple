zzso mice were generated in order to investigate the zzso efficacy of zzso zzso The zzso distribution and differentiation of zzso cells zzso from zzso blood transplanted into the liver of newborn non-obese zzso combined zzso zzso mice were zzso Using a zzso zzso chain reaction zzso human cells were found to be present in the liver for a time range from 5 zzso to 5 zzso After long-term zzso of 42 days, the highest level of human cells was measured in mouse zzso with lower levels in zzso and bone zzso zzso human cells in mouse zzso showed zzso differentiation only, as measured by zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso transplanted zzso into newborn mice were tested for zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso against zzso transplanted human zzso colon zzso in zzso zzso A delay of zzso tumor growth in mice in the presence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be associated with the presence of zzso human zzso cells within the zzso zzso Our data provide evidence that the zzso transplantation of zzso blood stem cells into newborn mice represents a valuable model for establishing functionally active human T cells with zzso zzso
