To examine the effects of combined blockade of zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso on accelerated zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell lung cancer zzso 

The effects of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso on zzso survival, DNA zzso breaks zzso zzso zzso catastrophe, and accelerated zzso in zzso cells were examined zzso For zzso experiments, zzso zzso established in zzso nude mice were treated with zzso (a zzso zzso and zzso zzso target of zzso zzso and zzso to determine effects on zzso DNA zzso and accelerated zzso after zzso 

Compared with either inhibitor alone, combination treatment with zzso and zzso reduced zzso zzso survival and significantly increased persistence of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso these effects coincided with the induction of accelerated zzso in zzso cells as reflected by positive zzso zzso zzso zzso arrest, enlarged and flattened cellular zzso increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso concurrent therapy with zzso and zzso resulted in sustained zzso zzso zzso and prominent zzso zzso 

Combined zzso and zzso blockade increased tumor cell zzso and enhanced the zzso properties of zzso radiation zzso and zzso These data provide a rationale for further zzso and clinical testing of this therapeutic zzso
