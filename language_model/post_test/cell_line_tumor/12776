To explore the zzso effect of expression of zzso gene in zzso zzso and to discuss the future application of zzso in the gene therapy for zzso zzso 

We constructed the zzso zzso zzso zzso which target zzso gene and plasmids were zzso into zzso cells by using zzso 2000 zzso The zzso zzso and zzso protein were detected by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to determine the zzso effect of zzso on cell zzso zzso cell lines and wild type zzso cell line were zzso to zzso of nude mice to establish animal zzso The tumor growth and volume were zzso 

After the zzso of zzso cells , the expressions of zzso zzso and zzso protein were zzso at different zzso zzso zzso cell growth showed no change by observation of zzso zzso and cell proliferation was not inhibited in zzso zzso However, in zzso growth of zzso was inhibited in preliminary experiments of nude zzso 

By zzso zzso constructed zzso zzso can effectively interfere zzso zzso cells by zzso the expressions of zzso zzso therefore can inhibit the growth of tumor zzso in zzso Future application of zzso in the gene therapy of zzso zzso might be zzso
