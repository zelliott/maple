zzso abnormalities involved in the zzso zzso of adult zzso leukemia zzso remain to be zzso Based on our integrated database, we focused on the expression patterns and levels of zzso family zzso zzso zzso and zzso in ATL patients and zzso zzso The results revealed profound deregulation of zzso zzso a pivotal regulator in the control of zzso differentiation and zzso The majority of ATL samples zzso zzso showed abnormal zzso of zzso zzso and four cases did not express zzso In addition, novel zzso loss in zzso locus was observed in zzso zzso We identified four zzso short zzso zzso and revealed their zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso of normal zzso or zzso promoted zzso zzso Global zzso profiling and zzso analysis showed zzso of several signaling pathways important for zzso proliferation and zzso These data provide new insights into the molecular involvement of zzso function in the zzso and zzso of ATL cells, indicating that zzso deregulation is one of the novel molecular hallmarks of zzso
