This paper outlines the first attempt to segment the boundary of zzso subcutaneous zzso which are frequently used in cancer research, from zzso zzso zzso image zzso zzso images provide low tissue contrast, and the zzso interface is hard to zzso however faint features exist which enable the boundary to be zzso These are used as the basis of our zzso zzso zzso Local phase feature detection is used to highlight the faint boundary features, and a level zzso active zzso is used to generate smooth contours that fit the sparse boundary zzso The zzso is validated against manually drawn contours and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When compared against manual expert zzso it was consistently able to segment at least zzso of the zzso region zzso zzso zzso in both easy and difficult cases, and over a broad range of zzso zzso When compared against zzso zzso data, it was able to capture over zzso of the functional zzso zzso Based on these results, we demonstrate the feasibility of subcutaneous zzso zzso from zzso image data without the assistance of zzso contrast zzso Our approach is a zzso that can be used as the foundation for further research, and to facilitate this, the code is zzso and available from zzso
