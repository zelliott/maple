The majority of patients diagnosed with zzso zzso are classified as being in advanced stage of zzso In a situation of cancer spread throughout the abdominal zzso a successful zzso treatment is difficult to zzso zzso preventing binding of tumor cells to the zzso is crucial for patients' zzso One important mechanism is the interaction between zzso acid and the zzso zzso with its zzso linking zzso This consists of zzso zzso and zzso and connects the zzso zzso with the zzso To assess the role of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso we analyzed zzso zzso samples from 105 patients for expression of zzso and zzso by zzso and correlated these data with several zzso zzso To zzso the functional importance of zzso and zzso their expression was inhibited in zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso and zzso were strongly expressed in 49 and zzso of zzso zzso samples, respectively, and their presence correlated with reduced overall survival in zzso analysis zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso analysis (including zzso stage, residual zzso zzso type, and zzso zzso zzso still remained significant as an independent risk factor zzso risk, zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso against zzso but not zzso inhibited in zzso zzso These data imply that zzso is necessary for tumor cell invasion, and the better prognosis of zzso zzso lacking zzso is probably related to their impaired zzso
