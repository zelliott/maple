zzso differentiation zzso is a hallmark of advanced zzso prostate cancer, for which no successful therapy zzso zzso zzso cells escape zzso cell death by zzso of zzso zzso where the zzso zzso entry zzso is known to be a key zzso We have previously shown that the zzso of zzso protein representing the major molecular component of zzso zzso in human prostate cancer cells, and zzso the principal source of zzso influx used by the cell to trigger zzso contributes to the establishment of an zzso zzso zzso Death zzso 2010 zzso zzso Here, we report for the first time that the decrease of zzso during zzso may be caused by alternative zzso mechanism involving zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso deprivation resulted in a decrease of zzso due to cortical zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso The disruption of zzso zzso by zzso D in zzso cells restored zzso while the induction of zzso zzso by zzso or zzso A diminished zzso without changing the expression of key zzso players: zzso zzso and zzso Our data suggest that targeting zzso pathways of zzso cells together with zzso channels may prove a useful strategy in the treatment of advanced prostate zzso
