Identification of zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso like zzso and zzso is difficult and may incur delays in blood procurement and zzso The detection of additional clinically significant zzso is hampered in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein is demonstrated to facilitate zzso zzso in both zzso 

zzso zzso zzso protein zzso was produced zzso the zzso zzso domain fused to a zzso zzso The protein was isolated from zzso cell culture zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Seven serum samples with zzso zzso and zzso and 30 serum samples with zzso to other blood group zzso were evaluated in zzso zzso zzso zzso with mixed zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso 

zzso zzso protein inhibited specifically zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso No zzso were neutralized that were directed to the zzso zzso zzso or to a large representative set of zzso from other blood group zzso zzso relevant zzso could be identified despite being masked by zzso and zzso A mixture of zzso and zzso proteins allowed detecting a common zzso despite the presence of zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso or zzso blood group zzso 

zzso detection systems zzso soluble zzso zzso protein provide an easy zzso method for detection and identification of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and other zzso blood group proteins and zzso of such proteins would be useful routine zzso in zzso
