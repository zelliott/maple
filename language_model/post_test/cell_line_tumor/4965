Parkinson's disease zzso is a neurodegenerative disorder, caused by a selective loss of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso In zzso the best therapeutic zzso cannot halt the zzso The selective hallmark pathology and the lack of effective treatment make zzso an appropriate candidate for cell replacement zzso Adult zzso zzso zzso stem cells zzso have been investigated as candidates for cell replacement zzso Several laboratories, including zzso have induced zzso into zzso cells demonstrating a variety of zzso markers including zzso zzso such as the expression of zzso zzso zzso This project aimed to induce zzso into mature zzso zzso cells and to generate a zzso to evaluate the zzso For that purpose, we created a reporter zzso containing a promoter of zzso the zzso zzso in the zzso synthesis and red fluorescent protein zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso cells confirmed the reliability of the constructed reporter zzso Following zzso differentiation of the zzso human zzso cells, zzso expressing cells were identified and zzso using flow zzso Further study revealed that not only did the differentiated cells activate zzso promoter but they also expressed zzso protein and zzso zzso The reported results indicate that zzso may be primed in zzso towards a zzso fate offering the promise of innovative therapy for currently incurable human disorders, including zzso
