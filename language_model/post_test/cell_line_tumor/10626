Ewing's zzso family tumors zzso are the second most common bone zzso in children and young adults, characterized by unique zzso zzso that in zzso of cases lead to expression of the zzso fusion zzso zzso functions as an zzso zzso factor that can both induce and suppress members of its target gene zzso We have recently demonstrated that zzso can alter zzso zzso expression and that zzso is a direct zzso target whose suppression is implicated in zzso zzso Here, we use zzso zzso to compare the global zzso expression profile of human zzso stem cells zzso and zzso cell lines, and show that zzso display a distinct zzso signature that includes induction of the zzso zzso zzso cluster and repression of the tumor zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that direct repression of zzso by zzso zzso in the zzso potential of zzso cells in zzso The mechanism zzso zzso expression regulates zzso growth is shown to be zzso by its target gene zzso as zzso zzso and zzso repression both block zzso cell zzso zzso with these zzso systemic delivery of synthetic zzso into zzso mice restored its expression in tumor cells, decreased zzso expression levels and resulted in zzso growth zzso in zzso Our observations provide evidence that deregulation of zzso target gene expression zzso in zzso development and identify zzso as promising new therapeutic target for one of the most aggressive pediatric zzso
