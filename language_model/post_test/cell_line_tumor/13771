zzso is a limiting factor in tumor growth and zzso It is well known that changes in the tumor zzso such as zzso and zzso deprivation zzso can induce zzso zzso However, the mechanism linking zzso to tumor growth and zzso is zzso We zzso that zzso zzso the zzso switch in tumors through zzso of the unfolded protein response zzso We report that zzso zzso in human tumors results in elevated expression of zzso zzso and a zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso results showed that zzso zzso zzso promoted zzso of a number of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of several zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In zzso studies revealed that partially blocking zzso signaling by zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso factor 4 zzso significantly reduced the production of zzso zzso induced by zzso However, suppressing the alpha zzso of zzso factors had no effect on this zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed binding of zzso to a regulatory site in the zzso zzso In zzso results confirmed that zzso of zzso in tumor cells slows down tumor growth and decreases tumor blood vessel zzso zzso these results show that the zzso arm of zzso mediates the zzso switch and is a potential target for zzso cancer zzso
