Members of the zzso protein family, including the zzso zzso zzso are involved in zzso plasticity in zzso zzso from our group previously demonstrated that zzso the only zzso protein expressed in zzso zzso to the cell membrane in zzso zzso zzso loss triggers female sterility, which suggests a role for zzso in zzso cell zzso These results were the basis of the present study, which focused on the function and requirements of zzso in the fly nervous zzso 

The present study identified two novel, zzso zzso zzso with variable zzso and zzso zzso and showed that zzso is the functional fly zzso of zzso In the adult brain, the protein was localized to several zzso such as the zzso zzso the central complex, and the mushroom zzso Interestingly, although reduced zzso levels triggered a mild zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited a defective response to zzso 

Based on its ability to induce zzso formation we propose that zzso is key in cell zzso processes underlying visual system zzso These results bring further insight into the role of zzso in biological processes involving zzso plasticity and behavior in flies and zzso
