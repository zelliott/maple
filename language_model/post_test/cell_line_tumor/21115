The zzso zzso protein 2 zzso is a recently identified zzso protein that contains a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso as well as a zzso domain in its zzso zzso In previous studies, we demonstrated that zzso binds to zzso and zzso or zzso and zzso zzso signaling in zzso In the present study, we found that zzso expression of zzso inhibited zzso virus zzso zzso zzso signaling and zzso zzso Indeed, zzso associated with zzso through its zzso and zzso zzso and these proteins zzso with each other in zzso human B zzso We found, zzso that zzso regulated zzso zzso signaling through direct or indirect interactions with the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso factor 3 zzso and zzso death domain zzso zzso zzso zzso was induced by the expression of zzso in human B zzso Furthermore, transient expression of zzso in zzso human B cells decreased cell zzso Finally, zzso knockout mouse embryonic zzso showed enhanced zzso cell zzso These results suggest that zzso acts as an zzso negative regulator of zzso zzso signaling through zzso and zzso
