zzso growth factor zzso zzso is one of the most promising targets for zzso cell lung cancer zzso Our study demonstrated the zzso effects of zzso zzso a highly selective zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso in two zzso lung cancer cell lines compared to zzso a cell line without zzso zzso We incubated zzso and zzso human lung cancer cell lines both with zzso zzso with various zzso of zzso and zzso for 48 zzso Cell proliferation and migration were determined using a real-time cell invasion and migration zzso and zzso zzso zzso was assessed by measuring zzso V zzso using flow zzso The zzso effects of zzso compared to zzso were similar and were most effective in reducing the proliferation of zzso cells compared to zzso zzso Our results suggest the possibility of zzso as a new therapeutic agent of zzso cancer cells, which has the potential to be used in the zzso treatment of zzso zzso
