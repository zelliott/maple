zzso remains a leading cause of cancer death in zzso Treatment zzso and survival rates have not improved in two zzso Driving the lack of therapeutic zzso the molecular zzso of zzso remains zzso zzso zzso have demonstrated far-reaching effects on the cellular biology of development and zzso Their role in zzso remains largely zzso Here we identify for the first time an zzso signature reflecting the zzso of zzso from surgically procured samples from human zzso The signature includes high expression of zzso and zzso as well as reduced expression of zzso zzso and zzso We also demonstrate that zzso and zzso exhibit restricted expression to distinct cell populations in the tumor zzso Further, higher expression of zzso and zzso in zzso biopsy samples characterized patients who developed clinical zzso zzso In addition, higher expression of zzso and zzso in zzso samples correlated with subsequent positive response to zzso In zzso and in zzso functional validation in zzso cell lines confirmed the tumor zzso role of zzso and the zzso role of zzso Furthermore, predicted target genes for zzso and zzso were confirmed as zzso by real-time zzso zzso array profiling of zzso from the zzso specimens and controls were interrogated according to predicted targets of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso This analysis revealed positive and negative correlations highlighting pathways of known importance to zzso as well as novel zzso Thus, our findings establish a zzso signature associated with zzso of zzso as well as critical zzso zzso of zzso and responsiveness to zzso
