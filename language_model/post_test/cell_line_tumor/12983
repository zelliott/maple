zzso extract of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been commonly used in China for cancer complementary therapy in recent years; however, the mechanisms of its zzso effects are largely zzso In the present study, we aim to investigate its zzso effect on both zzso and zzso cells, and explore the possible mechanisms of its zzso zzso Cell viability and zzso were measured by zzso and invasive zzso migration and scratch zzso in zzso zzso The distribution of cell cycle, zzso zzso and zzso 123 zzso were analyzed by flow zzso and western zzso were used to test the zzso zzso We found that zzso extract could strongly inhibit cell viability of zzso and zzso cells in a zzso and zzso manner; however, zzso cells showed more zzso to the zzso Furthermore, cell zzso and migration were also suppressed with exposure to zzso zzso We also indicated that zzso could induce zzso zzso arrest, zzso zzso and zzso selectively in zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and western zzso analysis confirmed cell zzso executed by zzso zzso zzso membrane potential by zzso 123 zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso X protein zzso indicated that zzso induced zzso through the zzso zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso As expected, the inhibitor decreased zzso zzso in both cell zzso Based on our findings, zzso can induce cell zzso in both zzso and zzso breast cancer cell lines and is an effective complementary agent for breast cancer zzso
