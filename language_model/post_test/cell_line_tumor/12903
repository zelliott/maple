The average human zzso contains a small cohort of active zzso zzso that zzso two proteins zzso and zzso required for their mobility zzso zzso Prior studies demonstrated that human zzso zzso zzso and an zzso reverse zzso activity are present in zzso zzso zzso However, the inability to physically detect zzso from engineered human zzso zzso has remained a technical challenge in the zzso Here, we have employed an zzso tagging strategy with engineered human zzso zzso to identify zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso zzso We next used this system to assess how zzso in zzso and/or zzso impact zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso in the zzso domain and zzso recognition motif of zzso as well as the zzso domain of zzso reduce the levels of zzso and/or zzso in zzso zzso Finally, we used this tagging strategy to zzso the zzso proteins and zzso zzso to zzso zzso that often were associated with stress zzso Thus, we conclude that a precise interplay among zzso zzso and zzso zzso is critical for zzso zzso zzso function, and zzso zzso
