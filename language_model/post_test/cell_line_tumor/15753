While patients with advanced prostate cancer initially respond favorably to zzso zzso therapy, most experience a zzso of the disease within 1-2 zzso Although zzso disease is unresponsive to zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways remain active and are necessary for cancer zzso Thus, both zzso itself and the processes downstream of the zzso remain viable targets for therapeutic zzso zzso analysis of multiple clinical zzso showed that the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso is both highly expressed in the prostate and further elevated in prostate zzso Using cellular models of prostate cancer, we have determined that zzso zzso directly increase the expression of a zzso zzso zzso and zzso increase functional zzso protein levels as determined by the zzso of both zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso two of zzso primary zzso zzso zzso of the zzso but not zzso signaling axis in prostate cancer cells by pharmacological zzso or zzso zzso blocks zzso migration and zzso zzso zzso of zzso alone leads to both increased zzso zzso and cell zzso Given the key roles of zzso and zzso in the biology of prostate cancer cells, we propose that these zzso are potential therapeutic targets in prostate zzso
