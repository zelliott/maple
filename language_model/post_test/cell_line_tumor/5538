Three circulating human bone alkaline zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso can be distinguished in healthy individuals and a fourth zzso zzso has been discovered in patients with chronic kidney disease and in bone zzso The present study was designed to correlate differing zzso patterns of each zzso zzso with their zzso activity towards zzso zzso zzso and to compare those properties with two zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso used extensively for zzso analysis of zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso recently used as therapeutic drug in a mouse model of infantile zzso The zzso zzso were prepared from human zzso zzso cells and the kinetic properties were evaluated using the synthetic zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso and zzso and the three suggested zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at pH zzso zzso zzso differences were also assessed by zzso binding and zzso The zzso was higher for B2 for all the investigated zzso The zzso activity towards zzso was essentially zzso The kinetic activity for zzso and zzso was similar to the activity of the human zzso zzso The zzso zzso differed in their zzso binding properties and zzso zzso zzso which also demonstrated differences between native and zzso zzso zzso The observed differences in zzso specificity were attributed to zzso zzso In conclusion, we demonstrate significantly different zzso properties among the zzso zzso due to structural differences in zzso zzso Our data also suggests that zzso is not an zzso zzso for the zzso zzso or for the zzso zzso zzso The zzso and the zzso zzso faithfully mimic the biological properties of the human zzso zzso in zzso zzso the use of these zzso zzso in studies aimed at zzso the zzso and treating zzso
