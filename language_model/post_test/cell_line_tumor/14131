Nuclear factor zzso 2, under normal conditions, is retained in the zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso antagonize this interaction, resulting in the release of zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso to the nucleus binds to ARE and activates a battery of zzso zzso Once this is zzso zzso 2 is exported out of the nucleus, binds with zzso 2, and zzso zzso 2 contains well defined signals that control nuclear import and export of zzso zzso The present studies demonstrate that zzso of zzso zzso is required for zzso nuclear export and degradation of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso and zzso resulted in the loss of interaction with zzso and zzso of nuclear export of zzso zzso zzso zzso is deficient in nuclear export and displays delayed degradation compared with zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso inhibitor zzso caused nuclear zzso of zzso 2 in normal and hydrogen zzso cells but had no effect on zzso of zzso zzso zzso Further experiments with small interfering zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to nuclear export and degradation of zzso zzso
