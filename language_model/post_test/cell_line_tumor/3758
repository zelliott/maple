zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are the zzso zzso for their functional importance to zzso zzso It is known that in zzso zzso zzso treatment zzso zzso of zzso terminals by interacting with zzso and depleting zzso zzso However, zzso precise mechanism of action remains zzso In this study various zzso approaches were employed to test the hypothesis that zzso zzso the expression of zzso and zzso and to determine molecular mechanisms that may be zzso The results showed that treatment of zzso zzso cells with zzso significantly decreased zzso and protein levels of zzso and zzso zzso reduction of zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso proteins showed a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso cells were arrested predominantly in the zzso which was zzso The arrest was confirmed by several DNA damage response markers zzso of zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso causes replication stress which triggers cell cycle arrest via the zzso zzso Moreover, the comet zzso verified that zzso induced zzso DNA zzso In zzso the present study demonstrated that zzso zzso the zzso zzso which may be zzso by its actions on DNA zzso leading to replication stress and cell cycle zzso These action mechanisms of zzso may account for its degenerative consequence after systematic administration for animal zzso
