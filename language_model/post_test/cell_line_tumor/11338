In chronic zzso zzso and chronic zzso leukemia zzso zzso cells spread via the circulation into various zzso zzso As zzso and zzso constitute the starting point for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso cells share many properties with normal zzso we investigated the role of these zzso in zzso and zzso cell expansion and organ invasion in a zzso model using zzso zzso Using two human zzso cell lines zzso and zzso we were able to show that zzso and zzso mediate leukemia cell zzso and adherence in a zzso flow zzso While zzso binding depended on zzso zzso zzso zzso binding was completely zzso or partially zzso independent of these carbohydrates indicating the involvement of zzso zzso zzso In a zzso model in zzso mice, both cell lines invaded the bone zzso and other zzso formed zzso and ultimately produced an overt zzso In contrast, in zzso and zzso knockout zzso mice, the cells failed to show zzso in 8 out of 10 animals and even if they did zzso they produced only little organ invasion and zzso zzso Together, these data suggest that zzso and zzso play an important role in zzso dissemination in zzso and zzso
