zzso zzso are the most frequently occurring primary brain tumors and are resistant to conventional zzso zzso replicating zzso are a novel strategy in zzso zzso Clinical trials using zzso zzso zzso have been reported recently and zzso zzso zzso zzso are in advanced zzso zzso Here we constructed a novel zzso zzso zzso incorporating a double deletion of a 24 zzso zzso region in the zzso zzso and a 903 zzso deleted region in the zzso gene that abrogates the expression of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exerted a potent zzso effect in zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso human zzso cell lines, as assessed by qualitative and quantitative viability zzso zzso analyses demonstrated that zzso replicates in zzso in human zzso zzso zzso zzso acquired a highly attenuated zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso normal human zzso In zzso experiments using zzso implanted zzso zzso zzso zzso in nude mice showed that a single dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly improved zzso zzso analyses of expressed zzso proteins confirmed zzso replication within the zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso a potent zzso effect and could ultimately demonstrate clinical relevance and therapeutic zzso
