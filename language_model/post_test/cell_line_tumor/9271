zzso zzso zzso are zzso which remove the zzso zzso from newly zzso zzso zzso of zzso with tumor progression of different zzso have been repeatedly zzso We aim to determine if zzso is expressed in zzso zzso and investigate to see if it would be a useful therapeutic zzso We evaluated zzso expression by zzso in 82 patients of zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso ducts to various zzso It was occasionally expressed with weak zzso in normal zzso duct zzso but was zzso zzso in zzso zzso duct zzso primary and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The increased expression of zzso in zzso zzso duct was zzso All zzso tumors had stronger expression of zzso than the corresponding primary zzso zzso a zzso specific zzso significantly inhibited cell proliferation in dose dependent manner and the degree of growth zzso was dependent on the amount of cellular zzso The present study highlights the involvement of zzso in an early event of zzso of zzso The findings represent the first description of increased zzso expression in zzso The zzso of zzso activity using zzso zzso may be a potential strategy for long-term control of tumor development and progression in zzso zzso
