zzso of the zzso tumor gene W zzso in primary zzso tumors was examined using a quantitative real-time reverse zzso chain reaction zzso or zzso zzso zzso showed that W zzso zzso was expressed at various levels in all of the 25 zzso tumors zzso zzso analysis showed that W zzso protein was expressed in 5 of 6 zzso zzso tumors zzso zzso and all of 18 high-grade ones zzso zzso and that expression levels of W zzso protein in high-grade tumors were significantly higher than those in zzso zzso W zzso protein was not detected in the normal zzso cells contained in the tumor zzso Furthermore, treatment with W zzso zzso zzso specifically inhibited growth of zzso cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso These results may indicate that the W zzso gene plays an important role in zzso of primary zzso zzso
