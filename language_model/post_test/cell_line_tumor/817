From the knowledge of risk factors of zzso zzso cancer, we deduced a hypothesis that human seminal plasma zzso has a preventive role in the development of zzso zzso zzso To examine whether zzso directly influences the growth of zzso cancer, we have investigated the in zzso and in zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso in comparison with its effects on normal zzso surface zzso cells zzso 

Cell viability was determined by zzso zzso zzso effect was evaluated by flow zzso analysis, by DNA zzso and by zzso zzso In zzso therapeutic effect of zzso was evaluated by the subcutaneous zzso of zzso cells in nude mice zzso zzso 

zzso at a final concentration of zzso induced a zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso growth, whereas zzso was not zzso zzso zzso analysis, DNA zzso and zzso analysis indicated that zzso induced zzso rather than zzso of both zzso zzso cell zzso In in zzso experiment that used the nude mice zzso with tumor zzso of zzso cells, zzso induced necrosis of tumor with no zzso toxic effects on the major zzso 

These results show that zzso zzso the growth and zzso the necrosis of zzso zzso cancer cells and suggests that one or more components of zzso may provide a scientific basis for preventing zzso zzso zzso
