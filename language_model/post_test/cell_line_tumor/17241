zzso with heat shock proteins zzso isolated from cancer cells has been shown to induce a protective zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso cellular immunity has been attributed to a variety of zzso activities zzso by zzso zzso have been shown to bind zzso zzso trim the bound peptides by intrinsic zzso activity, improve zzso of the zzso peptides by zzso and enhance the ability of zzso to stimulate zzso T zzso We have investigated the potential capacity of zzso and zzso to function as a zzso for zzso zzso stimulation in an in zzso model for human zzso zzso stimulation of zzso by zzso zzso loaded with zzso zzso did not increase the frequency of T cells directed against zzso peptides of zzso zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, repeated T cell stimulation with zzso zzso enhanced the number of zzso T cells, allowing zzso zzso T cell zzso We succeeded in demonstrating that the established zzso zzso clones recognized zzso zzso zzso loaded with the respective melanoma zzso as well as melanoma cells processing and presenting these peptides in the context of zzso We were not able to show that these zzso zzso clones were zzso by zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso These results are discussed with respect to various models for proving the role of zzso in T cell stimulation and to recent findings that part of the zzso zzso activities reported for zzso are independent of the zzso zzso
