zzso zzso to the surface of stealth zzso has been studied for zzso drug targeting to cells expressing specific receptors to provide a zzso drug zzso This study investigated the potential of zzso zzso for targeting cells expressing the human zzso zzso zzso A 12 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso protein containing the zzso zzso binding site was zzso to the zzso ends of zzso zzso zzso chains on zzso zzso zzso cells expressing the zzso showed increased cellular association and zzso of zzso zzso at 4 zzso compared to zzso zzso with a zzso zzso The interaction between cells and zzso zzso was significantly increased at 37 zzso suggesting that a possible zzso mechanism might be zzso zzso In zzso cell cultures, the zzso zzso loaded with the vitamin zzso analogue zzso induced zzso of the gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso which is activated through the vitamin zzso zzso upon binding of vitamin zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso are zzso and that zzso is delivered zzso and released in an active zzso In conclusion, the 12 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso seems promising for targeting of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso
