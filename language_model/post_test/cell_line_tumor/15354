zzso administration of zzso green zzso dye can effectively convert zzso zzso laser light into heat and enhance zzso injury of blood zzso however, there is no selective zzso of zzso by the zzso compared to the other zzso which impacts the therapeutic ratio of this strategy unless zzso can be selectively increased in zzso zzso Here we investigated the use of local zzso prior to intravenous zzso administration to enhance zzso zzso in zzso zzso thereby enhancing laser zzso zzso of solid zzso 

zzso zzso breast or zzso head and neck zzso were treated with a zzso laser light either alone or with prior intravenous administration of zzso zzso and/or local zzso zzso at zzso for zzso zzso of zzso was zzso using a zzso animal imaging zzso Treatment effects were assessed by growth delay and zzso 

zzso zzso in the heated zzso was zzso greater on average compared to zzso zzso in both zzso In zzso zzso animals receiving either laser zzso alone or in conjunction with zzso had a zzso or zzso increase in zzso growth zzso zzso The addition of local zzso before zzso injection resulted in complete zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso increased in zzso zzso however, little change in zzso growth delay was zzso 

Using local zzso may improve the delivery of zzso to the zzso and thereby increase the extent of laser zzso zzso of smaller superficial zzso that can be effectively exposed to laser zzso
