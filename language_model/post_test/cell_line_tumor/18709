Efforts to treat tumors have routinely depended on disruption of cell proliferation by a variety of methods, many involving stimulation of zzso We have previously shown that a truncated form of zzso basic zzso growth factor consisting of the zzso terminal 86 zzso acids zzso migration of tumor and zzso cells in zzso In the present study, this zzso was tested for its ability to suppress zzso and tumor growth using the zzso zzso zzso chamber model in zzso Treatment of zzso breast zzso tumor zzso with this zzso resulted in zzso of the zzso response and a significant reduction in tumor zzso Blood vessels that did form were poorly zzso In addition to zzso zzso the zzso also inhibited migration of Lewis lung zzso cells away from the tumor core before onset of zzso indicating that the zzso zzso of migration affects both zzso and tumor growth zzso Despite zzso of tumor cell migration, the zzso had no effect on zzso or zzso zzso This study demonstrates that the truncated form of zzso basic zzso growth factor is effective in suppressing tumor development in zzso through zzso of zzso as well as zzso of tumor cell migration without compromising other zzso zzso
