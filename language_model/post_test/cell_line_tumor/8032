We present a novel technique of zzso zzso zzso combining spectral precision distance zzso with widely used zzso like the Green Fluorescent zzso zzso derivatives zzso zzso Yellow Fluorescent zzso zzso and zzso synthetic zzso like Alexa zzso and Alexa zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso precision distance zzso allows the zzso of conventional resolution limits in zzso zzso zzso by precise object zzso after the optical isolation of single signals in zzso Based on the principles of this technique, our novel zzso method was realized for laser optical precision zzso and image reconstruction with highly enhanced optical resolution in intact zzso This allows for spatial assignment of individual fluorescent molecules with zzso zzso The technique is based on zzso intensity dependent zzso zzso of the molecules used combined with fast time sequential imaging under appropriate focusing zzso A meaningful advantage of the technique is the simple zzso as a universal tool for imaging and investigations to the major part of already available preparations according to standard zzso Using the above mentioned zzso the positions of single molecules within cellular structures were determined by visible light with an estimated zzso precision down to 3 zzso hence distances in the range of zzso zzso were resolved between individual fluorescent molecules allowing to apply different quantitative structure analysis zzso
