In order to detect zzso which induce zzso of zzso cells, design of zzso using a zzso cell line enable to detect these compounds is zzso zzso cell line is suitable to detect zzso activity, since they are zzso zzso with an zzso regulated zzso zzso To realize this zzso it appeared necessary to add a protection to the zzso cell, which is zzso of the wall protecting zzso or plant zzso With this aim in view, zzso cells have been isolated with a zzso shell using the zzso zzso Among several zzso the best cell survival zzso was obtained by alternating the zzso zzso ammonium zzso layer and the zzso charged zzso zzso We observed that the composition of the buffer used for zzso was crucial to preserving cell zzso zzso zzso zzso were preferred to sodium zzso during the zzso Furthermore, viability was increased when cells were allowed to recover for 2 h between each zzso zzso The use of engineered zzso cells that zzso zzso as a response to exposure to zzso demonstrated that coating not only permits cell survival, but also allows essential zzso functions, such as zzso and protein synthesis to take zzso zzso formation allows free diffusion of small zzso while it prevents zzso in the cells of proteins larger than 60 zzso
