zzso cell zzso zzso zzso is expressed in normal zzso cell zzso and in zzso cell zzso zzso Two nearly identical genes zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso are elevated in patients with benign skin diseases and in patients with zzso zzso used for the monitoring of SCC patients, presents no satisfactory diagnostic zzso As we have shown zzso the reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso testing aimed at detecting zzso cancer cells may be hampered by the zzso results due to zzso expression in activated peripheral blood zzso cells zzso The aim of this study was to assess the expression of zzso at zzso and protein levels in cultured normal zzso compared to that in zzso SCC zzso zzso High zzso zzso were found in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso while negative zzso zzso zzso from the same patients often presented significantly less zzso In normal activated zzso the level of zzso protein was the zzso At the zzso level zzso was zzso in normal zzso even in cultures with no zzso zzso but only by the zzso zzso contrary to zzso samples found to be zzso positive already in zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso transcripts were present in cultured zzso zzso was expressed at a higher level than zzso In conclusion, both zzso forms are zzso in normal zzso cultured in zzso zzso expression level in normal zzso is much lower than in the zzso zzso zzso In zzso in addition to zzso itself, zzso zzso zzso seem also to be a potential source of serum zzso
