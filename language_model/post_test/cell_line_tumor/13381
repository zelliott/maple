Acute zzso are characterized by deregulation of zzso networks that control the lineage specificity of gene zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso factor leads to zzso To determine how zzso mechanistically influences the zzso program, we combined a zzso analysis with zzso profiling in cells from an zzso mouse zzso We show that zzso displays a selective zzso that does not often cause zzso zzso We report that zzso controls zzso zzso and repression partially through distinct zzso recruitment to zzso We revealed several parameters zzso on zzso zzso zzso Gene zzso is facilitated by zzso occupancy close to zzso starting site of genes devoid of zzso Moreover, in those regions zzso acts by binding to multiple motifs tightly clustered and with similar zzso Finally, in contrast to the zzso and zzso B cells in which zzso exerts a zzso activity, in the zzso cells, zzso cooperating factors do not play a prevalent role in zzso zzso zzso Thus, our work describes a new mechanism of gene zzso through clustered site occupancy of zzso particularly relevant in regard to the strong expression of zzso in the zzso zzso
