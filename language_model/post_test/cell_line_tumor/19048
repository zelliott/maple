Breast cancer patients with advanced disease exhibit bone zzso leading to the formation of zzso zzso for which the only currently available treatments are zzso Here, we describe how we refined a mouse model of human breast cancer zzso into bone, characterized its zzso and demonstrated its clinical zzso zzso were selected from bone zzso caused by zzso cells after several in zzso passages, and engineered to express zzso Whole body zzso live imaging indicated that the selected zzso zzso clone was unique in its ability to form rapidly growing zzso bone zzso zzso cells were detected as early as 10 days after tail vein injection, as opposed to 1 month after cardiac injection in other zzso zzso Whole zzso analysis identified 114 zzso and 247 zzso genes in zzso cells compared to the parental cells, several of which represent novel zzso In addition, there was a 50% overlap between the zzso signature and a recently described signature obtained from human breast cancer bone zzso zzso with the plasticity of an aggressive zzso zzso zzso of the regulated genes are involved in zzso migration, invasion and zzso zzso zzso cells also express zzso zzso thus mimicking a process referred to as zzso in the zzso The zzso cells zzso bone zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso as well as the live imaging of this convenient model highlight its clinical relevance and usefulness during drug zzso
