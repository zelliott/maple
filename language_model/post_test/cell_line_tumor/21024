The zzso zzso leads to synthesis of cholesterol and zzso zzso zzso attach the zzso lipids to the zzso of several small zzso zzso zzso The zzso groups are essential for the biological activity of these zzso The zzso and other components of the zzso zzso are either present or potential drug targets for cancer, zzso zzso or high serum cholesterol zzso Until recently, cellular zzso to study protein zzso have been zzso zzso zzso The authors have developed a zzso zzso zzso to study protein zzso The zzso is based on a green fluorescent protein zzso reporter, which is zzso with the zzso motif of human zzso The zzso of zzso targets zzso to the plasma zzso When protein zzso is zzso the zzso zzso cannot be localized to plasma membrane but is soluble in the zzso The zzso of the zzso reporter can be analyzed in the zzso or zzso format using automated zzso and automated image zzso Information about cell number and nuclear intensity can be obtained from the same zzso In compound zzso these zzso provide valuable information about the toxicity of the zzso The authors have validated their zzso using several zzso of the zzso zzso as well as zzso against zzso zzso zzso a critical zzso in the synthesis of the zzso zzso
