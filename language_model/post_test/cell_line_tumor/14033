To determine the prevalence of zzso virus zzso infection in primary zzso zzso of the head and neck zzso in zzso zzso zzso represents zzso of all zzso diagnosed at the National Cancer Institute, zzso Although zzso infection is highly associated with zzso in zzso patients, the situation in zzso patients is still zzso 

The study included 50 zzso (11 cases in the nose and zzso zzso 11 in the zzso 13 in the zzso seven in the zzso and eight in the oral zzso five zzso zzso zzso 15 normal zzso tissue and 25 throat washes of healthy subjects from zzso Cases and controls were assessed for the presence of zzso by zzso chain reaction zzso and in zzso zzso techniques, the presence of 30 base pair deletion of the zzso zzso gene and for the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso This was also correlated with the clinical outcome of zzso 

zzso was detected in zzso and zzso of the cases using zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso All cases of zzso type zzso were positive for zzso zzso gene was detected in zzso of zzso cases zzso whereas 11 cases had zzso zzso either alone or mixed with zzso There was a significant difference in the frequency of zzso between zzso and normal zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was detected in zzso zzso and zzso of cases, whereas loss of zzso was detected in zzso of the zzso zzso analysis showed that only zzso zzso zzso zzso and advanced disease stage are independent zzso zzso 

zzso infection is frequent in zzso in zzso zzso zzso mechanisms involve deregulation of zzso and enhanced proliferation (as detected by high zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and advanced disease stage are poor zzso factors associated with reduced survival and poor response to zzso
