Alternative zzso produces functionally distinct proteins participating in cellular processes including differentiation and zzso zzso is a zzso that regulates zzso zzso and its own zzso transcript is alternatively zzso We show here that the zzso gene is zzso expressed and alternatively spliced in multiple zzso to three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso During zzso zzso stem cell zzso the expression of zzso zzso a rapid switch to its dominant negative zzso zzso zzso in the cavity of the zzso zzso zzso functionally zzso zzso and their switched expression zzso differentiation marker zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso we find that the switched alternative zzso of zzso and zzso is regulated by the zzso sequence upstream of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to this, we show that zzso and zzso induce zzso zzso zzso through the zzso zzso We have previously shown that the zzso gene is amplified in human zzso with a zzso loss of this zzso zzso These results together suggest that the upstream regulatory sequence contributes to alternative zzso of the zzso gene during stem cell zzso and its selective loss in human zzso potentially zzso zzso alternative zzso and alters stem cell zzso
