More than 14,000 people die from invasive zzso zzso zzso of the urinary zzso each year in the USA, and more effective therapies are zzso zzso occurring canine zzso very closely resembles the disease in humans and serves as a highly relevant zzso model for novel therapy of human zzso Work was undertaken to identify new targets for zzso therapy in dogs with the goal of translating successful therapeutic strategies into humans with zzso 

zzso expression analyses were conducted on zzso extracted from canine normal zzso zzso zzso 4) and zzso zzso zzso zzso 4) using Genome zzso zzso and analyzed by zzso zzso 11, with the stringency of P zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso The genes thus identified were further analyzed for functional and zzso analysis using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In selecting genes for further study, consideration was given for evidence of a role of the gene in human zzso From these zzso DNA zzso 1 zzso was selected for further zzso zzso zzso of canine normal zzso and zzso zzso was performed to confirm the zzso expression zzso The effects of targeting zzso in zzso was assessed through zzso zzso and Western zzso of canine zzso cells treated with zzso zzso and zzso A zzso 

zzso was expressed in 0 of 6 normal canine zzso samples and in 10 of 22 zzso canine zzso zzso The proliferation of canine zzso cells was inhibited by zzso (at zzso zzso 5 zzso and by zzso (at zzso zzso zzso zzso Western zzso results were supportive of zzso effects having a role in the zzso zzso 

zzso expression analyses on canine zzso identified zzso as a potentially zzso zzso zzso of zzso in canine zzso was confirmed by zzso and in zzso studies confirmed that drugs that inhibit zzso have zzso zzso These findings are similar to those recently reported in human zzso and are also in line with results of a zzso zzso trial of zzso in dogs with naturally occurring zzso zzso has excellent potential as a target for zzso therapy in zzso
