zzso a key regulator of cell survival, is also important in regulating zzso Although the zzso agent zzso employs zzso to induce cell death, the exact mechanism of how it zzso zzso and the role of calcium in this process remains zzso The main zzso calcium zzso the zzso zzso was identified as a new important gateway in zzso possibly providing a target for zzso The goal of this study was to investigate whether calcium changes associated with the zzso zzso were directly or indirectly generated by zzso at clinically relevant doses, and related to zzso zzso in breast cancer zzso zzso imaging techniques followed by an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to monitor zzso zzso calcium dynamics in zzso zzso zzso and zzso 7 zzso zzso breast zzso zzso zzso levels were measured with zzso V and zzso zzso zzso using flow zzso In both cell lines, zzso at zzso zzso zzso was observed to induce significant internal calcium changes, first a rapid zzso zzso calcium release and a transient zzso calcium increase upon zzso zzso After several hours of zzso treatment, the zzso zzso calcium store was gradually zzso and a sustained zzso calcium zzso was observed before significant induction of zzso zzso of these calcium changes decreased zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso induced only a slight cellular calcium change, not enough to regulate zzso Our findings demonstrate that zzso zzso calcium stores provide a direct target for zzso action and are important for induction of zzso independent of zzso zzso Furthermore, our results show for the first time, that the role of calcium in zzso zzso zzso zzso is dependent on zzso zzso
