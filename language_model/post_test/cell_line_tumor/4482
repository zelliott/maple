zzso evidence implicates zzso zzso in promoting breast cancer zzso and zzso cell behaviors in zzso and in zzso However, the extent to which zzso is actually required for breast cancer zzso remains to be zzso We used zzso interference to silence zzso zzso expression by approximately zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, a model of aggressive, zzso breast zzso Loss of zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso and proliferation on zzso zzso and modestly reduced the growth of zzso implanted zzso However, spontaneous zzso to lung was zzso zzso Experimental lung colonization after tail vein injection revealed a similar loss of zzso capacity for the zzso zzso cells, suggesting that critical, zzso events at the zzso site could account for much of zzso contribution to zzso in this zzso zzso zzso in the zzso cells reversed the loss of zzso capacity, and zzso another target, the small zzso zzso had no effect, supporting the specificity of the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells, all zzso abundant zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso suggesting that loss of zzso zzso might disrupt an zzso loop that could function to sustain zzso zzso Analysis of human breast cancer cases revealed reduced survival in cases where zzso zzso and zzso are both zzso 

zzso zzso or downstream zzso may be potential therapeutic targets in zzso breast zzso especially when zzso zzso or other zzso zzso zzso are also zzso
