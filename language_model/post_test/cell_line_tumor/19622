zzso right zzso zzso zzso is characterized by progressive zzso of the right zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso replacement, and increased risk of sudden zzso zzso in 6 zzso including 4 zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, and zzso zzso have been identified in patients with zzso zzso analysis of 66 zzso identified 4 zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso To establish a cause and effect relationship between those zzso zzso zzso and zzso we performed in zzso and in zzso analyses of the zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso failed to zzso to the cell membrane in zzso cell line and failed to bind to and zzso zzso Multiple attempts to generate zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have zzso analysis of zzso revealed evidence of profound zzso zzso which likely resulted in embryonic zzso We were able to develop transgenic zzso mice with zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Whereas mice zzso zzso zzso had no zzso zzso zzso or functional cardiac changes, the zzso mice had increased zzso zzso cardiac fibrosis, and zzso zzso along with zzso enlargement and cardiac dysfunction in both zzso These mice also displayed interruption of zzso interaction at zzso discs zzso and marked zzso changes of zzso These data suggest zzso expression in zzso is crucial for maintaining cardiac tissue integrity, and zzso abnormalities result in zzso by zzso death, changes in zzso zzso and defects in cardiac zzso
