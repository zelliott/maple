zzso breast tumors are typically zzso zzso and are associated with a high zzso of brain zzso and poor clinical zzso The molecular zzso zzso is predominantly expressed in zzso breast cancer zzso and contributes to an aggressive tumor zzso in zzso zzso We investigated the potential role of zzso in brain zzso in zzso 

zzso expression in primary breast zzso and brain zzso was analyzed by zzso among patients with breast cancer with brain zzso zzso was zzso or silenced in two different zzso cell zzso The effects on cell zzso to human brain zzso zzso cells zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso migration, and zzso across a zzso zzso zzso barrier zzso model were zzso In addition, the effects of zzso or zzso zzso on brain zzso in zzso were investigated using zzso zzso zzso 

In a cohort of women with breast cancer brain zzso zzso expression in primary breast zzso was associated with poor overall survival and poor survival after brain zzso even among patients with zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells enhanced zzso to zzso zzso migration, and zzso zzso in zzso whereas zzso zzso inhibited these zzso zzso promoted zzso of zzso cells to zzso at least in part, through an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso promoted brain zzso whereas zzso zzso inhibited brain zzso in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is a novel regulator of brain zzso in zzso and represents a potential zzso and drug target for this aggressive zzso
