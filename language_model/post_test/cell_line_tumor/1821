zzso molecular zzso using blood is an important approach for clinical assessment of zzso zzso We investigated a molecular zzso zzso approach for zzso using patients' blood zzso The expression levels of a list of candidate proteins were zzso in plasma and serum samples from two different zzso of patients with zzso zzso and normal zzso The biological function was studied for one of the identified zzso Additionally, the zzso significance of protein marker expression was measured by survival zzso As a result, protein zzso associated with zzso zzso were identified from the blood specimens and five of the protein zzso were common to both zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that many of the protein zzso identified in peripheral blood specimens were expressed in zzso zzso zzso levels for one of the zzso zzso was found to correlate with WHO grade among invasive zzso and we demonstrate that zzso promotes human zzso cell proliferation and zzso Additionally, four zzso protein zzso were zzso In conclusion, we demonstrate that both peripheral blood plasma and serum specimens are highly valuable and complementary to each other in the quest for protein zzso of zzso zzso zzso of novel protein zzso were identified that may aid in the diagnosis and prognosis of patients with zzso zzso
