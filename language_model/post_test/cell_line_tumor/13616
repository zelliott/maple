This study aimed to evaluate the effect of zzso and its structural zzso on the functional activity and gene expression of zzso zzso in order to identify effective zzso zzso from natural products which have additional zzso zzso 

The interaction characteristics of zzso zzso and zzso with zzso were determined in zzso cells zzso zzso 

All three compounds zzso the expression of zzso in a zzso and zzso manner, leading to zzso to zzso reductions of zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in the significant enhancement of the zzso zzso of zzso a zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso with zzso zzso or zzso significantly increased the zzso of cancer cells to zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

The present study suggests that zzso zzso and zzso could be promising agents for reducing the zzso resistance of cancer cells to zzso drugs via the zzso of zzso zzso
