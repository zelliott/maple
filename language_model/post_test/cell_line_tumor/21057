Recently discovered zzso zzso zzso which is primarily produced by gastrointestinal zzso has been implicated in the zzso cell proliferation and invasion, presumably through an zzso zzso This study was aimed to identify the role of zzso produced zzso in zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso receptors and produce more zzso as compared to normal human zzso leading to their enhanced zzso and invasive zzso zzso zzso available zzso zzso levels in patients with zzso cancer do not exhibit significant correlation with any tumor stage or grade, however, locally produced zzso tissue zzso strongly zzso both with advancing zzso zzso in a zzso manner and zzso of the zzso zzso We conclude that zzso might play an important role in promoting zzso zzso
