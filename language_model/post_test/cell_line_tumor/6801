zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso localized in the zzso inner zzso We and others have shown that zzso is a zzso gene that can mediate zzso through generation of zzso oxygen species zzso The zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso was found to activate the zzso promoter in colon cancer zzso zzso zzso have been reported to induce zzso in a variety of cancer zzso In zzso cells expressing a zzso zzso zzso enhanced the binding of zzso to zzso element in the zzso promoter and increased zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso either by zzso zzso or deletion of zzso element in the zzso promoter only partially decreased the zzso promoter zzso in response to zzso indicating also the involvement of zzso zzso Further, zzso also induced zzso protein expression in zzso cells, which may be the possible mechanism for zzso zzso zzso since zzso has been shown to be a downstream zzso in zzso zzso In zzso cells, with both zzso zzso and zzso zzso there was no effect of zzso on zzso zzso whereas in zzso cells, with a zzso zzso and wild type zzso increased zzso was observed by zzso zzso indicating that both zzso and zzso mechanisms are involved in the zzso zzso zzso A zzso and zzso increase in zzso zzso activity was obtained in zzso cells treated with zzso with a zzso increase in the production of zzso zzso Our results suggest that the induction of zzso by zzso may, at least in part, be zzso by targeting zzso gene expression for generation of zzso by zzso both by zzso and zzso zzso
