zzso from immune detection favors both tumor survival and zzso and new approaches to circumvent this are essential to combat zzso zzso zzso bacteria, such as zzso zzso can zzso a tumor by transforming it into a site of zzso however, the zzso zzso of zzso leads to zzso effects diluting its therapeutic efficacy and making its use in human patients inherently zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso tumor specificity can be significantly improved via a zzso zzso zzso directed to a zzso zzso zzso zzso bacterial targeting specifies the infection of zzso zzso cells in zzso and in zzso while significantly diminishing zzso cell zzso Indeed, zzso zzso was less generally zzso even in zzso that normally serve as zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso engineered to carry the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso effectively treats human zzso zzso when zzso zzso or zzso with zzso in mice lacking a functional zzso immune zzso zzso zzso zzso could prove effective even in those patients displaying a zzso immune system, which is often the case with late-stage zzso Altogether, zzso zzso zzso can mediate a zzso response and rejection with few zzso adverse effects while specifically delivering zzso zzso
