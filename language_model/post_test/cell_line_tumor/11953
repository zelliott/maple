The zzso initiation factor zzso zzso is the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in translation zzso In the present study, we investigate the biological function of zzso in translation and zzso in tumor zzso We demonstrated for the first time that zzso is zzso in most human tumors using a cancer profiling array and confirmed by real-time reverse zzso zzso in melanoma and pancreatic zzso zzso of zzso zzso cell proliferation and zzso zzso in melanoma and pancreatic cancer zzso zzso of zzso protects melanoma cells from zzso We further investigated the biological function of zzso In zzso translation studies indicate that zzso is a negative regulator of translation and that the region between zzso acids 170 and 248 of zzso is required for its translation regulatory zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso translation and overall cellular protein zzso zzso profile and zzso zzso zzso fragmentation zzso revealed that zzso reduces zzso which may be associated with zzso zzso We propose that zzso may play a role in zzso degradation during zzso These data provide critical insights into the cellular function of zzso and in linking translation initiation and zzso
