zzso is one of the main zzso of treatment outcome in oral zzso cell zzso zzso and treatment of zzso zzso is difficult due to cross resistance to other conventional zzso We aimed to identify whether genetically modified zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso which affects collagen zzso can effectively inhibit growth of the zzso zzso zzso effect of zzso zzso was compared between zzso and zzso zzso cell lines in zzso and in zzso and spread of zzso throughout the tumor mass was verified by zzso zzso zzso zzso effectively killed cancer cells and there was no significant difference in the zzso effect between zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso In animal experiments, the zzso significantly reduced the size of zzso and there was no significant difference between zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso expressing zzso showed better proliferation and eliminated zzso more effectively compared to zzso zzso zzso These findings suggested that genetically modified zzso zzso can effectively inhibit growth of the zzso zzso and might be a new therapeutic option in zzso zzso
