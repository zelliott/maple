Recent zzso association studies zzso identified a number of prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso but most of their functional zzso are not zzso Through our previous zzso for PC in a Japanese population and subsequent zzso and fine zzso we here identified that zzso zzso zzso zzso coding zzso zzso 4, is a zzso gene of the PC zzso locus zzso at zzso zzso zzso is expressed specifically in the prostate and heart, and quantitative expression analysis revealed a significant association between the zzso of zzso and zzso expression in normal prostate zzso zzso of zzso in PC cells enhanced their growth and zzso zzso in PC cells suppressed their growth, indicating the functional association of zzso with PC and its tumor zzso zzso zzso confirmed its zzso interaction to vitamin D zzso zzso and we found a significant interaction between zzso and zzso in their zzso zzso zzso These findings indicate that the zzso locus represented by zzso at zzso is likely to regulate zzso expression in prostate which could suppress PC growth by interacting with the zzso pathway, zzso to PC zzso
