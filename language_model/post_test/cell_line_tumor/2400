The zzso zzso has a function in many human zzso and is a proven therapeutic zzso zzso zzso or therapeutic zzso zzso zzso targeting zzso has been difficult because zzso intact zzso zzso frequently display zzso activity, zzso the use of zzso zzso fragments for zzso By using a novel strategy that included zzso with cells expressing zzso we obtained a range of zzso These zzso zzso were tested for binding specificity and zzso activity using a range of zzso techniques and in zzso zzso The zzso 80 zzso bound an zzso contained in the small zzso domain of zzso zzso acids zzso that was zzso exposed on the zzso zzso Since the zzso precursor is only expressed on the surface of cancer cells and not normal cells, this zzso is potentially tumor zzso An interesting subset of our zzso displayed profound activities on zzso zzso and zzso zzso 87, an zzso binding the loop connecting strands zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso domain of zzso displayed no intrinsic zzso activity but promoted zzso zzso and zzso zzso 87 inhibited zzso migration of zzso zzso zzso cells, the proliferation of zzso lung cancer cells and the growth of human zzso zzso cells in a mouse zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso targeting zzso controlling zzso zzso and degradation provide new ways of controlling zzso expression and activity and may enable the therapeutic targeting of zzso by intact, zzso zzso
