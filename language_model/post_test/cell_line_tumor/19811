Cancer cells can invade three-dimensional zzso by distinct mechanisms, recently defined by their dependence on zzso zzso including zzso zzso Upon treatment with zzso zzso some zzso cells undergo a zzso to zzso transition that allows invasion in the absence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso We show here that in zzso cells, this transition is associated with weakened zzso zzso consistently reduced cell surface expression of the zzso zzso collagen zzso and impaired zzso zzso as judged by reduced zzso of focal zzso zzso zzso On examining cancer cells that use defined invasion strategies, we show that distinct from zzso invasion, zzso invasion is independent of zzso zzso 2 zzso activity that is usually needed for turnover of zzso zzso during two-dimensional zzso zzso Moreover, an inhibitor of zzso zzso which specifically zzso zzso invasion, restores cell surface expression of zzso zzso downstream zzso zzso and zzso 2 zzso of zzso zzso These findings link weakened zzso function to a lack of requirement for zzso zzso zzso zzso turnover during zzso zzso In keeping with the need for zzso zzso zzso zzso invasion is uniquely sensitive to zzso zzso Thus, the need for a major zzso that controls zzso zzso turnover defines and zzso cancer cell invasion zzso
