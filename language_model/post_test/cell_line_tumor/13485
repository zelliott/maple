Studies have shown that zzso zzso was proved to be silenced while DNA zzso 1 zzso was zzso in gastric zzso But the mechanism of zzso expression of zzso and zzso and their relationships in gastric cancer are still zzso The aims of this study were to investigate the expression profile of zzso and zzso and reveal whether they have any zzso We used zzso quantitative real-time zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso to measure the level of zzso zzso DNA zzso level and zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer cells were zzso with zzso or zzso or treated with zzso Cell proliferation and zzso were detected by cell counting and flow zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrated that gastric cancer zzso and cell lines displayed a consistent zzso of zzso and zzso of promoter zzso zzso was zzso in primary tumors and cell lines, while zzso of zzso using zzso could decrease zzso level of zzso promoter and restore its zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of zzso in cancer cell lines caused reduction in zzso expression and inhibited cell zzso but no obvious change was found in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is zzso by DNA zzso of promoter region in gastric cancer, which is zzso through zzso zzso Additionally, the silence of zzso reduces its suppression to zzso in gastric cancer, and this may in turn result in zzso of zzso and promote DNA zzso
