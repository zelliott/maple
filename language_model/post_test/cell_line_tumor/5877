We provide novel functional data that zzso zzso of gene zzso using zzso not only abrogates the zzso zzso of zzso prostate cancer cells but is selective with respect to zzso and translation of other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a subset of zzso evidenced by gene expression array analysis and Western zzso but does not compromise cell proliferation or zzso zzso However, growth of zzso tumors containing the zzso zzso zzso is significantly zzso Analysis of the modulated genes reveals induction of the zzso zzso principally to involve zzso of networks of zzso factors and cellular zzso zzso The data provide evidence that zzso regulatory functions of zzso beyond protein zzso are critical regulators of cellular zzso zzso key members of affected networks identified by gene expression analysis raises the possibility of zzso stabilizing a benign zzso generated by modulating the expression of an individual gene and thereafter constraining a zzso zzso while leaving zzso zzso zzso
