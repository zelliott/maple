zzso zzso are small zzso zzso of approximately 22 zzso that can function as zzso or tumor zzso in human zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in many type of zzso and a reduction of cell zzso migration, and invasion upon zzso suggests that zzso is a tumor zzso In this study, zzso gene expression analysis of zzso cells that zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso a zzso scaffolding zzso is zzso a result that was confirmed by real-time zzso and Western zzso zzso A zzso reporter zzso revealed that zzso is directly bound to zzso zzso Cancer cell migration and invasion were significantly inhibited in zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso functions as an zzso in zzso The identification of tumor zzso zzso and their target genes could provide new insights into potential mechanism of zzso zzso
