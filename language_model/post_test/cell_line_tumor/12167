The zzso zzso of insulin zzso by pancreatic beta cells is zzso by membrane zzso due to increased zzso zzso production and closure of zzso zzso Alternative pathways may involve the zzso of zzso channels by cell swelling upon zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells zzso with an zzso solution containing 20 zzso zzso or a zzso zzso solution leads to the zzso of a zzso zzso with zzso and pharmacological properties of zzso currents activated in many other cell types during regulatory volume decrease zzso zzso outward zzso zzso at positive membrane zzso and block by zzso channel zzso like zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The current is not inhibited by zzso and remains activated for at least 10 zzso when reducing the zzso zzso concentration from 20 zzso to 5 zzso but zzso back to control levels when cells are exposed to a zzso zzso zzso solution containing 20 zzso zzso This zzso current can likewise be induced by 20 zzso zzso which is taken up but not zzso by the cells, suggesting that cellular sugar zzso is involved in current zzso Fluorescence resonance energy transfer zzso experiments show that zzso current zzso by 20 zzso zzso and zzso cell swelling are accompanied by a zzso transient zzso of the membrane associated fraction of zzso a zzso zzso zzso protein involved in cell volume regulation and generation of zzso zzso
