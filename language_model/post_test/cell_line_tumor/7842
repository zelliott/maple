zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has important roles in cellular zzso Because of its activity to switch the zzso of zzso bonds in zzso zzso zzso operates as a zzso switch, often in zzso zzso zzso activity is usually controlled by zzso zzso but how zzso switches protein fates has been zzso Here we show that zzso controls the degree of zzso zzso and thereby protein zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso is essential for viability because it controls the zzso zzso zzso factor involved in zzso zzso zzso High zzso activity results in low zzso of zzso which triggers zzso precursor processing and hence zzso factor zzso By contrast, decreased zzso activity leads to robust zzso zzso and subsequent zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells changes the zzso status of the zzso zzso protein zzso from zzso which is known to trigger nuclear export, to zzso which causes nuclear zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso activity is often translated into a zzso zzso switch, and that zzso may affect the degree of zzso zzso in other pathways as zzso
