Cancer zzso may have zzso and genetic differences from their primary zzso of zzso zzso zzso attenuated viruses based on zzso zzso zzso zzso have shown potent zzso effects in treating primary tumors in animal tumor models, but their efficacy in treating zzso zzso zzso is poorly zzso We compared the efficacy of an attenuated zzso zzso zzso in treating a series of zzso zzso zzso cell lines derived from serial zzso and harvest from zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso mice were implanted with zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated, expanded in zzso and zzso into new zzso A series of cell lines zzso were generated through seven serial zzso zzso from higher zzso passages showed consistent trends toward increased migratory and invasive ability, increased cell surface zzso (an zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso D zzso Exposure to zzso showed increased viral entry, zzso and zzso with higher zzso zzso zzso injection of zzso in a zzso flank tumor model caused significantly greater tumor zzso and increased viral infection of zzso compared with zzso 

These results show that zzso zzso zzso may undergo selection for zzso including increased zzso zzso that make them more sensitive targets for zzso zzso zzso These findings support the clinical application of these agents for the treatment of zzso zzso zzso
