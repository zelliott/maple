Based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on both zzso barrier zzso and zzso cells, zzso modified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were developed as a potential zzso drug delivery system for enhancing the zzso penetration via zzso zzso and improving the drug zzso in the zzso via zzso zzso In zzso zzso characterization of the zzso zzso system presented satisfactory size of 71 zzso with uniform distribution, high zzso efficiency and adequate loading capacity of zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso zzso a significantly higher amount of zzso was zzso by zzso zzso cells through zzso and zzso zzso Both of the transport ratios across the in zzso zzso model and the zzso of zzso cells after crossing the zzso were significantly greater of zzso than that of zzso In zzso fluorescent image indicated that zzso had high specificity and efficiency in zzso tumor zzso The zzso efficacy of zzso was significantly enhanced in comparison with that of zzso and zzso zzso safety tests showed no acute toxicity to zzso system, liver, zzso heart, lung and zzso in mice after intravenous administration at a dose of 100 zzso blank zzso per day for a zzso zzso these results indicated that zzso developed in this study could be a potential zzso vehicle for brain zzso zzso
