The zzso zzso zzso zzso is the first cloned G zzso zzso Many recent studies on zzso functions have determined that the zzso is involved in the regulation of zzso transformation and tumor progression in multiple zzso However, it is still unclear if the zzso is involved in the regulation of zzso transformation and tumor progression in zzso zzso zzso The purpose of our study was to investigate the expression of the zzso in zzso and to determine its effect on progression to further understand the influence of the zzso on the biological characteristics of zzso Higher expression of zzso was observed in liver tumor zzso compared to normal liver zzso When zzso gene expression was silenced or zzso the proliferation of zzso cells was zzso and tumor cells underwent zzso the cell cycle was arrested and tumor cell invasion and migration were significantly zzso zzso mice zzso with cells zzso expressing low levels of zzso displayed reduced tumor formation rates and reduced tumor zzso In conclusion, zzso is highly expressed in zzso and is involved in zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is a potential target for zzso zzso
