A synthetic zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso region of the cellular human prion protein zzso is useful for in zzso study of zzso zzso cell zzso The aim of the present work was to examine the implication of the cellular prion protein in the toxicity mechanism induced by zzso zzso The effect of zzso zzso was investigated both on human zzso zzso cells and on zzso zzso zzso cellular zzso zzso We show by zzso zzso tests and zzso zzso that zzso expression does not zzso the toxicity of the prion zzso Moreover, we investigated the effect of this zzso on an established non zzso model, rabbit kidney zzso zzso cells that express a zzso zzso zzso zzso We show for the first time that the prion zzso zzso does not exert any toxic effect on this cell line in the presence or absence of zzso Our results show that the zzso zzso cell zzso is independent of zzso zzso Rather, it seems to act via an interaction with zzso components of the plasma membrane as strengthened by our results showing the differential zzso of zzso and non zzso cell lines that significantly differ by their membrane fatty acid zzso
