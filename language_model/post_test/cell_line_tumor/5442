To assist in screening existing drugs for use as potential zzso we used a human unbiased zzso short interfering zzso zzso library targeting the zzso zzso We performed a synthetic protection screen that was designed to identify genes that, when zzso protected human zzso zzso cells from zzso cell zzso We identified 116 candidate protective zzso then identified 10 small zzso zzso of 13 of these candidate gene products and tested their zzso zzso zzso a clinically used second-generation zzso drug, effectively decreased zzso cell death in several cell lines including zzso zzso zzso zzso and normal lung zzso zzso and in primary cultures of zzso zzso significantly increased the survival of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells when zzso before zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso of zzso female mice zzso with 10 zzso zzso survived zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso of zzso controls, P zzso zzso These results demonstrate the power of unbiased zzso synthetic protection screening with a zzso zzso library to identify new zzso
