To understand better zzso zzso we examined promoter zzso zzso and zzso expression of closely related genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso tumor zzso genes in cultured zzso zzso that were derived from zzso adult type, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was zzso silenced in all but one of the 10 zzso zzso lines zzso zzso gene silenced in roughly half of the lines, and zzso was the least frequently zzso zzso zzso of the zzso promoter was seen in six out of 10 zzso zzso zzso patient samples and corresponded with lack of zzso protein expression in the cases zzso Treatment of cultured zzso with the DNA zzso zzso zzso resulted in reversal of the zzso gene zzso However, expression of zzso protein was delayed in relationship to zzso promoter zzso and required up to 3 weeks to occur, seemingly reflecting late zzso of the zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso affects in zzso zzso often zzso several tumor zzso genes that impact on key cell zzso The observed differential zzso of zzso and zzso and to a lesser degree zzso zzso indicates that the zzso is governed by precise, promoter zzso zzso The study provides also further rationale for treatment of at least some types of zzso zzso with DNA zzso zzso to target the zzso silenced tumor zzso zzso
