We and others have demonstrated already that TRAIL zzso zzso zzso is a very promising candidate for molecular targeted zzso therapy, especially when combined with zzso radiation or other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that activate and are specific for the death signaling TRAIL receptors are an alternative method to stimulate the programmed cell death zzso Phase 1 clinical trials have subsequently been conducted and shown a very good zzso of these zzso In order to assess the efficacy of TRAIL zzso stimulation to induce cell death by this alternate method, we studied the combination of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with radiation in zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso after combined treatment with TRAIL zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with 2, 5 or 10 zzso was determined by zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis of zzso and zzso The zzso zzso cell lines Colo zzso zzso 116 and zzso were used for in zzso zzso Growth delay experiments were performed with combined treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso and 3 zzso single zzso and the zzso zzso zzso three different zzso application on days 1, 4 and 8) on Colo 205 zzso zzso zzso nude zzso zzso and zzso induced zzso cell death in a zzso fashion and significantly increased cell death in combination with zzso in zzso when compared to either zzso or zzso treatment zzso The efficacy of the combined treatment seems to be at least partially zzso Similar to the results from cell culture experiments, in zzso experiments demonstrated a zzso delay in zzso growth after combined zzso In zzso in the zzso zzso model, zzso revealed a higher activity than zzso This is the first study to demonstrate significant efficacy of combined treatment with the zzso zzso TRAIL zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso radiation in in zzso and in zzso zzso We zzso that zzso and zzso will be very promising new agents in the field of molecular targeted zzso zzso zzso
