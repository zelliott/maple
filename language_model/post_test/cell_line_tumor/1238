zzso zzso zzso is the major cause of morbidity and mortality after lung zzso The potential role of zzso drugs in the development of zzso is uncertain, but there are limited data indicating that zzso A zzso may have a direct zzso effect on various human cell zzso zzso interactions have been suggested to play a crucial role in the course of zzso which is a major feature of zzso 

We studied the effect of zzso and zzso on primary human lung zzso proliferation in a human zzso interactive zzso 

zzso relevant zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not affect zzso proliferation in zzso zzso medium zzso from zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso CM from zzso zzso zzso zzso cells had no significant additive effect on zzso proliferation compared with CM of zzso zzso zzso In contrast, CM obtained from zzso cells treated with zzso zzso zzso significantly enhanced zzso proliferation compared with CM of zzso zzso zzso This zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso factors greater than 100 zzso 

These data demonstrate that a clinically relevant concentration of zzso stimulates zzso proliferation through zzso produced by airway zzso cells, raising the possibility that zzso may contribute to the development of zzso after lung zzso
