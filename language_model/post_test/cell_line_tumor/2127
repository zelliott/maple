A series of zzso zzso complexes with zzso bearing zzso groups of known protein zzso zzso and related zzso and zzso derivatives have been zzso In addition, the corresponding zzso complexes of the zzso zzso have also been zzso The compounds have been characterized by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso analysis, and by X-ray zzso zzso activity in three human cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso was determined by zzso zzso yielding zzso values of zzso zzso for three zzso zzso zzso whereas values for the metal complexes vary in a broad range from zzso to 140 zzso zzso with zzso of zzso derivatives with zzso or zzso results in a more consistent increase in zzso than zzso with zzso For selected compounds, the capacity to induce zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso and zzso analysis, whereas cell cycle effects are only zzso
