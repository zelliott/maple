The zzso zzso intrinsic to zzso zzso carbon zzso is ideal for biological imaging zzso to the low zzso and deep tissue penetration in the zzso region beyond 1 zzso However, zzso zzso carbon zzso with high quantum yield have been zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso carbon zzso with sodium zzso followed by zzso exchange to form zzso zzso coated zzso produces in zzso imaging agents that are both bright and zzso The exchange procedure is better than directly zzso the tubes with the zzso zzso because it results in less damage to the zzso and improves the quantum zzso We show zzso in zzso imaging using an zzso camera in the zzso zzso spectral range by detecting the intrinsic zzso zzso of the zzso zzso carbon zzso at a low dose (17 zzso zzso injected zzso The deep tissue penetration and low zzso background allowed high-resolution zzso zzso imaging of zzso vessels beneath thick zzso
