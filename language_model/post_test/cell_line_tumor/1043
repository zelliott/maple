To study the zzso effect of two zzso compounds isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso on the proliferation of Human Liver Cancer zzso cell line zzso and its zzso 

zzso of cell proliferation was measured by zzso zzso The zzso changes of zzso cells were observed under zzso zzso zzso fluorescent zzso transmission electron microscope zzso and scanning electron microscope zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to calculate the cell zzso rate, and zzso zzso was used to observe the regulation of gene zzso 

The proliferation of zzso cells was obviously inhibited after being treated with zzso acid at the concentration great than 5 zzso and zzso acid great than 10 zzso The biggest zzso effect was zzso when treated with zzso acid at the concentration of 25 zzso The effect had a linear relationship with zzso The result indicated that zzso cells exhibit typical zzso changes of zzso including condensed zzso and a reduction in zzso zzso peak was found by zzso analysis and the cell cycle was arrested at zzso zzso The zzso rates of the cells treated by zzso acid and zzso acid were zzso and zzso zzso It was zzso by zzso zzso that the drugs zzso the gene expression of zzso gene and zzso that of zzso zzso 

The two zzso compounds isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso acid can obviously inhibit the proliferation of zzso cell line zzso The mechanism is correlated with the induction of cell zzso by zzso the gene expression of zzso gene and zzso that of zzso zzso
