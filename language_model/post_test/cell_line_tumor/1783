zzso in liver cancer zzso a tumor zzso gene in multiple zzso is zzso down regulated or zzso by zzso mechanisms in primary prostate zzso zzso In this study the zzso and zzso profile of the zzso promoter region was examined in three zzso cell lines with low or zzso zzso expression: zzso its zzso zzso and zzso Two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso A zzso induced zzso zzso of the zzso promoter in all three zzso zzso promoter zzso and zzso were detected in zzso and zzso cells while in zzso cells zzso is silenced by zzso Treatment with zzso or zzso efficiently increased zzso expression in all lines, particularly in zzso cells, and activated the zzso promoter through the same zzso zzso The zzso cell line was selected to evaluate the efficacy of combined zzso zzso and zzso treatment on tumor growth in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso exposure reduced the tumor size by zzso compared to controls and in combination almost completely inhibited tumor zzso The zzso effect was associated with the induction of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso alone significantly reduced zzso activity, showing that this zzso is a target for zzso These results, obtained with a reliable zzso in zzso test, predict that combined therapeutic agents targeting the pathways governing zzso function and zzso zzso may be beneficial in management of prostate zzso
