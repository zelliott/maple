One frequent application of zzso experiments is in the study of monitoring gene activities in a cell during cell cycle or cell zzso A new challenge for analyzing the zzso experiments is to identify genes that are statistically significantly periodically expressed during the cell zzso Such a challenge occurs due to the large number of genes that are simultaneously measured, a moderate to small number of zzso per gene taken at different time points, and high levels of zzso random noises inherited in the zzso 

Based on two statistical hypothesis testing methods for identifying periodic time series, a novel statistical zzso approach, the zzso zzso is proposed to effectively screen out statistically significantly periodically expressed zzso The approach is then applied to zzso and bacterial cell cycle gene expression data sets, as well as to human zzso and human cancer cell line data sets, and significantly periodically expressed genes are successfully zzso 

The zzso procedure proposed is an effective method for identifying statistically significant periodic genes in zzso time series gene expression zzso
