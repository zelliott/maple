Resistance to zzso agents is one of the major obstacles in the treatment of zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso the zzso gene product, zzso zzso resistance zzso to zzso cancer zzso In this study, we reversed the resistance to zzso agents in human zzso cancer cells zzso by using the zzso small hairpin interference zzso acid zzso zzso 

zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso that contains the zzso construct targeting zzso zzso zzso acid zzso The zzso of zzso gene expression was assessed by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and the protein level of zzso was determined by Western zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso cancer cells to various zzso agents will be zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was analyzed by flow zzso 

It was shown that zzso zzso zzso reduced the zzso gene expression in zzso cells by zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso showed that zzso expression was significantly and specifically zzso zzso zzso revealed a reverse of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso cancer cells using zzso zzso zzso Increased zzso has been observed in the zzso zzso zzso cells when exposed to zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso can significantly inhibit zzso expression at both zzso and protein zzso zzso of zzso gene expression zzso an increased sensitivity to drug resistance in zzso cancer cells to conventional zzso zzso
