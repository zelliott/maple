Little is known about the role that zzso an zzso zzso family member, plays in solid tumor biology and zzso to zzso zzso We observed that the zzso protein is widely expressed in human zzso cell lines of different zzso origin zzso zzso zzso Because the expression of zzso zzso family proteins can significantly contribute to the zzso of human zzso we used an zzso strategy to address this issue in zzso 

zzso mice zzso zzso zzso received zzso injections of zzso zzso zzso After development of palpable tumors, mice were treated by zzso zzso pumps zzso with saline or zzso or universal control zzso (20 zzso for 2 zzso On days 2, 6, and 10, mice were treated with zzso zzso (35 zzso zzso or saline zzso During the experiments, tumor weight was assessed twice weekly by zzso zzso On day 14, animals were zzso zzso were weighed and fixed in zzso for zzso and terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso specifically reduced zzso protein expression but produced no reduction in tumor weight compared with zzso control zzso zzso zzso caused only modest tumor weight reduction compared with saline zzso However, use of zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso clearly enhanced tumor cell zzso and significantly reduced tumor weight by more than two-thirds compared with respective control zzso 

A combination of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso provides a synergistic zzso effect and might qualify as a promising strategy to overcome zzso in human zzso
