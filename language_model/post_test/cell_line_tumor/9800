Signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso regulates diverse cellular zzso including cell growth, zzso and zzso and is frequently activated during zzso Recently, putative zzso stem cells zzso were isolated and zzso These cells can zzso indefinitely in culture, are highly zzso and retain the ability to differentiate in zzso We have found that treatment of zzso with two chemically distinct small zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso cell proliferation and the formation of new zzso from single zzso zzso zzso of zzso using a short hairpin zzso also zzso zzso proliferation and zzso formation, confirming that these effects are specific to zzso Although zzso zzso can induce zzso in zzso zzso cell lines, this effect was not observed in zzso grown in stem cell zzso zzso of neural stem cell zzso also decrease upon zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is required for maintenance of the zzso characteristics of these zzso zzso even a transient zzso of zzso leads to irreversible growth arrest and zzso of zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso regulates the growth and zzso of zzso and is thus a potential target for cancer stem zzso therapy of zzso zzso
