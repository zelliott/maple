Cancer cells commonly undergo chronic zzso zzso zzso stress, to which the cells have to adapt for survival and zzso We report here that in melanoma cells intrinsic zzso of the zzso stress zzso protein response zzso is, at least in part, caused by increased zzso of protein synthesis driven by zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and promotes proliferation and protects against zzso induced by acute zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso factor 6 zzso signaling of the zzso in melanoma zzso This was associated with decreased zzso of zzso initiation factor zzso zzso and nascent protein synthesis and was zzso by zzso of zzso In line with this, introduction of zzso into zzso led to increases in zzso zzso and protein production and triggered zzso of the zzso Similar to zzso of zzso protein 78 zzso zzso of zzso zzso melanoma cell proliferation and enhanced zzso induced by the pharmacological zzso stress zzso zzso and zzso zzso these results reveal that zzso of adaptation to chronic zzso stress is another mechanism by which zzso zzso of the zzso zzso promotes the zzso of zzso
