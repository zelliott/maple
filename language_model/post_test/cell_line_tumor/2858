To investigate the zzso of nuclear zzso proteins zzso during the differentiation of zzso zzso cells induced by zzso acid zzso differentiation markers were detected by zzso and zzso were selectively extracted and subjected to two-dimensional gel zzso zzso zzso observation demonstrated that the expression of zzso markers was zzso in zzso cells following zzso zzso Meanwhile, 52 zzso (41 of which were zzso changed significantly during zzso zzso four of these zzso were further confirmed by zzso This study suggests that the differentiation of zzso cells was accompanied by the altered expression of zzso markers and zzso The presence of some zzso expressed zzso was related to the proliferation and differentiation of zzso Our results may help to reveal the relationship between zzso and zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso the regulatory principals driving neural cell proliferation and zzso
