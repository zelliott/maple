zzso A zzso and B zzso are zzso zzso that are produced by zzso zzso and have been recently characterized as new zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso derivatives of compound 1 were evaluated together with zzso for their in zzso growth zzso activities in five human and one mouse cancer cell lines in comparison to the reference compound zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso displayed similar growth zzso activities, and these zzso activities were equivalent in cancer cell lines that display certain levels of resistance to zzso stimuli and those that are sensitive to zzso zzso Of the six cancer cell lines under study, the human zzso cancer cell line zzso was the most sensitive to the four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that compounds 1, 2 and 4 displayed zzso rather than zzso growth zzso effects, while compound 3 appeared to have zzso zzso Thus, this study creates a stimulus for further zzso investigations with respect to the zzso activities of compounds belonging to the zzso zzso The observed toxicity does not seem to be affected by the zzso of zzso of the B ring, the presence of a zzso group at zzso or the presence of a zzso ring joining rings A and C in zzso zzso The zzso activity zzso versus zzso of this type of compound could be affected by the chemical zzso present at the zzso groups at zzso and zzso as was observed for the zzso and zzso activities of derivatives 4 and 3, zzso
