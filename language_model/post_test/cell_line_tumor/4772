Both the resistance of tumor cells to zzso and zzso toxicity remain two of the most important problems in the chemotherapy of clinical oral zzso cell zzso zzso Researchers have been seeking a zzso treatment regimen to improve the effect of zzso As potent new zzso drugs, zzso zzso zzso zzso have been reported to be associated with zzso modification and display synergistic activities with some traditional zzso zzso In this study, we evaluated the potential zzso effect of low dose zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso one of the most potent zzso in zzso cell zzso Cell viability and zzso zzso were zzso Compared with either zzso (4 zzso or zzso (2 zzso treated alone, zzso of both drugs zzso zzso zzso and zzso in both zzso and zzso cell zzso Furthermore, diverse zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso C and zzso were involved in the induction of zzso Our results suggest that concurrent treatment with zzso enhances tumor cell sensitivity to zzso doses of zzso This may be regarded as a novel strategy for treatment of zzso
