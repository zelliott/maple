To examine expression of zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso drug resistant cell line zzso and its parental cell line zzso and induction of cells zzso and reversal of drug resistance in zzso after zzso interference zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso gene in cells was detected by zzso zzso the protein expression level of zzso gene was analyzed by zzso zzso zzso cells were treated with zzso and zzso zzso and zzso orange zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed to evaluate the zzso of zzso 

zzso gene zzso expressed by zzso and zzso respectively in cell lines zzso and zzso while fluorescent cells were 59 zzso 5 and 42 zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso After the introduction of zzso into zzso zzso zzso level of zzso gene decreased distinctly from zzso to zzso The zzso cells of control group detected by zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso of zzso group zzso zzso zzso of zzso group zzso zzso zzso of zzso + zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio between zzso + zzso group and zzso group had significant difference zzso zzso zzso and that between zzso + zzso group and zzso group also had significant difference zzso zzso zzso 

Both zzso gene zzso and its protein are zzso in zzso zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso the level of zzso gene expressed in zzso is obviously different compared with that in its parental cell line zzso zzso interference targeted against specific sequences of zzso in zzso cell could significantly reduce the level of zzso zzso transcripts and zzso effectively induce the cells zzso and restore the sensitivity of cell to conventional zzso agents zzso
