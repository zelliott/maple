zzso is a scaffold protein with diverse upstream and downstream zzso zzso and zzso signaling pathways are known zzso of zzso It is amplified and zzso in a variety of human tumors including zzso Here we show a previously zzso role for zzso in zzso zzso Specifically, we found that zzso is zzso with zzso zzso in melanoma cell lines and tumor samples and its expression correlated with zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso and in melanoma cells increased zzso growth by providing zzso cells a survival advantage through zzso of zzso family of zzso zzso Of note, collaboration of zzso with zzso zzso enhanced zzso in zzso and led to an increased vessel density with strong zzso and zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso an zzso switch by zzso zzso and zzso zzso This zzso response was significantly suppressed with the zzso inhibitor zzso These data suggest that zzso signaling zzso collaborate with zzso downstream zzso for zzso an aggressive zzso in zzso Second, we show that zzso signaling axis is zzso and zzso in zzso and melanoma, and thus are acting independent of each zzso Finally, we establish a link between zzso and zzso in melanoma for the first zzso In conclusion, our findings provide evidence that zzso is a novel regulator of tumor zzso in zzso melanoma through regulation of zzso and zzso expressions zzso by zzso zzso
