So far, human zzso with good affinity and specificity for zzso a zzso protein zzso on breast zzso and zzso zzso and thus a promising target for therapy, were very difficult to zzso 

A human zzso zzso was isolated from an immune library derived from breast cancer patients zzso with zzso The zzso zzso reacted with zzso cells in more than zzso of zzso tissue sections of zzso zzso samples, while showing very low zzso with a large panel of zzso zzso By zzso and zzso display, affinity of zzso was increased up to zzso to zzso zzso zzso in serum was improved from below 1 day to more than 4 weeks and was correlated with the zzso tendency of the individual zzso The zzso bound to zzso and zzso zzso cancer cell lines were zzso into the zzso and zzso format resulting in decrease of affinity of one zzso The zzso zzso with the highest affinity were tested in mouse zzso models using zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, the experiments showed no significant decrease in zzso growth or increase in the survival zzso To study the reasons for the failure of the zzso experiments, zzso was zzso in zzso using zzso and zzso target cells, revealing a low zzso possibly due to zzso as detected for zzso zzso 

zzso zzso display starting with immune libraries and followed by affinity maturation is a powerful strategy to generate high affinity human zzso to difficult targets, in this case shown by the creation of a highly specific zzso with zzso affinity to a very small zzso consisting of four zzso zzso Despite these zzso in zzso binding zzso the therapeutic success of this zzso was prevented by the target zzso
