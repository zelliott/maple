We report the isolation and identification of a new zzso named zzso E zzso extracted from a widely used zzso zzso remedy made out of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This new zzso inhibited the growth of zzso zzso cultured in zzso by zzso in the concentration range from 24 to 68 zzso independently of the strain sensitivity to zzso We also showed that this compound was able to decrease zzso with a 50% zzso concentration zzso lower than that of zzso zzso was found to be less toxic than zzso D zzso another zzso zzso from zzso zzso and its zzso on zzso cells was dependent on the cell line, displaying a good selectivity index when tested on zzso zzso In zzso zzso inhibited zzso malaria growth of zzso zzso zzso by 50% at 1 and zzso zzso of body zzso by the oral or zzso routes, zzso The contribution of zzso as a source of zzso molecules needs therefore to be zzso
