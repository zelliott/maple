zzso gene therapy is a promising approach for the treatment of pancreatic zzso We previously reported that radiation enhanced zzso gene expression in pancreatic cancer, suggesting that zzso gene therapy might be more effective in zzso pancreatic cancer zzso In the present study, we compared the zzso efficiency of zzso genes in zzso and zzso cells, and investigated the underlying zzso We used an zzso expressing the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso as a representative gene zzso We established two zzso human pancreatic cancer cell lines using zzso zzso zzso and zzso pancreatic cancer cells were infected with zzso and zzso levels in the cells were zzso In order to investigate the mechanisms responsible for the differences in the zzso efficiency between these cells, we measured expression of the genes zzso zzso infection and zzso The results revealed that zzso levels in zzso cells were significantly lower zzso zzso zzso than those in zzso cells, although there were no significant differences in zzso zzso between zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and the zzso virus and zzso zzso was zzso in zzso cells, and zzso of zzso zzso promoted zzso gene zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso zzso in zzso pancreatic cancer cells could enhance zzso gene zzso
