zzso zzso reduction and zzso zzso reduction convert the zzso zzso zzso to zzso oxygen species zzso or a secondary alcohol zzso that contributes to inducing a severe form of zzso The closely related analogue zzso zzso less zzso but the zzso of its different behavior have not been zzso We developed a zzso model of the human heart and characterized whether zzso exhibited a defective conversion to zzso and secondary alcohol zzso Small zzso samples from cardiac surgery patients were zzso in plasma that contained clinically relevant zzso of zzso or zzso In this model only zzso formed zzso as detected by fluorescent zzso or zzso zzso zzso with zzso systems and zzso laser scanning zzso studies of zzso zzso suggested that zzso could not form zzso because of its zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and the zzso limited zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blocking the zzso mechanism with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso A1 zzso zzso to zzso and increased its conversion to zzso in human zzso zzso zzso also formed approximately zzso less alcohol zzso than zzso but this was caused primarily by its higher zzso and lower zzso values for zzso zzso reduction by zzso of human cardiac zzso Thus, zzso zzso and impaired efficiency of electron addition have separate roles in determining a defective zzso of zzso to zzso or secondary alcohol zzso in the human zzso These results uncover the molecular zzso of the reduced zzso of zzso and serve zzso guidelines to improving zzso zzso
