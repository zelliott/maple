zzso is a key regulator of cell growth and death by controlling cell cycle progression and zzso under conditions of stress such as DNA damage or zzso zzso As these processes are critical for cell function and zzso of tumor development, zzso regulatory pathways are strictly monitored in zzso Recently, it was recognized that zzso zzso including zzso zzso protein zzso and alternate reading frame zzso form the zzso double minute 2 zzso axis in zzso regulatory zzso which increases zzso stability by suppressing the activity of zzso In this work, we show that zzso protein zzso zzso candidate region gene 2 zzso zzso to the zzso under zzso stress, where it interacts with and zzso zzso and zzso cell cycle progression without the involvement of the major upstream zzso regulator, zzso Furthermore, zzso expression of zzso significantly suppressed growth of cancer cells in a zzso animal model via zzso zzso Our data identify zzso as a new member of the zzso axis for zzso zzso zzso direct regulation of zzso by zzso may be a key mechanism and therapeutic target for cell death or growth zzso when zzso pathways are zzso by genetic or zzso modifications of zzso which are the second most common types of genetic change observed in human zzso
