To examine the zzso effect of the combination of zzso the cornerstone of modern chemotherapy for prostate cancer, and zzso a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso applied to the representative zzso human prostate cancer cell line zzso The aim is to analyze if a zzso effect of the combined treatment on cell viability exists and to understand the molecular zzso zzso We first hypothesized an effect of zzso in zzso the function of zzso leading to a longer retention of zzso inside the zzso It may also be possible that zzso could zzso the zzso changes in expression of zzso and zzso zzso leading to a positive balance forward cell zzso 

We used zzso cells either wild type zzso or with acquired resistance to zzso zzso characterized by a higher expression of zzso We studied both zzso and zzso the expression of zzso and zzso receptors at a zzso level and after each treatment, as well as the expression of cell cycle and zzso related zzso 

Cell proliferation data suggested a zzso zzso effect of the combination of zzso plus zzso when given together or with the sequence zzso followed by zzso We did not observe any effect of zzso on zzso in the zzso cell lines, characterized by a higher pump expression than zzso On the other side, we defined a number of key factors involved in the zzso and zzso balance, which regulation, by single drugs and/or by combined treatment, could explain the effect on cell zzso also where there are apparently contradictory zzso 

Our data suggest that combined treatment with zzso and zzso alters the balance of zzso and zzso zzso ultimately leading to zzso of zzso zzso in human prostate cancer cells in zzso irrespective of cells being sensitive or resistant to zzso
