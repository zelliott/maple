There were only 3 multiple myeloma zzso cell lines established in zzso In this study, we succeeded in establishing a novel zzso cell line and analyzed its biological zzso 

zzso cells isolated from the peripheral blood zzso and bone zzso zzso of a patient with advanced zzso zzso light chain zzso were cultured in zzso Cell zzso was analyzed by zzso and zzso zzso zzso by flow zzso and zzso analysis by zzso zzso zzso zzso fluorescent zzso chain reaction zzso was used to detect Epstein - zzso virus zzso zzso 

The established cell line could survive and zzso in the presence of zzso cells or zzso zzso The cells zzso zzso light chain and were negative for zzso The zzso showed typical zzso or plasma cell zzso The zzso zzso of the cells showed the following zzso zzso positive for acid zzso negative for zzso The zzso of the cells was zzso with that of zzso zzso positive for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso negative for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso analysis showed complex zzso zzso of i zzso zzso zzso i zzso i zzso and zzso There was no difference in zzso zzso and zzso between cells from zzso and zzso 

An zzso cell line zzso zzso light chain named zzso was zzso The cells from both zzso and zzso have the same biological zzso
