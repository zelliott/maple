Two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were selected for the zzso evaluations of zzso drugs targeting various human zzso including those of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Both zzso were shown to react with pan cancer zzso which are zzso on the surface of almost all human zzso zzso zzso was shown to react with the zzso zzso of cancer zzso zzso mainly consisting of zzso zzso zzso proteins and zzso generally known as zzso zzso zzso was generated against the zzso domain of human zzso zzso which is also highly expressed on the cancer cell zzso zzso studies were performed to evaluate the efficacy of these two zzso as zzso drugs for treating human zzso High tumor specificity of zzso zzso was demonstrated with zzso zzso studies of various cancer cell lines, as well as normal and zzso tissue zzso These two zzso were shown to induce zzso as well as zzso zzso upon treatment to many cultured cancer zzso zzso zzso growth zzso of tumor cells from several different tissue origins were demonstrated by nude mouse zzso It was further demonstrated that zzso zzso can function as zzso zzso zzso in its biological zzso Efforts were made to generate zzso zzso forms of the zzso zzso Based on the results of these zzso studies, we believe that these two zzso in zzso or humanized forms, can be developed into suitable therapeutic agents for treatment of human zzso as zzso zzso
