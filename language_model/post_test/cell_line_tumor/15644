zzso muscular zzso zzso zzso is caused by zzso in the zzso protein zzso zzso Unlike its severe zzso forms, zzso usually involves slower onset and milder course without defects in the central nervous zzso The lack of viable animal models that closely zzso zzso clinical zzso led us to use zzso interference technology to knock down zzso expression via zzso gene delivery so as to circumvent embryonic zzso Specifically, an zzso viral zzso was used to deliver short hairpin zzso genes to healthy zzso zzso zzso viral zzso expressing a single zzso or two different zzso were injected one time into the hind limb zzso We showed that zzso expression at 10 months zzso was reduced by about 50% with a single zzso and by zzso with the dual zzso zzso zzso injection also reduced zzso zzso and its affinity to zzso by up to zzso and induced zzso pathology, including zzso and central zzso in more than 50% of the zzso at 10 months after zzso These results suggest that the reduction of approximately or more than zzso of the normal level of zzso expression zzso chronic zzso zzso in skeletal zzso Furthermore, the restoration of about zzso of the normal zzso level could be sufficient for zzso therapy to correct the genetic zzso effectively and prevent zzso zzso
