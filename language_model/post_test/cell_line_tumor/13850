The expression of zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso by the Met zzso is elevated in zzso and a variety of zzso Here we show that human zzso cancer cells with high Met expression were more sensitive to the cell zzso and invasion effect of zzso Met zzso by small interfering zzso or zzso resulted in reduced migration in response to zzso The zzso zzso activated by zzso can be blocked by specific zzso of the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso and also the expression of a zzso zzso demonstrating that zzso zzso the zzso signal through zzso and zzso to zzso A significant role for zzso in cell invasion is further supported by the observation that expression of zzso active forms of zzso is sufficient to induce invasive and migratory zzso in zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression and zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso and cellular invasion, whereas it had little effect on zzso suggesting for the first time that zzso zzso by zzso as a key step for zzso invasion and zzso These data suggest that interfering zzso may provide a novel means of controlling tumor cell zzso
