zzso zzso also known as zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed mainly in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso and zzso but its role in tumor zzso is not zzso In this study, we characterized the function of zzso in tumor growth using both zzso knockout and transgenic zzso zzso zzso zzso and melanoma tumor zzso showed reductions in growth and tumor zzso in zzso zzso zzso mice, whereas zzso zzso was not zzso In addition, growth of transgenic pancreatic zzso zzso and zzso zzso was also slower in zzso zzso zzso mice showed high levels of zzso expression in zzso cells of zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso cells lacking zzso showed impaired zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso upon zzso zzso indicating that zzso contributes to the zzso of vascular zzso growth factor zzso In transgenic mice zzso zzso in zzso zzso tumors induced by a zzso chemical skin zzso treatment showed increased growth and zzso Our findings therefore indicate that zzso activity contributes to tumor zzso and zzso
