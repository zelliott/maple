zzso is a common soft tissue zzso Although radiation zzso DNA damage and integrated stress response zzso the sensitivity to zzso radiation differs among zzso and traditional zzso for zzso is not deemed zzso We examined whether administration of an zzso agent enhances zzso of zzso 

zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso were zzso with zzso zzso of zzso and cultured with zzso zzso zzso which is known to induce zzso through zzso zzso of zzso translation initiation factor zzso zzso 

The numbers of cells were reduced after zzso and zzso further reduced them as well as their zzso zzso The levels of zzso zzso were elevated by zzso and administration of zzso zzso cells treated with zzso after zzso were more sensitive to radiation than those treated with zzso prior to zzso 

zzso may serve as a potential zzso agent for enhancing zzso and its efficacy may depend upon the dose used and the timing of its zzso
