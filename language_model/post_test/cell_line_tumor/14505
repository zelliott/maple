zzso is required for zzso maturation and stability of numerous key signaling proteins zzso involved in cell proliferation and zzso Here we describe two novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso demonstrate a differential sensitivity in zzso zzso zzso versus zzso protein zzso These two zzso inhibit proliferation and zzso growth, and abolish in zzso zzso tumor growth in melanoma cells regardless of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein and other zzso clients, such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in cells and zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso induce zzso activity in melanoma cells and are likely to show therapeutic benefit in melanoma patients by zzso targeting multiple zzso
