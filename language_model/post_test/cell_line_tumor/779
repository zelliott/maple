zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso encodes a portal protein that forms a large zzso structure believed to provide the zzso for DNA entry and exit from the zzso Chaperone proteins often facilitate the folding and zzso of such complex zzso In this report, we show that cellular zzso zzso components of the zzso zzso and zzso proteins are zzso in discrete zzso in the nucleus of the infected zzso The zzso viral protein zzso was shown to be necessary to establish these zzso at early times during infection and sufficient to zzso zzso molecules in zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that not only is the portal zzso zzso localized to these sites during infection, but it is also a zzso for zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso has evolved an elegant mechanism for zzso protein quality control at specialized zzso within the zzso
