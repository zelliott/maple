zzso cells zzso express zzso type 1 zzso zzso zzso stimulation with zzso activated zzso and induced the zzso factor zzso A functional zzso zzso is an important requirement for zzso zzso induction as blockade of zzso signaling by zzso reduces both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso stimulation did not activate either zzso or zzso zzso pathways or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, serum removal or blockade of zzso signaling by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and increased zzso induction of zzso This was consistent with a transient increase in zzso zzso and zzso levels following zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso zzso of the zzso zzso factor is zzso regulated through the zzso zzso and reveals several points of signaling zzso between these two important zzso zzso
