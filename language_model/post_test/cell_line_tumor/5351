The functional role of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso has not been previously zzso zzso we demonstrate that forced expression of zzso in zzso zzso cells resulted in increased total cell number as a consequence of increased cell proliferation and zzso zzso expression of zzso enhanced zzso growth and promoted scattered cell zzso with increased cell migration and zzso Moreover, forced expression of zzso increased tumor size in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso depletion of zzso in zzso zzso cells significantly reduced zzso growth and zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso protein by zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso cell viability in zzso and resulted in zzso of zzso zzso zzso We have therefore demonstrated that zzso possesses zzso functions in zzso zzso zzso zzso antagonism of zzso can therefore be considered as a novel therapeutic strategy for zzso zzso
