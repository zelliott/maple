zzso the zzso inhibitor of zzso proteins repeat zzso 3 of zzso inhibitor of zzso proteins zzso represents an innovative strategy for the design of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso were virtually predicted as zzso of the zzso zzso domain by using a previously generated zzso zzso From the methanol leaf extract of zzso zzso an enriched mixture of zzso was obtained showing zzso potential in combination with zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso technique facilitated the structure zzso of three known and two new natural zzso The main constituent and virtual hit, zzso zzso was isolated from the enriched zzso zzso a zzso polarization based binding zzso 3 was identified as zzso zzso zzso with a zzso affinity zzso zzso zzso Further, 3 induced zzso in zzso zzso cells and activated zzso in combination with zzso zzso experiments revealed a major impact of the zzso acid and sugar zzso of 3 on zzso zzso zzso which was zzso zzso To zzso this study zzso 3 as natural, zzso weight zzso zzso inhibitor using a combination of in zzso and zzso zzso zzso
