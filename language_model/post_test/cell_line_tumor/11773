The zzso zzso zzso zzso is increasingly identified as a zzso zzso being associated with pneumonia, among other zzso Despite this increasing clinical problem, the genetic and molecular basis of zzso zzso zzso is quite minimally zzso We now report that strain zzso the first clinical isolate of zzso zzso to be zzso encodes a functional type II protein zzso zzso zzso Indeed, zzso of zzso that contain a zzso in the zzso locus exhibit a loss of at least seven zzso proteins and three zzso zzso Unlike culture zzso from the parental zzso zzso from multiple zzso zzso also failed to induce the zzso zzso and death of zzso cells, a human lung zzso cell zzso zzso of the zzso zzso were also unable to trigger a massive zzso in the host cell's zzso zzso that was associated with zzso zzso In all zzso a zzso zzso zzso behaved as the wild type did, demonstrating that zzso zzso is required for optimal protein zzso and the zzso effects on host zzso The activities that were defined as being zzso dependent in zzso were evident among other respiratory zzso of zzso zzso zzso a similar type of genetic analysis, we found that a second zzso system zzso zzso by the zzso zzso is cryptic under all of the conditions zzso Overall, this study represents the first examination of zzso in zzso zzso and the data obtained indicate that zzso zzso likely plays an important role in zzso zzso zzso
