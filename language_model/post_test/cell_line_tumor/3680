zzso interference technology is a powerful tool for zzso zzso or zzso genes in zzso zzso Here our results showed that zzso silenced its target zzso specifically and effectively in human breast cancer cells, reduced tumor cell proliferation and induced zzso cell zzso Other molecular features modified by zzso included decreased zzso zzso zzso Ras and zzso levels, elevated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels as well as altered expression of other zzso zzso also caused cell cycle arrest at zzso zzso with reduction in zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso displayed in zzso zzso activity and increased therapeutic effectiveness of zzso in zzso zzso Thus, zzso may be a promising zzso drug for the treatment of human breast cancer and other zzso
