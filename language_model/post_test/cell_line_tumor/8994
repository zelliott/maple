Cancer cells in zzso are zzso influenced by an interactive zzso zzso However, identification of drug targets and initial target zzso are usually performed in zzso cell culture zzso The opportunity to design zzso zzso models that zzso at least in part, these zzso zzso when coupled with zzso zzso would enable investigations on the zzso impact of gene function in a model that more closely resembles tumor growth in zzso Here we describe a zzso method to discover cancer gene functions in a zzso zzso tumor zzso model system composed of human zzso colon cancer cells together with zzso zzso zzso zzso cells in this model failed to expand upon zzso depletion of zzso a member of the zzso zzso motor protein zzso In contrast, these cancer cells proved to be more resistant to zzso depletion when grown as a zzso zzso These results suggest that growth of certain cancer cells in zzso versus zzso can unveil differential zzso on specific genes for their zzso Moreover, they zzso that the zzso hanging drop zzso zzso zzso model will enable the discovery, zzso and validation of gene functions in key biological and pathological zzso
