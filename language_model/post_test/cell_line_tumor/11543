zzso for blood levels of zzso zzso zzso performed in prostate cancer zzso measure mostly zzso zzso and do not provide information regarding zzso active zzso which is biologically more zzso Thus, we designed and zzso an zzso zzso zzso sequence labeled with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and coupled it to a zzso modifier designed to improve its plasma zzso In its native state, the agent, zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso and only becomes fluorescent upon zzso by active zzso yielding a significant increase in zzso This zzso is highly selective for zzso relative to a large panel of zzso zzso Active zzso was detected in tumor frozen sections using zzso and this activity was abolished in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso In zzso imaging of zzso mice using zzso molecular zzso demonstrated a significantly higher fluorescent signal in zzso zzso tumors as compared to zzso prostate cancer 3 tumors zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging of tumor sections confirms zzso zzso signal zzso in zzso zzso This is the first report that demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of zzso real time, zzso molecular imaging of zzso zzso activity in prostate zzso
