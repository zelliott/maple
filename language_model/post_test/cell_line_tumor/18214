The zzso of zzso members of the zzso family is commonly associated with the enhanced zzso of zzso zzso There has been great interest in a novel set of agents that are able to mimic the function of the zzso domain by binding to the groove of zzso proteins and initiating the cell death zzso We sought to examine the efficacy of zzso zzso in a spontaneous mouse model of zzso zzso We evaluated the ability of the zzso zzso to zzso target tumor cells while sparing normal zzso In addition, we examined the contributions of zzso and zzso to the sensitivity of tumor cells to the zzso zzso We report here that two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were able to induce zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells in zzso and in zzso zzso that arose from transplantation of primary zzso cells zzso following 7 days of treatment with zzso zzso The long-term benefits of the transient treatment of zzso mice with the zzso zzso however, could not be properly zzso due to the high levels of toxicity we observed in zzso with these zzso zzso expression of either zzso or zzso from zzso tumor cells was able to protect these cells from the zzso induced by these zzso zzso suggesting that they function through other zzso We conclude that while the zzso drugs are effective at inducing cell death of zzso cells in zzso and in zzso their unclear molecular specificity and their ability to kill normal cells may limit their therapeutic uses in zzso
