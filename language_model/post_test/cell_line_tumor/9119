To investigate the effects of insulin on enhancing zzso zzso zzso functions and its mechanisms in the human zzso cancer cell line zzso zzso and human zzso cancer cell line zzso 

The effect of zzso combination treatment on the growth of zzso 109 and zzso cells was evaluated by zzso zzso zzso zzso After insulin treatment or zzso treatment, cell cycle distribution of both cell lines was analyzed by flow zzso Western zzso zzso was used to assess the expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected by flow zzso DNA fragmentation zzso and terminal zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso zzso Moreover, the changes of zzso zzso after insulin zzso were detected by zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso 

We found that insulin enhanced the zzso effect of zzso zzso on cell proliferation when zzso 109 cells and zzso cells were zzso with insulin for the appropriate zzso zzso increased the cell number of the S phase and the zzso of zzso zzso treatment enhanced zzso of tumor cells and zzso the expression of zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso Moreover, zzso treatment induced the changes of free zzso and the zzso zzso complex level compared with zzso treatment in zzso 109 and zzso zzso 

These data suggest that insulin enhances zzso functions of zzso zzso when it is treated before zzso for the appropriate time in human zzso and zzso cancer cell zzso
