zzso cell zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso plays a role in cell zzso and zzso in a number of human zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in many cellular events, such as cell cycle zzso cell zzso and differentiation through zzso zzso zzso It has been reported that zzso of zzso zzso zzso and that zzso zzso and zzso zzso however, the underlying mechanisms for the two phenomena are not clear zzso Here, we showed that zzso 1 zzso zzso which is required for zzso zzso by zzso First, we found expression of zzso and zzso were positively correlated and associated with poor survival in human breast zzso We then showed that zzso could zzso zzso at two consensus zzso zzso 92 and zzso which is required for the association of zzso and zzso resulting in stabilization of zzso Moreover, zzso is also required for the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso Based on this newly identified mechanism of zzso stabilization, two strategies were used to overcome zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso an approved clinical zzso drug, or knocking down zzso by using a zzso zzso In conclusion, the current report not only zzso a novel mechanism to link zzso zzso and zzso zzso but also provides a plausible combination therapy, zzso zzso plus zzso which was shown to be effective in killing breast cancer zzso
