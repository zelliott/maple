A zzso zzso can be induced in benign rat zzso cells zzso 37 zzso by zzso them with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso increases the level of the zzso zzso zzso zzso picked zzso cell lines have been established from the pool of zzso 37 cells zzso with one zzso DNA, zzso In these cell lines, moderate correlation is observed between the copy number of zzso and their zzso potential zzso zzso zzso zzso A very close correlation is observed between the cell zzso zzso potential in zzso and the zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso but not with another zzso protein in this system, zzso zzso A close correlation is also observed between zzso zzso levels and the adhesive potential zzso of the cells, but not with their growth rate in zzso zzso These observations support the previous suggestion that zzso is the direct zzso of zzso and that the presence of zzso is necessary, if not zzso for the induction of zzso in zzso in this zzso Additionally, these results suggest that zzso 37 cells with increased zzso zzso levels become zzso not through an increased growth rate, but through an increase in cellular zzso
