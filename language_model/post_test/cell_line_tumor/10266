zzso tumors occur within the jaw bones and may be derived from zzso zzso or zzso or contain active components of both tissue zzso We investigated the gene expression profile of zzso zzso proteins zzso genes related to zzso and the zzso process in zzso tumor cell populations focusing on an zzso zzso a zzso zzso tumor zzso and a zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso All cell populations were shown to be zzso in origin by zzso zzso All tested zzso were expressed by all zzso tumor cell types, with higher transcript levels seen in the zzso population especially for zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell populations showed a greater content of zzso cells as well as higher zzso zzso zzso Using zzso we found a higher expression of 8 genes in the zzso compared to the zzso and zzso In this study we demonstrated the establishment of zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso The unique gene expression profiles of zzso zzso and zzso cells and their interactions with the surrounding zzso may support their unique tumor development, zzso and zzso
