Epstein - zzso virus zzso zzso is suggested to have an important role in the zzso and development of zzso zzso zzso Our previous study showed that zzso exhibited growth zzso of zzso in animal zzso Here, we further explore whether zzso is involved in zzso zzso effects in zzso cell zzso 

Both the stable expressing zzso cell line zzso and its parental cell line zzso without zzso expression were used as in zzso models to assess zzso zzso zzso Both cell lines were treated with zzso for 72 zzso The median zzso concentration zzso was assessed by the zzso zzso zzso was observed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso lengths was detected by Southern zzso 

zzso for zzso in zzso cells and zzso cells was zzso and zzso zzso zzso After exposure to 2 and 4 zzso zzso for 72 zzso the zzso index in zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso On the contrary, in zzso cells the zzso index was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso As compared with parental cell line zzso zzso cells were more sensitive to growth zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso length was also found in zzso zzso Meanwhile, longer zzso in zzso cells failed to maintain zzso stabilization, instead, it prone to be shortened when exposure to zzso as comparing with zzso zzso 

zzso plays important role in enhancing zzso cell response to zzso The zzso of zzso length induced by zzso may contribute to the mechanisms of zzso zzso
