zzso promotes the proliferation of human breast zzso cells by interacting with the zzso zzso zzso zzso responses of cells to zzso are regulated in part by degradation of the zzso Previous studies revealed that zzso binds directly to the zzso thereby enhancing its zzso zzso with these findings, zzso zzso zzso dramatically reduced the number of zzso in zzso human breast zzso zzso Here we investigated the molecular mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso pathway, prevented the zzso zzso zzso from reducing the amount of zzso in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso afforded no zzso Moreover, zzso enhanced zzso zzso A point zzso zzso construct that is unable to bind zzso termed zzso is zzso to a greater extent than wild type zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso associated with and promoted the degradation of zzso The possible convergence of zzso and zzso on zzso degradation was zzso zzso bound zzso with higher affinity than that of wild type zzso Moreover, zzso attenuated the in zzso interaction between zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso zzso our data reveal that zzso is a component of zzso degradation via the zzso zzso and that zzso zzso this degradation zzso These results have potential implications for the development of selectively targeted therapeutic agents for breast zzso
