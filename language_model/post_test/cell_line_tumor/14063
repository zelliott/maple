In cancer the zzso spread of tumor cells leads to the formation of secondary tumors at distant zzso zzso the zzso of tumor cells is a prerequisite step during zzso zzso In regard to the fate of zzso cells located at the site of tumor cell zzso tumor zzso interactions were analyzed using an in zzso real-time zzso This model shows the complete sequence of the zzso process and gave new insights into the complex and dynamic zzso and zzso interactions which occur during tumor cell zzso across the zzso zzso An in zzso real-time zzso zzso permits the distinction between zzso cell death from zzso cell zzso This model indicates that zzso of tumor cell clusters derived from the invasive human zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso damages the zzso cells by inducing zzso at the site of tumor cell zzso It is zzso here that zzso induction zzso the removal of detached zzso cells, thereby zzso a local inflammatory response which might be zzso to zzso tumor zzso
