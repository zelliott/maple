Aurora A zzso is zzso in the majority of breast zzso A chemical genetic approach was used to identify the zzso targets of Aurora A, which revealed zzso domain protein zzso as an Aurora A zzso zzso zzso is a powerful zzso predictor for breast zzso which was confirmed in our zzso We further show that zzso of zzso is associated with zzso zzso zzso expression in breast zzso Aurora A directly zzso zzso leading to its zzso zzso also zzso regulates Aurora A, thereby triggering a feedback zzso We demonstrate the underlying mechanisms by which zzso zzso strongly zzso zzso zzso zzso thereby revealing zzso degradation as a key mechanism by which Aurora A promotes breast zzso Thus, not surprisingly, zzso zzso acts zzso with Aurora A zzso in promoting cell zzso zzso zzso might therefore be an alternative method to zzso Aurora A deregulation in breast zzso Finally, this study led to the discovery of a zzso in the Aurora A active site that renders it amenable to the chemical genetic zzso Similar zzso are required for Aurora B, suggesting that this modified approach can be extended to other zzso that have zzso not been amenable to this zzso
