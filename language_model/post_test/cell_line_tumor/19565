zzso receptors are zzso zzso factors whose activity is modulated either by zzso or by an alternative zzso zzso zzso receptors interact via a specific zzso domain, the zzso responsive element zzso in the promoter region of sensitive zzso This binding leads to an initiation of gene expression and hormonal zzso 

To determine the zzso activity of the zzso zzso we developed a molecular imaging system using sodium zzso zzso zzso as a reporter zzso 

The zzso reporter gene was placed under the control of an artificial zzso derived from zzso and named as zzso zzso was transferred to zzso human breast cancer cells, which highly expressed zzso zzso with zzso zzso expressing cells were generated by selection with zzso for 14 zzso After treatment of zzso and tamoxifen with serial doses, the zzso zzso was measured for the determination of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso activity was performed with 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso treated with zzso accumulated zzso up to zzso higher than did zzso zzso zzso expression was increased according to increasing doses of zzso zzso treated with tamoxifen also accumulated zzso up to 50% higher than did zzso zzso zzso zzso completely inhibited zzso zzso When zzso cells, the zzso zzso breast cancer cells, were zzso with zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not zzso 

This zzso reporter system is sufficiently sensitive for monitoring zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter systems with zzso will be zzso to the development of a novel selective zzso zzso zzso with low toxicity and high zzso
