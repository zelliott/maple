Recent technical progress in the field of cancer zzso cell research revealed that these zzso cells may provide critical roles for primary tumor growth, zzso at distant zzso and zzso treatment resistance, and disease zzso The precise molecular zzso events that frequently occur in cancer zzso cells and their early zzso during the early and late stages of cancer progression as well as their contribution to the treatment resistance and disease recurrence remain poorly zzso This lack of information on the zzso gene products that may be involved in the zzso transformation of zzso adult zzso cells into highly zzso and/or zzso cancer zzso cells emphasizes the urgent need to perform future zzso Toward this direction, we describe in this book chapter the characterization of zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells from well-established cell lines by zzso side population zzso This novel approach should help to establish novel in zzso and in zzso models of human cancer zzso cell mimicking more closely the genetic and zzso changes occurring during the different stages of prostate zzso and disease progression in clinical zzso Of therapeutic interest, the identification of new zzso and molecular targets specific to these zzso zzso cells should also help to develop more effective diagnostic and zzso tests and zzso and therapeutic treatments for the patients diagnosed at early and late stages of disease zzso
