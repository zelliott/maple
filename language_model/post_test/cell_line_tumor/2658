zzso and signaling via zzso zzso zzso is a key feature of solid tumors and is related to tumor progression as well as treatment zzso Although it is generally accepted that zzso provokes tumor cell survival and zzso zzso under zzso zzso mechanisms operate as zzso We present evidence that zzso medium obtained from zzso cells, incubated for 24 h under zzso protected zzso zzso cells from zzso cell zzso zzso extracts generated from zzso medium still rescued cells from zzso induced by zzso Specifically, the zzso zzso zzso zzso not only was essential for cell viability of zzso cells but also protected cells from zzso We noticed an increase in zzso zzso 2 zzso protein level and zzso activity under zzso which correlated with the release of zzso into the zzso zzso of zzso using specific small interfering zzso relieved zzso of zzso cells under zzso and zzso medium obtained from zzso zzso cells was only partially zzso zzso of zzso medium with zzso a zzso zzso reduced protection of zzso zzso with the further notion that zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso or zzso survival signaling downstream of zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso activates zzso to promote the synthesis and release of zzso which in turn binds to zzso zzso thus zzso zzso zzso protein zzso to convey zzso or zzso protection of zzso zzso
