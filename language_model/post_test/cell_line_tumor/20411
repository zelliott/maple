zzso based on zzso virus zzso 2 zzso belong to today's most promising and most frequently used viral zzso in human gene zzso Like in many other zzso systems, the broad but zzso zzso limits their use for certain cell types or zzso One approach to screen for zzso zzso is the selection of random zzso libraries displayed directly on the zzso zzso Although the zzso library system has been widely applied for the successful selection of improved gene therapy zzso it remains unknown which steps of the zzso process are most affected and therefore critical for the selection of targeting zzso zzso to the cell surface is the first essential step of zzso gene zzso however, our experiments challenge the conventional belief that enhanced gene transfer is equivalent to more efficient cell binding of zzso zzso zzso A comparison of the various steps of gene transfer by zzso carrying a zzso zzso zzso or displaying two exemplary zzso zzso selected from zzso random libraries on different human zzso cell lines demonstrated strong zzso in cell zzso cellular zzso as well as zzso processing of these zzso zzso our results suggest that entry and zzso events are decisive for the selection of the peptides zzso and zzso rather than their cell binding zzso
