Side population zzso cells have been isolated from several solid zzso They lack distinct molecular markers for cancer stem cells zzso and increasing evidence suggests that they may play an important role in zzso and cancer zzso However, there are no reports about the existence and function of SP cells in zzso zzso zzso cells thus zzso In this study, we scanned SP cells from five zzso cell lines and investigated stem cell zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso using SP cells from the zzso zzso zzso cell zzso We observed a strong zzso ability of SP cells following in zzso transplantation into zzso zzso combined zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso 19 was highly expressed on SP zzso SP cells were found to be more resistant to chemotherapy and zzso and this was related to the zzso cassette half zzso member 2 of G family protein and zzso protein zzso zzso Our results not only showed that SP cells in human zzso cell line zzso had stem cell characteristics in zzso but also showed that they had a strong ability to form tumors in zzso zzso we found the cell marker, zzso 19, may serve as a potential molecular marker for further characterization of zzso Taken together, our data shed light on zzso and zzso mechanisms, which are helpful for developing novel targets for effective clinical treatment of zzso
