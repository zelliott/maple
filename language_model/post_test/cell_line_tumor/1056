zzso are zzso zzso proteins with diverse but poorly understood zzso Here, we show that during cell cycle progression zzso 11 zzso from the nucleus to the zzso poles in zzso and to the zzso zzso in zzso zzso 11 is recruited to the zzso in late zzso where it forms part of the zzso zzso that also contains zzso To investigate the significance of these zzso we used zzso interference to zzso cells of zzso zzso A combination of zzso and video zzso zzso revealed that cells lacking zzso 11 fail to establish a functional zzso Instead, daughter cells remain connected by zzso bridges that contain bundled zzso and zzso zzso but exclude normal zzso components such as zzso and Aurora zzso zzso zzso cells failed to complete zzso and died by zzso These findings demonstrate an essential role for zzso 11 in the terminal phase of zzso
