We attempted to determine whether the combined regimen of zzso zzso and zzso therapy would favorably affect the survival of animals bearing liver zzso of colon cancer zzso Daily zzso therapy with zzso zzso 75 zzso was initiated at 3 days following zzso cell zzso of zzso colon cancer zzso zzso with 7 zzso of zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso an irrelevant zzso was conducted at 7 zzso zzso of vascular zzso growth factor zzso by zzso cells was assessed in zzso All zzso mice died by 31 days following cell zzso ( zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment resulted in slightly better survival of mice ( zzso ( zzso zzso zzso displayed a marked therapeutic effect ( zzso ( zzso however, all animals eventually died due to zzso by 99 zzso The combined regimen of zzso zzso and zzso therapy demonstrated a superior therapeutic effect in comparison to zzso consisting of either zzso or zzso therapy ( zzso ( zzso three mice survived the entire zzso observation zzso The combination of zzso therapy and zzso zzso failed to provide an appreciable benefit ( zzso Treatment with zzso decreased zzso production by zzso cells in a zzso zzso In conclusion, a combination regimen zzso zzso and zzso therapy initiated at the early stage of zzso would be of great benefit in terms of improvement of the therapeutic efficacy with respect to liver zzso
