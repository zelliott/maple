Current experimental and clinical knowledge supports the zzso of zzso cell targeting using a strategy combining zzso drugs with zzso zzso The purpose of the present study was to examine the effects of the association of zzso an zzso zzso agent, with zzso and zzso on the growth of six head and neck human cancer cell lines zzso in nude mice and to study zzso and molecular factors responsible for zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines were the most sensitive to zzso treatment, with zzso levels significantly higher zzso in these zzso zzso compared to Detroit zzso and zzso cell lines with relatively low zzso levels that were not sensitive to zzso In contrast, neither zzso levels nor zzso expression was linked to the zzso effects of zzso zzso in combination with zzso resulted in a synergistic zzso interaction with greater zzso effects than zzso zzso The synergistic interaction between zzso and zzso was zzso by a significant decrease in zzso zzso The present study may serve for future innovative clinical applications, as it suggests that zzso zzso levels are possible zzso for zzso zzso zzso It also supports the notion of zzso zzso when combining zzso and zzso and identifies zzso as the main zzso of this synergistic zzso
