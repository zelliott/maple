zzso in zzso zzso zzso cause familial zzso lateral sclerosis zzso a neurodegenerative disease resulting from motor zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that wild type zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso modification that can regulate protein structure, function, and zzso zzso zzso was confirmed by multiple techniques, including zzso exchange, click chemistry, zzso zzso and mass zzso Mass zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso 6 was the primary site of zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was significantly increased relative to that of zzso expressed in zzso cells and a motor zzso cell zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was also increased relative to that of zzso when zzso from transgenic mouse spinal zzso We found that the level of zzso zzso correlated with the level of zzso zzso suggesting a role for zzso in targeting zzso to zzso We further observed that zzso occurred predominantly on zzso as opposed to zzso zzso suggesting that immature zzso is the primarily zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso bonding and maturation with increased copper zzso for zzso expression caused a decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso less than zzso and had little effect on zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso occurs prior to zzso bonding during zzso maturation and that zzso is increased when zzso bonding is delayed or decreased as observed for several zzso
