The zzso zzso a newly identified member of the zzso zzso family that provides zzso for DNA damage repair, is directly regulated by zzso We show that zzso is also regulated by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Increased zzso zzso by serum stimulation coincided with an increase in the zzso activity in zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso activity, either by treatment with a zzso inhibitor or by zzso with zzso zzso dramatically decreased the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso but not zzso zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso activity, indicating that zzso is specifically regulated by a zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that the zzso segment zzso zzso acids zzso is critical for zzso interaction, and the binding domain of zzso is required for zzso increased zzso zzso zzso of zzso was greatly zzso by zzso radiation, and zzso activity was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was markedly attenuated by zzso of zzso or zzso zzso but not zzso zzso These data show that zzso is an zzso regulator of zzso and suggest that zzso may associate with zzso and zzso its zzso
