zzso DNA zzso followed by zzso sequencing zzso has the potential to identify changes in DNA zzso important in cancer zzso In order to understand the role of zzso zzso in the development of acute zzso leukemia zzso we have applied zzso to the DNA of 12 zzso patients and 4 normal bone zzso This analysis revealed zzso zzso zzso regions that included gene zzso gene bodies, zzso islands and zzso island zzso Two genes zzso and zzso with significantly zzso promoters were of interest and further analysis of their expression showed them to be zzso in zzso We also demonstrated considerable zzso zzso specificity in the zzso affecting different zzso zzso zzso distinct patterns of zzso of certain zzso repeat elements were associated with zzso zzso The zzso patterns of members of the zzso family tightly clustered all zzso patients with an enrichment of zzso repeats with a high zzso density ( zzso We were able to demonstrate significant inverse correlation between zzso zzso repeat sequence zzso and gene expression with zzso showing the strongest inverse correlation zzso zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso in DNA zzso that accompany the development of zzso affect not only the zzso but also the zzso zzso features, with significant zzso of certain zzso repeat DNA elements being associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso data were validated using zzso zzso and the zzso zzso
