zzso zzso are important in controlling zzso zzso However, the exact role in human gallbladder zzso has not yet been zzso 

zzso gallbladder zzso zzso cell lines zzso were zzso with zzso small interfering zzso zzso zzso migration, invasion zzso and drug zzso tests were zzso Next, zzso zzso expression was analyzed by zzso zzso chip zzso zzso and zzso zzso target gene expressions were also analyzed using tissue zzso zzso in 44 zzso zzso 

Treatment with zzso zzso decreased cell zzso migration, and zzso On the other hand, those cells increased zzso of zzso By performing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were shown to be highly zzso in cells treated with zzso zzso zzso When focusing on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was found to be a target of zzso In the zzso zzso zzso was significantly associated with the depth of invasion and zzso index zzso zzso zzso zzso Survival of patients with a high zzso zzso was longer than that of patients with a low zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our result suggested that zzso and zzso may contribute to the role of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso are favorable zzso of zzso
