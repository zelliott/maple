The design and synthesis of a library of novel families of zzso and zzso derivatives is zzso The library was composed of 44 zzso derivatives (11 of these compounds had a zzso zzso and 22 zzso zzso The synthetic procedure involved a zzso sequence carried out in solution, along with the use of zzso linked zzso and zzso zzso for the rapid removal of the excess of zzso zzso A final zzso step performed under mild conditions led to the charged zzso zzso zzso of this library in two biological zzso identified active compounds that inhibit the activity of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso resistance zzso Thus, this synthetic sequence represents a facile and convenient entry to unprecedented libraries of this sort of zzso derivatives that may be of use for identification of novel scaffolds of diverse biological zzso
