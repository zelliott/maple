zzso zzso exposure is recognized as a major risk factor for the development of breast zzso While the initial events in the regulation of gene expression by zzso have been described in detail, far less is known of the role of zzso in the long-term regulation of gene zzso In this study, we investigated the effects of long-term exposure of zzso breast cancer cells to zzso zzso on gene expression with the goal of distinguishing between gene expression that is continually zzso on zzso zzso zzso function as opposed to secondary and persistent effects that are downstream of zzso To assess the direct involvement of zzso in the differential gene expression of long-term zzso exposed zzso cells in comparison with that of control cells, we exposed cultures to the selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that exposure to zzso inhibited expression of numerous characterized zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso Genes that were increased in expression in zzso cells yet were unaffected by zzso exposure included the zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso and numerous other genes that were not previously reported to be regulated by zzso zzso regulation was evident for the zzso zzso zzso transcript levels remained elevated for several cell passages after the removal of zzso Signal zzso and zzso of zzso 1 zzso zzso genes including zzso zzso and zzso and zzso class I genes were also zzso in zzso cells and were unaffected by zzso zzso zzso is commonly zzso in breast and other zzso and is associated with increased resistance to radiation and zzso This is the first study to relate zzso exposure to increased zzso expression in breast cancer cells, an effect that may represent an additional role of zzso in the zzso of breast zzso
