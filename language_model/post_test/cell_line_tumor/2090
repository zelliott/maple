To explore the effects of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso gene expression on the proliferation and zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso Human zzso cells, zzso cells, were divided into four groups: zzso zzso intervention group, control zzso intervention group, empty zzso group and blank control zzso zzso zzso was zzso into zzso cells by zzso The expression of zzso zzso and protein was detected at 48 hours after zzso by zzso and Western zzso zzso Cell proliferation zzso was measured by Cell Counting zzso zzso The zzso was detected by zzso double zzso and flow zzso zzso method adopted one-way zzso between each group overall zzso 

The zzso cells were zzso by zzso zzso successfully with zzso zzso analysis showed that the expression of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso intervention group was significantly decreased as compared to the control zzso intervention group, empty zzso group and blank control group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso F zzso zzso P zzso zzso Similar results were obtained for protein expression as revealed by Western zzso analysis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso F zzso zzso P zzso zzso The proliferation zzso rate in the zzso zzso intervention group zzso was higher than that in the blank control group zzso control zzso intervention group zzso and empty zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The results of zzso and flow zzso showed that ratio of zzso positive cells was highest in the zzso zzso intervention group zzso which was zzso zzso zzso in the empty zzso group, blank control group, control zzso intervention group, respectively zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso zzso can zzso the expression of zzso gene in zzso cells inhibited the cell proliferation and induced their zzso
