zzso both the role of tumor zzso in zzso cell differentiation and the reasons that zzso cells may work zzso is crucial for therapeutic approaches in zzso We studied zzso zzso cell responses in zzso in a differential zzso model that used zzso the zzso zzso zzso with zzso On their initial zzso encounter, zzso zzso cells underwent programmed expansion in the zzso zzso where they acquired the ability to migrate to the zzso tumor site after zzso or zzso zzso without continuous zzso zzso This short zzso stimulation was sufficient to induce the migration differentiation program, which included zzso of zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso of zzso Moreover, zzso quantity determined the behavior of the zzso zzso cells, including their zzso functions and sensitivity to zzso Thus, the initial zzso encounter drives the programmed cell migration zzso but neither zzso functions nor cell death can occur without continuous zzso zzso
