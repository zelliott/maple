zzso Breast cancer resistance protein zzso zzso is a drug zzso zzso that is believed to affect the drug disposition of several drugs and zzso In the present study, we evaluated the zzso and functional expression of zzso in the human zzso cell line zzso an in zzso model of the human zzso and compared it with the expression of zzso zzso zzso as the most widely studied zzso zzso In addition, the expression of zzso at the zzso level was compared with that of zzso in the human term zzso zzso Western zzso analysis revealed high zzso expression of zzso protein in zzso zzso Using indirect zzso zzso we found that the zzso zzso appears to be localized predominantly at the zzso plasma zzso zzso studies showed a significant effect of the zzso zzso zzso (5 zzso and zzso (1 zzso on zzso zzso and, thus, confirmed zzso activity of zzso in zzso zzso zzso Using absolute zzso zzso with real-time reverse zzso chain reaction, we found high expression of zzso in zzso cells, whereas no transcript of zzso zzso the most extensively studied drug zzso was zzso zzso In the human zzso zzso was localized predominantly in the zzso zzso however, zzso for the zzso zzso was also observed in fetal vessels of the zzso zzso The number of zzso transcripts in the human term zzso was found to be more than zzso higher compared with the expression of zzso zzso In conclusion, we suggest that zzso cells could serve as a suitable in zzso model to study zzso transport of zzso zzso and that zzso zzso can play an important role in preventing the zzso of potentially toxic zzso in the zzso zzso
