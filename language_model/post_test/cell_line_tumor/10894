zzso evidence has accumulated in recent years to suggest that the cell membrane forms the vital common target for action by zzso radiation and zzso The present work describes the use of electric zzso for enhancement of zzso zzso of cancer cells both in zzso and in zzso In zzso low dose rate zzso zzso zzso zzso (2 zzso in combination with electric zzso of square wave (2 zzso 200 zzso zzso 8 zzso 10 zzso significantly enhanced the zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells zzso probably through enhanced production of zzso zzso oxygen species zzso The zzso generation of zzso and changes in zzso zzso membrane fluidity were determined by zzso using zzso and zzso respectively, as zzso Both radiation and zzso zzso have been observed to produce zzso in a zzso zzso We show that the combined treatment of cells with radiation and zzso significantly increased zzso zzso and changed membrane fluidity of zzso cells as compared to the effects by each individual zzso In zzso studies have been carried out with zzso zzso as a model zzso The localized treatment of a zzso zzso grown in the right hind leg of Swiss mice, had been carried out using radiation zzso zzso 2 zzso dose rate: zzso zzso and electric zzso (1 zzso 200 zzso 8 zzso 10 zzso Studies on tumor growth zzso have shown a significant growth delay (by 50% to that of zzso 7 days after treatment of tumor with radiation and zzso The results suggest that zzso of tumor cells in zzso as well as in zzso were enhanced significantly by electric zzso which may offer a potentially improved treatment of zzso
