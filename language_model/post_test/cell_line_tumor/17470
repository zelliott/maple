zzso zzso is a zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso T cells, zzso cells, and vascular smooth muscle zzso It contributes to zzso zzso and cellular zzso It also mediates zzso zzso zzso and plays important roles in zzso zzso zzso and zzso These properties are also characteristics of zzso cancer zzso zzso the zzso gene was found to be zzso among various zzso cancer zzso This suggests that zzso is involved in tumor zzso How the zzso gene is zzso in zzso cancer cells remains to be zzso Thus, we investigated the zzso zzso of the zzso promoter in the human zzso cancer cell line zzso We cloned the zzso promoter, and serial deletion analysis of the zzso promoter showed that the region between zzso and zzso may act as an zzso to control the zzso gene in zzso tumor zzso This region was found to contain overlapped zzso and zzso binding site zzso zzso zzso using the zzso nuclear extract and zzso or zzso zzso binding protein zzso zzso protein indicated that these two zzso factors can bind to the overlapped zzso zzso binding site motifs on the zzso regulatory sequence from zzso to zzso Surprisingly, the zzso experiments did not show zzso complex formation between zzso and zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso was more potent than the complex of zzso and its zzso zzso to zzso the zzso zzso In addition, zzso and zzso did not exhibit zzso zzso or zzso Our results suggest that zzso and zzso play an important role in the zzso of the zzso gene in zzso tumor zzso
