Many zzso human tumors, including zzso are zzso for zzso due to reduced expression of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which degrades zzso zzso resulting in zzso zzso has shown favorable results in clinical trials for treating zzso zzso Drug resistance is the major obstacle for effective zzso zzso To zzso mechanisms of resistance, we established several zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso melanoma zzso Compared with the parental lines, these zzso zzso showed the following zzso zzso all zzso cell lines showed elevated zzso zzso resulting from the zzso binding of the zzso factor zzso on the zzso promoter, suggesting that elevated zzso is the major mechanism of zzso zzso the zzso cell lines exhibited enhanced zzso signaling and were zzso sensitive to zzso zzso but reduced zzso zzso and were zzso resistant to zzso zzso zzso these zzso showed enhanced expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso reduced expression of zzso zzso and elevated sensitivity to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso consistent with the enhanced zzso zzso (the Warburg zzso zzso the resistant cells showed higher zzso zzso and zzso expression and were zzso vulnerable to zzso zzso We showed that zzso not elevated zzso zzso is involved in zzso of many of these zzso because zzso of zzso reduced their zzso whereas zzso zzso by zzso reduced their zzso This study identified multiple targets for overcoming zzso resistance in cancer chemotherapy using zzso zzso zzso
