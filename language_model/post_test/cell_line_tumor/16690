The zzso of zzso growth factor zzso through its zzso zzso is one of the major mechanisms that mediate zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso a natural zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso has shown zzso effects in a variety of zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso zzso migration and invasion of zzso cells is not zzso Here, we evaluated the potential roles of zzso signaling cascade that affects zzso zzso and also investigated the zzso effect of zzso on the zzso zzso migration and invasion abilities of zzso zzso Our data indicated that zzso inhibited migration and invasion of zzso cells in a zzso manner via blocking the zzso zzso especially in the zzso highly expressing zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso of zzso and its downstream molecules zzso but did not affect zzso of other downstream zzso zzso and zzso in human zzso cell zzso Moreover, our data suggested that zzso significantly reduced the zzso expression and its activity that was promoted by the zzso zzso and also suppressed zzso migration and invasion abilities of zzso zzso Taken together, this study clearly demonstrated that zzso inhibited zzso induced migration and invasion of zzso cells via blockade of zzso zzso Thus, we suggest that zzso could be used as a potential effective drug for the zzso of zzso zzso
