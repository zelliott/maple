zzso in zzso analyses of treatment responses are an important prerequisite to evaluate new zzso zzso in zzso imaging in the far red zzso zzso red zzso is a promising method, as it enables zzso at different time points in individual animals, thereby reducing the number of animals required, while increasing statistical zzso Here, we show the establishment of a method to monitor response to treatment using fluorescent cells, expressing the zzso growth factor zzso zzso a target already used in zzso 

We zzso zzso zzso cells with the far zzso protein zzso zzso resulting in strong zzso allowing for the monitoring of zzso growth when implanted in zzso zzso mice with a zzso zzso in zzso zzso We targeted zzso cells with a previously reported zzso zzso consisting of the zzso zzso zzso variable zzso zzso zzso fused to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso expression was verified using the zzso zzso to a zzso dye zzso through a zzso zzso 

The results show the feasibility to evaluate response to treatment in zzso by zzso imaging, while at the same location detecting zzso zzso Treatment with zzso resulted in zzso zzso growth, while not affecting the overall health of the zzso This is in contrast to treatment with zzso which, although decreasing the zzso size, resulted in poor zzso 

We developed a novel method to zzso determine treatment responses by in zzso imaging of multiple parameters which showed the efficacy of zzso
