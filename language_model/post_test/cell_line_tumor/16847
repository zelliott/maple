It has been recently proposed that zzso protein zzso zzso might indirectly promote the zzso of zzso zzso II regulatory light zzso at zzso to regulate the transition from zzso to zzso and the completion of zzso Although these findings provide zzso support for our earlier observations showing that the active form of the zzso zzso zzso zzso associates zzso with essential zzso regulators, several important issues remained zzso Does zzso zzso alter the ability of zzso to bind to the zzso apparatus and travel from zzso to the zzso zzso during zzso and zzso Does zzso activate zzso exclusively at the zzso zzso during zzso What is the zzso stimulus that activates the zzso zzso axis regardless of energy zzso First, we confirm that zzso zzso deprivation fails to alter the previously described distribution of zzso in all of the zzso zzso and does not disrupt its apparent association with the zzso zzso and other structures involved in cell zzso Second, we establish for the first time that zzso zzso exclusively with zzso zzso at the zzso zzso of dividing cells, a previously zzso interaction between zzso and zzso that occurs in zzso zzso zzso bridges and the zzso during cell division that appears to occur irrespective of zzso zzso Third, we reveal for the first time that the zzso of zzso zzso activity in response to zzso zzso completely prevents the zzso of zzso and zzso during the final stages of zzso and zzso ring zzso Because zzso zzso efficiently suppresses the zzso zzso of zzso at the zzso zzso zzso we propose a previously zzso role for zzso in ensuring that zzso occurs at the proper place and time by establishing a molecular zzso between zzso and zzso in an zzso zzso
