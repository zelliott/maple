zzso zzso substance zzso a member of the zzso zzso causes zzso of the zzso duct in male zzso The presence of zzso type II and type I receptors in zzso and cell lines derived from the prostate suggests that prostate is a likely target for zzso In this report, we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso growth of zzso cells and decreases their survival in zzso medium by preventing cell cycle progression and inducing zzso zzso of zzso zzso reversed the ability of zzso to decrease zzso cell survival in zzso medium but not zzso growth, whereas zzso of nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso effects of zzso on both zzso growth and zzso zzso The effect of zzso on zzso growth was not due to changes in zzso zzso zzso However, zzso suppressed zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso reversed zzso suppression of zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso regulates zzso gene expression and growth in prostate cancer cells through a zzso but zzso zzso Thus, zzso in addition to potentially regulating prostate growth indirectly by suppressing zzso testosterone zzso may also be a direct regulator of zzso gene expression and growth in the prostate at the cellular zzso
