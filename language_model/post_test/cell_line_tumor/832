To study the mechanism of zzso zzso resistance in zzso cancer cell zzso 

A zzso zzso cancer cell line zzso established in this laboratory was used in this zzso zzso zzso zzso intensity of the zzso cells and parental cells were measured by flow zzso The gene expression of membrane protein zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance associated protein zzso breast cancer resistance protein zzso was evaluated by zzso The zzso zzso zzso including a translation initiation site of zzso zzso was transferred into resistant cells by zzso 

zzso zzso zzso intensity of the resistant cells was zzso of that in the parental cells zzso zzso zzso No expression of zzso was demonstrated, and that of zzso was very weak in the zzso cells zzso expression value zzso zzso zzso was zzso in the zzso cells zzso expression zzso zzso but not in the parental zzso Transfer of zzso into resistant cells resulted in a zzso reduction of zzso gene expression zzso zzso zzso and an obviously increased zzso zzso zzso intensity from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso which zzso drug zzso may play an important role in the induction of zzso in zzso zzso
