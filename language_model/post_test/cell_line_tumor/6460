zzso zzso zzso is a class of small regulatory zzso zzso the zzso expression of which can lead to the development of zzso We recently reported that zzso of zzso and/or zzso leads to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso expressing zzso natural killer zzso cell zzso Through expression analysis, we show in this study that in both zzso zzso lines and samples of primary lymphoma, levels of zzso expression are significantly lower than in normal zzso zzso To examine its role in zzso we zzso zzso into zzso zzso cells, which increased the zzso of zzso and reduced cell zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso appeared zzso and showed lower zzso activity, resulting in shortened zzso zzso We also found that zzso directly zzso expression of zzso and zzso reduced levels of zzso zzso and increased levels of tumor zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso functions as a tumor zzso and that its zzso zzso zzso continuous zzso of the zzso pathway, leading to zzso zzso and zzso of cancer zzso These findings provide new insight into the zzso of zzso zzso
