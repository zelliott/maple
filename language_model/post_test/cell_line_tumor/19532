In this study, the mechanisms of zzso in zzso were zzso Analysis of cellular zzso of known zzso zzso proteins in mouse melanoma zzso cells revealed that zzso was specifically localized along the entire length of all zzso whereas other zzso zzso were zzso zzso interference of zzso reduced the number of zzso and remaining zzso had abnormal zzso with zzso and loosely bundled zzso zzso zzso of zzso 39 likely determined cellular zzso zzso The zzso active zzso zzso zzso increased the number and length of zzso whereas the inactive zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso Fluorescence recovery after zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso underwent rapid cycles of association to and zzso from zzso filaments in zzso with zzso zzso 10 zzso We propose that zzso is a key specific zzso zzso providing zzso for zzso zzso and that its dynamic behavior allows for efficient coordination between zzso and bundling of zzso zzso zzso
