The use of whole cell tumor vaccines and various means of loading zzso onto zzso cells have been under investigation for over a zzso zzso of zzso and the exposure of zzso proteins are thought to be beneficial for the use in zzso zzso but conclusive evidence in the clinical setting has been zzso zzso of melanoma cell lines with zzso zzso increased zzso and zzso exposure, but not in the zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso melanoma cell lines used for loading zzso cells for zzso showed differential response to the zzso effects of zzso These zzso tumor cells zzso were zzso and used for loading zzso for zzso cell zzso A zzso comparison of survival for patients whose zzso were found to be either sensitive zzso zzso and zzso or insensitive to zzso revealed a strongly significant correlation to zzso zzso and overall survival zzso favorably in those patients whose cell lines were resistant to the zzso effect of zzso These results suggest that the use of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso may only be beneficial when the cells do not undergo zzso in response to zzso and support the contention that the use of some zzso cells in vaccines may be zzso
