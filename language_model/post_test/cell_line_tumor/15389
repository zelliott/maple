zzso available red blood cells zzso for zzso are at high demand, but in zzso generation of zzso from zzso stem cells requires significant quantities of growth zzso Here, we describe the production of four human growth factors: zzso zzso stem cell factor zzso zzso 3 zzso and zzso growth zzso zzso either as zzso proteins or as zzso with a carrier zzso zzso in plants, using a zzso mosaic virus zzso transient expression zzso All growth factors were zzso and their identity was confirmed by western zzso and zzso zzso The potency of these zzso zzso was assessed using zzso cell zzso to EPO, zzso and zzso or zzso cell zzso to zzso proliferation zzso The biological activity estimated here for the zzso produced in plants was slightly lower or within the range cited in commercial sources and published zzso By comparing zzso values of zzso zzso with standards, we have demonstrated that all four zzso growth factors zzso the expansion of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and their differentiation toward zzso precursors with the same potency as commercially available growth zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report on the generation of all key zzso zzso required for the zzso development in a cost-effective manner using a zzso expression zzso
