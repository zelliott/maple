While melanoma cell lines use zzso zzso addition of a competitive inhibitor such as zzso zzso by itself achieved only modest zzso To overcome high levels of zzso proteins in melanoma cells, zzso or zzso deprivation zzso was combined with tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso TRAIL treatment by itself also only induced modest killing, but combining TRAIL with zzso or zzso triggered a synergistic zzso response in melanoma lines but not zzso In melanoma cells, there was zzso of zzso 3, 8 and zzso zzso by combination treatments was completely blocked by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso enhanced surface levels for both death receptors zzso and zzso which was accompanied by reductions in levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso reduced enhanced killing by combination treatments, accompanied by reduced zzso zzso These results indicate melanoma cells in which there is altered zzso zzso can be exploited by interfering with zzso metabolism in combination with zzso thereby overcoming the notorious death resistance of zzso Thus, a new therapeutic window is open for future clinical trials using agents targeting the zzso zzso in combination with agents triggering death receptors in patients with zzso
