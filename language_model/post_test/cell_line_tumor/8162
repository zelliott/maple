zzso is an essential zzso necessary for synthesis of membrane zzso cell zzso molecules and zzso The aim of this study was to detect and characterize the zzso zzso 1 zzso protein in zzso zzso and the hybrid zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso which zzso zzso and has high affinity zzso transport but does not express the zzso high affinity zzso zzso zzso The presence of zzso protein in zzso cells was confirmed using our zzso zzso which recognizes the zzso domain of human zzso Three different zzso small interfering zzso were used to decrease zzso zzso in zzso cells, causing lowered zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso None of the small interfering zzso influenced zzso zzso demonstrating the absence of major zzso zzso In parental zzso cells zzso of zzso also reduced high affinity zzso zzso Our results support the concept that zzso protein is necessary for the high affinity zzso transport which supplies zzso for cell zzso The presence of zzso protein in rat and human zzso regions, where it is found in zzso zzso and zzso cells, suggests that malfunction of this zzso could have important implications in nervous system development and repair following injury, and in neurodegenerative zzso
