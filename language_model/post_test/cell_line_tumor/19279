zzso systems to deliver, integrate and express therapeutic genes in host cells are essential for gene zzso In the present study, we investigated a novel zzso system for integration and expression of a zzso In this system, the zzso expression was driven by an zzso zzso zzso I zzso I) promoter after being integrated into the zzso DNA zzso zzso Human zzso factor IX coding sequence zzso with an internal zzso entry sites element at its leader region, was targeted into the zzso zzso locus via zzso zzso zzso protein zzso which was under the control of the zzso Pol I promoter, was found to be similar to that of a moderate Pol II zzso The average zzso expression level of the zzso zzso was additionally enhanced to that from a strong Pol II promoter as a result of elimination of position zzso Our data suggest the possibility of applying this system in gene therapy for zzso zzso
