Cellular zzso involved in zzso processes are driven by zzso assembly of zzso filaments in response to zzso zzso So far, only chemical compounds zzso zzso or stabilizing zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso have been used to eliminate the formation of zzso while zzso positive strategies have been designed to stimulate zzso Here we describe the design of four zzso zzso and zzso zzso and show that they enter the cell and induce specific growth of zzso zzso within zzso The largest increase in cell area is obtained with zzso amounts of a zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso These zzso specifically target zzso both in zzso and in zzso Analysis of their effects on filament assembly dynamics and its regulation indicates that the zzso act by slowing down filament dynamics and by enhancing zzso zzso These compounds provide new opportunities to study the zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso
