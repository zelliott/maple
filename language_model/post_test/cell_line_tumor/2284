Cell viability zzso have a variety of well known practical and technical zzso All the available approaches have zzso such as zzso high background and cumbersome zzso Several commonly used zzso chemicals rely upon generation of a colored zzso product formed by zzso reduction of these compounds via zzso zzso zzso However, sensitivity is inherently limited because their reduction relies on zzso zzso and cellular transport of zzso as well as accessibility to zzso zzso In this study, we identify zzso zzso as an inexpensive probe that can measure cellular zzso activity without the need of zzso In tissue culture zzso zzso accurately zzso metabolically active live cells in a linear manner superior to zzso based and other zzso Cell toxicity produced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso toxins zzso zzso oxide, zzso or zzso radiation was rapidly determined by the zzso zzso We found that zzso was superior to other commonly used zzso for cell viability zzso in its zzso membrane zzso and zzso conversion to a zzso reporter that is readily transported into the zzso zzso Our findings establish the use of zzso in a simple, rapid and low cost zzso to accurately zzso viable zzso
