The zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in the regulation of growth zzso signal zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso is frequently zzso in zzso zzso Our previous studies on clinical prostate cancer specimens indicated that zzso expression was increased in patients undergoing hormone zzso zzso We had also shown that the critical cell cycle regulatory gene zzso D1 and its promoter were targets of zzso signaling in prostate cancer cell lines, and that zzso D1 was required for zzso zzso zzso In the current studies, we found that increased zzso membrane expression correlated with increased nuclear zzso D1 zzso in clinical prostate cancer zzso and that expression of zzso was capable of inducing cell cycle progression in human prostate cancer cell zzso We further showed that zzso induced the zzso D1 promoter in zzso cells, and that small interfering zzso zzso of zzso D1 protein levels blocked a significant proportion of the zzso cell cycle progression in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of an activated zzso zzso induced zzso D1 expression in the mouse zzso commensurate with prostate zzso zzso Together, these in zzso and in zzso studies identify zzso D1 as a critical downstream target of zzso in the prostate zzso both of which are possible therapeutic targets for cancer zzso Furthermore, our novel mouse model provides a useful platform for ongoing in zzso investigations of zzso signaling in the prostate zzso
