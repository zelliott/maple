zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso by zzso and its zzso zzso zzso protein of 85 zzso zzso is known to play an essential role in directing this zzso to the zzso for zzso The mechanisms by which this zzso modification is regulated are not fully zzso nor is it clear where this process zzso In this study we show that zzso zzso leads to a pronounced zzso zzso zzso of zzso that subsequently influences zzso zzso Of importance, zzso interacts with the zzso zzso where it mediates the zzso of the zzso zzso into zzso bodies zzso for subsequent zzso These findings provide novel insights into how zzso zzso regulation of a zzso zzso regulates the fate of the zzso
