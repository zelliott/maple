zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were prepared by the zzso zzso of humanized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the active targeting of tumor cells that zzso zzso zzso The zzso properties of zzso were compared to unloaded zzso zzso to assess the influence of the drug on zzso zzso to the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso activated zzso zzso and the in zzso efficacy of zzso were tested on zzso zzso cancer cells that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained by a zzso method had a size of zzso zzso zzso and an zzso efficiency of about of zzso which corresponded to a drug loading of zzso zzso zzso were then zzso and zzso to activated zzso zzso to obtain zzso of zzso zzso zzso The influence of the zzso step on the zzso of the zzso was tested on zzso cells using zzso zzso and the activity of the zzso zzso was minimally affected after zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules of zzso zzso were bound per zzso zzso exhibited a zzso potential of zzso zzso The zzso properties of the zzso zzso were very similar to unloaded zzso suggesting that the zzso of the drug did not influence the zzso of the zzso to the zzso No drug loss was observed during the preparation zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso is in an zzso or zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is zzso in the zzso zzso and not zzso to the surface of the zzso In zzso studies on zzso zzso cancer cells demonstrated the greater zzso effect of zzso compared to other zzso zzso The results showed that at 1 zzso zzso the viability of cells incubated with drug zzso in zzso was lower zzso than the viability of cells incubated in zzso zzso zzso coated with zzso as irrelevant zzso zzso zzso or free drug zzso
