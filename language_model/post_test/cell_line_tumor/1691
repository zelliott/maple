zzso zzso zzso is the key tool for cancer zzso and zzso zzso zzso that targets tumor zzso has had great zzso In this study, a cell clone which kept zzso zzso zzso zzso named zzso against human zzso cell lung cancer zzso cells was zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was zzso The zzso named zzso of zzso specifically identified by zzso was proved to be a protein with the relative molecular mass zzso of 70 zzso The results of zzso zzso indicated that zzso could positively react to zzso but weak positively or zzso react to human zzso lung cancer zzso pulmonary zzso and other zzso zzso In soft zzso zzso the colony formation efficiency in zzso groups decreased in a zzso zzso For the concentration of 100 zzso 200 zzso and 400 zzso the zzso ratio of colony formation was zzso zzso and zzso zzso Meanwhile, zzso caused significant reduction in tumor volume and tumor weight compared to control mice in lung cancer zzso zzso The tumor growth zzso ratio in 200 zzso 400 zzso and 800 zzso zzso groups was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso also led to zzso changes and induced the zzso of human lung zzso cell line zzso zzso The newly developed zzso selectively reacted to zzso and exhibited zzso activity both in zzso and in zzso zzso is of great value concerning zzso and zzso for zzso and holds promise for further research regarding the mechanism underlying tumor progression of zzso
