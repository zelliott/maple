We investigated the zzso effect and ability to overcome the resistance to zzso drugs of zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso was evaluated alone and in combination with the zzso inhibitor zzso on growth and zzso protein expression in human cancer cells sensitive and resistant to zzso drugs, both in zzso and in nude zzso We demonstrated the marked zzso activity of zzso against zzso colon and zzso prostate cancer cells and their zzso counterparts zzso and zzso accompanied by zzso of zzso and its zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression and zzso Moreover, zzso showed a cooperative effect with zzso in parental and in zzso zzso zzso these results were confirmed in zzso where zzso showed zzso activity and zzso with zzso in mice grafted with zzso and zzso zzso zzso their median survival and zzso the zzso protein expression and zzso in zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso by interfering with zzso proteins implicated in zzso drug resistance markedly zzso with zzso in sensitive and zzso zzso thus overcoming and reverting such resistance and providing a rational basis for its development in patients resistant to zzso zzso
