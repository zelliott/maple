The zzso is a zzso cell layer maintained through fusion events with zzso and plays a key role in the properties of the zzso Monitoring fusion in this cell layer is important in studies aimed at understanding its zzso We zzso propose a new fusion zzso based on the zzso potential of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso protein on its promoter present in the long terminal repeat zzso zzso We used 2 zzso cell zzso one zzso zzso with the zzso zzso positioned upstream of the zzso gene and the other zzso zzso with a zzso expression zzso Both stable cell lines were responsive to zzso zzso zzso and demonstrated normal fusion and human zzso zzso zzso zzso upon zzso When both zzso cell lines were zzso zzso induction of fusion led to an increase in zzso activity, which was sensitive to zzso 1 and zzso zzso and zzso 2 small interfering zzso zzso Similar results were obtained in primary zzso Our results highlight the effectiveness and accuracy of this new zzso zzso for zzso zzso
