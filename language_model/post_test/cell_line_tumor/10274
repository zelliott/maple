zzso cells are dependent on zzso for their survival and proliferation during the early stages of disease, and independence from zzso is associated with disease zzso The role of the zzso zzso in the zzso growth of myeloma cells has not been zzso Because human zzso zzso zzso selectively activates the zzso pathway, we have used it as a molecular tool to examine the ability of the zzso zzso to zzso zzso independence on zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso expression of zzso but not its zzso zzso or a structural zzso protected zzso against zzso zzso zzso and resulted in emergence of zzso clones that could zzso long-term in zzso in the absence of zzso and form abdominal zzso with visceral involvement when injected zzso into zzso zzso These zzso clones were dependent on zzso activity for their survival and proliferation but were resistant to zzso and zzso a selective zzso zzso 1/2 zzso zzso expression of human T cell leukemia virus zzso Tax zzso which resembles zzso in inducing zzso zzso zzso similarly protected zzso cells against zzso zzso zzso Although zzso is known to zzso zzso gene zzso its protective effect was not due to induction of zzso zzso production but instead was associated with sustained expression of several zzso members of the zzso family upon zzso zzso zzso these results demonstrate that zzso zzso cannot only promote the emergence of zzso independence during myeloma progression but can also zzso resistance to zzso and zzso
