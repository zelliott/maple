Nuclear zzso zzso is a zzso zzso factor that generally enhances cellular resistance to zzso cell zzso It has been shown to be zzso active in some zzso and is being pursued as potential zzso zzso zzso which is used clinically to treat Crohn's disease has emerged as a potential inhibitor of zzso and has shown promising results in two zzso studies to target primary brain tumors, zzso Once zzso zzso is zzso into zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso by zzso bacteria, and the latter, too, is reported to suppress zzso zzso We now show that zzso cells obtained from patient zzso or zzso cell lines do not show significant zzso zzso zzso unless exposed to inflammatory zzso This does not change when zzso are implanted into the zzso of severe combined zzso zzso Nevertheless, zzso but not its zzso form zzso caused a zzso zzso of zzso zzso This effect was entirely attributable to the zzso of zzso zzso via the system zzso zzso zzso It could be zzso by zzso zzso a more specific system zzso zzso and zzso expression of a zzso active form of zzso zzso b was unable to overcome the growth zzso effects of zzso or zzso Both drugs inhibited zzso zzso causing a chronic depletion of zzso zzso and consequently compromised cellular zzso defense which stymied tumor zzso This data suggests that system zzso is a promising therapeutic target in zzso and possibly other zzso and that it can be zzso inhibited by zzso an zzso zzso
