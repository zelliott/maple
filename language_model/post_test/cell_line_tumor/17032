zzso cells produce zzso zzso and thereby permit rapid zzso zzso in the zzso peripheral nervous zzso Their zzso differentiation from neural crest cells is driven zzso defined zzso zzso zzso How this is linked to zzso changes is not well zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso factor zzso functions in zzso cells by recruiting zzso complexes via zzso zzso regions of zzso and zzso zzso zzso stimulates expression of these zzso regulators that then cooperate with zzso zzso immature into zzso zzso zzso functional interaction between zzso zzso is evident from zzso and zzso studies, similar zzso in the corresponding mouse zzso and an aggravated zzso in compound zzso Our results demonstrate that the zzso zzso recruitment of zzso machinery to specific zzso zzso is an essential driving force for zzso cell differentiation and zzso
