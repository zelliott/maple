zzso zzso is an zzso pathogen that zzso and survives in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso encodes a type four zzso system zzso that may facilitate zzso survival by zzso of zzso factors, but to date, no such factors have been zzso Because zzso proteins of several zzso organisms undergo zzso zzso by host cell zzso we investigated zzso zzso of zzso zzso proteins during zzso Within minutes after incubation of zzso zzso with zzso cells or zzso a 190 zzso bacterial zzso zzso was increasingly zzso zzso zzso binding to host cells without entry was sufficient for zzso zzso zzso An in zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli was zzso at zzso located at the zzso portion of zzso Similarly, zzso expressed in zzso cells underwent zzso zzso by zzso at the zzso The zzso zzso were located in zzso motifs that display the consensus sequence for binding to zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated zzso binding to the host cell zzso zzso during early zzso zzso of the zzso motifs and the presence of the zzso zzso were necessary for zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is a zzso zzso factor that is zzso by host cell zzso upon zzso into the host cell early during zzso zzso zzso may manipulate the host cell through zzso zzso
