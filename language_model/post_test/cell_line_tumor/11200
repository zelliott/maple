The identification of genetic and zzso zzso from primary tumor cells has become a common method to discover genes critical to the development, zzso and therapeutic resistance of zzso We seek to identify those genetic and zzso aberrations that have the most impact on gene function within the zzso First, we perform a zzso analysis of copy number variation zzso and DNA zzso covering the genetic landscape of zzso cancer tumor zzso We were specifically interested in copy number variation as our base zzso property in the prediction of tumor zzso and zzso in the altered zzso zzso We identify changes in DNA zzso and expression specifically for all amplified and deleted zzso We statistically define tumor zzso and zzso gene function from zzso analysis of three zzso copy number variation, DNA zzso and gene zzso Our method zzso zzso the extent of zzso and zzso zzso of defined tumor zzso and zzso features for the functional prediction of significant zzso cancer gene candidates and zzso identifies the functional activity or zzso of known tumor zzso and zzso in zzso zzso We applied our protocol on 42 primary zzso zzso cancer samples using zzso zzso array zzso Additionally, we provide the basis for incorporating zzso profiles of zzso tumors for the purposes of zzso survival prediction in the context of zzso zzso
