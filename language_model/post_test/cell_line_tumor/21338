The steroid and zzso zzso SXR zzso zzso X zzso is a nuclear zzso that plays a key role in the body's zzso response by regulating genes involved in drug metabolism and zzso SXR zzso include a wide range of compounds, which induce zzso of SXR target genes via zzso of a zzso zzso factor consisting of SXR and the related nuclear zzso zzso X zzso zzso We investigated the effect of zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso In agreement with previous reports, we found that zzso are weak zzso of SXR, but we also found that they can antagonize SXR zzso by the potent SXR zzso zzso This antagonism included suppression of zzso expression of SXR target zzso as well as reduced binding of zzso to SXR response elements both in zzso and in zzso Interestingly, two zzso zzso zzso and zzso caused a rapid and sustained decrease in the protein levels of both SXR and zzso The decrease in SXR level was due to an enhanced rate of protein degradation and was dependent on zzso activity, as opposed to zzso zzso degradation, which is zzso via the zzso Thus, we have demonstrated a novel, zzso mechanism regulating SXR protein stability, which may explain why zzso are only weak zzso of zzso transcription, despite reports that they bind to SXR with high zzso We suggest that the ability of zzso to induce degradation of both SXR and zzso in combination with competition for binding to SXR, can also explain why zzso antagonize the zzso of SXR by drugs like zzso
