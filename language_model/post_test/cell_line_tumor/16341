Silver zzso zzso have increasingly been used for zzso on various textiles and certain zzso for the treatment of wounds and zzso as a water zzso and in zzso zzso The wide use of zzso may have potential human health zzso In this study, the zzso of zzso zzso was evaluated in the mouse zzso zzso system, and modes of action were assessed using standard alkaline and zzso zzso zzso and gene expression zzso zzso of zzso mouse zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso resulted in a significant yield of zzso at doses between 3 and 6 zzso the upper range was limited by zzso Loss of zzso analysis of the zzso zzso revealed that treatments with zzso zzso induced mainly zzso zzso spanning less than 34 zzso pairs on zzso zzso Although no significant induction of DNA damage in zzso mouse zzso cells was observed in the standard zzso zzso the zzso treatments induced a zzso increase in zzso DNA damage in the zzso zzso zzso in which zzso zzso zzso were zzso Gene expression analysis using an zzso stress and zzso defense zzso chain reaction zzso array showed that the expressions of 17 of the 59 genes on the zzso were altered in the cells treated with zzso These genes are involved in production of zzso oxygen species, zzso stress response, zzso oxygen zzso and DNA zzso These results suggest that 5 zzso zzso are zzso in mouse zzso cells due to induction of zzso stress by the zzso
