In our previous study, lung zzso targeting of zzso was achieved in mice by intravenous administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso formation of zzso in the blood stream followed by enhanced zzso in the zzso was proposed as a mechanism of the zzso zzso of zzso In the present study, the mechanism of tumor lung preferential zzso of zzso from zzso was zzso zzso potential and in zzso cellular zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso of zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso 6 to these cells from zzso zzso 6 containing zzso zzso zzso 6) were examined as a function of pH zzso zzso and zzso The zzso potential of zzso increased as the medium pH became more zzso In zzso zzso of zzso 6 by zzso cells and zzso cells was enhanced at lower pH for zzso zzso In zzso zzso experiment with zzso demonstrated enhanced zzso as the pH became more zzso zzso enhanced zzso interaction between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of tumor cells appears to be an underlying mechanism of lung zzso zzso of zzso from zzso
