The zzso extract of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in various cancer cell lines but is significantly less zzso in zzso zzso Chemical zzso of zzso showed that its zzso is associated with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a major zzso in zzso but it shows little zzso A much less abundant zzso zzso cell death in tumor cells but not in normal cells, zzso the selectivity of the total extract zzso zzso treatment, by removing the extra sugar zzso in zzso converts it to zzso and zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the mechanisms of death induced by zzso revealed zzso of two distinct zzso zzso first, zzso of zzso zzso in much reduced zzso of zzso zzso second, induction of zzso zzso stress culminating in zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso These zzso pathways are activated by zzso selectively in tumor cells but not in normal zzso Both pathways play a zzso role in zzso zzso as restoration of either zzso activity or relief of zzso stress alone offer only partial protection from zzso zzso of zzso and induction of zzso stress apparently contribute to the induction of the previously reported zzso response in zzso zzso zzso induced zzso plays a protective role in zzso induced death zzso and failure to mount zzso response is associated with heightened sensitivity to zzso induced zzso The multiple zzso and apparently zzso responses to zzso its ability to inhibit zzso and the possibility of further enhancing its zzso by pharmacological zzso of zzso make zzso an attractive candidate for development as a cancer therapeutic zzso
