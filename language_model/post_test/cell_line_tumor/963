A series of four zzso lipids derived from cholesterol was zzso and their efficiencies to zzso zzso acids were zzso The investigation concerns the effects of systematic chemical modifications in the polar head and in the zzso The zzso zzso molecules used are in the same family of zzso cholesterol zzso zzso presenting a zzso of two or three zzso and a zzso ammonium polar head zzso with zzso or zzso zzso These lipids formed stable zzso zzso from 100 to 200 zzso when prepared with the zzso zzso zzso zzso The goal of this work was to investigate the effect of the chemical structure of these zzso lipids on zzso Their ability to form complexes with DNA, their zzso and their zzso efficiency in zzso and in zzso were zzso zzso were compared with those obtained from the well known zzso zzso zzso zzso In a melanoma cell line zzso results showed that either the polar head or the zzso affected the zzso zzso lipids with three zzso groups in the head are more toxic than those with three zzso groups while zzso lipids with three zzso in the zzso are less toxic than those with two zzso in the zzso The best zzso level was obtained in zzso and in zzso with zzso lipids having zzso in the zzso Data indicated that among these zzso in zzso gene transfer is zzso by the zzso polar head while in zzso the best level was obtained with the zzso zzso Finally, it was observed that the chemical structure influences the zzso in the presence of serum while the complex charge and the zzso ratios in zzso zzso affect the interaction with zzso zzso are proposed to explain the discrepancies between in zzso and in zzso zzso results concerning the optimal charge ratio and the chemical nature of the zzso zzso head zzso
