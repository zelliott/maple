zzso zzso present considerable advantages over viral counterparts in gene zzso However, the poor expression efficiency of the zzso genes poses a challenge for their use in gene therapy, primarily due to the inability of these zzso to overcome various zzso including the biological zzso Here, we report that zzso may be involved in the recognition and zzso of zzso zzso zzso is induced by zzso of zzso DNA and suppresses the zzso of zzso zzso It binds directly to the zzso promoter in zzso plasmids but not the zzso zzso Similarly, zzso suppresses the expression of the green fluorescent protein reporter gene on zzso zzso plasmids but not an integrated red zzso reporter gene with the same zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is able to differentiate between zzso and zzso zzso The suppression by zzso is independent of DNA zzso and can be abolished by zzso A zzso treatment and zzso of zzso and/or zzso Furthermore, zzso interacts directly with zzso Our results revealed that zzso plasmids are recognized by zzso and suppressed by a zzso complex zzso zzso and zzso and suggest that zzso could play a role as a potential molecular barrier in zzso zzso zzso
