Drug delivery, especially gene delivery to the zzso has been a zzso Numerous gene delivery systems to the lung have been developed and tested in zzso zzso However, only a few of them have been successfully tested in the clinic and shown zzso The reasons for failure to translate zzso findings into clinical setting include inefficient gene delivery, zzso stability, and other factors related to zzso and manufacturing of the gene delivery zzso zzso there is a need for developing and testing of new gene delivery systems that can overcome some of the existing zzso zzso studies from our laboratory using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have shown efficient and effective gene delivery to the lung especially to zzso lungs of zzso Based on the efficacy and toxicity studies observed in zzso studies, we have recently initiated a Phase I clinical trial for systemic treatment of zzso cell lung cancer zzso In this clinical trial, a tumor zzso gene zzso in the zzso zzso will be delivered zzso to determine the zzso dose zzso The results from this clinical trial will provide a basis for conducting subsequent Phase II trial that will focus on determining toxicity and therapeutic zzso In this chapter, the details for the synthesis and testing of the zzso zzso for systemic gene delivery to the lung with emphasis on lung cancer is zzso
