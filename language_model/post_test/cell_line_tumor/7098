In search for possible alternatives in the treatment of human zzso we investigated several new zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso and zzso zzso We show that all zzso tested inhibited the number of colonies of zzso zzso zzso resistant zzso and zzso human colon tumor cells with zzso values ranging from zzso to 1 zzso zzso # 2 inhibited the number of sensitive and zzso resistant zzso human zzso cells with zzso values ranging from 200 to 230 zzso Since no significant difference in the zzso of the zzso could be observed between sensitive and resistant cells, these compounds might be used in the treatment of zzso and zzso resistant zzso
