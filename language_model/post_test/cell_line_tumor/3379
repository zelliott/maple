zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso factor that mediates zzso responses to 17 zzso zzso zzso binding rapidly zzso zzso alpha levels through zzso zzso but the functional impact of zzso degradation on cellular responses to zzso has not been fully zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of blocking the zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso blocking either zzso or zzso degradation markedly increased zzso expression of an zzso zzso Time course studies further demonstrated that blocking zzso degradation of zzso alpha resulted in prolonged stimulation of zzso gene zzso In breast cancer zzso cells containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso the zzso decreased expression of zzso zzso zzso presumably due to the zzso of the zzso promoter, which contains multiple regulatory zzso In addition, in zzso cancer zzso cells zzso steroid zzso zzso 1, zzso displayed full zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso zzso without inducing zzso zzso zzso these results demonstrate that zzso degradation is not essential for zzso alpha zzso activity and functions to limit zzso zzso zzso The results further indicate that promoter context must be considered when evaluating the relationship between zzso alpha zzso and zzso zzso We suggest that the zzso of a gene driven predominantly by an zzso element, such as zzso is a more reliable indicator of zzso alpha zzso activity than a gene like zzso which contains a complex promoter requiring cooperation between zzso alpha and other zzso zzso
