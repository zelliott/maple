zzso proteins with zzso structures can participate in the regulation of various cellular zzso We have cloned a novel zzso zzso zzso which binds the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and subsequently mediates signaling through zzso in zzso zzso cancer zzso In the present study, we sought to determine the role of zzso in the zzso in zzso and in related molecular zzso In zzso zzso cancer cells, zzso of zzso using small interfering zzso inhibited zzso phase zzso induced spontaneous zzso and enhanced intrinsic and zzso zzso zzso cell zzso Growth of tumors in nude mice formed from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were significantly reduced, with decreased cell proliferation and increased zzso zzso analysis identified 246 genes significantly changed in zzso zzso zzso zzso Among them, 57 genes are related to cell proliferation or survival, including many zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis showed that the top-ranked disease related to zzso is cancer, and the top molecular and cellular functions are cellular growth and proliferation and cell zzso A human zzso tissue zzso study identified expression of zzso in normal zzso tissue as well as in human zzso zzso These observations suggest that the expression of zzso in these cancer cells may affect cell proliferation and survival by controlling the expression of multiple zzso especially zzso zzso
