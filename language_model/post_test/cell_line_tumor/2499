Recent clinical trials aimed at improved treatment of zzso by administration of vitamin D derivatives showed unremarkable results, suggesting development of vitamin D resistance in patients' zzso zzso Since mechanisms of vitamin D resistance are not clear, we studied zzso cells, a zzso of zzso cells that can zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso and protein levels of zzso an upstream zzso zzso are dramatically increased in zzso cells, and zzso protein is further increased when the zzso resistance of zzso cells is partially reversed by the addition of zzso acid and zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso reduces zzso differentiation of both zzso zzso and zzso cells and zzso zzso cells, but the effect of zzso zzso on zzso G 1 arrest is more apparent in the resistant than the sensitive zzso To explain why zzso and the zzso vitamin zzso zzso cells can zzso in the presence of vitamin D, we found that the zzso zzso zzso zzso level is high in zzso and zzso cells, but when differentiation is induced by zzso zzso decreases while full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with the zzso inhibitor zzso reduced zzso zzso and enhanced zzso differentiation of zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso is a positive regulator of vitamin zzso differentiation in zzso cells, but the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, high zzso zzso activity contributes to vitamin D resistance, and zzso has a dual role in zzso cell zzso
