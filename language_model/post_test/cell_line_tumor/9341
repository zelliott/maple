zzso zzso loss of zzso zzso is a common event in zzso occurring zzso in tumors that exhibit loss of zzso zzso and lack zzso zzso Although numerous tumor zzso genes zzso have been mapped to the zzso region, the gene or genes contributing to zzso zzso have remained zzso zzso zzso array zzso mapping of zzso zzso zzso relative to the positions of known zzso indicates that more than one gene may contribute to zzso zzso We evaluated the zzso status of zzso zzso zzso one of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso tumors with zzso zzso zzso and without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A significantly higher percentage of zzso zzso sites in the zzso promoter was detected in tumors exhibiting zzso loss zzso relative to tumors without loss zzso suggestive of a two-hit mechanism of zzso zzso The involvement of zzso in the control of zzso expression was confirmed by treatment of zzso cell lines with the zzso agent zzso zzso regulation of this locus is complex, zzso low levels of zzso expression were also seen in tumors with zzso zzso promoters zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to play an important role in the development of normal sympathetic zzso and interestingly, we found higher levels of zzso expression in differentiated tumors with favorable zzso zzso zzso zzso than in tumors with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso was zzso in the zzso zzso cell line following induction of differentiation with zzso zzso The association of zzso expression with zzso differentiation suggests that this zzso may play a role in zzso zzso
