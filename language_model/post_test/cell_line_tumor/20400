zzso is a zzso zzso modification that requires the contribution of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our study explores expression and activity of zzso and zzso in zzso melanoma cell lines with varying zzso zzso 

Gene profiling on zzso was conducted using zzso prepared from the zzso melanoma cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso The activity of zzso and zzso was monitored by zzso zzso whereas their expression was measured by Western zzso and zzso The zzso promoter was analyzed using promoter deletions and zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso factors binding the zzso promoter were studied by zzso mobility shift zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso expression was performed in zzso and zzso cells by zzso and their zzso properties monitored by injections into zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso was found to vary considerably between zzso melanoma cell lines with distinctive zzso properties in zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso were shown to bind to the zzso gene promoter to ensure zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso suppression of zzso gene expression in zzso and zzso cells increased their capacity to form tumors in zzso mice, whereas suppression of zzso significantly reduced or almost entirely abolished tumor zzso 

Our results suggest that while zzso of zzso may zzso a zzso advantage to aggressive zzso melanoma tumors, zzso may, on the other hand, support a tumor zzso function in zzso
