Cancer stem cells zzso form a very rare population within tumors and possess the ability to zzso and zzso zzso The cluster of differentiation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been identified recently and their clinical implications are about to be zzso In this context, we use the zzso zzso as a marker of zzso in zzso cells and show that zzso zzso are zzso expressed in this zzso The zzso in the zzso cell line were identified by the zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and real-time reverse zzso chain reaction zzso analyses were used to identify zzso with altered expression in zzso zzso The expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were examined using zzso zzso The zzso and protein levels of stem zzso genes were examined by real-time zzso and western zzso zzso Our results of zzso and real-time zzso analyses revealed distinct zzso expression profiles between zzso and zzso zzso zzso The expression of stem zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was higher in zzso cells than in zzso cells while that of zzso was lower in zzso cells than in zzso zzso In conclusion, our data indicate that zzso expression defines a zzso zzso of cells in the zzso cell zzso The overall zzso expression profile of zzso zzso cells was clearly distinct from that of zzso zzso cells, indicating that zzso are involved in the development of this zzso and may serve as pertinent zzso zzso
