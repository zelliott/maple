A fusion zzso zzso zzso composed of zzso binding protein zzso and zzso was zzso where the complete sequences of each binding protein were fused together into a single zzso zzso The orientation of this fusion zzso structure has the N zzso of zzso fused to the C zzso of zzso leaving the key binding areas of each zzso zzso zzso bound to cells via its zzso component and retained the increased affinity for zzso via its zzso zzso The effect of zzso zzso on growth was determined in cell lines from both zzso and zzso where zzso is an zzso growth zzso In studies using zzso zzso zzso or zzso a growth zzso effect was shown for all when present under zzso conditions with zzso However, with transient exposure, zzso zzso was the only zzso that retained this zzso zzso Under transient exposure conditions, zzso zzso was found to be effective when exposure was limited to as few as 10 zzso and zzso were as low as 1 zzso These findings with zzso zzso suggest that it potentially could lead be used as therapy against zzso in which zzso is an zzso growth factor because it brings an zzso action directly to tumor zzso
