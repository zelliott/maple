zzso is a major source of genetic zzso in the human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso The main mechanism responsible for the generation of zzso viruses is a process of copy choice between the two copies of zzso zzso during reverse zzso We previously identified, after a single cycle of infection of cells in culture, a zzso hot spot within the zzso zzso corresponding to the top portion of a zzso zzso Here, we determine that the hot region is circumscribed to 18 zzso located in the descending strand of the zzso following the sense of reverse zzso Three factors appeared to be important, albeit at different zzso for the high rate of zzso observed in this zzso The position of the hot sequence in the context of the zzso structure appears zzso because changing its location within this structure triggered differences in zzso up to zzso Another pivotal factor is the presence of a perfectly identical sequence between donor and zzso zzso in the region of transfer, because single or double zzso differences in the hot spot were sufficient to almost completely abolish zzso in the zzso zzso the primary structure of the hot region also influenced zzso although with effects only in the zzso zzso Altogether, these results provide the first molecular dissection of a hot spot in infected cells and indicate that several factors contribute to the generation of a site of preferential copy zzso
