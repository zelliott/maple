The Cancer Genome zzso zzso Network recently zzso zzso the molecular aberrations in zzso high-grade zzso zzso zzso with much remaining to be zzso regarding the zzso zzso Here, using zzso zzso data, we surveyed the zzso in the context of their predicted gene zzso 

zzso of zzso and gene patterns yielded evidence that zzso pairs of zzso are processed from zzso primary zzso and that zzso zzso and their host gene zzso derive from common zzso zzso of zzso expression revealed multiple tumor zzso and a set of 34 zzso zzso of overall patient zzso In a global analysis, zzso pairs zzso in expression across tumors showed a higher frequency of in zzso predicted target sites in the zzso zzso region (with less frequency observed for coding sequence and zzso zzso The zzso family and predicted target genes were among the most strongly zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso several zzso genes (including zzso and zzso and substantially decreased zzso cancer cell zzso 

This study establishes zzso as having a widespread impact on gene expression programs in zzso cancer, further strengthening our understanding of zzso biology as it applies to human zzso As with gene zzso zzso exhibit high diversity reflecting the zzso zzso within a clinically homogeneous disease zzso zzso zzso zzso as identified using zzso analysis, can be zzso zzso data are a valuable resource for the identification of novel tumor zzso zzso in zzso as well as other zzso
