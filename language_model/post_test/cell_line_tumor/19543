A number of neurodegenerative disorders may potentially be treated by the delivery of therapeutic genes to zzso zzso gene delivery systems, however, typically provide low zzso efficiency in zzso differentiated zzso To uncover zzso reasons for this zzso we compared gene transfer to zzso and differentiated zzso cells using zzso zzso zzso zzso cells exhibited substantially lower zzso of gene zzso To overcome this zzso zzso or zzso zzso peptides were attached to zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso improved the cellular zzso of gene zzso and enhanced gene zzso efficiency of primary zzso up to zzso zzso zzso resulted in a statistically significant increase in zzso escape from zzso suggesting it may improve gene delivery by more than one zzso
