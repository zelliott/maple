We have previously shown that zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso cell zzso by modulating the main zzso cell death mechanism in solid zzso the zzso cell zzso To decipher the biological pathways involved in these mechanisms, we constructed a zzso zzso cell model expressing an zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso We then demonstrated that zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso cell zzso In this model, zzso zzso induce zzso factor 1 alpha zzso zzso which is inhibited by zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso in zzso cells reduced the surviving fraction after 2 zzso zzso by increasing cell sensitivity to zzso zzso cell death and zzso zzso Because it is known that zzso controls zzso zzso we then looked at the zzso zzso effect on zzso zzso We show that zzso expression is decreased in zzso zzso Furthermore, treating zzso cells with the specific zzso zzso zzso significantly increased the percentage of giant zzso cells, zzso zzso and thus zzso cell zzso In consequence, we decipher here a new zzso of zzso zzso via the regulation of zzso zzso zzso and therefore zzso cell death by zzso zzso and zzso This work identifies new targets in zzso with the intention of zzso these highly zzso zzso
