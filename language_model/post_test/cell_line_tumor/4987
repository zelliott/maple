zzso originally prepared as a competitive zzso for zzso growth factor zzso is a zzso zzso that acts as an zzso and zzso zzso When the expression zzso for zzso gene was administered into mice by zzso delivery, the repetitive increase in the plasma zzso protein level was achieved by repetitive administration of zzso zzso Mice were zzso implanted with colon cancer cells and weekly given with the zzso zzso The repetitive delivery and expression of zzso gene inhibited zzso and zzso of colon cancer cells in subcutaneous tumor tissue and this was associated with suppression of primary tumor zzso By fifty days after tumor zzso cancer cells naturally zzso to the liver, whereas zzso gene expression zzso inhibited liver zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and tumor zzso by zzso gene expression has potential therapeutic value toward zzso of invasion, growth, and zzso of colon zzso
