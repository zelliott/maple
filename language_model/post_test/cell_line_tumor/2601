zzso factor 4 zzso a zinc zzso zzso factor, is a pivotal regulator of cellular zzso zzso has attracted considerable attention for its opposing effect in zzso as tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso breast zzso depending on tissue context, with the underlying mechanism remaining largely zzso Here we report that zzso mediates zzso signaling in breast cancer zzso zzso of zzso by zzso its turnover triggers zzso zzso We identified Von zzso zzso as the protein that zzso zzso turnover in breast cancer cells and demonstrated that zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso We provide zzso insights into zzso zzso degradation as well as its zzso in the presence of zzso and show that elevated levels of zzso or depletion of zzso zzso the zzso zzso and cell zzso Finally, zzso zzso revealed reduced concentration of zzso and zzso of zzso in breast cancer zzso We thus propose that suppression of zzso in response to zzso signaling results in zzso of zzso which mediates zzso zzso zzso
