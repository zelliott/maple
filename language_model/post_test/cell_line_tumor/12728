The zzso zzso is frequently zzso in head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso often due to amplification of the zzso gene zzso While zzso zzso enhances invasive potential, recent research indicates that it also promotes cell zzso but how zzso regulates the cell cycle machinery is zzso In this article we report that stable short hairpin zzso zzso zzso in the zzso cell line zzso led to increased expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso zzso These effects were associated with increased binding of zzso and zzso to zzso zzso and zzso complexes and decreased zzso protein zzso zzso regulated expression of zzso and zzso at the zzso and zzso levels, zzso The direct roles of zzso zzso and zzso downstream of zzso were confirmed by the transient zzso of each zzso by specific small interfering zzso which led to partial rescue of cell cycle zzso Interestingly, zzso cells with reduced zzso levels also exhibited a significant diminution in zzso expression and activity, together with decreased expression of zzso a critical component of the zzso zzso zzso that targets zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells decreased expression of zzso enhanced the level of zzso zzso and attenuated zzso zzso These findings identify a novel mechanism for regulation of proliferation in zzso zzso cells, in which zzso zzso acts via zzso to decrease expression of zzso zzso and highlight zzso as a downstream zzso for zzso in this zzso
