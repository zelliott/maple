zzso zzso zzso downstream of zzso activity, is understood to have zzso function and to be associated with poor outcome in cancer, of the breast in zzso The molecular basis of zzso effects of its zzso however, remains poorly zzso Moreover, the effects of their combination with the zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso have never been zzso In this study, we thus specifically addressed the zzso consequences of targeting zzso and zzso alone or zzso in breast cancer cell lines as well as in a novel human breast cancer ex zzso zzso 

By using in zzso zzso or zzso cultures of breast cancer cells plus a novel zzso short-term ex zzso zzso that correctly maintains human zzso tissue integrity and preserves tumor zzso we tested the effects of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso used as a single agent or in combination with zzso 

We show zzso that the zzso zzso zzso efficiently zzso zzso in breast cancer cell lines by a process that relies on the induction of zzso a zzso zzso 3 domain zzso protein of the zzso family that functions as an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso also targets zzso cancer zzso cells because it dramatically prevents in zzso zzso zzso Moreover, combining zzso treatment with zzso a zzso inhibitor of additional zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso leads to both a synergistic zzso response in breast cancer cells and to an zzso effect on zzso zzso These effects are also found when a zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso Finally, we evaluated individual human tumor responses to zzso zzso alone or in combination with zzso in ex zzso zzso Analysis of a series of 30 consecutive tumors indicated that a majority of tumors are sensitive to zzso induction by zzso and that association of zzso with zzso leads to an enhanced induction of zzso in tumor zzso 

We thus provide evidence that zzso and downstream zzso zzso are relevant targets in breast zzso zzso used as single agent or in combination with clinically relevant zzso is a promising innovative zzso strategy to treat zzso zzso
