zzso (a zzso and zzso are zzso molecules involved in zzso fusion, cell zzso membrane protein zzso and zzso In the present study, we examined the zzso expression of 13 different zzso species with putative zzso activity in human zzso tumors, zzso brain zzso and other zzso tumors by reverse zzso chain reaction, and found that zzso zzso zzso zzso is predominantly expressed in zzso zzso quantitative zzso chain reaction indicated that the expression level of zzso is remarkably at least zzso higher in zzso zzso zzso zzso than in zzso brain zzso zzso zzso zzso low grade zzso zzso 7) and zzso zzso tumors zzso zzso 9) zzso zzso zzso for each group), and zzso zzso zzso zzso 5) zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso showed that zzso cells are responsible for the gene zzso By zzso zzso was predominantly zzso on the cell zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso is expressed as an activated zzso form of approximately 90 zzso in zzso zzso There was a direct correlation between the zzso expression levels of zzso and zzso activity zzso cell zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bands consistent with the soluble form of zzso zzso growth factor, a zzso of zzso were observed by zzso in zzso samples with the zzso zzso and inhibited by treatment with zzso inhibitor of the zzso These data demonstrate for the first time that among the 13 different zzso species, zzso is highly expressed in human zzso and suggest the possibility that zzso plays a role in the prominent proliferation of the zzso through shedding of zzso zzso growth zzso
