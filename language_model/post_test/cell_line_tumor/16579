In our previous study, we demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso arrest of prostate cancer cell zzso Moreover, zzso degradation and an increase of zzso iron pool has been linked to the zzso of the zzso signaling zzso In the present work, we extended this study to determine which of the zzso zzso is responsible for zzso degradation and the role of iron in zzso cell zzso We hypothesized that zzso activates zzso zzso which will lead to zzso zzso an increase in zzso zzso formation and cell zzso 

zzso prostate cancer cells were used in this zzso Cell zzso concentration of zzso zzso iron pool, and changes in zzso and zzso and DNA damage were zzso 

We observed that zzso induced zzso degradation through zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso did not induce neither zzso formation nor increase the zzso in zzso zzso zzso We also observed that zzso increased zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The cells zzso with inactive form of zzso were more resistant against zzso of zzso and showed lower zzso zzso zzso zzso a specific iron zzso had no effect neither on cell viability nor DNA damage evaluated by comet zzso 

These results suggest that zzso increase in zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso
