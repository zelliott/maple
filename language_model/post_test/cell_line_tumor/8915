The Snail family of zinc finger zzso factors zzso Snail and zzso predicts the tumor recurrence in superficial zzso zzso while their roles in the development of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso with poor prognosis have not been zzso This study evaluates the clinical significance of zzso in aggressive zzso zzso 

A pair of zzso zzso zzso and zzso from a unique zzso zzso model of zzso cancer was zzso zzso to identify the potential precursors contributing to those aggressive zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso J, zzso and zzso and zzso was evaluated by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso The function of zzso expression on zzso to zzso switch, cell invasion, and zzso to zzso treatment was validated by zzso and zzso strategy in zzso 

zzso was identified as one of the novel targets contributed to the aggressive zzso of zzso cells, which showed enhanced cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso as previously zzso zzso of zzso was significantly correlated with a higher tumor stage and the zzso to zzso switch in zzso cancer cells and zzso whereas zzso expression of zzso in zzso cancer zzso and zzso cell lines promoted zzso transition zzso increased cell zzso and zzso By contrast, knocking down zzso using zzso in zzso cell lines reversed these zzso 

zzso zzso in invasive or zzso zzso cancer and plays a critical role in zzso via control of zzso zzso zzso may be a potential marker or target for improving the diagnosis and treatment of zzso zzso zzso
