Studies were performed to determine the influence of the zzso zzso zzso on sensitivity to zzso zzso in four human breast tumor cell lines and one zzso breast tumor zzso zzso did not interfere with the effectiveness of zzso in any of the cell lines zzso zzso also failed to protect zzso cells against the zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso enhanced sensitivity to zzso markedly in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells and moderately in the zzso 3 and zzso cell zzso In the zzso cells, zzso increased the extent of DNA damage induced by zzso as well as the extent of zzso cell zzso zzso did not influence sensitivity to zzso in bone zzso cells or zzso In an zzso model of breast cancer zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso did not zzso the zzso effects of zzso zzso the combination of zzso with zzso was no more toxic to the animals than zzso zzso Given that zzso has been shown to have the potential to protect the heart against the toxicity of zzso these studies suggest that the inclusion of zzso with conventional zzso protocols involving zzso (and possibly zzso zzso and/or zzso should not compromise the zzso effectiveness of these drugs nor enhance their toxicity to the zzso
