Previous studies found that zzso zzso zzso is abundantly expressed in zzso zzso However, the dynamic role of zzso in zzso zzso cells remains zzso The objective of this study is to evaluate the zzso roles of zzso in zzso zzso using zzso knockout mouse model and zzso cell zzso 

zzso and NO zzso zzso expression zzso analysis, light and transmission electron zzso zzso zzso DNA damage and repair determination, and zzso signaling examination were performed in zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was highly expressed in mouse zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 45 S zzso zzso related to DNA damage and zzso were significantly regulated in zzso zzso zzso DNA damage and zzso highly occurred in zzso zzso zzso zzso and NO levels were significantly higher in zzso zzso zzso than that in zzso which may affect zzso metabolism and the zzso signals related to DNA damage and zzso These findings were consistent with the in zzso study in zzso cells that, after zzso zzso exhibited cell cycle delay and zzso 

zzso may play an important role in protecting zzso zzso by balancing zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso function zzso DNA damage and zzso in zzso which can result in zzso zzso
