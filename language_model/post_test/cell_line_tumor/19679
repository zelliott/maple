zzso L zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso that is activated on binding to short zzso zzso zzso a feature that has led to its use in zzso therapeutic zzso By attaching a zzso zzso to the zzso zzso of standard zzso zzso it is possible to activate zzso L and guide it to specific zzso for zzso These zzso zzso zzso have been used successfully to target a variety of cellular and viral zzso zzso is a nuclear zzso complex that zzso zzso DNA and contributes to cellular zzso zzso is composed of a protein zzso zzso and an zzso zzso or zzso zzso both of which are critical for zzso zzso We describe the characterization of zzso zzso zzso targeting the zzso component of zzso zzso zzso zzso designed zzso zzso molecules were zzso for their abilities to selectively degrade zzso in a zzso zzso Of the five zzso tested, one zzso zzso zzso by zzso and two others zzso and zzso were also found to be highly active zzso zzso The ability of zzso zzso and its zzso zzso to degrade zzso in cultured tumor cells was assessed by real-time zzso In these studies, zzso and zzso effectively zzso zzso in a variety of zzso tumor cell zzso The zzso degradation studies were extended to growth zzso to determine whether zzso zzso affected tumor cell viability or zzso zzso treatment resulted in reduced tumor cell viability over the course of zzso growth zzso effects that were zzso by zzso with zzso To extend these results to an in zzso system, nude mice were implanted zzso or zzso with zzso prostate tumors and treated with zzso zzso mice exhibited enhanced tumor cell zzso and reduced tumor volume as compared with zzso These findings demonstrated the effectiveness of highly active forms of zzso zzso against zzso and also highlight the usefulness of the zzso system in predicting zzso efficacy before to inception of zzso and in zzso zzso
