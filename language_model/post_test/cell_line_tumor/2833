Heat zzso proteins 70 zzso is a family of highly zzso molecules that maintain the function of crucial cellular pathways during zzso zzso derived from tumor cells is bound with tumor zzso peptides from the diverse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso preparations after ex zzso administration permit zzso presenting cells zzso to present tumor zzso to their cell surface and induce tumor specific immunity in many types of zzso by directly zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso In the present investigation, we have demonstrated that zzso with tumor cell derived zzso lead to an effective survival advantage in mice with minimal residual tumor cells from which zzso is zzso by involvement of immune cell types in the rejection of tumor in the zzso zzso zzso host mice and their zzso zzso zzso It has been observed that zzso zzso zzso specific zzso immunity and effectively zzso tumors in the host mice, thereby enhancing survival of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso effectively primed specific zzso response and increased tumor cell zzso independently of zzso zzso zzso zzso in type I zzso in the serum of zzso zzso mice was also observed that indicates its zzso property in the zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso mice did not show any systemic zzso zzso it could be assumed as safe and might be clinically useful for vaccination against zzso human zzso
