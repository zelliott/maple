zzso zzso zzso zzso having both zzso and zzso segments of various lengths were zzso by a combination of zzso and zzso These zzso zzso zzso formed zzso zzso consisting of a zzso zzso core and a zzso zzso shell in zzso zzso The block zzso was characterized using zzso zzso and gel zzso zzso zzso zzso Due to its zzso structure, this block zzso forms zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso were extensively studied by dynamic light scattering zzso zzso zzso and transmission electron zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed the lowest zzso and demonstrated little zzso when exposed to zzso pancreatic cancer zzso In order to assess its application in biomedical area, the zzso drug prednisone zzso was loaded as the model drug in the zzso zzso In zzso release behavior of prednisone zzso was investigated, which showed a dramatic responsive zzso switching behavior according to the zzso structural changes of a zzso core zzso All of zzso features are quite feasible for utilizing it as a novel intelligent zzso zzso
