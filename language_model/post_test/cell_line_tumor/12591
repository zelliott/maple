A growing body of work implicates zzso in particular zzso and its zzso in the progression and zzso zzso of various zzso including breast zzso Various agents have been used to block the zzso interaction as a means of zzso cancer zzso However, as a potent zzso factor for zzso zzso also has the potential to enhance zzso zzso To further zzso its role in breast cancer zzso zzso and its zzso zzso were zzso in the zzso zzso mouse model of breast zzso 

While expression of zzso significantly inhibited zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso inhibited both zzso and primary tumor zzso The effects of zzso zzso were attributed to an immune response characterized by the induction of zzso T cell activity, enhanced zzso zzso increased numbers of zzso cells in the zzso zzso zzso and reduced zzso of zzso zzso cells in the zzso 

This study highlights the need to consider carefully therapeutic strategies that block zzso zzso zzso that boost zzso levels at the primary tumor site may prove more effective in the treatment of zzso breast zzso
