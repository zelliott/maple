DNA zzso has emerged as a promising zzso for prostate cancer zzso In this report, we screened 36 candidate genes generated by a zzso analysis of the human zzso and found that the melanoma cell zzso zzso zzso was an excellent candidate for zzso zzso in prostate zzso 

zzso sequencing of zzso zzso DNA, conventional zzso zzso zzso real-time quantitative zzso zzso zzso colony formation zzso and statistical zzso 

We found that the melanoma cell zzso zzso zzso gene promoter was specifically zzso in prostate cancer cell lines and primary prostate cancer zzso but not in zzso prostate zzso zzso by direct sequencing of zzso zzso DNA and conventional zzso zzso zzso Further analysis with quantitative MSP showed greater zzso of the zzso promoter zzso zzso in primary prostate cancer compared to zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso potential precursors of prostate zzso showed an intermediate zzso rate of zzso zzso We further observed that zzso promoter zzso was directly correlated with tumor stage zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso score zzso zzso zzso in primary prostate zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso promoter zzso deserves further attention as a potential diagnostic zzso DNA marker in human prostate zzso
