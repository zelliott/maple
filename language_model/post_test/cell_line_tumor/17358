Current zzso therapy for breast cancer is limited by the mixed zzso and zzso activity of selective zzso zzso zzso Here we show that the function of zinc fingers in the zzso zzso zzso domain zzso is susceptible to chemical zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which selectively block binding of the zzso zzso to its responsive element and subsequent zzso These compounds also significantly inhibit zzso cell zzso markedly reduce tumor mass in nude mice bearing human zzso breast cancer zzso and interfere with zzso and zzso regulatory gene zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis support a molecular mechanism zzso zzso agents zzso disrupt the vulnerable zzso zinc finger, thus suppressing zzso zzso breast zzso zzso Our results provide the proof of principle for a new strategy to inhibit breast cancer at the level of DNA zzso rather than the classical antagonism of zzso zzso
