zzso zzso gene 1 zzso also called zzso zzso zzso and zzso is expressed in various normal zzso and suppressed in several zzso In this study, whether zzso expression was correlated with differentiation of human breast cancer cells has been zzso zzso expression level of zzso was closely correlated with differentiation status of breast cancer cell zzso Furthermore, sodium zzso zzso an zzso of cellular zzso increased the expression of zzso a zzso differentiation marker, together with zzso of zzso in breast cancer zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso by its zzso resulted in reduced zzso of zzso zzso analysis showed zzso of zzso and zzso or milk fat protein zzso another differentiation marker of breast zzso in the mouse zzso model of breast zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso expanded the differentiated area in the zzso model of breast zzso In human breast cancer, using samples from 45 patients, we also showed close relationship between zzso and zzso or zzso zzso Altogether, in zzso and in zzso data demonstrated a possible role of zzso in differentiation of breast zzso We concluded that zzso could be used as a zzso for differentiation of breast cancer for both diagnostic and therapeutic zzso
