zzso cells are potent and specialized zzso presenting cells, which play a crucial role in initiating and amplifying both the innate and zzso immune zzso The zzso zzso vaccination against cancer has been clinically achieved promising zzso But there are still many challenges in its clinical application, especially for how to identify the functional zzso 

The zzso zzso were isolated from human peripheral blood after plastic adherence and zzso to approximately zzso with cocktail zzso zzso The immature zzso cells and mature zzso cells were induced by traditional zzso The resulting zzso cells were zzso with normal cells and cancer zzso The functional state of zzso cells including immature zzso cells zzso and mature zzso cells zzso under different zzso zzso were investigated by zzso transformed infrared zzso zzso and molecular biological zzso 

The results of zzso transformed infrared zzso showed that the gene zzso activity and energy states of zzso cells were specifically suppressed by tumor cells zzso zzso or zzso The expression levels of zzso B zzso in zzso cells were also specifically inhibited by zzso factors zzso zzso or zzso Moreover, the ratios of zzso zzso of zzso transformed infrared zzso at given wave numbers were closely correlated with the expression levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Our results confirmed that the ratios of zzso zzso of zzso transformed infrared zzso at given wave numbers were positively correlated with the expression levels of zzso suggesting that zzso transformed infrared zzso technology could be clinically applied to identify the functional states of zzso cell when performing zzso zzso zzso It's significant for the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso vaccination clinical preparation zzso
