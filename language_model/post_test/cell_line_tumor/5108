zzso zzso zzso which arises in the small zzso ducts of the liver, is the second most common liver zzso Although zzso of zzso zzso expression has been shown to be a potent sign of zzso tumors, zzso profiles of zzso remains zzso We performed sequencing analysis of the small zzso libraries of 2 zzso cell lines zzso and zzso and one normal zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso to produce the zzso profiles of zzso in zzso Furthermore, by means of the real-time zzso chain reaction zzso we validated the differential expression of zzso cloned exclusively or predominantly from each of the cell zzso A total of zzso small zzso clones were obtained from the 3 cell zzso We identified 27 zzso that were expressed exclusively or predominantly in each cell zzso zzso validation with the real-time zzso confirmed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were expressed specifically in zzso but were zzso in the zzso cell zzso Our study provides important information for zzso studies of the functional zzso of zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso identified in this study may serve as potential zzso for zzso
