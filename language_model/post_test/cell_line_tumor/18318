There is a large amount of scientific evidence showing that fruits and vegetables lower the risk of zzso However, the responsible molecular mechanisms remain poorly zzso Our previous studies have demonstrated that zzso of zzso zzso activity is associated with cancer cell zzso which may also be the major mechanism responsible for the zzso effects of green tea zzso In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that some fruits and vegetables inhibit tumor cell zzso activity and that this zzso contributes to their zzso zzso We report that the extracts of apple and grape are more potent than onion, tomato and celery in: zzso zzso the zzso zzso activity in leukemia zzso T cell zzso zzso accumulating the zzso proteins in intact zzso T zzso zzso inducing zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso in intact zzso T zzso and zzso inducing the appearance of zzso cells zzso in prostate cancer zzso over the normal zzso zzso cell zzso We also found that zzso extract had some effect on zzso T cell extract and the prostate zzso cell line but not on intact zzso T zzso Our findings suggest that the zzso is a zzso molecular target for, at least, the extracts of apple, grape and onion, and that the zzso of zzso activity by these fruits or vegetable may contribute to their zzso effects, although other molecular mechanisms may also be zzso
