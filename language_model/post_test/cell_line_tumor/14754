zzso zzso zzso 1 to 6 zzso generate zzso in an zzso manner, and expression of individual zzso has been shown to enhance the synthesis of zzso with particular zzso chain zzso However, the contribution of each zzso to zzso levels of specific zzso species has not been zzso We investigated the zzso of individual zzso in the zzso human breast zzso cell line by using zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso of each zzso resulted in zzso of zzso zzso Additionally, each zzso zzso produced unique effects on the levels of multiple zzso zzso For example, zzso of zzso decreased very zzso zzso but increased levels of zzso zzso and zzso expression and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso but increased zzso expression and caused zzso zzso to be zzso zzso of individual zzso failed to decrease total zzso or zzso zzso zzso Treatment with zzso targeting combined zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not change overall zzso or zzso mass but caused zzso of zzso and zzso and promoted zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso metabolism is robustly regulated by both zzso in zzso zzso synthesis and zzso of zzso zzso
