zzso zzso zzso zzso which can be produced by host and tumor cells in the tumor zzso is intimately involved in tumor zzso In the present study, to pursue the possibility that zzso could be a therapeutic target in the management of zzso zzso a specific zzso zzso was orally administered to zzso mice that were zzso implanted or zzso injected with either zzso Lewis lung zzso zzso or zzso zzso melanoma zzso The systemic administration of zzso was found to reduce the size of subcutaneous tumors and the extent of zzso regardless of zzso zzso levels from the tumor zzso zzso also reduced the extent of zzso in the tumors and inhibited zzso migration and tube formation by human zzso vein zzso cells in zzso Then, to determine whether host or tumor zzso was more crucial in tumor progression and zzso zzso or zzso mice were zzso implanted or zzso injected with LLC or zzso zzso LLC zzso zzso progression was shown to be controlled by the presence of host zzso and not affected by the zzso levels in the zzso Similarly, host zzso played a more crucial role in tumor zzso than did tumor zzso These observations suggest that regardless of the zzso levels in the zzso the systemic administration of zzso exerts an zzso effect through its interaction with host zzso This zzso effect might be zzso by the zzso properties of zzso
