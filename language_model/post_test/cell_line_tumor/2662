It has been reported that cancer stem cells may contribute to zzso zzso through preferential zzso of the DNA damage checkpoint response and an increase in DNA repair zzso We have examined DNA repair in five stem and zzso zzso cell zzso The population doubling time was significantly increased in stem compared with zzso cells, and enhanced zzso of zzso and zzso zzso was observed in zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso Neither DNA base zzso or zzso break repair nor resolution of zzso nuclear zzso were increased in zzso compared with zzso zzso We conclude that zzso stem cells display zzso cell cycle and enhanced zzso zzso of checkpoint proteins that might contribute to their zzso whereas enhanced DNA repair is not a common feature of these zzso
