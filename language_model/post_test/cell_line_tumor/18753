Human zzso interactive protein zzso gene is a novel member of the Ras zzso family and has been demonstrated to be a tumor zzso gene zzso by zzso in prostate zzso We analyzed zzso and expression status of zzso in breast zzso 

The promoter region of zzso was divided into two regions zzso and zzso following our previous report on prostate cancer, and zzso status was determined in breast cancer cell lines with zzso DNA zzso zzso was zzso with real-time reverse zzso to find that zzso zzso showed the inverse relationship with zzso On the basis of sequence data, we developed zzso zzso for zzso and zzso regions and applied to zzso 

zzso zzso was detected in 11 of 25 breast cancer cell lines zzso and 15 of 39 primary tumors zzso at the zzso region and in 12 of 25 cell lines zzso and 13 of 39 tumors zzso at the zzso zzso In addition, gene expression was restored in zzso cell lines with zzso confirming that zzso caused gene zzso We also examined the relationship between zzso zzso and zzso features in primary tumors and found that zzso in the zzso region was associated with progressive zzso status of zzso 

We developed zzso zzso for zzso and examined its zzso status in breast zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso frequently is present in breast cancer and plays a key role in zzso zzso suggesting the relationship between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of breast zzso
