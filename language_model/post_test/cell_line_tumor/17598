zzso zzso strains displayed different degrees of attachment to zzso cell zzso with two distinct adherence patterns, termed zzso zzso and diffuse zzso The LA zzso predominated over the zzso zzso The zzso zzso strains expressing zzso pattern zzso mostly with high index values zzso or zzso Low zzso index zzso was mainly observed among zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed positive results for zzso of both LA and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso surface proteins zzso zzso directly with zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited LA and zzso adherence patterns and ability to induce zzso zzso The experimental zzso also pointed to zzso as putative zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso
