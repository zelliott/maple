The zzso barrier zzso zzso the entry of the majority of zzso agents into the zzso Previous studies have illustrated the feasibility of drug delivery across the zzso using focused ultrasound zzso and zzso Here, we investigated the effect of zzso delivery of zzso on survival in rats with and zzso zzso cells zzso in the zzso Each rat received either: zzso no treatment zzso N zzso zzso zzso zzso only (N zzso zzso zzso IV zzso zzso zzso only; N zzso 17), or zzso zzso with concurrent IV injections of zzso zzso zzso N zzso zzso zzso by magnetic resonance imaging zzso showed that zzso reduced tumor growth compared with zzso zzso Further, we observed a modest but significant increase in median survival time after a single treatment zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso whereas neither zzso nor zzso had any significant impact on survival on its zzso These results suggest that combined zzso zzso disruption may significantly increase the zzso efficacy of zzso zzso in the zzso
