zzso zzso zzso factor 1) performs a crucial role in zzso the response to zzso However, other zzso factors are also capable of regulating zzso zzso zzso In a previous report, we demonstrated that the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso factor 2) regulates zzso gene transcription, along with zzso In the present study, we show that the protein stability of zzso is induced by zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and that zzso induction enhances zzso protein stability via direct protein zzso The zzso of zzso using small interfering zzso and zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso plays a key role in the maintenance of the expression level and zzso activity of zzso Furthermore, we determined that zzso interacts directly with zzso both in zzso and in zzso and competes with the zzso zzso protein zzso for zzso zzso zzso these results show that protein stabilization of zzso under hypoxic conditions is required for the induction of the protein stability and zzso activity of zzso for efficient zzso gene zzso
