To clarify the zzso of pancreatic cancer cells by interference with the zzso component of the zzso reverse zzso zzso complex and evaluate zzso of zzso zzso pancreatic cancer cells to zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso of full length zzso zzso was zzso into a zzso expression zzso zzso in zzso orientation to construct an zzso zzso expression zzso The plasmids were introduced into zzso cells, a human pancreatic zzso cell line, by zzso and zzso stable zzso were zzso zzso stable clones were screened for the presence of zzso insert by zzso with zzso and zzso reverse zzso located on the zzso of the zzso site of zzso zzso Cell growth rate, zzso zzso zzso activity, and zzso growth property were zzso Finally, zzso of zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso was zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso zzso was evident in the zzso transformed cells, and zzso activity was markedly decreased compared to control cells in standard zzso zzso Furthermore, the proliferation and the zzso growth ability in zzso expressing cells were significantly decreased compared with the control parental zzso However, no crisis or zzso phenomena was zzso zzso zzso appears to increase zzso cell's zzso to zzso zzso zzso but not to differentiation zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These data indicate that zzso is probably a critical component of human zzso activity and that zzso of the zzso component of human zzso is an effective target for zzso strategy and zzso zzso can increase zzso cell's zzso to zzso
