Human zzso zzso T cells are potent zzso zzso of innate immunity involved in zzso immune zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso subset targeting multiple myeloma zzso has not previously been zzso 

zzso T cells were zzso from peripheral blood zzso cells of healthy donors and patients with zzso by zzso sorting and expanded with zzso zzso together with zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso T cells were zzso by flow zzso and used in a zzso flow zzso zzso zzso zzso release and blocking studies were zzso zzso myeloma cells were zzso from zzso patients' bone zzso zzso 

zzso T cells expanded from healthy donors displayed prominent zzso by specific zzso against patients' zzso zzso zzso zzso bone zzso plasma zzso zzso T cells isolated from zzso patients showed equally significant killing of myeloma cells as zzso T cells from normal zzso zzso T cells showed similarly potent zzso against myeloma cell lines zzso and zzso and plasma cell leukemia zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso against myeloma cells was zzso in part through the zzso zzso zzso in addition to involvement of Natural zzso zzso zzso zzso accessory zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso T cells were shown to exert zzso activity equal to that of zzso T zzso 

We have shown for the first time that zzso T cells are highly zzso and have therefore established zzso zzso T cells as a potential candidate for a novel tumor zzso
