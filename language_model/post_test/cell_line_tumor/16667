zzso of zzso synthesis has been associated with zzso disorders such as zzso and zzso We examined the changes in zzso zzso and gene expression in zzso zzso when the synthesis of zzso is zzso by knocking down zzso pal zzso zzso 1, 2, and 3 zzso or zzso zzso 1 zzso Although knocking down all zzso zzso is necessary to reduce total zzso significantly, depleting zzso is sufficient to produce a similar zzso zzso analysis of distribution and zzso of multiple zzso classes indicates an increase in zzso in zzso cells, whereas zzso depletion leads to the zzso of zzso zzso free fatty zzso and zzso When zzso zzso synthesis is zzso the zzso profiles indicate zzso in zzso zzso zzso of genes involved in general zzso trafficking, and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso strongly affects the expression of genes involved with zzso zzso Changes in zzso acid, sugar, and zzso zzso as well as zzso trafficking between zzso are more prominent in zzso zzso These studies are the first to provide a direct and comprehensive understanding at the zzso and zzso levels of how zzso zzso respond to changes in the zzso of zzso zzso
