zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso signaling protein that previously has been shown to be a master regulator of a poor zzso gene signature in invasive breast cancer and to mediate the action of zzso Since zzso growth factor zzso zzso like zzso is often expressed in zzso zzso zzso breast cancer, we set out to investigate the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso another facet of the zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso cell lines were assessed for zzso of zzso and levels of downstream genes by zzso and nuclear protein extract zzso following treatment with zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A cohort of zzso human breast tumors was also assessed by zzso 

zzso treatment of cell lines resulted in increased zzso nuclear zzso This effect was inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment was also associated with zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as regulation of the zzso downstream target zzso zzso When zzso activity was knocked down, zzso levels were restored to zzso treatment zzso Analysis of zzso and zzso expression in a cohort of invasive breast tumors by tissue zzso and zzso confirmed a relationship between zzso and increased nuclear zzso within the zzso subset zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The same association was also confirmed for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and high zzso nuclear expression was most frequent in tumors that were positive for both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is a target of zzso signaling in zzso cell lines and breast tumors and therefore may be a common central factor and potential therapeutic target for important cell signaling pathways in zzso breast zzso
