zzso is one of the most prevalent childhood cognitive disorders, affecting approximately zzso of school-age zzso We have recently identified a risk zzso associated with zzso on zzso zzso which spans the zzso gene and portions of zzso and zzso Here we show that in the presence of the risk zzso the expression of the zzso gene is reduced but the expression of the other two genes remains zzso Using in zzso zzso we detect a very distinct expression pattern of the zzso gene in the developing cerebral zzso of mouse and human zzso Moreover, interference with rat zzso expression in zzso leads to impaired zzso migration in the developing cerebral zzso These data suggest a direct link between a specific genetic background and a biological mechanism leading to the development of zzso the risk zzso on zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene which is required for zzso migration during the formation of the cerebral zzso
