We found previously that zzso inhibitor of zzso protein zzso a potent zzso inhibitor of zzso is zzso in colon zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso has been shown to exert zzso and zzso effects in many cancer cell zzso However, neither zzso zzso alone nor zzso using zzso zzso is potent enough to control colon zzso We explored whether zzso zzso and zzso zzso offer a synergistic zzso effect in colon zzso zzso and zzso cells were treated with zzso or zzso zzso zzso Cell growth and zzso were zzso zzso mice were zzso zzso with zzso cells with or without oral zzso zzso growth, zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso growth zzso and zzso were more prominent in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso correlated with enhanced zzso of zzso and zzso zzso which were more profound in zzso zzso zzso of cells with zzso inhibitor zzso also zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly retarded the growth of zzso tumors, more significantly so in zzso zzso zzso Reduction of tumor size was associated with reduced expression of zzso vascular zzso growth factor, and zzso as well as increased zzso Loss of zzso significantly zzso zzso cancer cells to zzso zzso zzso and zzso of cell zzso Thus, simultaneous zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso may have a synergistic zzso effect against colon zzso
