zzso a novel zzso agent, could induce zzso and inhibit the growth of vascular zzso in several tumor cell lines and zzso zzso It has been suggested that the zzso effect of chemotherapy could be increased by combining it with an zzso agent in zzso zzso The present study explored the potential to increase the zzso effect of zzso by combining it with zzso in mouse zzso breast cancer models, and the underlining mechanism was zzso zzso was zzso in zzso to improve the water zzso In zzso zzso zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso cells via zzso and significantly enhanced the zzso of zzso cells induced by zzso In zzso the systemic administration of zzso zzso and zzso significantly decreased tumor growth through increased tumor cell zzso compared with either treatment zzso zzso these findings suggest that zzso zzso may augment the induction of zzso in zzso cells in zzso and in zzso and this combined treatment has shown synergistic suppression in tumor progression according to the analysis of zzso The present study may be important in future exploration of the potential application of the combined approach in the treatment of breast zzso
