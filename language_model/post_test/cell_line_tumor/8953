As one of the most lethal zzso pancreatic cancer presents poor prognosis with an overall zzso survival of less than zzso We previously reported that zzso a member of the zzso zzso family that encodes zzso zzso is zzso expressed in human pancreatic cancer zzso In the current study, we investigated the role of zzso in promoting tumor growth and zzso in an zzso nude mouse model of human pancreatic zzso 

We constructed zzso zzso for human zzso and a zzso zzso of human zzso zzso the zzso zzso generated from these zzso were then used to zzso the human pancreatic cancer cell line zzso to establish stable cell zzso We assessed cell proliferation using zzso tumor growth, and zzso zzso in an zzso mouse model of pancreatic zzso While tumor size was measured using magnetic resonance imaging, the tumor zzso were excised for protein extraction and zzso analysis to detect vascular zzso growth factor zzso expression and vessel zzso 

We established an zzso nude mouse model of human pancreatic zzso We observed that zzso promoted the proliferation of human pancreatic cancer cells, both zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso is required for zzso of primary human pancreatic tumors zzso and promotion of zzso through the induction of zzso zzso 

zzso can promote tumor growth and zzso by stimulating the zzso zzso
