The zzso dependence of zzso zzso on zzso contact in zzso cells has been established zzso zzso contact occurred in an ultrasound standing wave trap designed to form and zzso a zzso cell aggregate, allowing zzso adhesive interactions to proceed, free from the influences of solid zzso zzso spreading at the point of contact and change in cell zzso reached 50% of their final values within zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso increased at the interface but lagged behind membrane zzso reaching 50% of its final value in zzso zzso zzso had good mechanical stability after 15 zzso in the zzso The implication of this zzso dependence on the sequential progress of zzso processes is zzso These results provide insight into how zzso cell zzso with some liver cell functions might be assembled in a zzso controlled manner in a 3-D ultrasound zzso
