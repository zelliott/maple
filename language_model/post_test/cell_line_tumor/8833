zzso are promising targeted therapeutic agents zzso an zzso zzso that specifically binds to diseased cells, and a zzso zzso zzso components from bacteria or plants can trigger a zzso immune response, so that human zzso molecules are more zzso In this context, the zzso zzso B has been successfully tested in zzso zzso against different cancer cells in zzso and in zzso Our aim here was to introduce zzso M as an alternative and novel component of human zzso fusion zzso We fused it to the humanized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which specifically binds to zzso an zzso zzso zzso on activated zzso cells and zzso zzso We show that the humanized zzso fusion protein zzso specifically targets the acute zzso leukemia cell line zzso in zzso and is zzso with an zzso between zzso and zzso zzso These findings were confirmed ex zzso using zzso primary cells from patients, which were killed by zzso M despite the presence of the zzso B inhibitor zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso M is a promising new zzso inducing component for zzso because it specifically and efficiently kills target cells when fused to a targeting zzso
