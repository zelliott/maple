The zzso are a novel class of zzso zzso zzso I zzso A potential zzso agent was designed by attaching different zzso side chains on the zzso nitrogen as well as on the zzso position of the zzso ring zzso It was hypothesized that zzso on the zzso nitrogen could zzso out toward the DNA major groove while those on the zzso project out toward the DNA minor groove in the zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 was zzso in order to test this zzso zzso It was found unexpectedly that an zzso zzso on the zzso position was zzso zzso under basic conditions to afford a zzso A possible mechanism for this unusual zzso zzso was proposed on the basis of the studies of a zzso model zzso The proposed mechanism was further supported by zzso zzso Although the designed compound 4 showed potent zzso in various cancer cell lines, it was less potent than its zzso counterparts and was not a zzso I zzso
