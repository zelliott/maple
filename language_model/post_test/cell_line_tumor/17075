zzso zzso are increasingly employed as in zzso sensors of zzso and a single zzso can be used as a test zzso An zzso standing wave trap zzso can hold small particles in a zzso zzso This study investigated the conditions for holding zzso zzso in an zzso and its relevance to use in toxicity zzso It can take many hours to reach a zzso end point of cell damage in a standard cellular in zzso zzso zzso and the process might be accelerated through increased sample flow past the zzso A zzso was employed here to zzso and hold zzso zzso stationary against a flow of 3 zzso zzso when the acoustic pressure zzso is zzso zzso The zzso drive frequency was zzso zzso zzso zzso in the standing wave chamber generated 1 zzso zzso flow past a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso latex particle in the absence of sample zzso The conditions required to form zzso of cells of a zzso cell line in a single half wavelength zzso standing wave zzso are also described zzso It is argued that the manipulation capabilities demonstrated may have potential in increasing the efficiency of in zzso zzso detection by zzso zzso visual zzso zzso zzso observations of zzso zzso in the standing wave in the presence of the zzso zzso do suggest accelerated loss of viability compared with zzso
