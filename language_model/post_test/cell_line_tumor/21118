zzso disease zzso is an zzso dominant zzso neurodegenerative disorder caused by expansion of a zzso repeat in the zzso region of zzso zzso expansion causes zzso zzso to zzso and accumulate in the zzso and zzso of zzso The zzso zzso fragments of zzso zzso are toxic to zzso cells and may be involved in the zzso in HD patient zzso Although nuclear zzso zzso has been found to affect gene zzso the effect of zzso zzso zzso remains to be zzso We established zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso cells that express soluble zzso fragments of zzso containing 20 zzso or 150 zzso zzso zzso In these stable cell lines, both zzso and zzso are zzso distributed in the zzso without zzso zzso However, the stable zzso cells are deficient in zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso cells and cells zzso expressing zzso stable zzso cells also have decreased viability and are more susceptible to zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso soluble zzso zzso is also toxic to zzso
