The zzso zzso zzso belongs to a large family of zzso molecules called zzso and zzso zzso which mediate zzso zzso cell migration, and serve as entry receptors for zzso It has been recently shown that human zzso cells recognize zzso through the zzso zzso which triggers zzso cell stimulation in association with zzso zzso In this study, we show that zzso cells recognize zzso through an additional zzso zzso or T zzso increased late expression zzso zzso promotes zzso cell zzso to target cells expressing zzso stimulates zzso of activated zzso cells, and mediates acquisition of zzso from target zzso Thus, zzso cells have evolved a dual zzso system that recognizes zzso and zzso molecules on target cells and mediates zzso cell zzso and triggering of zzso zzso As zzso is highly expressed in certain tumors, this zzso system may be critical for zzso cell recognition of zzso
