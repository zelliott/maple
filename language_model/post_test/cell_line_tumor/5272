This study aimed to investigate the mechanisms of action of zzso an inverse zzso of zzso factor zzso capable of inducing zzso in human acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso 

Gene expression profiling followed by zzso zzso and zzso analyses were used to monitor zzso effects in zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and blasts from patients with different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with small interfering zzso was also zzso 

We have demonstrated that zzso zzso in zzso cells is characterized by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso We observed an increase in zzso protein accompanied by a decrease in zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso and by zzso box zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso C release and zzso zzso marked the late zzso zzso We have found that zzso triggered zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cells where zzso was zzso but not in zzso and zzso cells where zzso was zzso Finally, we show that zzso zzso in zzso cells by zzso small interfering zzso resulted in a significant reduction of drug-induced zzso 

We demonstrated that zzso is a powerful zzso agent with interesting zzso opportunities to treat zzso and described mechanisms of drug-induced intrinsic and zzso zzso both in zzso cell lines and blasts from zzso patients by addressing zzso as the master regulator of the whole zzso
