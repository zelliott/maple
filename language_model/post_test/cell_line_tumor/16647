zzso options for treatment of zzso breast zzso are limited and identification of molecular targets for novel therapies to treat this aggressive cancer is urgently zzso Recently, zzso a zzso box zzso factor, was identified as a functionally important zzso of breast cancer aggressiveness and the zzso breast cancer zzso However, the mechanism through which zzso controls aggressiveness of zzso breast cancer remains to be zzso Here, we identify zzso zzso 7 zzso as a key downstream zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso is significantly correlated in breast cancer samples and cell lines at both the zzso and protein zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso cell lines resulted in significantly increased expression of zzso and an zzso increase in zzso In zzso experiments, zzso zzso zzso in zzso breast cancer cell lines resulted in decreased expression of zzso without decreased expression of other zzso zzso We also demonstrate that elevated zzso of zzso and zzso is an independent predictor of patient outcome in zzso analyses of two breast cancer patient zzso Together, our findings identify zzso as a novel mechanism through which zzso may regulate the zzso breast cancer invasive zzso and the propensity of these zzso to zzso Furthermore, our findings demonstrate for the first time a correlation between zzso expression and zzso breast zzso suggesting that zzso may be a useful therapeutic target for treatment of this zzso
