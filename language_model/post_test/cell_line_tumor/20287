zzso zzso and zzso therapy zzso are standard treatments for advanced prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso is recognized as an important zzso feature likely to impact on both zzso and zzso response, and this study therefore aimed to characterize the vascular responses to zzso and zzso in experimental zzso 

Using mice implanted with zzso PC zzso vascular responses to zzso and zzso by zzso were zzso in zzso by zzso zzso before zzso zzso were analyzed both zzso and by zzso zzso zzso image parameters were correlated to the results from ex zzso quantitative fluorescent zzso analysis zzso of tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso performed on tissue sections made from tumors excised directly after zzso zzso 

Compared to zzso zzso tumors, an improved and highly functional zzso was detected in zzso zzso tumors, reflected by increases in zzso zzso parameters and by increased number of vessels zzso vessel density zzso and vessel area fraction zzso from zzso Although total hypoxic zzso ( zzso did not change, estimated acute zzso scores zzso proportion of zzso zzso within zzso from zzso zzso increased in zzso tumors compared to in zzso zzso Five to six months after zzso renewed zzso zzso tumor growth appeared with an even further enhanced tumor zzso Compared to the large vascular changes induced by zzso zzso induced minor vascular zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso parameters unveiled the zzso parameters area under curve zzso from initial zzso to strongly correlate with zzso and zzso whereas zzso of vessel size zzso by zzso zzso required zzso zzso zzso was not correlated to any zzso zzso zzso however, zzso may be estimated after zzso zzso Interestingly, such modeling also detected tumor necrosis very zzso 

zzso zzso reliably allows zzso assessment of zzso vascular zzso The findings of increased tumor zzso after zzso encourage further studies into whether these changes are beneficial for combined zzso or if treatment with zzso therapy may be a strategy to improve the therapeutic efficacy of zzso in advanced zzso
