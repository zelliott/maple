zzso have evolved mechanisms to inhibit the innate immune response to zzso The aim of this study was to develop an efficient screening method to identify viral proteins and their ability to block zzso signaling using zzso C virus zzso as an zzso The zzso cell zzso system was used in combination with transient zzso of zzso proteins in this zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso zzso to treat zzso cells, it was established that transient protein expression in this cell system yielded zzso and zzso cell survival for the positive zzso zzso and negative controls zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso resulted in zzso cell survival, consistent with previous reports, while expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso cell zzso zzso was subsequently shown to inhibit zzso of zzso at the zzso zzso zzso 

the zzso cell zzso system can be adapted for transient screening to examine the ability of viral proteins or other potential zzso to block the zzso signaling zzso We show that zzso zzso is able to block this zzso at the stage of zzso zzso zzso zzso
