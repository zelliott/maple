Gene therapy is not successful due to lack of safe gene delivery zzso low zzso efficiency and inability to target the particular zzso Here, we zzso a zzso block zzso zzso as zzso which consists of zzso zzso for zzso with DNA and enhancing zzso efficiency due to zzso ability of zzso zzso zzso for stability after systemic administration of the gene and zzso zzso as a specific zzso to target zzso zzso zzso zzso showed efficient zzso with zzso Cell viability zzso demonstrated that zzso had low toxicity compared to zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso showed higher zzso efficiency in zzso cells than zzso ones due to the recognition of zzso in the zzso gene carrier by zzso in the cells for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso the serum had no effect on zzso efficiency of zzso due to the presence of zzso zzso in the block zzso This study reveals that zzso zzso block zzso can specifically deliver gene to zzso zzso
