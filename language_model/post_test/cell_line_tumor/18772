zzso zzso has multiple zzso zzso however, its use has been limited by its short zzso in zzso This limitation may be overcome by zzso gene zzso We evaluated zzso therapy in an zzso mouse model of zzso 

Mice that were treated zzso 5 days after tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso with an zzso zzso that contains the mouse zzso gene zzso control zzso zzso or saline zzso Mice were monitored for multiple outcome measures and zzso To determine the mechanism of zzso effect, flow zzso of zzso fluid was performed to differentiate immune cell zzso zzso oxide in zzso fluid was measured with an zzso zzso 

zzso burden was decreased and survival was prolonged ( zzso in the zzso group after a single treatment of zzso zzso zzso zzso units, with acceptable zzso By flow zzso an increase in the proportion of natural killer cells (from less than zzso of the gated population to more than zzso zzso and an increase in zzso were seen in the treated zzso Although there was a trend toward increased levels of zzso oxide in zzso treatment groups, it was not statistically zzso 

zzso gene therapy results in decreased tumor burden and improved survival in an aggressive, zzso mouse model of zzso This therapy warrants further evaluation as a treatment for zzso zzso zzso
