Cell behavior is significantly different in two-dimensional and three-dimensional culture conditions, and a number of methods have been developed to establish and study three-dimensional cellular zzso in zzso When grown under zzso conditions, many types of cells form structures called zzso zzso zzso which have been popular models to study cell behavior in a three-dimensional zzso The zzso of zzso derived from zzso cells resembles that of tumors, and there is rapidly increasing interest in using these structures to more accurately understand the dynamics of cancer cells in zzso including their responses to zzso zzso zzso is an extremely useful method to investigate cell behavior in zzso due to its ability to more clearly image fluorescent zzso at some depth in three-dimensional zzso This chapter describes some basic approaches toward visualizing a variety of fluorescent zzso in zzso
