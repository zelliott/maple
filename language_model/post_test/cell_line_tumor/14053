Given that zzso is a tumor zzso that plays a central role in the cellular response to DNA damage and that more than 50% of all zzso have zzso zzso the wider utility of zzso therapy zzso in the treatment of cancer will depend on an understanding of whether zzso status zzso response to zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso of zzso cell lines that differ only in their zzso status to zzso using zzso as the zzso 

Acute zzso and chronic zzso zzso zzso were performed on two zzso zzso zzso and zzso that are zzso except that the latter expresses dominant negative zzso The zzso expression of zzso was determined on western zzso zzso of zzso cell cycle profile analysis, measurement of membrane zzso zzso and changes in zzso membrane potential were investigated using flow zzso 

zzso zzso was observed to be equivalent in zzso and zzso zzso There were no significant differences in cell killing between these zzso in both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso expression did not increase up to 24 h after zzso treatment in both cell zzso There were also no significant differences in the zzso arrest profiles and timing of onset of zzso 

Taken together, these results suggest that the status of zzso may not be important in zzso cell killing or induction of zzso By extension, these results imply that zzso may be used with equal efficacy for the treatment of zzso and zzso zzso
