Chemical aspects of mode of action of zzso and related zzso were zzso These compounds do not zzso DNA nor react with the zzso groups of zzso despite the presence of an zzso zzso They do react readily with biologically important zzso compounds to give products derived from either zzso ring zzso interaction with the zzso group of zzso or opening of the zzso ring of zzso The products from reactions of zzso and related zzso with zzso are not as potent as their parent compounds against tumor zzso These results are consistent with biological studies that show that the mechanism of zzso involves zzso depletion followed by zzso stress leading to zzso
