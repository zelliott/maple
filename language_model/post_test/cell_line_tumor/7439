zzso a member of the selective zzso zzso zzso zzso family, is widely used in the treatment of zzso zzso zzso breast zzso It has previously been shown that high-dose tamoxifen has zzso activity against zzso cells, but whether this effect is drug specific or represents a general property of zzso is zzso In this study, we demonstrate that tamoxifen and zzso a novel zzso with zzso activity, induce zzso cell zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, administration of tamoxifen and zzso suppresses tumor growth in zzso and extends animal survival in zzso zzso zzso None of the eight zzso cell lines examined express either zzso or zzso suggesting the mechanism for zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso is independent of the zzso signaling zzso zzso DNA zzso expression profiling allowed us to identify a subset of genes specifically regulated by tamoxifen and zzso and not by other zzso zzso including nuclear factor zzso with its target genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso We demonstrate that suppression of zzso zzso markedly enhances zzso zzso suggesting a role for zzso in protecting zzso cells from zzso zzso These findings demonstrate for the first time that a zzso other than tamoxifen can induce zzso cell zzso in zzso and in zzso and that the clinical efficacy of zzso for the treatment of zzso zzso could potentially be enhanced by simultaneous zzso of the zzso zzso
