Laboratory and zzso studies have indicated that zzso D3 zzso and dietary omega 3 zzso fatty acids zzso are capable of zzso the proliferation of various cancer zzso 

Human zzso cells zzso were treated with zzso and fish oil alone and in zzso Cell proliferation was measured either by the zzso of zzso into DNA or by counting the cell numbers using a zzso 

The zzso cell proliferation was inhibited by zzso and fish oil in a zzso zzso The lowest effective concentration of zzso was zzso M and zzso M using the zzso incorporation method and the cell counting method, zzso Fish oil also caused a significant zzso in zzso cell proliferation at 25 zzso When zzso cells were treated with zzso in combination with fish oil, it was found that fish oil increased the zzso effect of zzso on zzso cell growth compared to treatment with zzso zzso 

zzso could be used to treat zzso zzso zzso However, the major zzso of zzso limits its zzso An enhanced zzso zzso of zzso cell proliferation in the presence of zzso in the form of fish oil suggests that a lower concentration of zzso could be used to treat zzso zzso in the presence of zzso to decrease the risk of zzso caused by high zzso of zzso
