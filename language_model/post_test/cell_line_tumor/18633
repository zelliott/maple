zzso zzso receptors can act as signaling receptors that transmit information from the zzso environment to the interior of the cell, affecting many fundamental cellular zzso such as cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling depends on the formation of organized zzso complexes that comprise zzso zzso and signaling zzso The identification of molecules that interact with the zzso domain of zzso has been the focus of research aimed to zzso the zzso basis of zzso signal zzso We have identified zzso as a novel zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso In the same zzso zzso also zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso is a peripheral membrane protein and that zzso and zzso interact in zzso and in zzso and zzso at the cell zzso We find that zzso is zzso on zzso zzso zzso of zzso is increased by stress stimuli and decreased by treatment with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of an zzso promoter, indicating that the two proteins interact functionally as zzso We suggest that zzso may constitute a molecular scaffold that contributes to zzso zzso and other zzso with zzso signaling zzso
