zzso is a 38 zzso zzso zzso zzso that was first identified in rat zzso zzso cells zzso It is expressed in normal zzso zzso but is absent from vascular zzso zzso zzso is a commercially available mouse zzso zzso which binds to an zzso on human zzso zzso zzso is therefore highly sensitive and specific for zzso zzso Recent investigations have shown widespread applications of zzso zzso with zzso in evaluating zzso expression as an zzso marker for diagnosis and prognosis in various zzso To determine whether the zzso zzso zzso may be useful for the diagnosis of soft tissue tumors, 125 cases, including 4 kinds of benign tumors, 15 kinds of zzso tumors and 3 kinds of zzso zzso were zzso using the zzso zzso Total zzso was extracted from frozen tumor tissue obtained from 41 corresponding soft tissue tumor patients and 12 kinds of soft tissue tumor cell zzso zzso real-time zzso reactions were zzso zzso and quantitative real-time zzso analyses demonstrated the expression of the zzso protein and zzso in the majority of benign and zzso soft tissue tumors and zzso zzso zzso with the exception of zzso soft part zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Ewing's zzso primitive zzso tumor and zzso which were completely negative for zzso Since it is widely and highly expressed in nearly all kinds of soft tissue tumors, especially in zzso cell zzso zzso type soft tissue tumors and soft tissue tumors of the nervous system, zzso is considered to have little value in the differential diagnosis of soft tissue zzso
