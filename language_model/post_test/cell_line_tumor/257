A new zzso leukemia cell line zzso with normal zzso was established from a patient with acute zzso leukemia zzso following zzso syndrome zzso The cells of zzso are immature blasts and have an immature zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso negative for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A partial expression of zzso zzso zzso and a weak expression of zzso and zzso was zzso The cells are negative for zzso By molecular analysis, a zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso were zzso No zzso were detected in zzso zzso or zzso By real-time zzso a series of 19 zzso was identified which are strongly expressed in zzso In conclusion, a new cell line was established which will be useful for the study of zzso with normal zzso and zzso in zzso and/or zzso
