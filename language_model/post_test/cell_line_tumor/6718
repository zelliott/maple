The expression of zzso growth factors zzso and zzso and their receptors has been reported in a variety of human zzso including zzso zzso zzso growth factors can promote zzso growth directly, or indirectly through promoting the growth of zzso In the present study, we evaluated the expression of zzso and zzso as well as zzso receptors zzso zzso in 39 cases of Hodgkin's lymphoma, including all zzso as well as Hodgkin's zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso and their receptors zzso but not zzso were found to be expressed by the zzso cells in the majority of zzso Interestingly, only zzso but none of the zzso or the other zzso was expressed by the Hodgkin's zzso cell zzso This indicates that only zzso is zzso expressed by Hodgkin's zzso cells, whereas zzso and the other zzso are induced in zzso Culture of the Hodgkin's cell lines under conditions of hypoxic stress could induce vascular zzso growth factor zzso but not zzso zzso zzso in contrast to zzso might be expressed in response to zzso zzso In zzso zzso did not reveal zzso gene amplification or zzso as the cause of zzso zzso zzso as has been shown in a subset of multiple zzso zzso might be expressed as part of the Hodgkin's cell zzso The demonstration of widespread expression of zzso and some of their receptors in Hodgkin's zzso suggests that zzso are important for sustaining growth of the zzso and suggests that zzso zzso could be used as an zzso zzso
