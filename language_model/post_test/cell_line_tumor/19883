The membrane zzso zzso has been shown to alter cellular behavior through both zzso effects on zzso and zzso zzso interactions and its ability to act as an zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is regulated by both zzso and zzso zzso An analysis of the effects of zzso expression on zzso zzso in zzso tumor and zzso cells, which exhibit both zzso growth and contact zzso of growth, showed that the effects are density dependent, with opposing effects on zzso cells and zzso zzso In these cells, zzso interactions through zzso are required for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso However, zzso interactions via zzso inhibit the zzso zzso zzso of zzso reverses both of these zzso In zzso cells, zzso appears to activate the zzso zzso at the level of zzso this zzso does not depend on Ras zzso The increase in zzso activity zzso with an increase in zzso zzso expression in these zzso This zzso of contact zzso is dependent on the number of zzso repeats in the zzso zzso of zzso indicative of an zzso zzso The mechanism by which zzso zzso contact zzso involves a zzso zzso of zzso from zzso junctions at the lateral membrane of the cells to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of contact zzso may be an important mechanism by which tumors progress from an early, more benign state to zzso
