Advanced zzso prostate cancer zzso is a fatal disease, with only zzso therapeutic zzso Though almost zzso of cases of zzso zzso present bone zzso our current understanding of the molecular mechanisms that govern this zzso dissemination remains zzso The main objective of the present study was to identify zzso zzso genes that regulate zzso zzso 

zzso expression profiling was done in human prostate cell lines to identify zzso zzso components of advanced zzso zzso expression was assessed in prostate zzso cell lines and clinical specimens by real-time zzso and in zzso zzso To assess the biological significance of zzso zzso was zzso in bone zzso zzso cell lines followed by in zzso and in zzso functional zzso 

zzso expression is specifically attenuated in bone zzso zzso suggesting a fundamental zzso role for this zzso zzso of zzso in bone zzso zzso cell lines suppresses zzso via zzso of several critical steps of the zzso cascade including zzso transition, invasion, and zzso zzso zzso significantly attenuated the development of zzso in a bone zzso model of zzso zzso zzso regulates a cohort of zzso genes including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso including zzso a master regulator of bone zzso 

zzso is an zzso zzso in zzso that acts at multiple steps of the zzso zzso cascade via repression of a cohort of zzso zzso zzso may be an attractive target for therapeutic intervention in advanced zzso
