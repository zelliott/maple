The University of Pittsburgh zzso Library zzso Center zzso zzso conducted a screen with the National Institutes of Health compound library for zzso of in zzso cell division cycle 25 protein zzso B activity during the pilot phase of the zzso Library zzso Center zzso zzso zzso of the zzso compounds screened at 10 zzso met the active criterion of zzso or zzso zzso of zzso activity, and 25 zzso of these were confirmed as zzso zzso with 50% zzso concentration zzso values zzso zzso Thirteen of the zzso zzso were represented by singleton chemical structures, and 12 were divided among four clusters of related zzso Thirteen zzso of the zzso inhibitor hits were zzso zzso The zzso zzso were further characterized in a series of in zzso secondary zzso to confirm their activity, to determine their zzso selectivity against two other zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso and to examine if the mechanism of zzso zzso involved zzso and zzso Nine zzso zzso did not appear to affect zzso through a mechanism involving zzso because they did not generate zzso amounts of zzso in the presence of zzso and their zzso zzso values were not significantly affected by exchanging the zzso for zzso or reduced zzso or by adding zzso to the zzso Six of the zzso hits were selective for zzso zzso versus zzso and zzso but only the two zzso hits, zzso substance identifiers zzso and zzso significantly inhibited the growth of human zzso breast and zzso prostate cancer cell zzso To confirm the structure and biological activity of zzso the compound was zzso along with two zzso Neither of the zzso to the two zzso was zzso and only the zzso hit zzso inhibited zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and significantly inhibited the growth of the zzso breast and zzso prostate cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The two zzso hits identified in the screen represent novel zzso zzso inhibitor zzso that block tumor cell zzso The availability of zzso active zzso zzso should provide valuable tools to explore the zzso of the zzso zzso as potential zzso or combination therapies for zzso
