zzso zzso zzso contributes to human zzso and resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the active zzso of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso is in clinical trials, but the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso Here we show that in zzso zzso zzso neither zzso activity nor the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso by zzso target of zzso or zzso zzso zzso However, in intact cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso recruitment to the plasma membrane and zzso of zzso Surface zzso resonance shows that zzso but not zzso binds zzso zzso zzso zzso domain zzso zzso Furthermore, nuclear magnetic resonance zzso shows that zzso but not zzso binds to the zzso domain in the vicinity of the zzso zzso Finally, zzso active zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not the transforming zzso zzso are resistant to zzso and rescue from its zzso of proliferation and induction of zzso Thus, the results of our studies indicate that zzso binds to the zzso domain of zzso and blocks its recruitment to the zzso and that the subsequent zzso of zzso zzso contributes to zzso zzso and zzso activities, suggesting that this drug may be beneficial to patients whose tumors express persistently zzso zzso
