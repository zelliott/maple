zzso of DNA zzso play an important role in zzso In a zzso screen, we identified a zzso zzso within the zzso region of the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso member zzso gene zzso that showed de zzso zzso in zzso zzso also known as zzso zzso of zzso zzso activates several signaling zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Using zzso we detected zzso promoter zzso in 8 zzso of 14 diffuse zzso 17 zzso of 22 zzso zzso 101 zzso of 120 zzso 6 zzso of 6 zzso cell lines, and 7 zzso of 7 zzso stem zzso zzso primary cultures but not in four normal white matter tissue zzso Treatment of zzso cell lines with the zzso agent zzso significantly reduced the zzso level and resulted in increased zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cell lines leads to a significant reduction in focus formation and elevated zzso activity after flow zzso zzso zzso zzso studies of zzso zzso cells supported these results by showing the zzso of signaling pathways associated with regulation of zzso We conclude that zzso is a novel and frequent target for de zzso zzso in zzso which affects zzso activity and focus formation thereby contributing to the molecular zzso of zzso
