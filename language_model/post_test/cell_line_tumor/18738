zzso dependence is a feature unique to cancer cells, exhibited as inability to grow in a zzso environment supplemented with homocysteine, the immediate zzso precursor of zzso This study explores the effect of zzso depletion and homocysteine supplementation on the zzso sulfur zzso acid metabolism and zzso zzso of normal and cancer cells, as well as their ability to recover from the zzso An array of cells including zzso zzso zzso prostate zzso zzso and transformed zzso and normal zzso zzso has been used aiming to evaluate the importance of tissue zzso All cell lines proliferated well in zzso media zzso whilst only the normal zzso zzso grew in zzso zzso media zzso None of the tested cell lines were able to grow in media without zzso or homocysteine zzso zzso was the only cell line that did not recover from the zzso treatment whilst zzso did not recover from the zzso zzso zzso and homocysteine depletion zzso and zzso were found to induce arrest at different zzso of the cell cycle, depending on the cell zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso arrested at the S and zzso phase, whilst zzso and the zzso zzso accumulated in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed that the observed zzso were zzso The information resulting from these studies is important for not only the behavior of cancer cells, but also for appreciating the potential of developing cancer therapies based on zzso zzso
