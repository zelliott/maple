To zzso the role of the zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso and its target gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso C virus zzso zzso 

Liver samples were collected from the patients with chronic zzso infection and zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso zzso Two independent clones zzso zzso and zzso zzso expressing zzso core protein were zzso Total zzso was extracted from cells and liver zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso by real-time zzso chain reaction zzso using zzso Green zzso Total extracted proteins were separated by zzso gel zzso and zzso zzso were incubated with the zzso zzso then with a zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso for zzso zzso bands were revealed by an enhanced zzso reaction for zzso For zzso zzso of zzso sections were incubated with the primary goat zzso zzso directed against zzso at room zzso 

zzso zzso indicated that the zzso level and expression level of zzso gene in zzso C patients lowered significantly as compared with the controls zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso Western zzso results showed that the level of zzso protein in the zzso of zzso C patients was lower than that in controls zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso The zzso zzso results in chronic zzso C patients indicated a decrease in zzso zzso in zzso compared with those in the control zzso The in zzso studies found that in the zzso and zzso colon zzso expressing zzso core zzso the zzso zzso levels were significantly lower than that in the zzso 

The impaired zzso zzso expression is associated with the zzso mechanism in zzso injury during chronic zzso zzso zzso infection reduced the expression of zzso and zzso at the level of not only zzso but also zzso zzso plays an important role in the zzso of chronic zzso infection, but the impaired function of this nuclear zzso in zzso infection needs further zzso
