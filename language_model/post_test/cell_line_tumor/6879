zzso rearranged acute zzso leukemia zzso is an aggressive type of acute zzso leukemia zzso diagnosed predominantly in infants zzso years of zzso Since current chemotherapy fails in zzso of patients with zzso new therapeutic strategies are desperately zzso For this, understanding the biological features characterizing zzso is zzso Analysis of gene expression profiles revealed that the expression of the tumor zzso gene zzso is reduced in children with zzso rearranged ALL as compared to ALL patients carrying germ line zzso This finding was confirmed by quantitative real-time zzso In zzso of the infant zzso cases tested, zzso of the zzso zzso region was observed, resulting in strongly reduced zzso and protein zzso In contrast, zzso zzso in infant and zzso ALL patients carrying germ line zzso was found in only approximately zzso zzso or zzso zzso expression was restored upon exposing zzso cells to the zzso agent zzso which induced zzso zzso and more specifically, zzso cell death was induced by zzso zzso rearranged zzso cells with expression zzso zzso zzso zzso confirming tumor zzso activity of this zzso These observations imply that suppression of zzso may be required for the development of zzso and provide new insights into zzso and therapeutic possibilities for zzso
