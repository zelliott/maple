zzso of translation initiation factors contributes to many zzso conditions, including zzso Here, we report the definition of a novel regulatory zzso for zzso initiation with possible therapeutic import in zzso Specifically, we found that zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly expressed in breast tumors and plays a critical role in cancer cell proliferation by controlling zzso zzso zzso translation initiation factor zzso an essential component of the translation initiation complex zzso is zzso by binding the zzso factor zzso We found that genetic or zzso zzso of zzso attenuated zzso zzso thereby increasing zzso binding to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso investigations showed that zzso zzso with and zzso zzso at two novel sites zzso and zzso which were essential for zzso zzso along with increased zzso translation and cell zzso In zzso our work identified zzso as a pivotal regulator of zzso translation and cell proliferation that acts by zzso zzso zzso As zzso is highly expressed in breast tumors, these findings offer an initial rationale to explore zzso blockade as a therapeutic strategy to treat zzso driven by zzso zzso zzso
