zzso signaling between cancer cells and zzso plays an important role in determining tumor zzso We recently found tumor zzso factors to induce zzso zzso and that the high amounts of zzso growth zzso factor zzso produced by these zzso zzso zzso enhanced the zzso of zzso cancer zzso We now observed that leukemia cells lacking zzso respond to this novel type of zzso zzso zzso with growth arrest and differentiation to a zzso zzso zzso This effect was zzso by introduction of zzso expression into these zzso Moreover, those leukemia cell lines harboring properly processed zzso showed no effect in response to zzso We propose this effect to be zzso by zzso zzso signals, and present the potential candidates induced in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leukemia zzso factor and zzso zzso Our results emphasize the role of activated zzso zzso in controlling progression of certain zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso
