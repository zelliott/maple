zzso extracts are a part of traditional Chinese medicine, zzso In the current study, we investigated the effect of zzso on the proliferation of the human zzso zzso zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso and explored the therapeutic potential of the zzso Our results demonstrated that zzso markedly inhibited cell proliferation and promoted zzso in the zzso and zzso cells in zzso The underlying mechanism of the zzso zzso was the induction of zzso zzso zzso stress via the zzso zzso In addition, during the zzso stress response, the zzso pathway, characterized by the conversion of zzso to zzso was zzso resulting in increased zzso protein levels, decreased zzso expression and stimulation of zzso zzso Our data supported the zzso role of zzso zzso when the zzso zzso was blocked with specific chemical zzso the involvement of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso was also demonstrated when the expression of zzso and zzso was silenced using zzso These data indicate that combining zzso with a specific zzso inhibitor could be a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of zzso
