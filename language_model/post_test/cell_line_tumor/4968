To develop a zzso direct method for the in zzso tracking of small interfering zzso zzso used in zzso zzso two zzso zzso were zzso with zzso zzso The ability of zzso to track delivery was tested in cultured cells and living zzso The cellular delivery of zzso could be zzso by gamma counting and could be zzso by zzso zzso zzso can be efficiently delivered into cells by reaching up to zzso molecules of small zzso per zzso Moreover, zzso were zzso with homogeneous distribution throughout the zzso and zzso In zzso mice, zzso images and zzso studies showed that zzso were delivered to almost all zzso after intravenous zzso The imaging of living animals allowed zzso and zzso monitoring of the in zzso delivery of these small zzso In conclusion, using zzso zzso the delivery of small zzso could be measured zzso in cultured cells and could be zzso zzso in living animals using a gamma zzso The results of this study could open up a new approach for measuring the in zzso delivery of small zzso that might further facilitate the development of zzso as targeted zzso
