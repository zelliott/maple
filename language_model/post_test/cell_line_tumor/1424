The liver is the major site of ethanol metabolism and thus sustains the most injury from chronic alcohol zzso Ethanol metabolism by the zzso leads to the generation of zzso zzso and oxygen zzso that can readily zzso DNA, zzso and zzso More recently, it has become apparent that ethanol consumption also leads to increased zzso modifications of the natural repertoire, including zzso zzso Previously, we determined that alcohol consumption selectively zzso zzso zzso in polarized zzso However, neither the step at which the block occurs nor the mechanism responsible for the zzso have been zzso To identify the specific step at which zzso zzso is impaired, we examined the zzso levels, and assembly of selected components of the zzso machinery in control and zzso zzso To determine whether the impairment is caused by zzso zzso zzso we also examined the same coat components in cells treated with zzso A zzso a zzso inhibitor that leads to protein zzso in the absence of zzso 

We determined that both ethanol and zzso impair zzso at a late stage before zzso zzso We further determined that this zzso is likely the result of decreased zzso recruitment to the zzso of zzso zzso resulting in impaired zzso zzso These results also raise the exciting possibility that agents that promote zzso zzso may be effective zzso for the treatment of alcoholic liver zzso
