zzso domain containing 1 zzso zzso a new member of zzso family of proteins is highly responsible for the regulation of zzso by zzso zzso zzso family protein zzso zzso the higher expression levels of zzso in cancer zzso may have a direct influence on cancer progression by arresting zzso With this background this study was focused to find out the effect of zzso zzso on the progression of human brain zzso cells, zzso and zzso The results indicated that both cell lines show a higher expression level of zzso and zzso interference zzso zzso gene zzso successfully down regulated the zzso gene zzso As a result of zzso zzso the proliferation of both cell types was reduced by over zzso 5 days after zzso zzso the colony formation was completely inhibited and there were no cells present following two week zzso gene zzso The cell proliferation was inhibited as a result of cell cycle arrest due to zzso zzso zzso these results clearly indicate that, zzso is essential for the progression of zzso cells and zzso of it is resulting in significant zzso of cell cycle progression and cell zzso zzso this study shows that zzso gene engineering could be used as an effective tool in zzso brain tumor zzso
