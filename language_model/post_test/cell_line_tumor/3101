zzso is a type III zzso zzso that zzso cellular sensitivity to zzso and zzso Previous studies have suggested that zzso acts as a tumor zzso in certain human zzso zzso However, the roles of zzso in zzso zzso cell tumors zzso are poorly zzso The objective of this study was to determine whether human zzso exhibit zzso expression and, if so, what impact this zzso has on tumor zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso zzso transcripts in human zzso zzso zzso 17) and normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This analysis established that zzso exhibited a significant zzso lower mean zzso zzso level as compared with the normal zzso zzso zzso zzso Similarly, two human zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso exhibited low zzso expression and poor responsiveness to zzso and zzso A in zzso reporter zzso which was restored by stable zzso of zzso zzso zzso significantly increased the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, decreased cellular invasion through zzso and inhibited wound zzso zzso of zzso forms of zzso that are defective in zzso and/or zzso binding in each zzso cell line revealed that the zzso effects of zzso on wound healing were most strongly linked to the zzso region of zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso expression zzso the zzso zzso of wound healing and invasion, whereas both zzso zzso and zzso zzso abolished the zzso increase in zzso to zzso These data suggest that loss of zzso contributes to the zzso of zzso
