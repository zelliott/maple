zzso in the zzso zzso occur in most zzso zzso zzso and these zzso lead to increased nuclear zzso of the zzso zzso zzso In the nucleus, zzso associates with zzso sequence specific zzso factors to activate target gene zzso The zzso zzso restricts cellular growth by preventing nuclear zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso expression is elevated in zzso suggesting that, like zzso zzso the zzso zzso may contribute to zzso zzso zzso of zzso at the zzso level has been well studied but the zzso factors that control zzso gene expression are zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso complexes bind a DNA zzso element within the first zzso of the zzso gene to drive zzso expression in zzso zzso As such, reducing zzso expression in zzso cells using zzso leads to decreased zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso is abundantly expressed in the zzso and zzso of several established human colon cancer cell lines and this zzso pattern is insensitive to zzso zzso Finally, we show that zzso expression is elevated in the majority of a panel of primary human zzso tumors compared with its expression in zzso zzso zzso and that zzso and zzso zzso to the nuclear compartment of tumor zzso Together, these results zzso zzso as an zzso whose expression is driven by zzso zzso signaling in human zzso zzso
