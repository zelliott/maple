Increased collagen deposition provides physical and zzso signals to support tumor growth and invasion during breast cancer zzso zzso zzso of collagen synthesis and deposition has been considered a strategy to suppress breast cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso is a potential therapeutic target for the disorders associated with increased collagen zzso However, expression and function of zzso in breast cancer progression are not well zzso 

Gene zzso analysis was performed in the published zzso zzso to identify potential regulators of collagen I, III, and IV in human breast cancer zzso zzso of zzso was silenced by zzso and its activity was inhibited by 1, zzso a zzso zzso zzso culture zzso was used to analyze roles of zzso in regulating zzso zzso of breast cancer zzso zzso deposition of collagen I and IV was detected by Western zzso and zzso Control and zzso breast cancer cells were injected into fat pad and tail vein of zzso mice to examine effect of zzso on tumor growth and lung zzso 

Using gene zzso analysis, we showed that zzso was associated with expression of zzso zzso and zzso during breast cancer development and zzso zzso zzso levels were significantly zzso in breast cancer compared to normal zzso zzso Increased zzso levels of zzso correlated with poor clinical outcome in breast cancer patients, which is independent of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression or treatment with the zzso inhibitor significantly inhibited cell proliferation and suppressed aggressive zzso of breast cancer cells in zzso culture, accompanied by reduced deposition of collagen I and zzso We also found that zzso of zzso inhibited zzso tumor growth and zzso to lungs in zzso zzso 

These results suggest the critical role of zzso in breast cancer progression and identify zzso as a potential therapeutic target and zzso for breast cancer zzso
