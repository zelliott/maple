To present a novel method of tumor zzso through zzso zzso using locked zzso acid zzso and to investigate the role of zzso in DNA double strand break zzso zzso 

zzso survival zzso zzso the proximity zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis were conducted in zzso and zzso human zzso cancer cell lines treated with zzso zzso and zzso short hairpin zzso zzso Additionally, nude mice with zzso flank tumors were treated with zzso radiation therapy after zzso with zzso zzso and monitored for tumor zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer cell lines in an zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA repair signaling was impaired in zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso and zzso both attenuated DNA repair zzso after radiation, and zzso was found to zzso with zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso combined radiation and zzso zzso treatment in tumor zzso in nude mice suppressed tumor growth compared with either treatment zzso 

These results support a zzso property of zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso in double strand break repair, and suggest that zzso zzso might eventually serve as an effective clinical agent in the zzso of zzso zzso
