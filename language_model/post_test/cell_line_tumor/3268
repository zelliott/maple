To observe the suppressing effect of zzso zzso of zzso 1 zzso on zzso tumor growth following zzso injection, and to explore its potential use in clinical treatment of lung zzso 

After human lung cancer cells zzso had been zzso zzso to zzso nude mice and grew to tumor zzso these mice were distributed randomly into three groups: four in the saline group, five in the zzso group, and another five in the sense zzso of zzso zzso zzso Multiple direct zzso injections of zzso zzso or saline were given into the tumor zzso zzso The tumor growth and the zzso characteristics were observed and the expression of zzso and zzso zzso in tumor cells were measured by zzso zzso zzso 

After 16 days of continuous injection, the tumor volume of the zzso group was significantly smaller than that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso groups zzso zzso zzso tumor cell zzso and necrosis were observed in mice treated with zzso Moreover, a statistically significant decrease in zzso labeling index zzso zzso zzso and the positive expression ratio of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed in the zzso zzso 

Human lung tumor cell lines express high zzso zzso zzso can inhibit the activity of zzso and suppress the proliferation of tumor zzso
