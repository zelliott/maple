The search for new sources of natural antioxidants from plant material may have beneficial therapeutic potential for those diseases associated with zzso zzso The medicinal plant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contains zzso compounds as main zzso however, there are no reports on its zzso zzso 

To evaluate zzso and zzso potential of ethanol extract of zzso zzso aerial zzso 

Total zzso content was determined using zzso zzso zzso activity was measured using zzso zzso and the analysis of the major zzso was carried out using a zzso zzso The zzso and zzso effect were also investigated by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The human zzso zzso cell line was zzso with ethanol extract (from zzso to zzso for zzso prior to zzso zzso exposure zzso 

Total zzso content was zzso zzso zzso sample and zzso value was zzso zzso zzso Chemical constituents were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acids and zzso zzso In cell system model of zzso stress, zzso with ethanol extract at the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso significantly attenuated zzso loss in viability by zzso 17 and zzso zzso Furthermore, these ethanol extract zzso markedly inhibited zzso zzso production with zzso zzso These findings demonstrate the beneficial properties of ethanol extract of zzso zzso aerial parts, rich in zzso compounds, as zzso and radical scavenger zzso zzso processes and diseases such as several neurodegenerative zzso
