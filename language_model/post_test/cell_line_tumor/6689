We have previously shown that zzso zzso zzso consisting of zzso zzso linked to the zzso agent zzso E zzso lead to potent in zzso and in zzso activities against zzso positive tumor zzso zzso is a new zzso zzso zzso with a charged zzso zzso zzso that zzso its zzso activity compared to its zzso counterpart, zzso most likely due to impaired zzso zzso In zzso zzso studies indicated that zzso zzso zzso were zzso more potent than free zzso on a large panel of zzso positive zzso cell zzso As with zzso the corresponding zzso zzso induced cures and zzso of established zzso tumors at well tolerated zzso To further zzso the zzso several new zzso were generated in which various components within the zzso zzso were either altered or zzso One of the most promising zzso contained a zzso zzso zzso zzso between the drug and the zzso zzso was approximately as potent in zzso as zzso against a large panel of cell lines and was equally potent in zzso zzso zzso was tolerated at zzso times the zzso of zzso zzso studies indicated that drug released from zzso was the zzso zzso which likely arises from zzso degradation within the zzso of target zzso This new zzso technology appears to be zzso suited for drugs that are both relatively zzso and tolerant of substitution with zzso zzso Thus, zzso of the zzso have pronounced impacts on toxicity and lead to new zzso with greatly improved therapeutic zzso
