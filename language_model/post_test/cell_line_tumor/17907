zzso acid zzso has recently been reported to afford protective effects in neurodegenerative zzso However, the mechanisms underlying zzso zzso remain to be zzso This study was undertaken to determine whether LA treatment could increase zzso antioxidants and phase 2 zzso in cultured human zzso zzso cells, and whether such increased cellular defenses could afford protection against zzso induced by zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso zzso of LA for 24 h resulted in a significant increase in the levels of reduced zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso in a zzso zzso Treatment of the cells with LA also led to an increased zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso To determine the protective effects of the zzso cellular defenses on zzso cell injury, zzso cells were zzso with LA for 24 h and then exposed to zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso We observed that LA zzso of zzso cells led to a marked protection against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as detected by zzso reduction zzso Taken together, this study demonstrates for the first time that LA can induce zzso and zzso in cultured human zzso cells and zzso cellular defenses are accompanied by a markedly increased resistance to zzso induced by various zzso The results of this study may have important implications for the zzso effects of zzso
