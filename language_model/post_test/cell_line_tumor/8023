zzso in the promoter region of tumor zzso genes is a common mechanism of gene zzso which tends to occur in zzso The effects of zzso zzso a specific DNA zzso zzso on the cell proliferation of human breast cancer cell line zzso and on the expression of zzso gene were zzso Human zzso cells were incubated with increasing zzso of zzso for 12 to 120 zzso The growth zzso rates of zzso cells were detected by zzso zzso Changes of cell cycle distribution and zzso rates of zzso cells were determined by flow zzso The expressions of DNA zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were measured by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso Meanwhile, the expression of zzso protein was detected by Western zzso The results showed that zzso significantly inhibited the growth of zzso cells and the growth zzso rate of zzso cells was significantly enhanced with the concentration of zzso and the action zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso could significantly induce zzso cell cycle arrest and increase the zzso rate of zzso zzso The zzso and protein expressions of zzso were zzso in zzso cells treated with zzso which was accompanied by zzso of DNA zzso zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso might zzso the growth of tumor cells and promote the zzso of zzso breast cancer cells by zzso the expression of DNA zzso zzso and zzso the zzso gene zzso
