The zzso zzso zzso and zzso properties of zzso obtained from nine species of brown algae were studied in order to examine the influence of zzso origin and composition on their biological zzso All zzso inhibited zzso recruitment in an inflammation model in rats, and neither the content of zzso and zzso nor other structural features of their zzso zzso significantly affected the efficacy of zzso in this zzso In zzso evaluation of zzso zzso zzso to zzso under flow conditions revealed that only zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso could serve as zzso zzso All zzso except that from zzso zzso carrying substantial levels of zzso branches in the linear zzso zzso chain, exhibited zzso activity as measured by activated partial zzso time whereas only zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso displayed strong zzso activity in a zzso zzso zzso The last zzso zzso inhibited human zzso vein zzso cell zzso zzso in zzso and this property correlated with decreased levels of zzso zzso in zzso zzso suggesting a possible mechanism of zzso zzso of zzso Finally, zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso strongly blocked zzso breast zzso cell zzso to zzso an effect which might have critical implications in tumor zzso The data presented zzso provide a new rationale for the development of potential drugs for zzso zzso and tumor zzso
