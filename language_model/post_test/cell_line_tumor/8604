zzso cancer is one of the most common zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 d zzso is zzso zzso in many human zzso cells, and recent research has suggested that it could be a potential therapeutic target of zzso However, the function of zzso in zzso zzso cells is not well zzso To investigate the function of zzso in zzso zzso we used zzso zzso zzso to knock down the expression of zzso in zzso zzso We found that the zzso zzso system efficiently decreased the expression level of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression efficiently inhibited the proliferation and colony formation of zzso zzso Moreover, we found that zzso zzso led to zzso zzso arrest and the zzso of cells at the zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso zzso reduced the expression level of zzso inhibited zzso zzso and activated the zzso signaling zzso We found that zzso plays a crucial role in zzso zzso cell proliferation and colony zzso Our work provides strong evidence suggesting that zzso is a potential therapeutic target of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a promising gene therapeutic method to treat zzso zzso
