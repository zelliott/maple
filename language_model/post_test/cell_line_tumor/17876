zzso is a structurally novel zzso zzso discovered through zzso technology, zzso proprietary drug discovery zzso The compound was shown to have a broad zzso activity in the low zzso range when tested in the zzso 60 cell line zzso In the work presented here, zzso was further evaluated against brain tumor cell zzso zzso zzso studies as well as in zzso zzso evaluation were zzso 

Since zzso has a zzso zzso we first investigated if it binds the central and/or peripheral zzso zzso zzso was tested in zzso binding zzso on zzso receptors obtained from rat zzso The ability of zzso to inhibit the growth of zzso zzso was evaluated on a panel of zzso rat and human zzso cell lines using a standard zzso zzso zzso efficacy studies were performed on zzso zzso and zzso human breast and human prostate mouse tumor zzso zzso activity and zzso analysis of zzso was evaluated following intravenous zzso subcutaneous zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso was shown to bind the peripheral but not the central zzso zzso and inhibited the growth of zzso tumor cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso administration gave rise to low but sustained drug exposure, and resulted in moderate to significant zzso activity at doses that were well zzso In a rat zzso zzso zzso model, zzso produced up to zzso tumor growth zzso zzso while in a human zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso activity was highly significant in both human zzso breast zzso and prostate zzso zzso resulting in zzso of 72 and zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso dosing was followed by rapid elimination of the drug and was zzso 

zzso efficacy of zzso appears to be associated with the exposure zzso zzso and/or sustained drug levels rather than C zzso These in zzso data constitute a rationale for clinical studies testing prolonged continuous administration of zzso
