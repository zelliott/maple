It is controversial whether persistent signaling by the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso We reported persistent zzso signaling in human embryonic kidney zzso zzso cells expressing human zzso zzso whereas another group reported persistent signaling in mouse zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso we test this hypothesis zzso 

We used two methods to measure persistent signaling in zzso and confirm our previous zzso In zzso 1, we used a zzso zzso to measure zzso zzso zzso over zzso by adding a zzso inhibitor to the incubation zzso In zzso 2, we used an zzso zzso to record zzso levels zzso 

Using zzso 1, we show that zzso signals persistently in human zzso and human zzso zzso zzso Using zzso 1 in zzso we show that after zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso increases zzso to zzso zzso zzso increases zzso to zzso zzso but zzso added zzso after zzso withdrawal increases zzso to 105 zzso Using zzso 2 in zzso we confirm that without zzso zzso causes a transient increase in zzso and zzso after zzso withdrawal, zzso increases zzso in cells zzso with zzso more rapidly and to a higher level than zzso added to cells not zzso to zzso Lastly, using zzso 2, we show that in zzso zzso types 3 and 4 are involved in degrading zzso as the specific zzso zzso and zzso expose persistent zzso zzso 

We conclude that persistent zzso zzso occurs in human zzso zzso cells and zzso it is not zzso specific but is revealed by zzso zzso
