Past work has established that human zzso and breast cancer cells invariably express the zzso zzso factor 5 zzso and that loss of function of zzso caused massive zzso death of all cancer cell lines zzso zzso expression and function in pancreatic cancer cells have not been zzso 

zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso western zzso zzso zzso zzso and promoter reporter zzso were used for gene expression zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso analysis were used to monitor cell zzso 

zzso is highly expressed in pancreatic cancer cells as compared with zzso zzso Both zzso treatment and loss of function of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso function in zzso cells resulted in zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso resulting in enhanced sensitivity to zzso induced by zzso zzso 

zzso is highly expressed in pancreatic cancer zzso zzso zzso significantly enhances zzso zzso in human pancreatic cancer zzso zzso could be an important therapeutic target for pancreatic cancer zzso
