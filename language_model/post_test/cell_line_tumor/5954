Alternative zzso zzso provides transcript diversity and may contribute to human zzso We demonstrate that expression of several genes regulating zzso processing is decreased in both liver and skeletal muscle of obese zzso We evaluated a representative zzso factor, zzso zzso in both obese human liver and muscle and in zzso mice, and determined zzso impact of reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso Moreover, zzso zzso mice have increased zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso and plasma zzso We demonstrate that zzso a key regulator of zzso zzso is a zzso target of zzso reduced zzso favors the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso abolished zzso effects of decreased zzso zzso Together, our results indicate that reduced expression of zzso as observed in zzso from obese humans, alters zzso zzso zzso zzso and therefore contributes to zzso zzso associated with zzso
