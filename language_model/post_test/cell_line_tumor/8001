To address the biological zzso of lung cancer, we studied 199 lung zzso by zzso zzso data on copy number zzso and gene expression with full zzso for major known zzso zzso in this zzso This showed zzso patterns of copy number zzso significantly linked to zzso and zzso zzso status and to distinct clinical zzso and led to the discovery of a striking association of zzso zzso with zzso of zzso a gene within a broad region of frequent zzso loss on zzso zzso is involved in negative feedback control of zzso zzso and we provide functional validation for its role as a growth zzso in zzso lung zzso zzso loss also associates with zzso deletion and defines a distinct clinical subset of lung cancer zzso Another novel observation is that of a zzso relationship between zzso and zzso zzso These results highlight the power of integrated zzso to identify candidate driver genes within zzso broad regions of copy number zzso and to delineate distinct zzso pathways in genetically complex common zzso zzso
