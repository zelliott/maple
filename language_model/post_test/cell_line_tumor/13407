zzso zzso is a novel drug in clinical development that zzso and selectively zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The activity of zzso zzso was evaluated against the zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was tested against the zzso in zzso panel using zzso exposure at zzso ranging from zzso to zzso It was tested against the zzso in zzso panels at a dose of zzso administered zzso twice weekly for 2 weeks and repeated at Day 21 with a total observation period of 6 zzso 

The median zzso value for the cell lines was zzso with less than fourfold range between the minimum zzso and maximum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated an activity pattern consistent with zzso for most of the cell zzso zzso zzso models were studied and zzso zzso induced significant delays in event free survival distribution compared to control in 23 of 36 zzso zzso solid tumor zzso and in 3 of 7 ALL zzso zzso zzso did not induce objective responses in the solid tumor panels and the best response observed was stable disease for one zzso zzso In the leukemia panel, there were two objective responses with a complete response observed in a single zzso 

zzso zzso shows an interesting pattern of activity suggesting its potential zzso against selected childhood zzso particularly zzso
