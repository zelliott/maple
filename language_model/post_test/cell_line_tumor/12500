zzso zzso zzso is a central zzso factor involved in the cellular responses related to various aspects of cancer biology, including zzso survival, and zzso and the metabolism of the zzso zzso in zzso This study evaluated whether zzso small hairpin zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso cell proliferation and zzso in zzso zzso zzso cell zzso 

zzso of zzso expression was constructed by zzso zzso interference tools, and zzso cell lines infected with zzso coding virus were cultured under a zzso condition zzso zzso for 24 zzso Following infection, the expression levels of zzso zzso factors, and zzso zzso zzso were examined using Western zzso Cell proliferation and zzso were measured by a cell proliferation zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso of zzso induced suppression of tumor growth in zzso cell zzso It also zzso the expression of zzso factor and zzso zzso zzso as well as mobility of vascular cells to tumor was suppressed by zzso zzso groups in human zzso vein zzso cells zzso 

These data suggest that zzso zzso of zzso zzso the invasion, tube formation, and cell growth in zzso and zzso zzso
