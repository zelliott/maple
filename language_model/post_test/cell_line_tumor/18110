zzso are the most common and aggressive primary brain tumors for which zzso no effective treatment zzso exist despite advances in molecular biology as the knowledge base to unravel the extremely complex molecular mechanisms of zzso is zzso In this study an attempt has been made to understand the molecular pathological basis of zzso which led to an identification of an zzso zzso and an zzso strategy has been evaluated to control the zzso by zzso this zzso 

zzso zzso were zzso to investigate the expression of genes in a large number of tumor samples and to identify zzso genes which could be potentially causing zzso zzso zzso expressing short hairpin zzso zzso targeted against zzso were designed and zzso into human zzso cell line ex zzso in order to zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso was used to determine the level of zzso zzso Western zzso was used to determine the level of expression of zzso protein as measure to zzso down regulation of zzso expression along with use of flow zzso to investigate effect of zzso on cell cycles and detection of zzso Following ex zzso study, viral particles containing small interfering zzso for zzso were subsequently injected into zzso graft tumor of nude mice and the weight of human zzso zzso survival and resulting zzso changes of target gene were zzso 

Human zzso tissue zzso indicated the positive expression rates of zzso with a positive correlation with zzso grades zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing short hairpin zzso zzso against zzso caused efficient deletion of zzso cellular zzso arrest concluding in zzso and zzso of proliferation in human zzso cells zzso and zzso cell lines ex zzso And the viral particles containing small interfering zzso for zzso were subsequently injected into subcutaneous and zzso zzso graft zzso of nude zzso For subcutaneous tumors, injection of zzso zzso significantly decreased tumor weight and volume compared with zzso zzso indicated that zzso are negative and zzso are positive in tumors treated with zzso zzso For mice implanted with zzso zzso treatment of zzso zzso increased survival times compared with zzso 

zzso gene plays an important role in the proliferation of human zzso zzso of zzso could zzso inhibit human zzso cells growth ex zzso and in zzso From these results, it was suggested that zzso might be a potential target on gene therapy of human zzso
