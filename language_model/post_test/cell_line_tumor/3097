Recently, the involvement of the zzso system in the proliferation of prostate cancer has been zzso There is increasing evidence that zzso II zzso type 1 zzso is expressed in a variety of cancer cells and zzso and may have a role in tumor growth, zzso and invasive activity of zzso zzso in zzso The implications of data referring to an zzso zzso in zzso human prostate cancer zzso cells are zzso zzso II has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of zzso cell zzso However, it is known that zzso stimulates cell proliferation and that zzso II zzso type 2 zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso 

The aim of our study was to zzso by means of zzso and reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso the type of zzso II zzso that is present in zzso zzso 

In zzso complementary zzso acid zzso a zzso chain reaction zzso revealed 2 zzso zzso products zzso zzso and 126 zzso zzso zzso did not reveal zzso expression at a level sufficient for detection by zzso In cultured cells, zzso testing revealed a positive reaction in cultures zzso with zzso zzso but not in those zzso with zzso zzso 

The zzso effect of zzso II on the proliferation of zzso cells is exerted via zzso It is possible that presence of 2 zzso of zzso in that cancer cell line is essential to produce the biological effects of zzso
