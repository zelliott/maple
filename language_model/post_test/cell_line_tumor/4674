zzso factors that determine the cell fate in early zzso are modulated during interaction of signaling pathways to form a unique regulatory network inside the cell, which is essential for differentiation of various cell zzso We carried out a comparative study of expression of the genes of zzso growth factors and their receptors at the initial stages of differentiation of the embryonic stem cells, during formation of zzso of the embryonic zzso cells, and during growth of zzso cells in zzso in zzso zzso The patterns of expression of the genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and their receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proved to be zzso zzso of zzso and zzso factor zzso zzso specific for the primary zzso was detected in the embryonic zzso zzso In zzso embryonic stem cells, expression of zzso was found at the zzso level, while expression at the level of proteins appeared only in the primary zzso cells in the zzso zzso The results obtained suggest that despite the existence of similar signaling systems in the embryonic stem and zzso cells, the presence of different zzso specific factors forms radically different regulatory zzso which determine the program of their zzso
