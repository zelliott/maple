The zzso transition zzso is critical for induction of zzso and zzso of human zzso In this study we investigated the expression profiles of the zzso zzso the relationship between zzso markers and zzso factors, and the interplay between major zzso regulators in human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the hallmarks of zzso were shown in zzso and zzso of primary zzso samples, zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso the major regulators of zzso was identified in zzso zzso and zzso of primary zzso zzso zzso analysis determined that Snail and zzso but not zzso are major zzso zzso in zzso zzso of Snail and/or Twist correlated with zzso of zzso zzso expression of zzso and a worse zzso In contrast, there were no such significant differences in samples that zzso zzso zzso of Snail and Twist correlated with the worst prognosis of zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly correlated with Twist zzso zzso cell lines with increased Snail and Twist expression zzso zzso exhibited a greater capacity for zzso than cells with low zzso zzso expression zzso zzso zzso of Snail zzso Twist in zzso induced zzso and zzso whereas zzso of Twist or Snail in zzso reversed zzso and inhibited zzso Twist and Snail were independently zzso but exerted an additive zzso effect to suppress zzso zzso 

Our study provides a comprehensive profile of zzso markers in zzso and the independent and collaborative effects of Snail and Twist on zzso zzso were confirmed through different zzso
