The enhancement pattern of zzso tumors has been studied in short-term animal models zzso zzso but the reported results have been variable and zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the changing blood flow characteristics of zzso tumors implanted in rabbit zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to establish a predictable pattern of vascular evolution over an extended zzso growth zzso 

zzso zzso was implanted in zzso of 10 male New Zealand White zzso Dynamic CT zzso zzso 60 zzso was conducted on days 7, 14, 21, and 28 after tumor zzso Enhancement parameters of zzso curve zzso time to start zzso time to peak zzso maximum enhancement zzso slope of enhancement zzso and zzso zzso in tumor center, tumor zzso and normal liver were zzso zzso samples corresponding to CT images of one tumor on days 14 and 21 and seven tumors on day 28 were stained with zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso The relationship between enhancement parameters and zzso parameters zzso of tumor border, extent of blood zzso and zzso vessel zzso was zzso 

zzso growth, appearance, and vascular changes occurred in 7 of 10 animals over the zzso observation zzso zzso zzso enhancement was noted in CT zzso zzso analysis showed that tumor rim enhancement was pronounced and more rapid than normal liver initially but this difference diminished with tumor zzso The zzso zzso and zzso decreased from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Hu on day 7 to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso on day 28, zzso zzso increased from zzso zzso zzso seconds on day 7 to zzso zzso zzso seconds on day zzso No significant changes were noted on the zzso parameters in normal zzso The maximum density difference between tumor rim and normal liver zzso appeared zzso zzso zzso seconds after contrast zzso The maximum zzso decreased from zzso zzso zzso Hu on day 7 to zzso zzso zzso Hu on day zzso On zzso analysis, viable tumor cells were found in tumor rim with few zzso zzso The tumor border showed zzso reaction, vascular zzso and zzso inflammatory cell zzso and blood zzso These findings were more obvious on day 28 than those on day zzso zzso showed significant positive correlations with the extent of blood stasis in tumor border and adjacent liver and the maximum thickness of the tumor border zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, P zzso zzso 

The rabbit zzso liver tumor is a zzso tumor with zzso enhancement over its lifespan as zzso by zzso zzso changes in the measured vascular parameters correlated with the zzso of the tumor zzso These findings suggest that the accuracy of CT enhancement imaging for zzso liver tumor detection might be decreased with tumor zzso
