To investigate the zzso effects of humanized zzso zzso zzso zzso truncated tissue factor zzso on the zzso zzso mice, and to explore its zzso 

The zzso activity of the zzso fusion protein was detected by zzso zzso and zzso factor X (FX) zzso test in zzso Mouse zzso cell line zzso cells were zzso zzso into mice to establish the mouse models of zzso The mice were randomly divided into two groups to be injected once with zzso fusion protein or zzso protein labeled with zzso B zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso fusion protein in the mouse zzso tissue was analyzed by zzso laser scanning zzso 24 hour after the zzso Fifteen mice were randomly divided into three groups to be injected with the zzso fusion zzso zzso protein or zzso zzso saline (PBS) once, zzso The tumor size was measured every two days to calculate the tumor zzso Ten days after the injection the mice were zzso zzso of the zzso heart, zzso zzso zzso kidney and brains of the mice were taken for zzso zzso 

Both the zzso fusion protein and zzso protein effectively promoted blood zzso Under the conditions of zzso the zzso time in the zzso 3, 6 zzso zzso groups was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, and the zzso time of the zzso 3, 6 zzso zzso groups was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, the difference between the two groups was not significant zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso fusion protein was similar to the zzso protein in the ability of zzso FX zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso laser scanning microscopic analysis showed that zzso labeled zzso fusion protein was enriched in the zzso zzso The tumor volume of the zzso fusion protein group was significantly lower than that of the zzso and PBS groups (both P zzso zzso however, there was not significant difference between the zzso and PBS groups zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The survival time of the zzso group was zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly longer than that of the PBS group zzso zzso zzso d and the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso (both P zzso zzso 

The zzso fusion protein retains the zzso ability and has the capability of targeting to tumor zzso and zzso zzso in the tumor vessels, thus to suppress the growth of zzso in the zzso
