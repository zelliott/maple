zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso converts zzso acid to four zzso zzso acids zzso that exert multiple biological effects in the cardiovascular system and in various human solid zzso However, it is unknown whether this zzso is expressed or plays any role in zzso zzso zzso In this study, we found strong and highly selective zzso expression in five zzso zzso zzso cell lines and in leukemia cells from peripheral blood and bone zzso in 36 of 42 patients zzso with zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, increased levels of zzso were detected in urine and blood samples from these zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso in cultured zzso zzso zzso cell lines markedly accelerated proliferation and attenuated zzso zzso of the selective zzso inhibitor compound 26 zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited cell proliferation and increased zzso an effect that was significantly reversed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activated zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso and increased zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also enhanced zzso zzso growth, which was efficiently inhibited by oral administration of zzso in zzso transgenic mice and in severe combined zzso zzso zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso plays a key role in the zzso of human zzso zzso zzso Selective zzso of zzso may be a promising therapeutic strategy for these zzso
