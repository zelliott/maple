zzso zzso zzso is a natural inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso Recent studies have shown that experimental manipulation of zzso expression alters the zzso behavior of human breast cancer zzso However, the association of zzso with prostate cancer invasion and progression remains zzso Here, we show that zzso is robustly expressed in normal human prostate zzso whereas its expression is zzso in zzso prostate cell lines and prostate tumor zzso Treatment of zzso prostate cell lines with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso A resulted in significant induction of zzso zzso levels and increased zzso protein zzso indicating that zzso zzso may play a role in the loss of zzso expression observed in prostate zzso zzso zzso in human prostate cancer cells significantly reduced in zzso cell proliferation and zzso zzso Furthermore, the results from a zzso zzso model showed that the zzso of zzso significantly zzso tumor growth and the zzso of lung zzso These results suggest that the zzso of the zzso gene is associated with promoter zzso modifications and that this association plays an important role in prostate cancer progression during the invasive and zzso stages of the zzso
