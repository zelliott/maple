Previously, we defined zzso 1 binding protein 1 zzso to be a zzso of zzso that binds to mouse double minute gene number 2 zzso In the current study, we found that an increase in zzso protein levels caused a parallel change in the amount of zzso protein due to the zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was not able to alter the zzso of zzso by human zzso protein zzso indicating that the effect was specific for zzso zzso in the level of zzso protein in cells led to the greater zzso zzso of zzso and zzso reduced rate of cellular zzso increased levels of zzso and zzso of zzso Thus, we propose that zzso is a novel regulator of the zzso feedback loop and that it may be a potential tumor zzso
