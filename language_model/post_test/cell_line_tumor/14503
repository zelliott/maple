The human zzso gene has three zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are thought to be derived from alternative zzso It remains controversial whether the zzso gene is expressed in cancer zzso zzso of zzso is regulated by two zzso the zzso zzso zzso and DE zzso zzso but the expression and regulation of zzso are not well zzso Here, we zzso report that zzso is expressed at low levels in zzso cells, while the zzso gene is zzso By zzso the function of different promoter zzso and the DNA zzso status of three regulatory regions, we demonstrate that the zzso gene in zzso cells is zzso by zzso control rather than zzso zzso In addition, we speculate that the zzso of zzso in zzso cells is zzso regulated by additional regulatory zzso This work will enhance the understanding of zzso gene in differential zzso
