Although protein zzso zzso zzso has been suggested in the negative control of the cell cycle machinery in many types of cancer cells, its underlying mechanisms are partly zzso Here we report that the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso in a zzso manner, and contributes to zzso zzso cell cycle arrest through persistent zzso zzso in breast cancer zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso gradually zzso the expression of zzso zzso and zzso and subsequently enhanced its zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso such zzso zzso expression was completely abolished by zzso of zzso a specific zzso inhibitor or by knocking down the expression of zzso while zzso expression of a zzso active form of zzso strongly zzso zzso zzso We also found that the persistent zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso in response to zzso was greatly attenuated by zzso zzso zzso of zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso expression of zzso by zzso contributes to the zzso arrest by enhancing persistent zzso signaling zzso which represents a novel alternative mechanism of zzso cell cycle arrest and limiting proliferation of breast cancer zzso zzso
