Traditional in zzso models used for the development of zzso drugs are based on the zzso culture of cells, which has a limited zzso of in zzso zzso A number of cell culture platforms have been developed in recent years to improve zzso and further to zzso the mechanisms governing the differing responses observed in zzso versus in zzso One zzso aspect of current in zzso models is their inability to zzso the effect of different zzso factors on the responsiveness of the cells to drug zzso Here, we have used an engineered zzso zzso zzso array as a zzso approach to study the effect of environmental zzso independently of each zzso It is observed for zzso breast cancer cells, that culture within the three-dimensional zzso environment of the zzso alone had an effect on the response to zzso and results in a reduction of cell death in comparison to cells cultured on flat zzso zzso the zzso allowed the response of single versus zzso clusters to be zzso It was found that the formation of zzso contacts alters the drug response, depending on the type of adhesive protein zzso Thus, with this zzso platform it is revealed that the presence of zzso contacts in addition to the zzso and the zzso composition of the environment are important zzso of altered drug zzso In conclusion the zzso array can not only serve as a platform to reveal which parameters of the zzso environment affect drug response but further the zzso of these zzso
