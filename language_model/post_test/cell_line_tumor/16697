The aim of this study was to investigate the role of zzso in the regulation of development and zzso of zzso zzso cell lines in zzso and zzso cancer in a nude mouse model in zzso The effects of zzso on the ability of two zzso potential human zzso cancer cell lines zzso and zzso to zzso invade and migrate zzso were observed by means of a cell zzso test, cell invasion test and cell migration zzso The size and number of the zzso and zzso zzso in zzso in a nude mouse were determined following zzso injection of zzso Furthermore, the extent of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso were zzso zzso migration, invasion and zzso of zzso cancer cells were significantly inhibited ( zzso in a zzso manner zzso In addition, zzso inhibited zzso zzso and lung zzso ( zzso with no weight loss in zzso consistent with decreased expression of zzso and zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso the development and zzso of zzso cancer by reducing zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
