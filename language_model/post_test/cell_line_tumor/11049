To investigate the effect of gene zzso on gastric cancer zzso resistance zzso by introducing it into gastric cancer zzso resistant zzso cell line zzso 

Gene zzso was cloned from zzso by zzso and its differential expression between gastric cancer zzso cells and its parental cells was displayed by Northern zzso The gene was introduced to gastric cancer cells by zzso of zzso zzso expression zzso by zzso zzso zzso in zzso was applied to investigate its effect on zzso resistance zzso of gastric cancer zzso 

The full length zzso of gene zzso as long as zzso zzso was cloned from gastric cancer zzso cell line zzso and its sequence was zzso with the hypothetical gene zzso in zzso It was zzso in zzso cells than its parental cells at zzso zzso In the zzso zzso in zzso the drug sensitive cells zzso with sense zzso expression zzso showed zzso targeted zzso with increased resistance to zzso zzso and zzso and decreased resistance to zzso but no influence on resistance to zzso However, the drug resistant cells zzso with zzso zzso expression zzso showed down regulated targeted zzso with less resistance to all the five zzso drugs to different zzso 

Gene zzso is related to zzso zzso of gastric cancer cells and may become a candidate molecular target to reverse the zzso of gastric zzso
