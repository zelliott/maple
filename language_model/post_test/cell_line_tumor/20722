zzso zzso zzso zzso represent a promising class of potential zzso agents for treatment of human zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of zzso A zzso one such zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso a zzso chemotherapy agent or zzso a novel molecular target therapy drug, on lung cancer zzso zzso 

zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso alone or in combination with zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso and cell cycle distribution were evaluated using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso Moreover, zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis were employed to examine zzso of zzso heat shock protein 90 zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso in response to the different zzso zzso 

Compared with zzso treatment, zzso of zzso cells with zzso or zzso zzso inhibited cell zzso induced zzso and caused cell cycle delay at the zzso zzso Treatment with zzso or zzso led to a significant increase of zzso zzso zzso also resulting in elevated zzso of zzso or zzso and decreased expression of zzso which was zzso associated with the level of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso effects are observed between zzso or zzso and zzso on lung cancer zzso Such combinations may provide a more effective strategy for treating human lung zzso
