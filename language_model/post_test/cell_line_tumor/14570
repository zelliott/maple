The role of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in cell zzso cell cycle arrest and zzso has attracted increasing zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso has been recently described as possessing zzso zzso We studied the effects of zzso on zzso growth arrest and zzso in zzso prostate zzso cells and its interaction with the signaling pathways of the activated zzso zzso zzso We observed that zzso in a zzso and zzso manner, inhibited the growth of zzso cells independent of zzso In addition, zzso induced cell cycle arrest and zzso We demonstrated that cell proliferation was zzso by zzso in a zzso and zzso manner and was inhibited by zzso The analysis of the main zzso signaling pathways downstream of the activated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso revealed that zzso reduced the zzso levels of zzso and of their downstream zzso which mediate zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, simultaneous targeting of zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso could be the molecular mechanism by which zzso exerts its additive zzso effects on zzso cell zzso
