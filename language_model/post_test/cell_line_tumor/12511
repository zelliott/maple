zzso 4 zzso is a zzso factor that regulates the cell zzso zzso is zzso in breast tumor and breast cancer cell lines, but its significance in zzso cancer zzso is not fully zzso 

The present study assessed 129 patients who underwent surgery for zzso and assessed three cell lines derived from human zzso The correlation of gene expression with clinical parameters in patients was assessed by zzso experiments with these cell zzso 

Patients with high zzso expression had a statistically relatively better zzso and those with low zzso expression showed poorer overall survival than those with high zzso The assessment of zzso zzso in the three cell lines demonstrated that the zzso zzso resulted in a statistically significant increase in cell growth and zzso 

The data strongly suggest that zzso expression is a zzso factor in zzso
