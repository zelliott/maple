zzso is a B zzso zzso of which appears to increase the risk of developing several zzso including zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso effect of folate zzso in normal zzso several lines of evidence indicate that folate depletion suppresses the progression of existing zzso and enhance the sensitivity of cancer cells to zzso zzso mediates the transfer of zzso necessary for the de zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and hence is an essential factor for DNA synthesis and repair, and the maintenance of DNA integrity and zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA strand breaks, increases zzso zzso into DNA, zzso DNA repair and appears to induce zzso Although the effects of folate depletion on DNA integrity and zzso and on subsequent cancer development, progression and treatment in zzso zzso cells have been well zzso it is largely unknown at present how folate depletion zzso specific upstream genes in zzso and cancer pathways that regulate these zzso We therefore investigated the effects of folate depletion on expression of genes involved in zzso and cancer pathways in four human colon zzso cell lines in an in zzso model of folate zzso zzso and cancer zzso zzso were used to screen for zzso expressed genes in response to folate zzso and the expression of seven most notably and consistently affected genes was confirmed by real time zzso Our data suggest that folate zzso affects the expression of key genes that are related to cell cycle control, DNA repair, zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso zzso in gene expression changes in response to folate zzso is likely due to significant differences in molecular and zzso zzso growth rates and zzso folate zzso among the four cell zzso
