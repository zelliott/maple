zzso is widely investigated in conjunction with cancer development, in particular because of the possibility of early stage detection and of new therapeutic zzso However, such studies are zzso affected by the limitations of imaging techniques in the detection of microscopic blood vessels zzso 3-5 zzso grown under zzso zzso We report that zzso X-ray imaging techniques with very high spatial resolution can overcome this obstacle, provided that suitable contrast agents are zzso 

We tested different contrast agents based on gold zzso zzso for the detection of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and high resolution X-ray zzso Among them only zzso in conjunction with zzso injection provided sufficient contrast to allow in zzso detection of small zzso species (the smallest measured zzso diameters were 3-5 zzso The detected vessel density was zzso times higher than with other zzso We also found that zzso with zzso allows detecting symptoms of local zzso zzso diffusion in tumor areas where zzso leakage zzso 

Although zzso zzso are natural candidates as zzso contrast agents, their success is not guaranteed, in particular when targeting very small blood vessels in zzso zzso We found that zzso injected with zzso produced the contrast level needed to zzso the first time by X-ray zzso zzso with 3-5 zzso diameter as well as zzso diffusion due to zzso membrane zzso These results open the interesting possibility of functional imaging of the tumor zzso of its development and organization, as well as of the effects of zzso zzso
