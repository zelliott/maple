zzso comparative zzso zzso zzso has become a powerful method for the zzso detection of zzso zzso Although zzso zzso have been used for mouse zzso studies, the resolving power of these analyses was limited because zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso were not zzso We therefore developed a mouse zzso zzso containing zzso unique zzso clones from mouse zzso libraries at zzso zzso For the general amplification of zzso clone DNA prior to zzso we designed a set of three novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso amplify mouse zzso sequences while minimizing unwanted amplification of zzso zzso coli zzso The resulting zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso identified DNA copy number zzso in cell lines and primary tumors, such as zzso zzso regional zzso and zzso
