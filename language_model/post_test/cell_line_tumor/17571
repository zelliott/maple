To observe the microscopic characteristics of zzso spreading tumor zzso cell line in primary zzso 

The cells isolated from a zzso zzso zzso obtained by zzso zzso zzso was primary zzso followed by observation with scanning and transmission electron microscope in comparison with the cells of zzso and normal zzso of the zzso 

zzso and transmission electron zzso both revealed numerous zzso covering the surface of the zzso cells, and the zzso contained large quantity of zzso zzso and zzso Obviously zzso cell zzso were present with abnormal nuclear zzso and huge zzso 

The cultured zzso cells are highly zzso
