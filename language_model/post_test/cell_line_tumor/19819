Marine organisms are being considered increasingly as sources of zzso zzso The extract from zzso zzso zzso has been shown to decrease the growth of zzso and this study was undertaken to determine its ability and mechanism of zzso The extract inhibited the proliferation of six human zzso cell lines from different origins with varying zzso The cell lines zzso zzso and zzso with kidney or lung origins were more sensitive to the extract than those of the zzso zzso and zzso cells from other zzso In the three sensitive cell lines zzso zzso and zzso the extract was shown to block different zzso of the cell cycle progression and inhibit DNA synthesis in a zzso zzso It was concluded that the extract from zzso zzso is potentially a novel zzso agent, especially on kidney and lung zzso cell zzso
