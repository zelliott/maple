zzso zzso zzso an invasive zzso in gastric zzso cells through a mechanism that requires the type IV zzso system and the zzso of zzso The zzso complex is a major component of the zzso junctions and functions as an invasion zzso We investigated whether zzso has a role in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cells that lack zzso and that are invasive to zzso zzso stimulation were zzso with zzso and infected with zzso zzso zzso cells, which zzso express zzso were also used for infection zzso 

zzso was sufficient to suppress not only zzso zzso zzso zzso but also zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso infection led to increased interactions between zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso Using in zzso infection zzso we showed that zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso zzso and zzso Finally, using small interfering zzso we showed that interactions between zzso and zzso and between zzso and zzso were established through zzso 

We suggest that zzso zzso alters the zzso complex, leading to formation of a zzso complex composed of zzso zzso zzso and zzso This complex abrogates zzso and zzso zzso zzso and suppresses the zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso
