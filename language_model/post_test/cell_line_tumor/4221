zzso iron oxide zzso zzso zzso with zzso human zzso growth factor zzso were studied as a potential agent for magnetic resonance imaging contrast enhancement of zzso brain zzso zzso zzso were characterized by transmission electron zzso dynamic light zzso and nuclear magnetic resonance zzso The interaction of zzso zzso with cells was analyzed in a zzso zzso cell zzso The distribution of the zzso and their zzso in tumors were assessed by magnetic resonance imaging in an zzso model of zzso zzso zzso zzso had the properties of a negative contrast agent with high zzso of relaxation zzso In zzso studies of zzso zzso showed high zzso incorporation and the absence of a toxic influence on zzso cell viability and zzso zzso administration of zzso zzso in animals provided zzso targeted delivery across the zzso barrier and tumor retention of the zzso this was more efficient than with zzso zzso The zzso of zzso in the zzso was revealed as zzso zones on zzso images with a twofold reduction in zzso relaxation time in comparison to zzso zzso ( zzso zzso zzso provide targeted delivery and efficient magnetic resonance contrast enhancement of zzso zzso zzso
