zzso zzso induction of the zzso zzso zzso gene by the zzso zzso zzso is a classic model used to investigate zzso gene zzso Classic studies analyzing zzso of the zzso gene demonstrated that despite having very high affinity for zzso some steroids cannot induce zzso zzso zzso activity, but the molecular basis for this phenomenon is zzso Here, we used zzso and zzso zzso to determine zzso zzso zzso and zzso recruitment to the zzso promoter zzso in rat zzso cells induced by seven zzso zzso zzso zzso cortisol zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso As expected, zzso zzso zzso and zzso all induced both zzso zzso and zzso recruitment to the zzso while zzso and zzso did zzso However, while zzso could not induce significant zzso zzso it did induce robust zzso occupancy of the zzso zzso also induced recruitment of the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso as efficiently as zzso These zzso effects zzso at another zzso target gene zzso zzso and zzso also failed to promote the multiple changes in gene expression required for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso simulations and zzso sensitivity zzso suggest that zzso and zzso induce different zzso in zzso Thus, although steroids that bind zzso with high affinity can induce zzso and zzso occupancy of target zzso they may not induce a zzso of zzso capable of zzso zzso
