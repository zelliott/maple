In the present study, we demonstrate that elevated levels of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in breast cancer cells zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso and protein content, causing zzso repression of the zzso genes insulin zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso and zzso addressing a specific effect of zzso on zzso gene zzso zzso gene promoter activity was drastically inhibited by zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed a zzso responsive region containing a zzso response element zzso site located at zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the effect induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed an increase of zzso bound to the zzso region encompassing the zzso site, and the recruitment of a zzso complex containing nuclear zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso of zzso and zzso hormone zzso and zzso zzso with zzso of zzso zzso and displacement of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso studies demonstrated the crucial involvement of zzso in the zzso effects due to zzso zzso on zzso protein and zzso We also demonstrated that the zzso regulation observed in zzso cells depended on zzso expression because zzso zzso partially abrogates the feedback zzso of zzso levels after zzso zzso Our study provides evidence for a mechanism by which zzso zzso is able to actively repress zzso gene zzso
