Cocoa zzso zzso zzso were zzso based on the zzso and zzso zzso with an objective to enhance the stability and zzso of zzso The zzso were zzso using zzso methods and analyzed using zzso equipped with a zzso detector zzso and mass zzso zzso The zzso zzso had a purity of zzso zzso and contained zzso zzso (from zzso to zzso and zzso with zzso being the zzso component zzso zzso Different zzso mass ratios were tested to investigate the effects of zzso on the zzso zzso Using zzso mass ratio of zzso the zzso zzso had a particle size of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso particle yield of zzso loading efficiency of zzso and loading capacity of zzso The zzso zzso were zzso as observed by scanning electron zzso zzso zzso transform infrared zzso zzso suggested that the primary interaction between the zzso and gelatin was hydrogen bond and zzso interaction, while zzso interaction was the main binding force between zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso significantly improved the stability of the zzso at zzso The zzso zzso showed the same zzso effects at lower zzso in human acute zzso leukemia zzso cells compared with the zzso in zzso
