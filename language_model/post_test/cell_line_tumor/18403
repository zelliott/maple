zzso I, a zzso cell zzso zzso was first identified in the zzso To date, various zzso zzso proteins have been identified but their biological functions have not been well zzso Here, we have zzso a zzso zzso protein with a molecular weight of zzso from sea zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso and gel zzso The protein was not zzso zzso zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso zzso fragments were highly zzso to other sea zzso zzso zzso proteins identified zzso The circular zzso zzso spectrum analysis demonstrated that the zzso protein contained high content of zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso protein is a zzso zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso zzso protein promoted zzso human zzso cell zzso Further, a synthetic zzso zzso zzso of the protein corresponding to a highly zzso region of the zzso zzso family promoted zzso zzso cell zzso Moreover, the zzso inhibited zzso cell attachment to the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso protein from sea zzso zzso isolated here is a member of the zzso I family and that the zzso region of the protein is important for cell attachment zzso The protein has a potential to be involved in biological functions in sea zzso as a cell adhesive zzso
