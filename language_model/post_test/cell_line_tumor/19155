To investigate the relationship between the zzso of complete blood counts and tumor shrinkage during tumor rejection induced by a high dose of zzso in zzso zzso 

Wild type zzso zzso mice were treated with different doses of zzso zzso 75 zzso zzso was the minimal effective dose of zzso that could cure the zzso zzso Then another 6 zzso mice were treated zzso with zzso (75 zzso Blood samples were obtained from zzso zzso zzso on different days before and after zzso treatment, and then complete blood counts were performed and the relationship between the zzso of blood counts and tumor shrinkage after zzso treatment was zzso 

zzso sizes decreased steadily and tumors disappeared within the first week after zzso zzso and at the same time 75 zzso zzso also had side effects on zzso blood zzso The number of zzso significantly decreased from the first day after zzso treatment ( zzso But during the 7 zzso to 15 zzso day the number of zzso zzso back to normal level zzso Later it decreased again and it couldn't recover back to normal level at the 28th day after zzso treatment ( zzso The concentration of zzso decreased at the first day and lasted for 2 weeks ( zzso It increased gradually back to normal in 2 weeks after zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso on zzso count was not zzso The zzso count increased significantly at the first and at the 11th day after zzso treatment respectively ( zzso 

zzso shrinkage after zzso treatment is not related to the decreased number of zzso or zzso but correlated with the increased number of zzso at the first day after zzso zzso
