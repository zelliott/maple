zzso zzso zzso have been detected in patients with systemic rheumatic diseases and are used in the screening and/or diagnosis of zzso in patients as well as mouse models of systemic zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso cells is the gold standard for zzso zzso However, its usefulness is limited in diagnosis, prognosis and monitoring of disease activity due to the lack of zzso in performing the technique, zzso in interpreting the results and the fact that it is only zzso Various zzso techniques have been developed in an attempt to improve upon the method to zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso line zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso other than zzso zzso Yet zzso on zzso cells remains the most common screening method for zzso In this study, we describe a simple quantitative method to detect zzso which combines zzso on zzso coated slides with analysis using a zzso imaging zzso zzso Using zzso to determine zzso zzso zzso (32 of zzso of the zzso for human patient samples were within 2 zzso of those determined by zzso which is the acceptable range for proficiency zzso Combining an initial screening for nuclear zzso using zzso with zzso by zzso resulted in zzso zzso of zzso of the zzso detected to be within two zzso of those determined by zzso The zzso method for quantitative zzso zzso using serum from both patients and mice with zzso provides a fast, relatively simple, objective, sensitive and zzso zzso which could easily be standardized for comparison between zzso
