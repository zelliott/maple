zzso zzso is a well-studied zzso agent against a spectrum of liver zzso However, the role of zzso in zzso fatty liver disease zzso induced insulin resistance and underlying signaling is not fully zzso In this study, zzso zzso rats were fed with high-fat diet to develop zzso with or without an zzso zzso zzso rats showed typical zzso symptoms including zzso changes, insulin resistance, and zzso metabolism zzso zzso zzso significantly ameliorated these pathological features partly through restoring the zzso zzso In addition, zzso and zzso cells were incubated with zzso acid zzso to induce zzso zzso zzso in cells also reduced zzso zzso recovered cell zzso and zzso the protein expression of zzso the marker for insulin zzso zzso blocker of zzso abolished the zzso effects of zzso on cellular zzso In conclusion, zzso alleviated zzso and insulin resistance both in zzso and in zzso partly through regulating the zzso zzso
