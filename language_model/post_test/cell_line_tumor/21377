Drug resistance is often associated with zzso of zzso zzso systems, and thus global membrane zzso methods are valuable tools in the search for novel components of drug resistance zzso zzso we have compared the zzso zzso from the lung cancer cell line zzso and its zzso zzso zzso line zzso The method used includes zzso preparation, zzso labeling followed by narrow range zzso zzso in an immobilized zzso zzso and zzso zzso We demonstrate that the zzso preparation and zzso labeling is zzso regarding protein content and zzso The rationale using narrow range zzso zzso separation is demonstrated by its ability to: zzso lowering the complexity of the sample by two-thirds while keeping high zzso coverage zzso zzso providing high separation efficiency, and zzso allowing for zzso validation and possibly identifications of zzso zzso After analyzing one-fifth of the zzso zzso zzso pH range of zzso a total of zzso proteins were identified, among which zzso were predicted to be membrane zzso One of the proteins found to be zzso expressed was zzso 2, a calcium pump located in the zzso membrane that potentially could result in changes of zzso response toward zzso
