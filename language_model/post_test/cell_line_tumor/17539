zzso zzso interacting zzso zzso gene is a tumor zzso gene cloned from a human fetal liver zzso library, which is located at zzso one of the high frequent regions of loss of zzso zzso in lung zzso zzso protein can interact with zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso which promotes zzso This study was designed to explore the correlation of zzso of expression and structure of zzso gene with the progression of lung zzso 

The expression and structure of zzso gene in 4 lung cancer cell strains and 30 zzso were determined by SP zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso 

zzso In 4 lung cancer cell zzso zzso protein was not detected in zzso zzso zzso except for zzso in which the protein expression level was slightly lower than that in zzso zzso zzso cell strain zzso zzso protein was observed in zzso zzso lung cancer zzso while zzso zzso in normal lung zzso The difference was significant in statistics zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in 4 lung cancer cell zzso and there existed no obvious zzso of the amount between these cell strains and zzso zzso or decrease of zzso zzso was observed in zzso of lung cancer zzso The average quantity of zzso zzso was zzso in lung cancer zzso while zzso in paired normal lung zzso The difference was significant in statistics zzso zzso In all the zzso cell strains and zzso with zzso zzso the products of zzso were as long as those from their control samples in size, including the entire coding region, and no variation of zzso gene structure such as absence, zzso zzso zzso were zzso No point zzso was detected in all 6 zzso of zzso gene in 4 lung cancer cell strains and 30 zzso 

zzso protein expression was zzso in lung cancer, which might be involved in the occurrence and/or development of lung zzso The zzso of zzso protein expression in lung cancer was partly caused by the zzso of its zzso The variation of gene structure may be not the reason of zzso zzso in lung zzso
