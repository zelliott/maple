The prime objective of this study was to develop a combined zzso zzso which could directly kill cancer cells as well as activate the zzso tumor zzso to mount a robust zzso immune zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso were selected as zzso drug and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso based zzso and zzso containing zzso zzso were prepared by the zzso method zzso and characterized in terms of size, zzso potential and transmission electron zzso zzso The release behavior of zzso and zzso from the zzso exhibited a zzso pattern characterized by an initial burst followed by slow continuous zzso In zzso zzso activity of zzso was found to be higher compared to zzso when studied in a tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso activated zzso zzso induced the zzso of various zzso zzso After zzso administration of zzso in tumor bearing zzso mice, the amount of zzso in the tumor mass was found to be higher in zzso treated mice as compared to commercial zzso group at all time points zzso In zzso studies suggest that zzso containing zzso and zzso have both direct zzso and zzso zzso Hence this might have potential as a zzso zzso against cancer with advantage over present day chemotherapy with zzso in terms of tumor zzso less toxicity and zzso
