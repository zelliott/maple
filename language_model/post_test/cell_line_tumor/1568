A rapid echo zzso imaging sequence for dynamic imaging of zzso zzso and zzso zzso simultaneously was zzso zzso separation of these zzso was achieved by spatial shifting in the zzso direction with the appropriate choice of echo zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso is achieved through an zzso zzso zzso zzso Signal sampling efficiency as a function of zzso and zzso zzso angle was simulated using two site exchange zzso Dynamic imaging is demonstrated in a transgenic mouse model, and phantom zzso of the zzso pulse frequency selectivity were zzso
