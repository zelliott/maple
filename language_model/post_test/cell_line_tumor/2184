zzso of zzso has been found in many tumors, including lung zzso The zzso zzso signaling zzso plays an important role during normal development, and the abnormal regulation of its members has also been related to many zzso However, little is known about the relationship between zzso and the zzso zzso In this paper, we report zzso zzso playing a role in zzso cell lung cancer zzso and targeting zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso We found that zzso was zzso when cells were treated with zzso zzso We zzso expressed zzso in zzso cell lines to examine the influence of zzso zzso The results showed that zzso of zzso in zzso cells promoted cell cycle progression and cell zzso migration, and zzso The promoting effects of zzso on cell zzso migration, and invasion were partially reversed by the zzso inhibitor zzso These results suggested that zzso might have zzso zzso Potential targets of zzso were predicted, and we showed tumor zzso zzso was a functional target of zzso zzso may be responsible for the effect of zzso on cell zzso Altogether, our results indicated that zzso was involved in zzso and the zzso activity of zzso in zzso cells was due, in part, to suppression of zzso
