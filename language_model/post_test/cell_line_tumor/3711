zzso zzso virus zzso is a candidate for development for cancer zzso We created a zzso replicating zzso zzso with an altered surface protein that targeted zzso to breast cancer zzso The zzso zzso contained a single zzso zzso gene derived from zzso zzso This gene expressed a zzso zzso zzso binding zzso and the native zzso E1 fusion zzso The zzso zzso binding zzso called zzso was modified to reduce its native binding function and to contain a single chain zzso zzso with specificity for the human zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso These viruses selectively zzso zzso in and killed cells expressing zzso The zzso of zzso on zzso cells, a human breast cancer cell line which highly expresses zzso was zzso zzso zzso compared with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso on 143 cells, a human zzso cell line which does not express zzso The zzso of zzso on zzso cells, a mouse zzso cancer cell line zzso zzso to express human zzso was zzso zzso zzso compared with a zzso of 5 zzso zzso on the parent zzso cells which do not express zzso When zzso on zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso coated with zzso had zzso the zzso of zzso zzso coated with wild type zzso zzso indicating that the zzso zzso zzso had severely impaired binding to the natural zzso Analysis of the protein composition of the zzso found low expression of the modified zzso zzso on the zzso
