A series of zzso derivatives were zzso and their in zzso zzso activity was evaluated against one zzso strain zzso and three zzso strains zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso relationship showed that two zzso charges as well as zzso and zzso zzso on the zzso ring were required to exert a good zzso zzso The best compounds possessing these features inhibited the growth of the zzso strain with an zzso zzso close to that of zzso itself, and that of the three zzso strains better than zzso with zzso zzso These zzso derivatives inhibited the formation of zzso suggesting that, like zzso they act on the zzso zzso zzso Finally, in zzso zzso was also evaluated upon human zzso cells, which showed that one of them zzso zzso 1 displayed a promising zzso activity in zzso with a quite good selectivity index versus zzso cell on the zzso strain and promising selectivity on other zzso
