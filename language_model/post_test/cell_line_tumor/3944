zzso zzso formed by a pair of zzso charged zzso zzso zzso block zzso and zzso termed zzso have zzso size, and are characterized by unique zzso property due to the flexible and zzso zzso of zzso complex zzso zzso The zzso can zzso a variety of molecules in an inner zzso phase just by a simple vortex mixing of solution, expecting their utility as zzso of substances with biomedical zzso Here, we report on a new functionality of the zzso zzso release of zzso agents for zzso drug zzso A potent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso was efficiently incorporated into the zzso zzso and its quick release was induced by zzso possibly due to the zzso damage of the zzso zzso The combination of a high-resolution fluorescent zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso method revealed that such zzso release of zzso occurred even in the zzso of living cells after zzso zzso zzso the released zzso zzso affected the integrity of the zzso zzso leading to the zzso of zzso and zzso themselves to the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso exhibited appreciably stronger zzso compared with free zzso zzso Thus, the zzso have promising feasibility for the zzso therapy or the zzso zzso delivery of therapeutic zzso
