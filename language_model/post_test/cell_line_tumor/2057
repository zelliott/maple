To examine the potential of combining zzso family zzso with chemotherapy in zzso cancer, we evaluated a panel of 27 zzso cancer cell lines for response to the combination of zzso (formerly zzso and zzso or zzso The majority of cell lines exhibited a greater than additive response to either zzso as determined by the Bliss independence model, and more than 50% of the zzso cell lines exhibited strong zzso for the zzso zzso To identify zzso for tumors likely to respond to this zzso we evaluated the protein levels of intrinsic zzso zzso zzso zzso seems necessary, but not zzso for zzso zzso in zzso suggesting that exclusion of patients whose tumors have low or zzso zzso would enrich for patients responsive to the zzso We evaluated zzso levels in zzso cancer tumor tissue from 40 patients (20 zzso responsive and 20 with poor response to zzso and found that patients with high zzso were less sensitive to zzso treatment (10 of zzso zzso positive patients, P zzso zzso These data support the use of zzso in combination with zzso therapy in zzso cancer patients with high levels of zzso
