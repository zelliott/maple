The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso the growth factor zzso zzso are highly expressed during the development of the nervous system and have been implicated in the zzso progression of different tumor zzso Here, we describe human zzso variable zzso zzso zzso that target the zzso domain zzso in zzso and show the effect in zzso and in zzso The zzso zzso was used as a bait in a zzso zzso system to select human zzso from a library with zzso zzso region 3 zzso Surface zzso resonance showed zzso binding of the selected zzso The zzso zzso zzso for binding of zzso to zzso in intact cells and inhibited zzso signal zzso through zzso zzso Invasion of an intact zzso cell zzso by zzso human zzso cells was inhibited by the zzso zzso In addition, the growth of established tumor zzso in mice was reversed after the induction of the conditional expression of the zzso zzso In archival zzso brain tumors expression levels of zzso and zzso were found elevated and appear correlated with poor patient zzso This suggests a zzso function of the zzso interaction that may be exploited zzso
