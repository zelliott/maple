zzso meningitis zzso is a devastating disease characterized by the dissemination of zzso tumor cells into the zzso space along the brain and zzso zzso treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso can be effective against zzso systemic breast zzso but, like other therapies, is ineffective against zzso The goal of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic effect of zzso emitting zzso zzso following zzso administration in a rat model of breast zzso zzso 

zzso rats were injected zzso with zzso breast zzso cells through a surgically implanted zzso zzso zzso In zzso 1, animals received 33 or 66 zzso zzso zzso cold zzso or zzso In zzso 2, animals were zzso with a lower tumor burden and received 46 or 92 zzso zzso zzso or zzso In zzso 3, animals received 28 zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso zzso zzso control zzso or zzso zzso analysis of the zzso was performed at the end of the zzso 

In zzso 1, median survival increased from 21 days for the saline and cold zzso groups to 45 and 48 days for 33 and 66 zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso 2, median survival increased from 23 days for saline controls to 68 and 92 days for 46 and 92 zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso 3, median survival increased from 20 days to 29 and 36 days for animals treated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso survivors were observed exclusively in the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso shows promise as a treatment for patients with zzso breast zzso
