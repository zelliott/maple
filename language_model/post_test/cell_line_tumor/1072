zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrates differential zzso activity in the National Cancer Institute's zzso drug zzso We demonstrate here that zzso human breast cancer cells are sensitive to zzso both in zzso and when grown in zzso as zzso in zzso zzso As previous work has indicated that zzso requires zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso we investigated the effect of zzso on zzso expression and on the zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso a zzso regulator of zzso In zzso but not zzso cells, the drug caused a zzso induction of zzso zzso and a corresponding increase in zzso zzso An zzso zzso of the zzso breast zzso zzso with diminished zzso zzso exhibits cellular resistance to zzso and is zzso to zzso zzso induction by the zzso The increase in zzso zzso in the zzso zzso breast tumor cell results from zzso zzso of zzso element zzso zzso zzso treatment causes a zzso of the zzso from the zzso to the nucleus with subsequent formation of zzso protein DNA zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso cells, the resistant cell lines zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated zzso nuclear zzso of zzso Additionally, zzso failed to induce zzso activity, zzso transcription, zzso complex formation, and zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso of zzso in a sensitive breast tumor cell line is the result of the engagement of zzso signal zzso
