The zzso family zzso factor zzso is an zzso of zzso in its zzso form and was recently reported to be a zzso of zzso zzso We studied the roles of zzso in both zzso zzso (a zzso zzso cell line) and zzso zzso human zzso cancer cell zzso Treatment of zzso cells but not zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso experiments revealed that a zzso zzso of zzso or a triple zzso zzso of zzso in which all three of the putative zzso zzso sites were converted to zzso was unable to zzso the zzso protein in cells treated with zzso Because the zzso form of zzso is known to be localized in the zzso we examined whether zzso zzso of zzso might have an effect on the zzso distribution of zzso zzso induced the zzso of zzso in the zzso in zzso cells but not in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso induced the association of zzso protein with zzso in zzso cells but not in zzso zzso Because the zzso form of zzso binds the zzso zzso promoter, thereby inducing zzso we further examined the effect of the zzso status of zzso on the activity of the zzso zzso promoter in the presence of zzso zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso or TM of zzso induced the activity of the zzso zzso promoter in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso expression of TM of zzso in zzso cells decreased the cell viability after treatment with zzso Our findings suggest that zzso causes the zzso of zzso via a zzso zzso zzso and zzso of this cascade zzso zzso cancer cells to zzso
