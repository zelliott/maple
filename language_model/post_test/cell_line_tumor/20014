zzso is zzso used to treat various human zzso however, clinical responses to zzso are zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso plays an zzso role in prostate cancer development and prostate cancer cells with higher level of zzso are particularly sensitive to zzso zzso We show that zzso is frequently zzso in human primary prostate cancer and cell zzso zzso subjects with tumors that highly expressed zzso had poor overall zzso zzso zzso inhibited cell proliferation and induced zzso in zzso and in zzso whereas zzso zzso transformed human normal prostate zzso cells and promoted invasion, which was attenuated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We further show that the sensitivity to zzso is positively correlated with zzso expression in a panel of prostate cell zzso zzso zzso expression greatly enhanced sensitivity to zzso while its zzso zzso resistance to this zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso in a zzso and zzso manner, consequently leading to inaction of zzso zzso Finally, we show that zzso level is correlated with zzso expression and zzso in zzso prostate cancer zzso Our results offer the first evidence that zzso is a potential therapeutic target for prostate cancer and may serve as a zzso for assessing prognosis of human prostate cancer and response to zzso zzso
