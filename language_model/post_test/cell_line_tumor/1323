The aim of the present study was to investigate the dynamics of zzso oxide zzso zzso formation in mice with transplanted tumors and to zzso whether synthetic zzso zzso zzso and natural compounds could zzso zzso zzso 

In the study zzso zzso zzso and zzso mice were zzso zzso zzso synthesis in mice with transplanted zzso zzso zzso and Lewis lung zzso zzso was estimated by measuring urine zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and their concentration in tumor tissue determined by zzso zzso 

It is shown that zzso development is accompanied by increased zzso zzso formation whereas LLC growth - by its zzso Total zzso zzso with urine in zzso mice during tumor development was in the range of zzso zzso body weight that was zzso times higher than that in zzso zzso Treatment of zzso animals with zzso and zzso resulted in decreased zzso formation causing moderate tumor growth zzso Effect of treatment with zzso was shown to be dependent on the rout of its administration and zzso Treatment of zzso mice with zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso enriched with zzso resulted in tumor growth zzso at the early stage of zzso growth accompanied by stimulation of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso formation towards normal zzso levels or zzso of these compounds may result in tumor growth zzso
