The natural product zzso is a zzso found in many fruits and zzso Previous research has shown that zzso has zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the present investigation we studied the effect of zzso on the ability of prostate cancer cell lines with various degrees of aggressive potential to form colonies in zzso Specifically, we examined the molecular mechanisms underlying this effect, including the expression of cell cycle and tumor zzso genes as well as zzso We observed that zzso at zzso of 25 and 50 zzso M significantly inhibited the growth of the highly aggressive zzso prostate cancer cell line and the moderately aggressive zzso prostate cancer cell line, whereas it did not affect colony formation by the poorly aggressive zzso prostate cancer cell line or the normal zzso cell line zzso Using the gene array methodology, we found that zzso significantly inhibited the expression of specific zzso and genes controlling zzso zzso zzso and M zzso of the cell zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso the expression of several tumor zzso zzso In conclusion, our results demonstrate that the zzso effects of zzso directly correlate with the aggressive potential of prostate cancer cells and that the zzso of zzso zzso effects may involve zzso of tumor zzso genes and zzso zzso of zzso and cell cycle zzso The results of these studies provide a scientific basis for the potential use of zzso as zzso in the zzso of zzso
