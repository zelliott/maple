zzso integrated into zzso DNA participate in long-range gene zzso from as far away as several hundred zzso zzso have been put forth to account for these phenomena, but data have not been provided to support a physical mechanism that explains long-range zzso In zzso leukemia zzso zzso leukemia in mice, integrated zzso have been found upstream of zzso in three regions, named zzso zzso and zzso zzso 50, and 70 zzso upstream, zzso The zzso factor zzso is an zzso whose zzso and/or zzso can lead to human zzso We hypothesized that the zzso zzso upstream region contains regulatory elements zzso by the zzso To identify regulatory sites in the zzso zzso upstream region, we looked by zzso zzso with zzso technology zzso for zzso modifications implicating gene zzso in normal zzso zzso zzso and zzso were enriched at zzso and/or zzso in the zzso cell line zzso which expresses zzso The enrichment of all of these zzso marks decreased with zzso zzso of the gene in zzso cells but increased and spread in tumor cells containing integrated zzso zzso using zzso zzso capture zzso zzso zzso interactions between the zzso region, including the promoter and all zzso sites zzso zzso and zzso were detected due to DNA looping in zzso cells and tumor cells with zzso in zzso zzso or zzso zzso our study provides a new mechanism of zzso zzso zzso zzso spatial zzso organization allows zzso located zzso with its own zzso zzso to access the zzso regulatory region of the zzso
