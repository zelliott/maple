zzso zzso zzso is the key zzso factor involved in the zzso response to zzso It has been established that zzso is zzso in various human zzso including oral zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso a wide spectrum of many key cancer molecular pathways involved in diverse tumor zzso In this study, zzso interference zzso was introduced to zzso the expression of zzso in zzso in zzso and in zzso The zzso and protein expression levels of zzso and vascular zzso growth factor were detected by quantitative real-time reverse zzso western zzso and zzso and cell proliferation activity was assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso growth, zzso density, zzso and the expression of zzso gene zzso in tumor zzso were zzso Our data demonstrated that small interfering zzso targeting zzso significantly inhibited the zzso and protein expression levels of zzso and vascular zzso growth zzso In addition, marked suppression of tumor cell zzso and zzso growth, significant zzso density suppression, reduced expression of zzso and increased cell zzso were zzso These findings suggest that zzso targeting zzso could effectively inhibit the progression of zzso Thus, it may be used as a potent and specific therapy for oral cancer, especially in zzso and preventing cancer cell zzso and zzso
