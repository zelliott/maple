In this study, we examined the possible involvement of zzso cells in the zzso of human zzso zzso zzso using tissue specimens and cell zzso We used zzso cassette zzso zzso as a zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso were observed in the zzso areas of the zzso zzso and zzso cancer cells were also scattered or zzso clustered in zzso We sorted the cultured zzso cells zzso and zzso into zzso and zzso zzso and then zzso them for 4 zzso zzso cells could generate zzso and zzso zzso during zzso whereas zzso cells bore only zzso cells, suggesting that a cancer cell hierarchy with reference to zzso exists in zzso cells and that zzso cells reside at the higher rank in that zzso Interestingly, other zzso cell markers including zzso 19 and zzso were mainly expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was more intense in zzso zzso In addition, the expression patterns of zzso factors zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso protein zzso in zzso and zzso cells resembled those during normal liver zzso In conclusion, this study suggests that cancer cells with zzso expression might play a central role in zzso and the maintenance of the cancer cell hierarchy of human zzso
