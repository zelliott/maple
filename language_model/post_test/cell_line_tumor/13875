zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which causes zzso of gastric zzso cells and other types of cultured cells, is known to stimulate zzso via a zzso zzso In the present study, we examined the mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was monitored by zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells in which zzso c release was zzso most of zzso was localized to zzso rather than zzso zzso reduced the membrane potential of isolated zzso without inducing zzso c release, suggesting that it did not act directly to induce zzso c release from zzso and that in intact cells, zzso zzso c release involved zzso zzso such as a zzso zzso family zzso In agreement, flow zzso analyses using zzso specific for activated zzso revealed that zzso zzso was activated by zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso Using active zzso zzso we also observed that the zzso family zzso zzso was zzso By zzso zzso zzso and zzso were activated in zzso cells in which zzso c release was induced by zzso In addition, small interfering zzso zzso of the zzso gene resulted in reduction of zzso zzso c release, consistent with a contribution of zzso zzso zzso to zzso c zzso zzso enhanced both zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso was not inhibited by zzso zzso which inhibited zzso caused by zzso These results suggest that zzso acts through different signaling pathways to induce zzso via zzso zzso independent of zzso
