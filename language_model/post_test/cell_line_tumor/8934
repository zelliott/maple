This study aimed to evaluate the mechanism associated with zzso activity displayed by the drug zzso incorporated in zzso zzso and its slow delivery from the zzso zzso zzso characterization encompasses zzso analysis zzso differential scanning zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso zzso transform infrared zzso and X-ray zzso zzso was performed to verify the process of association between the drug zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was done to indicate that zzso is the mechanism responsible for the cell zzso The release profile of the drug zzso from zzso zzso for 48 hours was zzso Also, the zzso activity was evaluated by the zzso testing and the production of zzso oxide and zzso zzso were zzso The chemical characterization of the material indicated the presence of drug associated with the coordination network in a proportion of zzso g zzso per zzso g of zzso zzso The zzso tests were carried out against four cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso associated drug was extremely zzso against the human breast cancer zzso zzso cell line and against human acute zzso leukemia cells zzso cancer cells were killed by zzso zzso The drug demonstrated a slow release profile where zzso of the drug was released in 48 zzso The results indicated that the drug incorporated in zzso zzso decreased significantly the number of zzso in the zzso cavity of zzso as well as reduced levels of zzso and zzso oxide zzso
