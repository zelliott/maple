Since recent evidence indicates a requirement for zzso nuclear factor zzso signaling in lung zzso we investigated the impact of the zzso inhibitor zzso on lung tumor promotion and zzso We used an experimental model in which zzso mice or mice expressing an zzso reporter received zzso zzso (1 zzso followed by twice weekly zzso (1 zzso during distinct periods of tumor zzso Mice were serially assessed for lung zzso zzso inflammation and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso did not impact tumor formation but retarded the growth of established lung tumors in mice via effects on cell zzso In contrast, long-term treatment with zzso resulted in significantly increased lung tumor number and zzso This zzso effect of prolonged zzso treatment was associated with perpetuation of zzso inflammation and chronic zzso of zzso and zzso zzso motif zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 in the zzso In addition to airway zzso zzso inhibited zzso in pulmonary zzso in zzso presenting a possible mechanism of tumor zzso In this regard, zzso zzso exposed to zzso showed increased expression of zzso zzso and zzso In conclusion, although short-term zzso may exert some beneficial effects, prolonged zzso zzso zzso chemical lung zzso by perpetuating zzso zzso zzso of zzso in pulmonary zzso appears to play an important role in this adverse zzso
