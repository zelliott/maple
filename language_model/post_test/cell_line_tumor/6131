To investigate the chemical constituents of the branches and leaves of zzso zzso 

The compounds were isolated and zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso column zzso zzso Their chemical structures were zzso on the basis of zzso properties and spectral zzso 

Fourteen compounds were isolated and identified as zzso acid zzso zzso acid zzso zzso acid zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso 

All the compounds were isolated from the zzso zzso for the first time; compounds 6 and 13 showed zzso activities against zzso tumor cell zzso
