zzso member of the zzso zzso family, is a zzso protein that is involved in the regulation of cell zzso and zzso The aim of this study was to determine whether or not the expression of zzso zzso correlated with sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso zzso and could serve as markers with potential clinical zzso 

Human pancreatic zzso zzso cell lines were characterized for in zzso sensitivity to zzso expression of zzso family zzso markers of zzso to zzso transition, and expression of zzso and its zzso zzso The effects of zzso growth factor zzso and zzso on zzso expression as well as the effect of zzso zzso on cell proliferation were also zzso 

zzso was detected in all of the pancreatic tumor cell lines tested as well as in the majority of the human tumor samples zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso was specifically associated with an zzso zzso zzso dependency, and sensitivity to zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced cell proliferation and zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells, and promoted the growth zzso effects of zzso 

zzso our data indicate that the zzso zzso is associated with an zzso zzso and identifies zzso cell lines that are sensitive to the zzso inhibitor zzso The availability of zzso zzso may offer a new tool in pancreatic cancer management if these results can be verified zzso in cancer zzso
