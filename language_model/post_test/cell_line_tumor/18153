zzso zzso zzso an abundant zzso zzso in zzso regulates vascular and immune cells by zzso zzso zzso In this report, we investigated the mechanisms by which high plasma zzso levels are maintained in zzso We found that plasma zzso turns over rapidly with a zzso of approximately 15 minutes, suggesting the existence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso of bone zzso from zzso to zzso mice restored plasma zzso levels, suggesting that zzso cells are capable of zzso zzso into zzso However, plasma zzso levels were not appreciably altered in mice that were zzso zzso or zzso Surprisingly, zzso of zzso bone zzso cells into zzso hosts failed to reduce plasma zzso suggesting the existence of an zzso zzso source for plasma zzso zzso expression of zzso in the liver of zzso mice restored plasma zzso zzso In zzso vascular zzso cells, but not zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso stress zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso while zzso stimulating zzso release from zzso cells in zzso zzso of expression of zzso zzso zzso with small interfering zzso and zzso expression altered zzso zzso suggesting an important role played by this zzso These data suggest that the vascular zzso in addition to the zzso system, is a major contributor of plasma zzso
