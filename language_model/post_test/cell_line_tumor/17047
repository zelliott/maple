zzso is a mounting health concern in the United States and is associated with an increased risk for developing several zzso including zzso cell zzso zzso Despite this, little is known regarding the impact of obesity on zzso zzso Because zzso cells zzso are critical regulators of zzso zzso we examined the combined effects of obesity and tumor outgrowth on DC zzso Using a zzso obesity zzso model, DC function was evaluated in mice bearing zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso mice had profoundly altered serum zzso and zzso profiles, with zzso of 15 zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso mice had elevated percentages of conventional zzso DC that were impaired in their ability to stimulate zzso T cell expansion, although they were zzso similar to normal weight zzso zzso In zzso mice, zzso zzso tumor challenge in the absence of therapy led to increased local zzso by T zzso DC and accelerated early tumor zzso Following administration of a zzso zzso established zzso tumors zzso in normal weight zzso The same zzso was ineffective in zzso mice and was characterized by an zzso of regulatory DC in zzso zzso decreased local zzso by zzso zzso T cells, and progressive tumor zzso Our results suggest that the presence of obesity as a zzso can impair the efficacy of zzso zzso zzso
