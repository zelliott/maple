zzso is an orally zzso zzso currently being tested in phase II clinical trials as a potential zzso zzso In this study, we reveal a novel mechanism underlying the zzso activity of zzso that involves the induction of zzso 2 zzso in human cancer zzso zzso induced zzso and/or cell cycle arrest in several lung and head and neck cancer cell zzso However, the combination of zzso with low zzso of zzso rendered cells less sensitive to zzso both in cell culture systems and in lung cancer zzso zzso zzso we examined the effects of zzso on zzso expression and activity in a set of lung and head and neck cancer cell lines, and found that zzso rapidly and zzso increased zzso levels and activity, the degrees of which correlated to the abilities of zzso to inhibit the growth of cancer zzso We also detected increased zzso levels in lung cancer zzso treated with zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso induction by both zzso and small interfering zzso approaches decreased cell sensitivity to zzso zzso these data indicate that the zzso of zzso contributes to the zzso activity of zzso including zzso induction and growth zzso These data are clinically relevant as they suggest that the combination of zzso and zzso zzso such as zzso may produce a potential drug zzso
