zzso the growth of new blood vessels from pre-existing zzso is a key process in several pathological conditions, including zzso growth and age-related zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factors zzso stimulate zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso (also known as zzso is present in all zzso during development, and in the adult it becomes restricted to the zzso zzso However, zzso is zzso in the zzso of zzso and zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso is highly expressed in zzso zzso and genetic targeting of zzso or blocking of zzso zzso with zzso zzso results in decreased zzso vascular density, vessel branching and zzso cell proliferation in mouse zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and sustained zzso even in the presence of zzso (also known as zzso or zzso zzso whereas zzso against zzso and zzso in combination resulted in additive zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, genetic or pharmacological disruption of the zzso zzso zzso led to widespread zzso zzso expression and excessive zzso which was inhibited by blocking zzso zzso Our results zzso zzso as a regulator of vascular network zzso zzso zzso may provide additional efficacy for zzso therapies, especially towards vessels that are resistant to zzso or zzso zzso
