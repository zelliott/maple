During zzso zzso zzso gases are in direct contact with the zzso zzso in which they may affect zzso zzso and fluid zzso The effects of zzso gases in zzso on zzso zzso and zzso channels, which participate in zzso liquid zzso remain zzso In the present study, the effects of zzso zzso 2, and zzso zzso on zzso function in cultured human zzso cells were investigated using the zzso zzso After exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso inward currents increased by zzso whereas zzso outward currents decreased by zzso These effects, which occurred within 30 zzso remained for zzso periods of exposure to the gas, were zzso and were zzso upon zzso zzso with zzso prevented zzso of the increase in inward currents without change in outward zzso consistent with an zzso of zzso zzso sodium zzso zzso obliterated zzso of the effect of zzso on outward zzso without change in inward zzso indicating zzso of zzso zzso zzso These channels were identified in excised patches to be zzso zzso zzso zzso These effects of zzso were not modified after the zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso Exposure of the cells to either zzso or to low zzso completely prevented the increase in zzso currents induced by zzso suggesting a release of zzso channels zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso and independently zzso and zzso zzso in human zzso zzso
