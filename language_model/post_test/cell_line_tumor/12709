We studied the tumor stem cell properties of the zzso zzso in the human lung zzso cell line zzso zzso cells were classified into zzso based on differential expression patterns for zzso and zzso zzso from different zzso were cultured and zzso injected into 32 nude zzso Our results as following, zzso The majority of zzso cells died, whereas only about zzso of cells divided and proliferated to form cell zzso zzso The expression of zzso and zzso in zzso cancer cells was statistically significantly different from that in normal zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell proliferation in group A zzso was the fastest among all zzso Cell proliferation in zzso cells was slower than in group A but faster than in groups B zzso C zzso and D zzso zzso The zzso capacity in cells from group A was significantly higher than that in cells from groups B ( zzso C ( zzso and D ( zzso In conclusion, zzso cells in the zzso cell line zzso have expressive significant cancer stem cell properties with continuous zzso capacity and differentiation zzso
