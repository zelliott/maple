We zzso the zzso properties of a small cell lung zzso cell line zzso zzso established from a patient with zzso who had zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies showed that zzso cells have features of the classic type of zzso zzso cells grew in suspension, forming relatively small zzso of cells with a doubling time of 72 zzso On light zzso the cells were relatively small with little zzso On zzso using zzso zzso rabbit zzso the cells were intensely positive for zzso In addition, they were positive for zzso zzso and zzso They also expressed human zzso a zzso zzso whose presence was confirmed by zzso analysis with zzso sequencing and Western zzso zzso The point zzso of their zzso gene zzso zzso was detected as zzso The present study demonstrates that human zzso is expressed in zzso cells cultured from an zzso zzso patient with zzso zzso might be important for further research on zzso related zzso
