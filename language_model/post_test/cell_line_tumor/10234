In this article the synthesis of new zzso and zzso complexes with zzso zzso is zzso The structures of obtained compounds have been characterized by X-ray zzso and zzso zzso functional zzso zzso The zzso of complexes and zzso has been examined for two human leukemia cell lines zzso and zzso and one human melanoma cell line zzso The zzso complex with zzso has been shown to possess greater activity than zzso against the zzso melanoma cell zzso Additionally, the zzso zzso forms existence in different zzso zzso zzso zzso has been characterized by zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso analysis and zzso zzso The obtained results have been compared with those from other studies of similar zzso
