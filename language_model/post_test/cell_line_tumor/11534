zzso cell zzso zzso is an aggressive form of zzso zzso with an ongoing need for novel zzso Apart from the zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso additional aberrations are frequently observed in zzso including a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso target of zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso a key component of this pathway, is pivotal for the assembly of zzso complex zzso 1 and zzso zzso an analog of the zzso inhibitor zzso is approved for the treatment of relapsed zzso Response rates, however, are low and response zzso are zzso We demonstrate that zzso of zzso by zzso or blocking of zzso and zzso in conjunction with zzso by zzso reduces proliferation of zzso cell lines to a similar zzso However, only zzso is able to sufficiently inhibit the downstream zzso of zzso and to mediate cell death through zzso of the intrinsic zzso zzso Further analysis demonstrated that the zzso zzso family member zzso plays a central role in regulation of zzso zzso While zzso protein levels remained unchanged after zzso with zzso they were zzso in zzso treated zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso zzso or zzso of zzso zzso but not of zzso or zzso by zzso facilitated cell death of zzso cells and enhanced zzso capacity to induce cell zzso Our findings may help to lay the foundation for further improvements in the treatment of zzso
