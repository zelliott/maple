Recently studies have shown that zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso and cancer progression of zzso zzso Here, we examined the molecular mechanism of zzso expression of AID in cancer cells, and whether or not zzso oxide zzso zzso this zzso as NO is known to cause chemical zzso of the zzso In several cancer cell lines, treatment with the DNA zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso expression of AID by zzso and expression was further induced by additional treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso with no zzso The zzso sites located in the promoter and zzso 1 region of the AID gene in cancer cells were found to be zzso in correlation with AID expression zzso Further, administration of zzso zzso also induced expression of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso in cancer cells treated with zzso Interestingly, administration of zzso zzso a zzso oxide zzso zzso was found to enhance AID and zzso expression in zzso cells treated with zzso Our findings suggest that AID and zzso expression in cancer cells may be modified by zzso mechanisms, and that NO may further enhance AID and zzso zzso Given recent plans to introduce zzso and zzso zzso as novel cancer treatments, these findings regarding the potential for zzso and zzso zzso to enhance expression of AID and zzso resulting in further cancer zzso might be taken into zzso
