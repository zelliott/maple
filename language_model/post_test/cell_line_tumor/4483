zzso have been implicated as key contributors of zzso cell lung cancer zzso zzso However, the role of zzso a recently discovered zzso for zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso is zzso To define the relative contribution of zzso receptors to migration and zzso we generated human lung zzso and zzso cell lines with stable zzso of zzso zzso or zzso Cancer cells exhibited zzso to zzso that was enhanced under hypoxic conditions, associated with a parallel induction of zzso but not zzso Interestingly, neither zzso cell line differed in the rate of zzso zzso or cell zzso however, in both cell lines, zzso migration was abolished when zzso signaling was zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso signaling did not alter cellular migration to zzso In an in zzso zzso zzso model using zzso cells, expression of zzso but not zzso on cancer cells was necessary for the development of zzso In addition, cancer cells knocked down for zzso (or both zzso and zzso produced larger and more vascular tumors as compared with zzso or zzso zzso tumors, an effect that was attributable to cancer zzso zzso out competing zzso cells for available zzso in the tumor zzso These results indicate that zzso not zzso expression engages zzso to mediate zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso migration and zzso may be a viable therapeutic option in zzso
