Limited improvement in long term survival of lung cancer patients has been achieved by conventional chemotherapy or targeted zzso To explore the zzso of tumor initiating cells zzso therapy, it is essential to identify the cell targets and understand their maintenance zzso We have analyzed the performance of zzso zzso as zzso markers and treatment targets of lung cancer using zzso in zzso and in zzso analyses in multiple established and zzso lung cancer zzso The zzso subset showed the highest enhancement of stem cell zzso properties compared to zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso They showed higher invasion zzso zzso genes and zzso transition zzso factors zzso lower zzso zzso protein expression and higher zzso phase cell cycle zzso In zzso mice, the zzso showed the highest tumor induction frequency, serial zzso shortest zzso largest volume and highest growth zzso zzso of sonic zzso and zzso zzso pathways reduced zzso zzso zzso and targeted therapy resulted in higher zzso subset viability and zzso subset zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso led to reduced zzso gene expression and zzso to drug zzso In zzso clinical lung zzso containing a higher abundance of zzso and zzso cells was associated with lower recurrence-free zzso Together, results suggested zzso was the cellular zzso of zzso and drug zzso Further investigation of the regulatory mechanisms underlying zzso maintenance would be beneficial for the development of long term lung cancer zzso
