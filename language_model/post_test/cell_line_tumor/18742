zzso zzso zzso protein 14 zzso is one of zzso zzso referred as zzso The zzso zzso formed by zzso with its partner zzso zzso is the major fatty acid carrier in zzso The zzso complex has been also implicated in the zzso transport of zzso acid and its precursors in zzso We show here the involvement of zzso in human zzso zzso In an initial study, zzso differential zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso was performed with two zzso zzso one zzso zzso and matched normal adjacent zzso zzso with the arbitrary primer zzso showed that one zzso band was highly expressed in normal zzso but disappeared or substantially decreased in tumor zzso It was later identified to be the zzso of migration zzso zzso protein 14 zzso Northern zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso as compared with adjacent normal zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso demonstrated that expression of zzso was restricted to normal zzso zzso No zzso was found in the zzso DNA of the zzso gene by zzso and directed DNA zzso Our finding suggested that the reduction of zzso expression is a frequent event in Chinese human zzso zzso
