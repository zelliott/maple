To investigate the effects of the zzso of zzso zzso 2 zzso gene on cell growth and invasion of the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso for zzso delivery of zzso was constructed and zzso into zzso zzso After collecting the viral zzso the zzso cell line zzso cells were zzso The effects of zzso silence on cell proliferation and cell cycle were detected using zzso zzso plate colony formation zzso and flow zzso The migration and invasion of zzso cells were determined by wound healing zzso and zzso invasion zzso zzso The expressions of zzso and zzso transition zzso markers at zzso and protein levels were examined by real-time zzso and Western zzso zzso 

The expressions of zzso zzso and protein in the zzso zzso cells were obviously zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso significantly inhibited the growth of zzso cells zzso zzso zzso Colony formation rate zzso of zzso cells was lower than control zzso P zzso zzso Cell cycle analysis showed that most zzso cells were arrested in zzso phase, with a very low ratio of cells in S zzso zzso healing zzso indicated that the migration ability of cells zzso zzso decreased significantly, and the zzso relative migration distance of zzso cells and control cells was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso invasion zzso showed the invasive capacity of cells zzso zzso was significantly zzso with less penetrating cells zzso zzso zzso compared to control zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso expressions of zzso markers zzso and zzso 18 in the cells zzso zzso increased by zzso and zzso respectively, and the zzso expressions of zzso markers zzso and zzso decreased by zzso and zzso zzso Similar results also were obtained with Western zzso zzso 

zzso significantly enhanced the proliferation and invasion of zzso zzso cells in zzso which might be zzso by inducing zzso
