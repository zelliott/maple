A key step in human colon cancer development includes the zzso of zzso signaling and the induction of zzso target genes that participate in colon cancer zzso Recent studies identified members of the zzso cell zzso molecules zzso of the zzso family zzso and zzso as targets of zzso signaling in colon cancer zzso zzso was detected at the invasive front of colon cancer tissue and zzso zzso when zzso in zzso In contrast to zzso we did not detect in colon cancer cells significant levels of another zzso family of zzso the zzso zzso receptors zzso and zzso while zzso was previously found in the normal small zzso and colon zzso We studied the properties of colon cancer cells in which zzso and zzso were expressed either alone, or in zzso and found that such cells display a wide range of properties associated with tumor zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso was the most efficient in suppressing the zzso of colon cancer zzso This was associated with enhanced rates of zzso and change in several zzso zzso In contrast to its capacity to suppress zzso zzso was unable to affect the highly zzso and zzso capacities of colon cancer cells in which zzso was zzso Our results suggest that various zzso zzso families play different roles in affecting the zzso function of the same cells, and that zzso and zzso can fulfill a tumor zzso zzso
