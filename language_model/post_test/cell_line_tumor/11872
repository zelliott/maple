The creation and characterization of permanent cell lines derived from primary human zzso in the 1960s gave scientists access to unlimited, renewable material in which to study the development of brain zzso These cells, however, were already zzso and selected for growth in culture, limiting the amount of information that could be gathered about the events that led to the formation of their tumors of zzso In response to these limitations, investigators moved to the study of primary tumors to identify in a zzso fashion the zzso important in tumor formation, and to the use of animal models to gain information about the transformation zzso While these approaches have been zzso successful, they too are limited by their zzso nature (in the case of zzso zzso and their potential lack of direct relevance to human cancer (in the case of mouse zzso Recent developments in the isolation and manipulation of human cells have allowed investigators a fresh chance to address questions about brain tumors in a direct zzso The present review serves as a summary of important recent findings derived from the use of defined human cells in the study of zzso
