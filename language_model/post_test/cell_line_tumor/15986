We describe the zzso levels and molecular and cellular repair of DNA zzso breaks zzso in zzso acid zzso human zzso zzso cells after zzso in zzso This study was conducted to provide a basis for our previous observation of zzso and zzso of cellular recovery after zzso of zzso zzso zzso brain tumor zzso We used the neutral comet zzso to assess zzso and found that the zzso zzso levels as indicated by the mean tail moment after a 1 h application of 2 zzso zzso at 37 zzso was increased from a value of zzso in control cells to zzso in zzso treated cells at 0 radiation zzso However, at all radiation doses, the induction zzso of zzso were zzso suggesting that no interaction of zzso with the initial zzso actions of zzso radiation zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that this increase was not due to zzso in the relative percentages of zzso cells throughout the cell zzso In zzso DNA repair studies we found that zzso decreased the repair rate of zzso cells by a factor of zzso This suggests that the zzso from graded single doses of zzso occurs as a consequence of zzso zzso of the zzso repair zzso These results link the previously noted changes in cellular zzso to a molecular zzso That is, zzso produces increased numbers of zzso in the zzso zzso coupled with a decreased repair rate of zzso in zzso radiation zzso
