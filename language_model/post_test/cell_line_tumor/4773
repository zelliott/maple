zzso zzso is characterized by a poor prognosis and lack of response to conventional zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of zzso zzso on proliferation and zzso of pancreatic cancer cells in zzso We found that zzso induced prominent growth zzso and zzso in human pancreatic cell zzso In addition, zzso treatment significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as downstream zzso B4 zzso production, in these cell zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso in zzso cell lines or zzso zzso made them more resistant to zzso zzso which was correlated with increased zzso zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso acid metabolism is associated with the zzso activity of zzso We also provide evidence that zzso has clinical therapeutic value for patients with pancreatic zzso
