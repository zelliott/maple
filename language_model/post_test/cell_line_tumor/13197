zzso is a member of the zzso protein family, and genetic variation in zzso is associated with zzso and peripheral artery zzso In this study we investigated the zzso binding properties of zzso in zzso as well as its zzso and function in human zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso selectively interacts with zzso while the zzso zzso binding domain binds cholesterol and several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso containing a predicted zzso segment zzso the zzso association, but allows partial zzso zzso A zzso zzso fusion protein is distributed mainly in the zzso and the plasma zzso indicating that the zzso affinity of zzso involves other zzso in addition to the zzso zzso zzso cells expressing zzso zzso display increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso but not of zzso in culture zzso and contain reduced levels of zzso zzso zzso analysis of cellular zzso demonstrates enhanced zzso zzso by cells expressing zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is zzso in zzso cells zzso with the zzso zzso zzso As a conclusion, the present study zzso the zzso of zzso association with zzso and the zzso complex and provides evidence for a specific role of this protein in zzso zzso by human zzso
