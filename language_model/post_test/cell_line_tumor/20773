Most drugs do not have the zzso features required for optimal pulmonary zzso In this study, we developed zzso zzso zzso carriers zzso to improve the delivery of zzso agents to lung zzso zzso zzso modified with zzso zzso zzso weight 2000 zzso zzso zzso modified with zzso zzso zzso weight zzso zzso and zzso without zzso modification were prepared by zzso and zzso and were loaded with zzso zzso They were investigated in terms of zzso zzso zzso cellular zzso and zzso effect zzso zzso exhibited regular zzso with a zzso zzso The particle size zzso by laser zzso was approximately 100 zzso zzso in zzso protected the active zzso form of zzso compared with zzso solution after incubation with zzso In zzso studies, zzso especially zzso zzso had longer circulation time and decreased zzso by the zzso system zzso compared with unmodified zzso zzso accumulated in the lungs after zzso injection in zzso zzso showed enhanced cellular zzso by human lung zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments indicated that zzso loaded with zzso have superior efficacy against zzso lung cancer compared with zzso solution and zzso These results suggest that zzso is a promising delivery system for zzso in the treatment of lung zzso
