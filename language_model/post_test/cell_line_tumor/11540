zzso protein zzso has emerged as an important factor in pancreatic beta cell biology, and tight regulation of zzso levels is necessary for beta cell zzso However, the mechanisms regulating zzso expression have only started to be zzso The zzso zzso zzso factor zzso has been reported to zzso zzso expression in zzso and zzso cells but to zzso zzso in liver, and the effects on beta cells have remained zzso We now have found that zzso binds to the zzso promoter in zzso in human zzso and zzso beta cells and significantly decreases zzso zzso zzso promoter deletion analyses revealed that an zzso motif zzso zzso response zzso protein zzso zzso zzso expression is necessary and sufficient for this effect, and zzso shift zzso confirmed zzso binding to this zzso Moreover, zzso blocked zzso zzso expression and reduced zzso zzso binding at the zzso promoter without affecting zzso expression or nuclear zzso suggesting that zzso may compete with zzso for binding to the zzso zzso In fact, a zzso zzso zzso zzso failed to inhibit zzso transcription, and the effects were not restricted to zzso as zzso also inhibited zzso of other zzso target genes such as liver zzso zzso Together, these results demonstrate that zzso zzso beta cell zzso zzso and suggest that zzso zzso this zzso by interfering with zzso DNA binding at target gene zzso Our findings thereby reveal a novel gene regulatory mechanism and a previously unappreciated zzso between zzso and zzso two major zzso signaling zzso
