Some new complexes of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso with potentially interesting biological activities are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were prepared and structurally characterized by means of zzso electronic and zzso and zzso zzso zzso The crystal structure of complexes zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been determined by X-ray zzso Complex zzso is a zzso zzso built up around the zzso zzso zzso zzso Complex zzso is zzso zzso complex with the zzso zzso behaving as a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso hydrogen bonds stabilize these two structures, while the crystal packing is determined by zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid and its metal complexes have been evaluated for zzso activity in zzso against the cells of three human cancer cell lines, zzso zzso cancer cell zzso zzso zzso cancer cell zzso and zzso zzso cell lung zzso and a mouse zzso zzso cell zzso Complex 5 exhibits the highest selectivity against zzso and 4 shows the highest selectivity against zzso zzso zzso were found to be more potent zzso agents against zzso and complex 5 against zzso cancer cell lines than the prevalent benchmark zzso zzso The zzso zzso activity was measured by the zzso test which showed that complex zzso is a good zzso zzso
