zzso virus zzso is the zzso agent for dengue fever, for which there is no approved vaccine or specific zzso zzso As a remedy for this, we explored the use of compounds that interfere with the action of required host factors and describe here the characterization of a zzso inhibitor zzso which has selective effects on zzso and zzso zzso activity, and zzso activity on zzso C, zzso and yellow fever zzso zzso inhibited zzso propagation without zzso zzso zzso synthesis or zzso The compound did not cause any changes in the cellular distribution of zzso 3, a protein critical for zzso zzso zzso but altered the distribution of the structural envelope protein from a zzso network to enlarged discrete zzso which altered the zzso with the zzso replication zzso zzso electron zzso analyses of zzso zzso cells showed the presence of viral particles that were distinctly different from viable enveloped zzso within enlarged zzso zzso These viral particles were devoid of the dense zzso The zzso of the viral particles was not inhibited by zzso however a reduction in the amount of zzso infectious zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso these observations suggest that zzso inhibited the recruitment and assembly of the zzso in specific zzso compartments during the zzso assembly process and hence the production of infectious zzso zzso and zzso compounds could be useful zzso zzso to explore the zzso zzso and could also represent a new class of zzso
