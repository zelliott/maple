zzso zzso zzso is a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso and studies have shown that it is capable of enhancing the zzso effects of several zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that long-term zzso therapy leads to acquired drug resistance and that estrogen, which is normally a survival zzso is a potent zzso agent in these resistant zzso Interestingly, we have developed an zzso breast cancer cell line, zzso which is resistant to zzso zzso but has elevated levels of zzso In the present study, we examined whether zzso is capable of zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso Our results showed that treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso plus zzso zzso combination for 1 week reduced the growth of these cells by almost zzso whereas the individual treatments had no significant effect on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso effect of the combination treatment was due to zzso Our data indicates that zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso human breast cancer cells and that depletion of this zzso by zzso may be critical in zzso resistant cells to zzso zzso
