Eight zzso have been evaluated for their ability to inhibit the in zzso growth of three human tumor cell lines representing different tumor types, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lung zzso and zzso zzso zzso The synthesis of four new zzso zzso is presented as well as the results of the zzso zzso calculations to find the parameters that relate the structure with the zzso zzso This work provides supplementary information that could allow the development of new zzso zzso with this type of biological zzso
