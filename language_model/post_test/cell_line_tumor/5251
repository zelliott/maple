The zzso zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in tumor zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the major biologically active component of green tea, zzso growth in a variety of human cancer cells by zzso the zzso of several types of zzso zzso zzso In this study, we examined the effects of zzso on the activity of the zzso axis in human zzso zzso The levels of total and zzso zzso zzso form of zzso protein zzso were observed to increase in a series of human zzso cell lines in comparison to the zzso normal human zzso zzso zzso inhibited the growth of zzso zzso cells, which express zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in comparison to zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso caused a zzso and zzso decrease in the expression of zzso and zzso zzso The production of zzso from zzso cells was reduced by treatment with zzso zzso of zzso significantly inhibited the growth of zzso zzso in nude mice and this was associated with zzso of the zzso of zzso and its related downstream signaling zzso including zzso and zzso zzso drinking also decreased the expression of zzso protein and zzso zzso in the zzso These findings suggest that zzso can zzso at least in part, its zzso effect on zzso cells by zzso the zzso zzso zzso might therefore be useful in the treatment of zzso
