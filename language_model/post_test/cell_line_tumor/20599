zzso are members of the zinc zzso zzso characterized by the presence of zzso and zzso zzso In human melanoma, zzso is expressed in zzso areas of the zzso border in both melanoma and zzso zzso However, the role of zzso in melanoma progression remains zzso To analyze the role of zzso zzso for the growth and survival of melanoma cells, we have used in zzso zzso systems of melanoma cells and zzso zzso zzso of melanoma cells in the presence of zzso zzso led to increased melanoma cell proliferation and reduced zzso as compared with control zzso We identified zzso and zzso as the two relevant factors expressed in increased amounts in culture zzso from zzso zzso zzso was associated with induced melanoma cell zzso whereas soluble zzso zzso the reduced cellular zzso in zzso In zzso injection of zzso melanoma cells into the flank of zzso animals resulted in the development of significantly larger tumors than in zzso animals as a result of increased proliferation and decreased zzso of melanoma zzso Taken together, zzso expression of zzso during melanoma development zzso the expression of zzso and zzso which in turn affect tumor cell proliferation and zzso
