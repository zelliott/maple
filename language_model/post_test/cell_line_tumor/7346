zzso zzso zzso zzso mediates signaling from the zzso growth factor zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso acid zzso decreases zzso protein levels in zzso zzso and zzso breast cancer cells, which are growth arrested by zzso but not in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Based on prior reports of zzso degradation of zzso we investigated the zzso of zzso in zzso breast cancer zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso blocked the zzso degradation of zzso and zzso increased zzso of zzso in the zzso breast cancer zzso In addition, we found that zzso increases zzso zzso of zzso To zzso the signaling zzso responsible for this zzso event, zzso zzso were zzso Two zzso zzso but not a zzso zzso blocked the zzso degradation and zzso zzso of zzso We demonstrate that zzso activates zzso in the sensitive, but not in the resistant cells, with a time course that is consistent with the zzso decrease of zzso We also show that: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso interact in zzso cells, and zzso zzso of three zzso zzso sites in zzso to zzso results in no zzso in zzso zzso of zzso Together, these results indicate that zzso regulates zzso levels by the zzso pathway, involving a zzso zzso
