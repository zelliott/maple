This study has focused on the use of zzso zzso in the treatment of zzso zzso We have used the human zzso cancer cell line zzso alongside two in-house derived drug resistant zzso zzso zzso acquired resistance to zzso and zzso and the zzso expressing zzso zzso acquired resistance to zzso These zzso cell lines were shown to have a higher expression of zzso zzso and zzso increase, respectively, compared with the parental cell zzso We have shown that the zzso inhibitor zzso (an analogue of zzso zzso is effective in zzso of drug resistant zzso zzso cells giving rise to a synergistic effect when used in combination with either zzso or zzso in zzso zzso These effects were also seen at the level of zzso using the zzso V zzso and expression levels of the zzso zzso A reduction in the downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso was seen in both resistant cell lines when zzso was used in combination with either zzso or zzso This reduction was not so apparent in cells treated with the single agent zzso or zzso zzso Interestingly, we did not show evidence for an enhanced sensitivity to the zzso inhibitor in our zzso expressing resistant lines versus parental zzso zzso However, the zzso resistant cell line appeared more sensitive to the zzso effects of zzso in line with its increased zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso is effective in zzso of zzso cell drug resistance that occurs in conjunction with zzso zzso
