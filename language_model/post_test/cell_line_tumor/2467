The widespread application of zzso zzso in cancer therapy has been greatly hampered by lack of specificity resulting in poor tumor zzso and zzso To address the challenge, two zzso zzso zzso compounds zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso studies were conducted in human lung zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing various zzso of the Ga compounds were prepared using a zzso mixture of zzso zzso and zzso alcohol as zzso zzso zzso were characterized based on size, zzso stability and zzso zzso effects of free or zzso Ga compounds were investigated based on cell zzso production of zzso oxygen species and reduction of zzso zzso Compared to free Ga compounds, zzso of zzso Ga zzso zzso was less dependent on concentration and incubation time zzso with zzso zzso zzso delivery zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso effects of Ga compounds and the effect was pronounced at: zzso shorter incubation times; and zzso at low zzso of zzso zzso 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso Additional studies showed that zzso Ga delivery was not dependent on zzso zzso zzso mechanism zzso zzso zzso suggesting the potential in overcoming zzso resistance in some zzso In general, preparation of stable and zzso zzso that facilitated Ga tumor zzso and zzso effects could be effective in zzso cancer zzso
