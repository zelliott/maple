The zzso protein zzso A zzso is associated with diverse cellular processes such as cell zzso and signaling through its scaffolding zzso Here we examine the effect of zzso on the regulation of signaling pathways that control the expression of zzso zzso zzso The lack of zzso in human zzso melanoma cells was associated with zzso and zzso zzso expression and zzso of active zzso in the absence of zzso zzso zzso cells displayed stronger zzso production and activity than their zzso counterparts where zzso had been zzso zzso Using an zzso promoter construct zzso in zzso zzso zzso and genetic and pharmacological approaches, we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by suppressing the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Experimental evidence indicated that this phenomenon was associated with zzso and zzso of zzso a zzso zzso exchange factor that activates zzso by zzso the release of zzso zzso expression of zzso was accompanied by zzso zzso and elevated levels of zzso in zzso cells, whereas a zzso inactive dominant negative zzso which prevented zzso zzso reduced zzso expression in zzso zzso Our results indicate that expression of zzso regulates zzso zzso of the zzso zzso partly through a zzso mechanism to zzso the production of zzso
