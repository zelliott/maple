To investigate the influences of extracts of zzso zzso on proliferation of zzso cells and expression of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cells were treated for 24 h with five zzso obtained from zzso zzso in different zzso zzso on proliferation of the zzso cells was assessed by zzso zzso zzso of zzso was measured by zzso in the zzso of zzso cells treated with zzso of essential oil and total zzso for 24 zzso zzso of zzso of zzso was detected by zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso essential oil and total zzso showed potential zzso activity on zzso in a concentration dependent zzso Data of zzso showed that fraction of essential oil suppressed zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso indicated that both essential oil and total zzso restrained expression of zzso of zzso 

It suggested that essential oil and total zzso of zzso zzso inhibit proliferation of zzso cells through zzso zzso and expression of zzso in zzso However, further experiments are necessary to carry out to investigate the potential zzso
