zzso zzso is a potent zzso compound that is able to induce zzso in breast cancer zzso In the present study, we show that zzso also has zzso activity in colon cancer cells, showing 50% zzso concentration zzso values lower than those described for breast cancer cells and suggesting great potential of this synthetic drug in the treatment of zzso We identified that the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is a target of zzso being zzso and activated by the zzso However, zzso was not affected by zzso and was not necessary for induction of zzso in either breast or colon cancer zzso In addition, the efficacy of zzso was improved when combined with the zzso zzso zzso which enhanced zzso zzso with involvement of protein zzso zzso Moreover, we report here, for the first time, that in combined therapy, zzso zzso a clear process of zzso formation, and prior treatment with zzso an zzso zzso is able to significantly reduce zzso cell zzso Finally, we observed that a minor population of zzso zzso zzso cells persisted during long-term treatment with lower doses of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso this population showed zzso activity and a percentage of cells arrested in S phase, that was more evident in cells treated with the zzso combination than in cells treated with zzso or zzso zzso Considering the resistance of some cancer cells to conventional chemotherapy, combinations enhancing the diversity of the cell death outcome might succeed in delivering more effective and less toxic zzso
