Lung cancer is one of the most prevalent zzso zzso This study focused on small cell lung cancer zzso which has a poor clinical zzso and attempted to zzso potential therapeutic molecular zzso A zzso zzso search revealed zzso of the zzso gene in three of 13 zzso cell lines and two of 15 primary zzso By introducing these zzso zzso zzso we established artificial zzso cells and found that zzso a zzso inhibitor of zzso signaling that is located downstream from zzso significantly inhibited the growth and colony formation activity of these zzso Using cancer cell lines, we further showed that zzso zzso cells are more sensitive to zzso than zzso zzso zzso Additionally, we found that a zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells was equally sensitive to zzso This study for the first time uncovered zzso zzso in zzso and our findings suggest that zzso molecular therapy could be effective for a zzso of zzso which shows zzso of specific zzso such as zzso zzso and that genetic zzso of zzso according to the zzso status of individual therapeutic target pathways could be clinically zzso especially for zzso zzso
