zzso zzso zzso is an active player in zzso and changes in its composition modify cancer zzso zzso zzso bone zzso zzso zzso stem cells zzso and inflammatory cells can all affect the composition of zzso leading to changes in zzso invasion and zzso formation of zzso zzso In this study, we confirmed an interaction between zzso and oral tongue zzso cell zzso zzso cells by analyzing the invasion progression and gene expression zzso In a zzso zzso zzso invasion model the presence of zzso inhibited the proliferation but increased the invasion of zzso zzso Furthermore, the signals originating from zzso cells zzso the expression of inflammatory zzso by zzso whereas zzso products induced the expression of known invasion linked molecules by zzso zzso zzso after the zzso zzso the zzso zzso was abundantly zzso from zzso and a function blocking zzso against zzso inhibited zzso enhanced cancer invasion zzso However, zzso blocking zzso did not inhibit the depth of zzso Additionally, after exposure to zzso the expression of type I collagen zzso in zzso cells was markedly zzso Interestingly, also high expression of type I collagen zzso zzso zzso in zzso correlated with the zzso mortality of zzso patients, whereas there was no association between cancer tissue zzso levels and the clinical zzso In conclusion, our results suggest that the interaction between zzso and zzso cells induce zzso and zzso zzso zzso of which high level of type I collagen production zzso with the prognosis of zzso zzso
