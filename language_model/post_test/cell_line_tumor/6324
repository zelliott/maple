The zzso of human zzso growth factor zzso zzso results in the zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso cascade that may lead to the resistance to zzso therapy in zzso zzso zzso expressing breast cancer by means of zzso of zzso in the zzso region by zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso and by means of decreasing zzso zzso zzso is the most widely used technique for the detection of zzso and zzso in breast cancer zzso however, is inadequate in its ability to assess the relationship between zzso zzso and zzso cascade at the single cell zzso To clear this major zzso we devised a novel flow zzso method to zzso the expression of zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso cascade simultaneously in single zzso The method was validated by concurrent Western zzso in established cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso after long-term incubation in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Using the flow zzso method, we confirmed the previous finding that zzso expression is zzso upon zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first such zzso to incorporate simultaneous single cell measurement for all of these zzso which may prove useful to determine the zzso zzso in breast tumors or the zzso status in circulating tumor zzso
