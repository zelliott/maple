In this study we identified two zzso compounds (5 and 6) as potent and specific zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Whereas compound 5 exhibited fivefold higher affinity towards zzso than to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compound 6 also inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the same range as zzso zzso compound 5 was screened over zzso zzso identifying 5 as a highly potent and selective inhibitor of zzso X-ray analysis of 5 bound to zzso demonstrated its binding zzso In addition, characterization of 5 and 6 in a cell biological approach revealed the ability of both compounds to inhibit proliferation of tumor cell lines in a dose and cell line specific zzso In zzso our zzso lead to the development of new highly selective zzso and zzso specific zzso with biological zzso
