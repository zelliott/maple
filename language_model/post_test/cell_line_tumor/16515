zzso therapy zzso may be a less invasive treatment for lung zzso Our newly developed surface zzso zzso zzso technique enables us to irradiate deep tumor while preserving the zzso zzso The aim of this basic study was to verify that the zzso technique might be applied to lung zzso 

zzso with zzso sodium was performed using a zzso laser with different pulse dose rates zzso zzso zzso zzso in a mouse model of subcutaneous zzso To mimic the zzso wall structure and a zzso tumor in the zzso we also made a mouse model in which a piece of zzso cartilage was placed between the zzso and the zzso and zzso was carried out 2 weeks after zzso In both experiments, the tissue samples were collected zzso after zzso and evaluated zzso 

zzso using a zzso laser damaged the underlying tissue but left the superficial tissue intact in the mouse subcutaneous tumor zzso In zzso a higher zzso produced a thicker layer of intact superficial tissue than a lower zzso while a lower zzso produced a deeper layer of damaged tissue than a higher zzso zzso was also able to preserve the superficial tissue and to damage the tumor tissue beneath the cartilage zzso 

zzso was able to damage tumor beneath the superficial normal tissue layer, which included zzso cartilage in the mouse zzso The thickness control of zzso was provided by controlling laser pulse zzso zzso is a new technology, whose future potential is zzso The initial clinical application of this technology could be zzso treatment zzso zzso therapy of zzso zzso via zzso
