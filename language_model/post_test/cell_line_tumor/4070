zzso is required for the unlimited lifespan of cancer zzso The vast majority of pancreatic zzso zzso zzso activity and blocking zzso could limit their zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso that blocks the template region of zzso The aim of this study was to define the effects of long-term zzso exposure on the maintenance of zzso and lifespan of pancreatic cancer zzso zzso size, zzso activity, and zzso zzso response to zzso were measured in a panel of 10 pancreatic cancer cell zzso The cell lines exhibited large differences in levels of zzso activity zzso zzso but most lines had very short zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso inhibited zzso in all 10 pancreatic cancer cell lines, with zzso ranging from 50 zzso to 200 zzso Continuous zzso exposure of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso resulted in an initial rapid zzso of the zzso followed by the maintenance of extremely short but stable zzso Continuous exposure to the drug eventually led to crisis and to a complete loss of viability after 47 zzso and 69 zzso zzso zzso In these cells was accompanied by zzso of a DNA damage response zzso and evidence of both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso DNA content, zzso zzso zzso of the drug after long-term zzso exposure led to a zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso in the third week of zzso without zzso These findings show that the lifespan of pancreatic cancer cells can be limited by continuous zzso zzso These results should facilitate the design of future clinical trials of zzso in patients with pancreatic zzso
