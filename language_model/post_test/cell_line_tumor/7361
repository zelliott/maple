Previous studies have demonstrated zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells zzso embryonic stem cells and zzso stem zzso and various cancer cell lines, but didn't express in differentiated adult zzso In this study, we examined the zzso expression in several cancer cell lines and some normal human zzso Moreover, we used zzso techniques to knock down the zzso gene expression in zzso zzso As a result, we found that all these detected cancer cell lines in our program had high levels of zzso zzso which indicated zzso played a really important role in the zzso of these cancer zzso At the same time, zzso expressed in human zzso tissue also at a high level, which may be due to the existence of a mass of zzso stem zzso Only a small quantity of zzso expression could be found in normal human muscle tissue due to the existence of zzso And for the first time our findings demonstrated that if zzso expression of zzso cells was knocked down, more zzso cells couldn't complete the DNA synthesis to pass through S zzso So the percent of zzso phase increased with the decrease of S phase and cell proliferation rate and in zzso zzso capacity decreased zzso Our work would help shed light on the zzso and zzso growth of cancer zzso
