Because zzso have been implicated as major players in the mechanism of action of zzso we have investigated the factors that zzso their tumor cell killing zzso Human zzso differentiated in zzso from peripheral blood zzso were used in binding and zzso zzso using zzso zzso leukemia or zzso target cells zzso with zzso zzso was zzso at zzso zzso zzso and was not significantly affected by zzso expression levels or by zzso zzso at position 158 zzso The role of zzso was demonstrated by complete zzso of zzso by excess human zzso Because zzso can be differentiated to zzso or zzso cells with either zzso or zzso respectively, and can be classically activated by zzso stimuli zzso or undergo alternative zzso with zzso such as zzso or zzso we have analyzed the effect of these different polarization programs on the zzso zzso by zzso zzso differentiated in presence of zzso showed a zzso to zzso greater zzso capacity compared with zzso zzso Furthermore, addition of zzso significantly increased, whereas zzso decreased zzso by both zzso and zzso zzso zzso had little zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in different zzso populations correlated with zzso zzso Interestingly, several B zzso cell lines were observed to zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso of human zzso with zzso zzso medium increased significantly their zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso by zzso cells can favor alternate zzso of zzso with a high zzso capacity toward zzso zzso
