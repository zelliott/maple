The zzso region of Thailand is well known to have high zzso of zzso duct cancer known as zzso So there is a continued need to improve diagnosis and treatment, and discovery of zzso for early detection of zzso duct cancer should greatly improve treatment outcome for these zzso The zzso a collection of proteins zzso from cells, is a useful source for identifying circulating zzso in blood zzso from cancer zzso Here a Hollow zzso zzso culture system was used for enrichment of zzso zzso since this culture system mimics the dense three-dimensional zzso of the tumor found in zzso zzso zzso difference gel zzso using a sensitive zzso zzso dye zzso followed by zzso was used to compare protein expression in the zzso of cells cultured in the Hollow zzso system and cells cultured in the zzso culture zzso For the first time, the zzso of zzso zzso from the two culture systems could be zzso The Hollow zzso system improved the quality and quantity of zzso zzso proteins compared to conventional zzso system, showing less interference by zzso proteins and yielding more zzso zzso Overall, 75 spots were analyzed by zzso and 106 zzso proteins were zzso Two novel zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso were found only in the Hollow zzso system and were absent from the traditional zzso culture zzso Among the highly expressed zzso 22 zzso soluble proteins were enriched by 5 fold in Hollow zzso system compared to zzso culture zzso The Hollow zzso system is therefore useful for preparing a wide range of proteins from zzso cell zzso
