In this study, we investigated how zzso mediates insulin synthesis through zzso zzso zzso via zzso expression in rat zzso zzso zzso Under zzso stress condition zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso was significantly increased when compared with only zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso two protein was significantly reduced under conditions of zzso stress when compared with zzso but no expression of zzso protein was zzso In zzso treatment, zzso zzso zzso increased zzso protein expression in a zzso zzso zzso zzso expression significantly decreased under zzso stress condition prior to zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced nuclear and cellular zzso expressions in a zzso manner when compared with only zzso or zzso These results indicate the zzso of the aforementioned expressions under regulation of the pathway, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso target of zzso and zzso zzso zzso was found to be independent of the zzso stress zzso In zzso treatment, zzso increased nuclear zzso zzso protein zzso expression and reduced cellular zzso expression and subsequently resulted in a decrease in cellular insulin level and rise in insulin zzso in a zzso zzso In zzso treatment, zzso and insulin proteins showed similar expression zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso especially zzso increased nuclear zzso expression and subsequently resulted in a decrease in zzso zzso it is hypothesized that zzso zzso of insulin may be regulated by zzso
