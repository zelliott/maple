There is solid evidence indicating that zzso zzso zzso the main component of zzso zzso zzso present in the brain of zzso disease patients, plays a key role in progression of this zzso However, it has been recently reported that zzso unmodified zzso protein may also induce a zzso effect on zzso zzso by zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso In the present work we show an essential component that links both effects, which is zzso alkaline zzso zzso This zzso is abundant in the central nervous system and is mainly required to keep control of zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso protein once it is released upon zzso zzso Only the zzso zzso protein behaves as an zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso provoking a robust and sustained zzso calcium increase finally triggering zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso receptors by zzso zzso increases the expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso An increase in zzso activity together with increases in protein and transcript levels were detected in zzso disease patients when they were compared with healthy zzso
