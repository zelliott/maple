A zzso and zzso zzso comprise a zzso family of zzso zzso zzso 9 and zzso 15 are involved in cell migration and zzso zzso of zzso 9 and zzso 15 was reported to be altered in several types of zzso 

zzso real-time reverse zzso chain reaction was performed to measure the expression of zzso 9 zzso in bulk pancreatic zzso zzso showed no significant difference in the expression of zzso 9 zzso between pancreatic cancer and zzso zzso zzso cultured pancreatic zzso also expressed zzso 9 zzso zzso a laser zzso and pressure zzso technique was employed to isolate cancer cells from tumor zzso The expression of zzso 9 and zzso 15 zzso was measured in zzso samples zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso normal zzso cells, zzso zzso 13 for zzso 9; cancer cells, zzso zzso 9; normal zzso cells, zzso zzso 9 for zzso zzso 

zzso cancer cells expressed significantly higher levels of zzso 9 and zzso 15 zzso than did normal pancreatic zzso cells zzso zzso zzso for zzso 9; p zzso zzso for zzso zzso 

zzso 9 and zzso 15 are involved in pancreatic zzso zzso analysis appears to be indispensable for the accurate analysis of the expression of certain zzso family members in pancreatic zzso
