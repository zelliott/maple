zzso cell zzso zzso accounts for zzso of all zzso zzso and has the worst prognosis among all zzso The hallmark of zzso is a zzso zzso that results in zzso of zzso D1 by tumor cells of virtually all zzso In this study, we examined whether zzso D1 could be an effective zzso zzso for zzso We identified zzso D1 peptides for zzso and generated zzso zzso zzso lines from zzso blood donors and zzso zzso These cell lines proliferated in response to zzso D1 zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the T cells efficiently zzso zzso but not zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso human zzso lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and more importantly, zzso primary zzso cells from zzso zzso No killing was observed with zzso primary zzso cells or zzso normal blood cells, including B zzso These results indicate that these T cells are potent zzso T cells and recognize zzso D1 peptides naturally presented by patient zzso cells in the context of zzso zzso Taken together, our work identifies zzso D1 as a potentially important zzso for zzso of zzso
