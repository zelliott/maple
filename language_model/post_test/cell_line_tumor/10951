To study the effects of zzso expression zzso zzso targeting zzso in zzso on cultured zzso cells, the observation of the expression of zzso the screening of the best interference zzso and the exploration of the application of zzso interference on tumor gene therapy in the zzso 

On the basis of the principle of target sequence of zzso four interference sequences of zzso were zzso and the downstream zzso zzso of the zzso were zzso The zzso zzso kit used zzso zzso zzso III promoter and modified zzso for high level, precise zzso expression inside target zzso The zzso cells was zzso in growth period of index with the zzso products of the four sites zzso and began to observe and measure the results of zzso interference in 48 zzso 

The zzso zzso cells created, turned into the round shape and began to shed off, whereas zzso of the cells of other groups had not obviously zzso Performing the zzso gels zzso with zzso products, compared with the contrast groups, some cells zzso zzso of zzso were suppressed obviously, the ratio of zzso was zzso 05 while the expression of zzso of the cell of other groups had not obviously zzso Western zzso revealed that zzso expression was decreased obviously post zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso rate of zzso zzso cells is zzso and zzso rate of the rest three site zzso cells scarcely zzso Similar results were obtained in three independent zzso 

The study suggested that zzso expression zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso can effectively inhibit the growth zzso zzso cell zzso cell lines zzso
