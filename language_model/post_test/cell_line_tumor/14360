The zzso zzso of zzso toxin zzso interacts with the zzso zzso which is zzso expressed on zzso cells zzso and B zzso After administration of zzso chemically coupled to zzso zzso in mice, we showed that the zzso zzso zzso restricted by zzso molecules is specifically presented by zzso zzso DC, some of them displaying a mature zzso Using mice carrying a zzso zzso a diphtheria toxin zzso zzso under the control of the zzso zzso promoter, which allows zzso zzso of DC, we showed that DC are required for efficient zzso of zzso after zzso zzso zzso of mice with zzso induced zzso zzso T cells detected ex zzso these cells were long zzso since they could be detected even 91 days after the last zzso and were composed of both central and memory T zzso zzso of mice with zzso and zzso coupled to zzso a protein derived from zzso inhibited tumor growth in zzso and therapeutic zzso This effect was mainly zzso by zzso T zzso zzso therefore appears to be a powerful carrier directly targeting DC in zzso resulting in a strong and durable zzso response associated with tumor zzso
