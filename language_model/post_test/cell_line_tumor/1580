To illuminate the role of the spatial organization of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso in signal zzso quantitative information about the zzso topography on the cell surface, zzso on living cells and in real time, are zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso enables to zzso size, and track individual membrane zzso enriched in zzso with high zzso zzso We used a zzso enhanced labeling strategy to label zzso receptors on zzso zzso cells zzso with 60 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso under zzso conditions at zzso The statistical analysis of the spatial zzso distribution on the cell surface in the scanning electron microscope zzso confirmed a zzso of the zzso labels consistent with a zzso distribution of zzso in the plasma zzso zzso shifts in the scattering response of clustered zzso facilitated the detection and zzso of individual zzso clusters on living cells in solution in an optical zzso We tracked the lateral diffusion of individual clusters at a frame rate of 200 zzso while simultaneously monitoring the zzso dynamics of the zzso zzso information about the zzso clusters in their membrane zzso were obtained through analysis of the electromagnetic zzso of the zzso zzso labels through polarization resolved zzso Our studies show that the zzso zzso is enriched in membrane zzso with typical diameters in the range between zzso zzso These membrane zzso exhibit a slow lateral diffusion with a diffusion zzso of zzso zzso which is almost an order of magnitude slower than the mean diffusion zzso of individual zzso zzso zzso receptors under identical zzso
