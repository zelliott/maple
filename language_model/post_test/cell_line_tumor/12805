Twenty five compounds including ten zzso zzso zzso six zzso zzso 24, zzso five zzso zzso 18, zzso two zzso zzso zzso zzso one zzso zzso and one fatty acid zzso were isolated from the roots of zzso zzso zzso zzso The structures of those compounds were identified by comparing their zzso and spectral data with those of published in zzso All the compounds were evaluated for DNA zzso zzso activities and zzso Among the zzso compounds, 4 and 19 showed more potent zzso zzso zzso 39 and 19 zzso zzso than zzso as the positive control zzso 46 zzso against zzso zzso zzso 4, 10, 12, 19, 24 and 25 showed strong zzso activities toward DNA zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 17 zzso respectively), which were more potent than that of zzso as positive control zzso 20 zzso In zzso cell line, 5 and 6 showed zzso zzso 4 zzso and 3 zzso respectively, with zzso of zzso as positive zzso zzso zzso In the zzso cell line, 3, 5 and 7 showed zzso zzso 4, 3 and 4 zzso respectively, with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 6, 12 and 23 showed zzso in the zzso cell line zzso 19, 19 and 15 zzso respectively, with zzso of zzso 2 zzso
