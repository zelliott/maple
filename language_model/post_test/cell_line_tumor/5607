To study the effect of short zzso zzso zzso on expression of vascular zzso growth factor C zzso and proliferation and invasion behavior of human breast cancer cell zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso was zzso into the human breast cancer cell zzso by zzso and the positive zzso cell clones were screened with zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells after gene transfer was detected by real-time quantitative zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso zzso and invasion ability of zzso cells were analyzed by zzso and zzso zzso 

The expressions of zzso zzso and protein were decreased markedly compared with the control group after the zzso and the zzso ratio was zzso and zzso respectively ( zzso The proliferation of zzso cells zzso by zzso measured with zzso zzso was significantly zzso ( zzso The invasion ability of passing through the zzso filter of zzso cells zzso by zzso were declined evidently ( zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso have been proved not only to be effective and specific for zzso of zzso but also can inhibit the proliferation and invasion of zzso cells zzso
