zzso or acquired resistance of pancreatic cancer to zzso zzso is an important factor in the failure of zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso pancreatic cancer cells and zzso zzso cells identified zzso zzso as a zzso protein which is involved in zzso zzso However, a zzso experiment showed that zzso was not the only protein implicated with zzso Finding further candidate proteins is necessary for achieving effective zzso therapy for patients with pancreatic zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso reported to be zzso in tumor cells, such as lung zzso cell cancer, gastrointestinal zzso zzso urinary zzso cancer and zzso zzso zzso In urinary zzso cancer cells, zzso of this protein is intimately bound with zzso and poor zzso In the present study, the expression of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells was zzso It was found that zzso was significantly zzso in zzso zzso cells compared to sensitive zzso zzso The ratio of expression of zzso to that of zzso was significantly zzso in zzso cells compared to zzso cells zzso by zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is a possible candidate zzso for predicting the response of patients with pancreatic cancer to treatment with zzso
