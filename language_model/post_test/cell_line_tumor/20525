zzso consist of zzso zzso a zzso version of the cellular protein zzso zzso They occur in a variety of strains that share the zzso acid sequence of zzso but differ in zzso properties, such as cell zzso and zzso zzso is attributed to the zzso of zzso zzso To gain insight as to how zzso of cells to a given prion strain comes about, we compared amplification of zzso zzso by zzso using cell zzso from zzso zzso and zzso cell lines as zzso We found that both zzso supported amplification of zzso zzso zzso equally well, despite a zzso difference in the zzso of the cells from which they were zzso Thus, zzso is an attribute of the intact zzso
