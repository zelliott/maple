zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso play a key role in zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso and a loss of zzso function appears to inhibit inflammation and zzso zzso A is a potent and selective zzso inhibitor with zzso zzso We found that zzso A caused a rapid and potent zzso of zzso activity induced by tumor necrosis factor alpha in a number of cell zzso Most unexpectedly, other classes of zzso zzso had no zzso zzso To identify the molecular mechanisms of zzso A action, cultured human zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso with various zzso and zzso zzso and a striking difference in zzso A sensitivity was zzso Furthermore, cells expressing zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso loop at zzso exhibited zzso zzso zzso of zzso in response to zzso A, whereas substitution of zzso and zzso zzso protection against zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity and formation of stable zzso zzso were observed in the presence of zzso A that could be blocked by zzso zzso interaction with the zzso protein zzso was disrupted in zzso zzso zzso Most importantly, administration of zzso A to mice zzso with zzso zzso tumors caused potent zzso zzso Thus, zzso A with its zzso zzso plays an important regulatory function in zzso signaling through pathways distinct from its role as a protein zzso zzso
