zzso is a zzso and zzso zzso zzso high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein involved in zzso zzso and zzso signaling in Alzheimer's zzso We now report that zzso is a negative regulator of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of neural zzso cells with human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that was effectively inhibited by zzso of zzso zzso studies indicated that the zzso half of zzso was physically involved in interacting with zzso and the absence of zzso complex formation precluded the loss of zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso indicating that zzso complex formation is zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso by reducing zzso expression in the plasma membrane without significantly altering the affinity of zzso for zzso or zzso These results suggest that zzso is directly involved in regulating zzso zzso by interacting with zzso and by reducing its incorporation on the cell zzso
