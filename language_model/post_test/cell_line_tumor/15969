A zzso zzso zzso promotes survival and drug resistance in multiple myeloma zzso cell zzso We studied the effect of zzso on zzso behavior in primary zzso cells and correlated our findings with zzso zzso expression by zzso and/or Western zzso In zzso cases, expressing zzso zzso zzso significantly increased the percentage of zzso cells in S + zzso phase (from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 15, P zzso zzso whereas a lesser effect was seen in cases expressing zzso D1 zzso zzso zzso zzso response to zzso was most marked for zzso zzso cases with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and was accompanied by increased expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins in zzso zzso cells were not modulated by zzso Surface expression of zzso maturation zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was not significantly different between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We observed zzso of nuclear zzso and zzso pathways in response to zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso stimulates zzso progression in zzso zzso zzso cells bearing zzso zzso but has minimal effect on zzso zzso cells, suggesting zzso cells from different zzso zzso classes rely on different mechanisms for zzso zzso
