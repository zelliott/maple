zzso zzso zzso zzso mountain zzso an endemic plant of the Balkan Peninsula, has been used in traditional medicine in the treatment of gastrointestinal complaints, zzso and rheumatic zzso This study aimed to evaluate its zzso and zzso zzso Besides, continuously increasing interest in assessing the role of the plant active constituents preventing the risk of cancer was a reason to make a detailed examination of the investigated ethanol, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso extracts regarding zzso zzso administration of the investigated extracts caused a zzso zzso effect in a model of zzso rat paw zzso zzso activity of the extracts was investigated using an zzso acute stress zzso in zzso The zzso activity of plant extracts was assessed on zzso zzso and zzso cells and compared to the zzso of zzso compounds identified in zzso zzso and zzso cell death were analyzed by double zzso with zzso zzso zzso V and zzso The developed zzso method enabled qualitative fingerprint analysis of zzso compounds in the investigated zzso Compared to the effect of the positive control, the zzso drug zzso (4 zzso which produced a 50 % decrease in zzso zzso zzso and zzso extracts exhibited about the same effect in doses of 200 and 100 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso All investigated extracts produced zzso zzso activity with the efficacy comparable to that of the reference drug zzso The zzso zzso extract showed significant zzso zzso on zzso cells and zzso cells, decreasing cell growth to zzso % and zzso % of control, respectively, when used at 100 zzso It seems that zzso compounds zzso zzso and their corresponding zzso are responsible for the zzso zzso extract zzso zzso It also appears that induction of zzso stress might be involved in its zzso since zzso and zzso cells increased their zzso production in response to treatment with zzso zzso zzso Neither of the tested extracts nor any zzso compounds showed significant zzso effect to human zzso These results demonstrated the potent zzso and zzso activities, as well as the promising zzso
