zzso zzso zzso was used to develop quantitative zzso relationship zzso models to screen databases for new zzso zzso One of the selected compounds was zzso an zzso zzso with a promising profile predicted to slow tumor growth through zzso signaling and protein zzso C zzso We found that zzso inhibited the growth of a wide variety of cancer cell types as verified by the zzso cancer cell line zzso zzso cell viability zzso showed that zzso inhibited 50% of the growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cancer cell lines at much lower zzso than that required for zzso and human zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso lung zzso cells as measured by zzso DNA zzso However, protein zzso C was not targeted by zzso as predicted by in zzso zzso zzso slowed in zzso tumor growth and zzso spread of zzso cells injected zzso into zzso mice, without zzso any severe adverse events as monitored by animal survival, blood serum analysis, and zzso analysis of zzso zzso administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso which were generated with zzso technology, inhibited in zzso growth of zzso lung zzso cells almost as effectively as zzso injections of zzso Taken together, our study of a novel zzso drug identified using a molecular zzso approach to drug discovery demonstrates that zzso has zzso activity in zzso and in zzso although additional studies are needed to zzso its mechanism of zzso
