zzso is considered the standard zzso therapy for patients with advanced pancreatic zzso More recent strategies have focused on improving the efficacy of zzso by either improving the method of delivery or by combining zzso with other zzso chemotherapy agents or with zzso zzso However, the clinical benefits, response rates, and duration of responses have been zzso zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso involved in the metabolism of zzso The expression of zzso has been zzso to be zzso of zzso zzso We determined the relationship of zzso zzso protein expression and/or genetic status of zzso in a panel of human pancreatic cancer zzso and pancreatic cancer cell lines and determined the relationship of these variables to the clinical outcome of patients treated with zzso We report that zzso protein expression is expressed in the majority of pancreatic zzso analyzed (40 of 44 cases, zzso and showed a range of labeling zzso ranging from zzso zzso weaker in intensity than normal zzso present in same zzso to zzso zzso greater in intensity than normal zzso present in same zzso When labeling intensity was compared with survival, low zzso expression zzso zzso was correlated with both overall survival zzso zzso zzso and zzso survival following zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso Low zzso labeling intensity was also significantly correlated with patient age zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso years; P zzso zzso suggesting that age-related zzso of the zzso gene may account in part for the observed zzso zzso of the entire zzso coding sequence in 17 cell lines and 9 patients' cancer zzso with disease progression while on zzso did not identify any zzso suggesting that genetic zzso of zzso are not a common mechanism of resistance to zzso for this tumor zzso Moreover, zzso labeling showed similar patterns and zzso of labeling among matched zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso levels of zzso protein are most correlated with overall survival following zzso treatment and are stable even after resistance to zzso is clinically zzso
