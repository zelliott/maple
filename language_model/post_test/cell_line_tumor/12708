zzso zzso in the genes members of zzso pathway, especially in zzso zzso for zzso have been found to play an important role in zzso The purpose of this work is to characterize zzso of the zzso zzso pathway, and to study the expression pattern of a panel of zzso and proteins potentially involved in the zzso of liver zzso In this respect, the molecular characterization of the most used liver cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso could represent a useful tool to identify novel molecular markers for zzso zzso A significant zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso transcripts was observed in all the four liver cancer cell zzso The analysis of selected zzso showed that zzso zzso and zzso could be suitable candidates to discriminate zzso versus normal human primary zzso Finally, zzso protein expression resulted to be increased more than zzso in liver cancer cell lines in comparison to normal human primary zzso These advances in the knowledge of molecular mechanisms involved in the zzso of liver cancer may provide new potential zzso and molecular targets for the diagnosis and zzso
