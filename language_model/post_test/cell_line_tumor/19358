The occurrence of zzso zzso and its only recognized precursor zzso Barrett's zzso has rapidly increased during the past three zzso The precise reason for the rise remains to be zzso but increasing rates have been linked to multiple nutritional zzso zzso diets have generally been associated with a reduction of risk for zzso zzso and those of animal origin with risk zzso Moreover, a number of recent in zzso and limited in zzso investigations have reported that zzso extracts affect multiple zzso processes in breast, zzso zzso and other cancer cell lines of zzso zzso Thus, this study sought to investigate the zzso potential of a zzso zzso rich extract zzso in zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited the viability and proliferation of zzso cells in a zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso cell proliferation of zzso zzso zzso treatment induced cell cycle arrest at the zzso checkpoint and significantly reduced the percentage of zzso cells in zzso following 24 and 48 h of zzso zzso treatment also resulted in significant induction of zzso Thus, zzso zzso cell cycle regulation, zzso zzso and zzso all key biological processes altered during progression to zzso zzso These findings support that further zzso studies are warranted to more fully zzso the zzso potential of zzso against zzso zzso
