zzso resistance is a major problem in the treatment of zzso zzso zzso zzso We have previously reported that zzso zzso protein 1 zzso zzso zzso activity by competing with zzso for binding to zzso zzso a zzso of positive zzso zzso b zzso This results in the zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso II zzso at zzso 2 and the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso target zzso As zzso can inhibit zzso activity, we examined whether it has a critical role in the zzso effects of tamoxifen on zzso We observed that zzso zzso recruitment to the promoter region of zzso target genes and decreased the recruitment of zzso zzso and zzso 2 zzso zzso to the coding regions of these zzso zzso in cells wherein zzso expression has been zzso we observed zzso of the zzso effects of tamoxifen on zzso zzso zzso recruitment to coding regions of zzso target zzso As a consequence, zzso of zzso resulted in the zzso of the repressive effects of tamoxifen on zzso gene expression and zzso zzso clinical relevance to our studies is our analysis of human breast cancer tissue samples that indicated association of lower expression of zzso with tumor recurrence in patients who received zzso Our studies provide a better understanding of the zzso basis for the zzso effect of tamoxifen on zzso activity and may suggest new therapeutic targets for the treatment of zzso breast zzso
