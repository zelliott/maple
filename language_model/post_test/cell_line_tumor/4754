Although the vital role of the zzso zzso zzso has been well demonstrated in primary prostate zzso its role in the zzso prostate zzso still remains zzso Here, we used a small hairpin zzso approach to directly assess zzso activity in prostate cancer zzso Reduction of zzso expression in the two zzso prostate cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso and cell zzso zzso in two zzso prostate cell lines, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso expression showed a more pronounced effect on zzso zzso and cell growth than zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we also compared the zzso profiles induced by either zzso depletion or zzso zzso Although a significant number of transcripts appear to be regulated by both zzso depletion and zzso zzso we observed a subset of transcripts affected only by zzso depletion but not by zzso zzso and vice zzso Finally, we demonstrated a direct role for zzso in promoting tumor formation and growth in a zzso zzso Taken together, our results zzso an important role for the zzso in zzso prostate cancer cells, and suggest that zzso can be used as a therapeutic target for zzso prostate zzso
