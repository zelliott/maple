To investigate the effects of zzso zzso extract zzso on zzso of proliferation and on zzso and the underlying mechanisms, in a human zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso 

zzso rat zzso and human zzso zzso cells were examined by zzso blue exclusion and zzso zzso respectively, as normal zzso The proliferation of zzso cells was determined by zzso zzso The cellular zzso of zzso cells was observed by phase contrast zzso zzso zzso was performed to analyze cell zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso membrane potential with zzso 123 and cell cycle with zzso in zzso zzso zzso proteins such as zzso C, zzso zzso and cell cycle zzso including zzso and zzso were measured by Western zzso 

zzso inhibited proliferation of zzso cells in a zzso and zzso manner without zzso in rat zzso and human zzso zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso cells in a zzso manner, as determined by flow zzso The zzso was accompanied by a decrease in zzso membrane potential, release of zzso C and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso arrested the cell cycle in the S phase by increasing zzso and decreasing zzso protein zzso 

zzso exerted a significant zzso effect through a zzso zzso and arrested the cell cycle by regulation of cell zzso proteins in zzso cells without an effect on normal zzso The zzso selectivity shown in this study suggests that the plant extract could be a promising novel treatment for human zzso
