We have previously shown the use of the zzso growth factor type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso as an attractive strategy to combat multiple myeloma zzso in zzso and in zzso After a zzso drug zzso the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso was shown to act in zzso with zzso reducing survival of zzso zzso In this study, we tried to zzso the molecular mechanisms underlying this zzso zzso 

The in zzso zzso effects of zzso and zzso alone and in combination were evaluated by studying zzso cell cycle distribution, and downstream zzso using both human zzso cell lines and cells from the zzso zzso zzso In zzso the effect on survival of zzso mice was zzso 

In the human zzso cell line zzso treatment with zzso and zzso in combination resulted in a zzso increase of zzso and an additive effect on the zzso of the active forms of zzso was observed as compared with the single drug zzso Cell cycle analysis revealed an zzso of cells in the zzso phase and subsequent zzso of cell cycle regulating zzso These data were also confirmed in the zzso cells in zzso Also, the zzso was analyzed by zzso zzso showing gene expression zzso mainly in categories of genes regulating zzso and cell zzso Combined treatment in zzso resulted in a significantly prolonged survival of zzso zzso 

The results indicate an improved zzso treatment opportunity in using a combination of zzso and zzso
