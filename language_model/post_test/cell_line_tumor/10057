It has been reported that the induction of cellular zzso through zzso zzso is an effective strategy in tumor zzso Unfortunately, however, tumors including adult zzso zzso zzso have disadvantages such as zzso zzso and a lack of zzso and/or zzso In this study we characterized zzso cell death in 16 zzso cell zzso Eight cell lines, including six zzso cell lines, had zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the cell lines underwent zzso or zzso arrest, whereas eight cell lines with zzso zzso were zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso revealed that only zzso cell lines with zzso zzso showed cellular zzso although they lack both zzso and zzso These results indicate that cellular zzso is an important event in zzso cell death in ATL cells and is zzso without zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso regulator zzso a novel target gene of zzso by small interfering zzso indicated its important role in the induction of cellular zzso As many patients with ATL carry zzso zzso our study suggests that zzso zzso by zzso is a promising strategy in zzso We also found zzso with a combination of zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting the application of zzso therapy to be broader than zzso
