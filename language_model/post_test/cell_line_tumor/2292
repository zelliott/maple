zzso protein zzso is one of the most prevalent zzso modifications and is involved in essential cellular functions such as zzso interactions and cellular recognition as well as in chronic zzso In this study, we explored stable isotope labeled zzso tandem mass tags zzso as a novel approach for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso bearing zzso and zzso groups were compared for zzso reducing end zzso efficiency and zzso zzso zzso zzso outperform the zzso zzso in terms of labeling efficiency zzso vs zzso at zzso zzso and mass zzso based zzso using zzso labeled zzso enabled accurate zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso over a broad dynamic range (up to zzso In contrast, zzso zzso labeling with zzso of reporter zzso in tandem mass zzso suffered from severe ratio zzso already at low sample zzso To demonstrate the practical utility of the developed approach, we characterized the global zzso zzso profiles of the zzso human colon zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The data revealed significant zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso cell zzso
