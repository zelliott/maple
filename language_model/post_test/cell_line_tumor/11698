zzso radiation zzso is currently the most efficient therapy available for zzso zzso Unfortunately, this strategy is zzso due to the characteristics of zzso of zzso zzso The aim of our study was to compare zzso stem cells zzso with zzso cells zzso to determine whether zzso are responsible for the zzso zzso and to zzso whether cell cycle checkpoint proteins are responsible for the zzso of zzso In this study, zzso (a marker of brain cancer stem zzso and zzso were zzso in zzso isolated from zzso The percent of zzso cells in zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso more zzso survived following 2, 4, 6 and 8 zzso zzso than zzso zzso kills cancer cells primarily through DNA zzso breaks zzso The neutral comet zzso is often used to intuitively show the level of zzso zzso fewer zzso showed DNA damage than zzso following 2 zzso zzso This demonstrated that zzso are more resistant to in zzso radiation than zzso Furthermore, activated zzso zzso zzso zzso is essential for the zzso of downstream zzso zzso such as checkpoint zzso 2 zzso and zzso which mainly contribute to the proper regulation of zzso arrest in the zzso zzso DNA damage induced by zzso zzso initiated zzso of zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso checkpoint zzso zzso of the zzso of these checkpoint proteins was significantly higher in the zzso compared to zzso We found that zzso of zzso zzso induced cell cycle checkpoint defects and increased the rate of zzso of zzso following zzso Our results suggest that zzso were more resistant to radiation compared to zzso due to high expression of zzso cell cycle checkpoint zzso and zzso of zzso could significantly reduce the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso may represent a source of zzso in zzso and a target of improved zzso of zzso
