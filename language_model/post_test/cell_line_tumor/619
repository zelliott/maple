A series of new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso in which the zzso zzso was replaced by zzso zzso including zzso or linear zzso or zzso zzso zzso derivatives zzso were converted to the corresponding alcohols by treatment with sodium hydroxide and subsequently zzso using zzso zzso followed by zzso to yield the zzso or by zzso with zzso to form the zzso zzso of 2 with zzso zzso followed by zzso with zzso zzso led to the zzso zzso These products could be further zzso by converting them into their zzso and subsequent treatment with zzso yielding the corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso with an oxygen atom in the zzso which are more similar to the natural zzso were zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso respectively, and subsequently zzso by standard zzso The zzso zzso were investigated in a functional zzso at zzso cells, a zzso hybrid cell line which expresses the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso were generally weaker zzso than zzso zzso contrast to zzso were zzso The most potent compound was zzso zzso zzso zzso with an zzso value of zzso showing that the replacement of the zzso by zzso which leads to enhanced stability, was well zzso
