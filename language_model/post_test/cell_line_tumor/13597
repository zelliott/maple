To explore the influence of three central zzso zzso biomedical materials zzso zzso and zzso zzso on the zzso zzso and cell cycle of zzso Lung zzso zzso cells so as to provide the basis for clinical choice of central zzso zzso 

zzso cells were cultured and zzso and the cells at passage 3 were cultured with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and only cells served as a zzso At 24, 48, and 72 hours after zzso zzso zzso was used to detect the cellular proliferation and flow zzso to detect the cell cycle and zzso At 72 hours after zzso zzso microscope was used to observe the cell zzso 

zzso microscope showed the cells grew well in control group, zzso group, and silicone zzso In zzso zzso group, the cells zzso zzso and zzso residual adherent cells had zzso zzso and decreased zzso At 24 and 48 hours, no significant difference in zzso zzso and cell cycle was found among 4 groups zzso zzso zzso At 72 hours, the zzso of zzso cells in three material groups were significantly inhibited when compared with control group zzso zzso zzso and the cells in zzso zzso group had more significant proliferation zzso than zzso group and silicone group zzso zzso zzso but there was no zzso difference in proliferation zzso between zzso group and silicone group zzso zzso zzso Compared with the control group, three material groups had significant impact on the rate of zzso and cell zzso zzso zzso group was the most zzso followed by silicone group, zzso group was minimum zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso can significantly impact the zzso zzso and cell cycle of zzso zzso zzso has better zzso than zzso zzso and zzso
