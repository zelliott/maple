In regard to gene zzso for cancer gene therapy, their zzso into the tumor tissue should be essential for successful zzso Here, we studied the tumor zzso of zzso zzso zzso after incubation with the zzso tumor zzso zzso models and zzso zzso injection into subcutaneous zzso As a result, zzso zzso zzso zzso type zzso zzso zzso showed facilitated zzso and improved zzso inside the tumor zzso whereas conventional zzso from zzso zzso exhibited limited zzso and localized zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso allowed the zzso to the hypoxic region of the tumor tissue in both in zzso and in zzso zzso To the best of our knowledge, our results demonstrated for the first time that zzso zzso might show improved tumor zzso over zzso zzso thereby achieving zzso into the inside of the tumor zzso
