zzso viruses have been tested against many zzso of zzso and zzso zzso however, zzso arising from zzso have received relatively little zzso Using 13 human zzso representing seven tumor types, we assessed the efficiency of infection, zzso and replication of green fluorescent protein zzso zzso zzso virus zzso and its zzso enhanced zzso zzso Both viruses efficiently infected and killed 12 of 13 zzso zzso showed a faster rate of infection and zzso In zzso and in zzso zzso was selective for zzso compared with normal zzso A single intravenous injection of zzso selectively infected all subcutaneous human zzso tested in mice and arrested the growth of tumors that otherwise grew zzso In contrast to other zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated remarkable resistance, even to high zzso of virus zzso of infection zzso of zzso We found no dysfunction in zzso binding or zzso zzso also resisted infection by human zzso and zzso virus, suggesting a virus resistance mechanism based on an altered zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso analysis revealed a heightened zzso expression of zzso genes zzso zzso but not zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso virus zzso protein rendered zzso highly zzso and this correlated with zzso of zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso also enhanced zzso in moderately zzso zzso and zzso zzso Overall, we find that the potential efficacy of zzso as an zzso agent extends to zzso zzso tumors and that unusually strong resistance to zzso zzso can be overcome with zzso zzso
