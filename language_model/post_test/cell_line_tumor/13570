This study aims to discuss the correlation between zzso and the expression of zzso zzso in the cancer cells of the patients with zzso cell lung cancer zzso and the zzso mechanism of zzso on the invasion of lung cancer zzso The expression level of zzso was detected by zzso real-time zzso zzso the expression of zzso was detected by zzso and the expression level of zzso in the cancer tissue of each case was detected by western zzso and in its adjacent tissue of 53 patients with zzso The influence of zzso on the invasion potential of the lung cancer cell line zzso was studied with zzso system including cloned zzso fragments zzso The expression of zzso and zzso in zzso tissue was not obviously related to patient's zzso age, differentiation extent of cancer zzso cancer types, zzso but also staging and zzso zzso zzso and the difference was zzso Further studies showed that the relationship between the expression level of zzso and the expression of zzso was zzso The relative expression level of zzso was zzso zzso zzso in zzso positive sample and zzso zzso zzso in zzso negative sample, and the difference of which was notably significant zzso zzso zzso Western zzso showed that the expression level of zzso was highly zzso related to the expression level of zzso The invasion potential of zzso was notably lowered when zzso by zzso The zzso regulates the expression level of zzso to influence the morbidity and zzso of zzso The zzso is likely to become the key to the treatment of lung cancer zzso
