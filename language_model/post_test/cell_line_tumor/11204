zzso biological properties of zzso cancer cells can be modeled and studied using in zzso zzso Any experimental setting can closely reflect some aspects of the native zzso however, parameters that differ from in zzso aspects must be zzso zzso with existing and zzso as well as new, cell culture techniques provides a basis for correct experimental design and production of reliable scientific zzso This chapter presents a short comparative review of the techniques used for cell culture establishment and maintenance of zzso cancer cells, as well as laboratory methods used to characterize zzso features of these cells, including the zzso transition, cell zzso and zzso resistance to zzso zzso and stem cell zzso
