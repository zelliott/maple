We report a technique for isolation and zzso of intermediate filament zzso proteins from zzso zzso compatible with both gel zzso and liquid zzso zzso zzso using mass zzso zzso This is important because changes in the IF zzso particularly in zzso expression and zzso are noted in zzso zzso of patients with zzso zzso Though zzso have traditionally been dissolved in high concentration of zzso the latter zzso zzso efficient zzso zzso by zzso prior to zzso zzso zzso The extraction of zzso proteins was initially evaluated using zzso cancer cell lines using a published, differential zzso zzso zzso IF proteins were extracted from zzso zzso using a combination of homogenization and zzso Since comparable efficiency of zzso was noted on the extracted IF from cell lines between zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso isolated proteins from zzso zzso were zzso in zzso Using zzso techniques, we successfully demonstrated isolation of zzso and preservation of zzso modifications zzso zzso zzso proteins were zzso zzso and peptides analyzed by zzso showing the functionality of the zzso in shotgun zzso applications, specifically zzso of the zzso for zzso tagging relative and absolute zzso based zzso zzso
