zzso were recently demonstrated to be zzso in zzso cell lung zzso zzso via zzso activity and zzso inhibitor zzso did suppressed zzso zzso zzso positive zzso zzso However, other zzso involved in zzso production and metabolism of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and others have not been zzso zzso in this study, we examined the zzso biological significance of zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso materials obtained from 103 zzso patients were zzso evaluated using zzso and zzso zzso The findings of zzso were then correlated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso factors and overall survival of the zzso We further employed zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso to study the functional significance of zzso in zzso 

A higher zzso zzso tended to be positively associated with zzso zzso and tumor stage zzso whereas a higher zzso zzso was positively associated with a zzso cell and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso tumor stage zzso T factor of zzso zzso zzso maximum tumor diameter zzso and tended to be associated with N factor of zzso zzso zzso A higher zzso zzso was also significantly associated with lower zzso E1 concentration zzso and a higher zzso zzso concentration ratio zzso On the other hand a higher zzso zzso was significantly associated with higher zzso E1 concentration zzso zzso of zzso zzso analysis demonstrated an increased zzso zzso in tumor cells as an independent negative zzso factor zzso zzso zzso E1 treatment in zzso positive zzso cells, zzso and zzso resulted in zzso production ( zzso and enhanced cell zzso which was zzso effectively by zzso zzso zzso ( zzso In addition, zzso inhibitor treatment resulted in zzso up regulation in both zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso of our present study suggest that zzso may be considered an important zzso factor in zzso patients and targeting zzso activity may further improve the clinical response in zzso responsive zzso zzso
