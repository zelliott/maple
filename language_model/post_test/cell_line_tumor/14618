zzso zzso zzso is associated with a high potential for zzso and disease zzso even after surgical zzso The cancer stem cell zzso hypothesis proposes that zzso are responsible for zzso zzso and zzso zzso is a zzso indicator of zzso and poor survival in many different cancer zzso In this study, we investigated the possible link between zzso and zzso in zzso 

We analyzed the functional implications of zzso on cancer zzso by modification of the zzso gene in zzso cell zzso 

The zzso of zzso zzso into the liver cancer cell line zzso enhanced the properties of zzso including zzso their zzso ability, side population zzso and tumor initiation ability in zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso in the liver cancer cell line zzso suppressed its stem zzso zzso 

These results show that zzso give rise to properties of zzso in zzso zzso these findings suggest that zzso may be a potential molecular zzso marker of zzso and may aid in the development of more effective zzso
