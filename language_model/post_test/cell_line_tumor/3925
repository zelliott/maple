We previously conducted gene expression zzso analyses to identify novel indicators for zzso cancer zzso zzso and prognosis from which we identified zzso as a candidate zzso zzso which encodes a long zzso zzso mapped to zzso zzso whose zzso amplification is one of the most frequent events in a wide variety of zzso zzso However, zzso molecular mechanism of action remains zzso 

We conducted cell proliferation and invasion zzso using zzso cancer cell lines zzso with zzso or negative control zzso Gene expression zzso analyses on these cell lines were also carried out to investigate the molecular function of zzso Further, we investigated the impact of zzso expression on the prognosis of zzso zzso cancer patients by zzso 

zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso exhibited significant loss of their proliferation and invasion zzso In these cells, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso signals were significantly zzso In addition, zzso and zzso analysis revealed that zzso expression level was an independent risk factor for overall survival of zzso cancer zzso 

zzso which maps to zzso generates zzso activity in zzso and abnormal expression of zzso was a zzso indicator for zzso zzso
