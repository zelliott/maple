The stability and zzso zzso of zzso a protein that plays a major role in cell zzso and zzso is tightly regulated by multiple signaling zzso While zzso zzso of zzso signaling has been implicated in zzso the zzso identity of zzso active zzso zzso commonly known as zzso zzso 37 zzso and zzso 41 zzso zzso remains zzso Our current study demonstrates that ABC zzso activity is influenced by zzso of zzso by zzso zzso D1 zzso Whereas the nuclear zzso from zzso prostate cancer cell line zzso is zzso zzso with high zzso activity, the nuclear zzso from zzso zzso cells is highly zzso at zzso zzso and zzso with low zzso activity, zzso that zzso of nuclear zzso alone cannot be simply used as a zzso for zzso zzso In human normal prostate zzso the zzso zzso zzso is mainly localized to the zzso network zzso zzso zzso and this pattern is significantly altered in prostate cancer zzso zzso which is consistent with known down regulation of zzso in prostate zzso These in zzso and in zzso data unveil a previously zzso zzso modification of ABC through zzso zzso by zzso which alters zzso zzso and zzso activity of zzso Our results support the view that zzso signaling activity is regulated by spatial zzso and zzso modifications and protein level of zzso alone is insufficient to count signaling zzso
