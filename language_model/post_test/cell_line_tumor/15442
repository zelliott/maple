zzso plasma zzso is an emerging zzso diagnosis zzso However, whether zzso long zzso zzso zzso in plasma can be used as a novel approach to detect human prostate cancer zzso has not yet been zzso The study was divided into three zzso zzso the characteristics of zzso zzso fragments were systematically studied in the plasma or serum of 25 zzso zzso the source of the circulating zzso fragments was explored in zzso and in zzso and zzso the diagnostic performance of zzso associated in lung zzso transcript 1 zzso derived zzso zzso was validated in an independent cohort of 192 zzso The expression levels of zzso were measured by quantitative real time zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso copies were calculated using a standard curve in an area under the zzso curve zzso operating characteristic zzso zzso zzso profiling revealed that zzso and prostate cancer gene 3 zzso are zzso in zzso zzso Plasma zzso probably exist in the form of fragments in a stable zzso zzso enters cell culture medium at measurable levels, and zzso derived from human zzso zzso actually enters the circulation in zzso and can be measured to distinguish zzso mice from zzso In addition, plasma zzso levels are significantly elevated in zzso patients compared to zzso patients ( zzso At a zzso of zzso zzso copies per zzso of zzso the sensitivity is zzso zzso and zzso and the specificity is zzso zzso and zzso for discriminating zzso from zzso positive biopsy from negative biopsy and positive biopsy from negative zzso zzso We conclude that zzso can be used as a novel zzso zzso for zzso detection and can improve diagnostic accuracy by predicting prostate biopsy zzso Further large-scale studies are needed to confirm our zzso
