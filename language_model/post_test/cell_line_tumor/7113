zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso are associated with a poor prognosis in various zzso including prostate zzso zzso of these receptors may provide a treatment for zzso prostate zzso The presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed in the zzso human prostate cancer cell line, zzso zzso were exposed to the selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for 96 zzso zzso zzso at 6 zzso the dose causing 50% growth zzso was applied 48 h after the start of drug zzso There was a zzso effect on cell survival for both zzso and zzso zzso Combining zzso and zzso led to less than additive effects on cell zzso zzso and zzso representations further zzso this less than additive effect on cell zzso The application of zzso led to a marked zzso in the level of the negative regulator of cell division, zzso The zzso combination had less of an impact on zzso expression compared with the effect of zzso treatment zzso The lowest expression of the zzso zzso zzso was observed in the presence of the drug zzso There was a significant interaction zzso between zzso and either zzso or zzso zzso In contrast, the drug combination with zzso resulted in zzso zzso zzso These results indicate an zzso interaction between zzso and zzso targeting and provide molecular mechanisms supporting this zzso Data from zzso cells suggest that dual targeting of zzso and zzso may be inappropriate for the treatment of zzso prostate cancer, especially in the context of their combination with zzso
