zzso are associated with various types of cancer due to their ability to affect expression of genes that zzso zzso In this study, we explored the role of zzso in pancreatic zzso The analysis of clinical characteristics showed that zzso was significantly zzso in zzso and cell lines of pancreatic zzso Moreover, the decreased zzso level was significantly associated with tumor size and zzso stage, as well as zzso zzso and distant zzso Meanwhile, both zzso and zzso survival analysis showed decreased zzso were associated with overall zzso zzso of zzso in pancreatic cancer cells inhibited cell zzso zzso and invasion; induced zzso arrest and zzso and enhanced zzso To understand how zzso mediates the zzso of pancreatic cancer cells, a zzso tool was used to identify zzso as a potential target of zzso The zzso reporter gene zzso showed that zzso binds directly to the zzso region zzso of zzso to inhibit zzso zzso Western zzso and quantitative real-time zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso expression was zzso correlated with zzso expression both in pancreatic cancer samples and cell zzso zzso of zzso inhibited cell zzso zzso and invasion, induced zzso arrest and zzso and enhanced zzso In a nude mouse zzso model, both zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso significantly zzso pancreatic cancer cell zzso zzso we conclude that zzso targets zzso acts as a tumor zzso in pancreatic cancer cells, and may serve as a novel therapeutic agent for zzso pancreatic cancer zzso
