To investigate the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth in nude mice and its mechanisms, and to explore the relationship between the expression of zzso initiation factor families zzso & zzso and zzso factors zzso & zzso after the administration of zzso 

Human zzso zzso cells from zzso cell strain were transplanted zzso to zzso nude mice to produce tumors zzso nude mice were separated into seven groups to be treated by zzso zzso The tumor volume, tumor weight and tumor zzso rate were zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso density were estimated by zzso sections of seven groups' tumor samples analyzed utilizing zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso could inhibit the tumor growth in zzso A significant suppression of tumor growth was observed when the dosage was zzso The tumor zzso rates zzso of zzso 50 zzso 100 zzso and 200 zzso treated group were zzso , zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso of 100 zzso zzso zzso was not significantly different with that of 3 zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of the drug combination zzso zzso zzso + 3 zzso zzso was zzso Compared with control groups the protein expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were significantly inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso density in zzso treated groups decreased zzso zzso zzso The tumor zzso rate of combined zzso 100 zzso and zzso 3 zzso was zzso 

zzso could inhibit the subcutaneous zzso of human zzso zzso in nude mice and its mechanism may be associated with inhibited expression of zzso families and zzso zzso The combination of zzso and zzso could promote the synergistic effect on chemotherapy in the target tumor zzso
