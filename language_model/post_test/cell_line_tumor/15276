Cancer is a genetic disease with frequent zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso copy number aberrations zzso in human zzso would enable the zzso of disease mechanisms and the zzso of candidate zzso drivers with zzso roles in zzso We have zzso and systematically characterized zzso and the accompanying gene expression changes in tumors and matched zzso liver zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our analysis identified 29 zzso amplified and 22 zzso deleted regions with a high level of copy number zzso These regions harbor established zzso and tumor zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso as well as many other genes not previously reported to be involved in liver zzso zzso analysis of zzso genes in the amplification and deletion zzso implicates zzso of core cancer zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and transforming growth factor beta zzso in a large proportion of zzso zzso We further credentialed two candidate driver genes zzso and zzso from the zzso focal amplification zzso and showed that they play a significant role in zzso growth and zzso 

We have demonstrated that characterizing the zzso landscape in zzso will facilitate the understanding of disease mechanisms and the identification of zzso drivers that may serve as potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of this devastating zzso
