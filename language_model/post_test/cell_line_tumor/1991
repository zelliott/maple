zzso of differentiation zzso and nuclear zzso B zzso have been detected in many zzso tumors, and their presence has been correlated with the zzso potential of these zzso This study was undertaken to investigate the zzso significance of the expression of zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso roles in the invasion process of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and protein levels of zzso and zzso in normal zzso zzso cells and zzso cell lines were examined using reverse zzso and western zzso analysis, whereas the zzso and protein levels of zzso and zzso in clinical zzso specimens were determined by reverse zzso and zzso Short hairpin zzso zzso was used to silence zzso and zzso to allow for the examination of zzso zzso zzso expression and migratory capacity changes in zzso zzso zzso Cox analysis revealed that elevated zzso expression was a significant independent predictor of the 5 year overall survival rate zzso ratio zzso zzso P zzso zzso Furthermore, elevated expression of both zzso and zzso was associated with poor clinical survival zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso in zzso cells inhibited zzso expression and decreased the migratory capacity of zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso expression is a novel independent zzso marker zzso that helps identify zzso patients with a poor zzso Additionally, combined analysis of zzso and zzso can be useful for identifying patients at risk for zzso clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced tumor cell migration, which is associated with the zzso of zzso
