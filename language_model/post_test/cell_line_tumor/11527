zzso toxins have the potential to overcome intrinsic or acquired resistance of cancer cells to conventional zzso zzso Here, we hypothesized that zzso a zzso zzso toxin zzso consisting of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso growth factor and zzso would efficiently target and kill cells derived from canine zzso zzso a highly chemotherapy resistant zzso as well as cultured zzso used as a surrogate for cancer stem cells zzso zzso showed zzso in four zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso at a concentration of zzso zzso and the zzso was dependent on specific zzso zzso zzso targeted toxins also killed these zzso zzso in this case, a zzso level of zzso expression appeared to be required to make cells sensitive to the zzso zzso but not to the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was higher by approximately two orders of magnitude as compared to zzso but these cells were still sensitive to zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and when targeted by zzso resulted in death of the entire cell zzso Taken together, our results support the use of these toxins to treat zzso tumors such as zzso including those that conform to the zzso zzso Our results also support the use of companion animals with cancer for further zzso development of these zzso zzso
