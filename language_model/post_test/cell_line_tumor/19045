zzso of brain zzso zzso zzso is reported to decrease food intake and body weight in zzso Yet, the fatty acid zzso zzso inhibitor and zzso zzso zzso produces zzso and weight loss when given to zzso zzso zzso Thus roles and relative contributions of altered brain zzso activity and fatty acid zzso in these phenomena remain zzso We administered compounds that target zzso or zzso to mice by single zzso zzso and examined acute and prolonged effects on feeding and body zzso zzso decreased food intake rapidly and zzso at all doses zzso zzso and dose zzso inhibited intake on day zzso zzso weight loss on day 1 persisted through 4 days of zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso produced zzso zzso zzso zzso for 1 day, weight loss for 2 days, and weight regain to vehicle control by day zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso zzso 320 zzso did not alter overall day 1 zzso However, zzso attenuated the zzso produced by zzso indicating that zzso stimulation is important for zzso zzso A novel compound, zzso was characterized in zzso as a selective zzso of zzso that does not affect fatty acid zzso zzso zzso 320 zzso decreased feeding in mice for 3 days and produced persistent weight loss for 6 days without producing zzso taste zzso Similarly, zzso administration decreased feeding and body weight without producing zzso taste zzso These results suggest a role for brain zzso in the regulation of energy balance and zzso zzso stimulation as a pharmacological approach to weight zzso
