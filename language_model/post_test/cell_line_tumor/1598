Recent studies in several tumor models indicated that treatment with zzso zzso may trigger induction of zzso to other zzso Here we investigated modes of resistance and invasion in several tumor cell lines including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso using zzso at doses comparable to clinically zzso zzso In comparison with zzso tumors, zzso increased zzso to lung in zzso tumors and to zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso However, the same treatment did not induce zzso in zzso tumors, further suggesting that accelerating zzso during treatment with zzso zzso is tumor zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso (a dual inhibitor of zzso and zzso zzso as single agent or in combination with zzso reduced zzso in all models tested suggesting a role for zzso zzso in zzso or zzso Moreover, zzso data showed that while zzso is highly enriched in tumor cells, zzso is zzso mainly by the zzso zzso zzso suggesting a zzso fashion for zzso zzso zzso in the zzso In conclusion, our findings indicate that zzso zzso is tumor zzso dependent and further supports a rationale for combination of zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso
