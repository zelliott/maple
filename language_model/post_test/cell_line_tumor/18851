zzso metabolism as assessed by zzso PET imaging provides zzso information in patients with pancreatic cancer but the implications of manipulating zzso metabolism for therapeutic purposes are zzso Based on previous results with other cancer cell types, we hypothesized that zzso of zzso metabolism in pancreatic cancer cells would cause cell killing via zzso stress resulting from disruptions in zzso zzso zzso zzso a chemical inhibitor of zzso zzso and zzso deprivation induced zzso in human pancreatic cancer cells in a zzso zzso manner as well as causing significant increases in zzso zzso stress as measured by increased zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso administration of the zzso zzso zzso protected pancreatic cancer cells against the zzso effects of zzso as well as reversing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In nude mice with zzso pancreatic tumors, the combination of zzso and zzso radiation resulted in greater zzso of tumor growth and increased survival, relative to either agent zzso These results support the hypothesis that zzso zzso metabolism causes zzso in human pancreatic cancer cells via zzso zzso stress and disruptions in zzso zzso These results also support the speculation that zzso of zzso metabolism can be used in combination with classical zzso zzso agents (such as zzso zzso to enhance therapeutic responses in pancreatic zzso
