To observe the effect of zzso growth zzso zzso on bone zzso protein zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso were divided into blank control, IGF-1, IGF-1 + zzso and zzso zzso zzso was used to block the zzso zzso signaling zzso Changes in the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined using reverse zzso zzso chain reactions zzso and Western zzso zzso 

zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was significantly zzso by IGF-1 compared with the control group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were significantly reduced after blocking of the zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso but such a significant difference was not observed for zzso zzso protein expression zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

IGF-1 can zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso can noticeably reduce the zzso zzso We can conclude that the zzso effect of IGF-1 on zzso expression is realized through the zzso zzso signaling zzso
