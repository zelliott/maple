zzso zzso zzso channels are a unique family of zzso channels because they are capable of directly zzso calcium signals to changes in cell membrane potential required for cellular processes including but not limited to cellular proliferation and zzso It is now possible to distinguish three families of zzso channels based on differences in their zzso and pharmacological properties as well as zzso zzso Using a combination of zzso zzso and zzso approaches, we show that human tumor cells of zzso origin, zzso zzso cells, express transcripts for all three family members of zzso channels including zzso zzso and all three SK channel types zzso zzso and zzso The use of selective pharmacological zzso shows prominent expression of currents that are inhibited by the BK channel specific zzso zzso and zzso However, despite the presence of transcripts for zzso and zzso neither zzso an inhibitor of zzso channels, nor zzso known to block most SK channels inhibited any zzso The exclusive expression of functional BK channels was further substantiated by zzso zzso experiments, which selectively reduced zzso sensitive zzso Western zzso of patient zzso with zzso specific for all three zzso channel types further substantiated the exclusive expression of BK type zzso channels in zzso This finding is in sharp contrast to other zzso that express primarily zzso zzso
