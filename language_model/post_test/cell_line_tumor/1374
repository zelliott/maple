zzso and zzso function as zzso of cell cycle checkpoint arrest following DNA zzso Small zzso zzso of zzso proteins are under clinical evaluation in combination with zzso agents known to induce DNA zzso We examined whether zzso zzso could be effective as single agents in zzso cells with inherent DNA damage because of zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells showed a dramatic increase in the extent of DNA damage and DNA damage response zzso zzso within 1 h of treatment with zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso and cell zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso cell death was preceded by zzso of DNA damage and the amount of DNA damage correlated with the extent of cell zzso This effect was not observed in normal B cells indicating that DNA damage zzso following zzso zzso was specific to zzso zzso cells that exhibit inherent DNA damage because of zzso replication zzso Similar results were obtained with another structurally distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were more sensitive to a dual zzso inhibitor than to a zzso zzso In all cases, the level of DNA damage following treatment was the most consistent indicator of drug zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso would be beneficial therapeutic agents in zzso zzso We propose that zzso of zzso can act in a zzso lethal manner in zzso with replication stress as a result of these zzso being zzso on zzso proteins for an effective zzso and cell zzso
