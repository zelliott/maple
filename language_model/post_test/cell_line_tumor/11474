zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is subjected to multiple zzso zzso Our previous finding that zzso of zzso is essential for regulation of zzso and zzso zzso prompted us to investigate how zzso is zzso Here, we report that zzso is regulated by alternative zzso of zzso zzso to remove zzso 15, containing the zzso zzso Specifically, we find that two major alternative transcripts zzso full-length zzso zzso and zzso with zzso 15 deleted zzso exist in cells, and each transcript produces the expected zzso Further zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso reveal overlapping yet different zzso Interestingly, other zzso zzso zzso also have missing zzso encompassing the zzso of zzso suggesting that protein zzso zzso level may, in general, be controlled by the alternative zzso zzso Finally, we observed differential distribution of zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso cells in normal mouse zzso zzso Thus, alternative zzso not only serves as the zzso for zzso zzso but also generates cell zzso zzso that might regulate normal zzso biology in the zzso zzso
