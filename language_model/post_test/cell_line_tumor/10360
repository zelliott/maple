We developed zzso etched silicon chip zzso for zzso of zzso human breast cancer zzso and zzso human breast zzso zzso The zzso were zzso using a zzso zzso step zzso Each chip contained a zzso array of cavities 140 zzso wide by 60 zzso deep separated by zzso silicon zzso zzso occupied zzso of the etched zzso The cavities were enriched zzso in zzso cells relative to the seeding ratio of, zzso zzso zzso Micro zzso comprised of both zzso and zzso cells formed in zzso of cavities and contained zzso cells per zzso zzso cell interactions were seen in zzso and sites of these interactions were enriched with zzso zzso A selective zzso response to the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso occurred in zzso cells which was zzso by significant increases in cell length and cell area on flat surfaces and in the number of stretched cells inside the etched zzso The zzso of zzso cells was zzso in response to zzso Real time imaging showed the formation of highly dynamic and randomly zzso zzso extensions in zzso cells zzso after adding zzso this is the first report of a zzso zzso response in breast tumor cells to a zzso zzso zzso The findings demonstrate the utility of etched silicon zzso for the propagation of human breast cell zzso and the application of zzso as a potential marker to distinguish zzso breast cancer cells in a background of normal breast cell zzso
