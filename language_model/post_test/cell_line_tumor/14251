According to previous clinical experiences of the authors, zzso zzso was effective against acute zzso leukemia zzso However, its effectiveness has never been proven zzso or unequivocally zzso This study was aimed to investigate the effects of zzso on the zzso cell cycle and zzso of zzso cell line zzso zzso Cell zzso rates were detected by zzso zzso zzso zzso changes were observed under light microscope and transmission electron zzso zzso effects were determined by DNA gel zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso flow zzso The results demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso cells in a zzso zzso The zzso changes of cell zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso body formation, were observed by light microscope and transmission electron zzso Cell cycle analysis showed that zzso cells were blocked in zzso phase of cell zzso And zzso induced zzso zzso cell increase and DNA zzso There was a correlation between cell zzso rates and the zzso of zzso in zzso manner zzso zzso zzso It is concluded that for the first time the present study shows that zzso can inhibit cell zzso block cell cycle and induce zzso of zzso cell line zzso zzso
