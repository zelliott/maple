zzso (also called zzso is a zzso protein that plays an important role in regulating protein function and zzso It is known that several nuclear receptors are modified by zzso however, the effect of zzso in regulating nuclear zzso function has not been zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso is markedly enhanced by zzso a member of zzso zzso zzso zzso ability to enhance zzso zzso is not zzso through zzso of zzso but rather through its ability to zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso thereby reducing its zzso zzso zzso repressive effect on zzso zzso could be reversed by zzso and by deletion of its zzso zzso zzso interference depletion of zzso zzso also reduced zzso zzso Thus, zzso could regulate zzso zzso through zzso of zzso These studies provide insights on the potential role of zzso in the regulation of nuclear zzso zzso
