Certain zzso food zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso vegetables, have been shown to target cellular pathways regulating zzso Previously, our laboratory showed that dietary zzso is an effective zzso zzso agent in a zzso zzso model of zzso zzso zzso zzso The primary objective of the present study was to extend our zzso studies in mice to an analogous human zzso in cell zzso zzso we tested the hypothesis that zzso or zzso may be zzso in human zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso Treatment of the zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso in zzso significantly reduced cell proliferation and viability at zzso 8- to zzso lower than the parent compound zzso zzso zzso zzso arrested zzso and zzso cells at the zzso phase of the cell cycle and 15 zzso zzso significantly increased the percentage of zzso cells in all zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso reduced protein expression of zzso dependent zzso 4 and 6 zzso zzso and zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso also significantly altered expression of eight transcripts related to human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Similar zzso effects of zzso were observed in zzso zzso exposure to 100 zzso zzso significantly decreased the rate of growth of human zzso zzso in zzso zzso mice, reduced final tumor size by zzso and increased the zzso index compared to zzso zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate a potential for therapeutic application of zzso in zzso
