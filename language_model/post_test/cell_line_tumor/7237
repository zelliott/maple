zzso analysis of zzso patterns by image zzso can be used in the development and refinement of diagnosis and prognosis of zzso and in the follow-up of zzso However, little is known about the biological mechanisms underlying these zzso zzso mechanisms as zzso zzso modifications and particularly zzso zzso could play a major role in the determination of these zzso patterns and then influence nuclear texture zzso 

This study examined the consequences of treatment by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso A zzso on the nuclear texture in human cell lines sensitive and resistant to zzso Small cell lung zzso zzso cells and their zzso zzso which is resistant to zzso were incubated with 100 zzso of zzso for 0 to 24 zzso Nuclear texture was evaluated by image zzso and compared with the zzso zzso zzso level measured by western zzso and expression of zzso gene evaluated by reverse zzso and real-time zzso chain zzso 

zzso treatment induced an increase in zzso zzso zzso level in both cell zzso However, at the level of zzso texture, sensitive zzso cells displayed a progressive zzso zzso up to 24 zzso whereas resistant zzso showed rapid (8 zzso but transient zzso Similarly, expression of zzso increased regularly in zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells, an increase was also observed up to 12 h followed by a decrease after 24 h of zzso 

Analysis of nuclear texture appeared to be a sensitive technique to detect zzso pattern zzso induced by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso in the zzso cell line and enabled the observation of zzso pattern discrepancies between zzso zzso and drug-resistant cells during this zzso When zzso gene expression was analyzed as gene sensitive to zzso control, these textural differences seemed to be correlated to gene zzso
