zzso of zzso molecules may play an important role in the interaction of tumor cells with vascular zzso cells during tumor invasion and zzso In this study, the adhesive force of human zzso zzso cells to human zzso vein zzso cells zzso was investigated using a zzso aspiration zzso zzso of an zzso zzso zzso was also observed by zzso zzso In particular, the adhesive force after stimulation of zzso with zzso human zzso zzso was zzso The results demonstrated that the adhesive force of zzso cells to zzso zzso is significantly higher than that of zzso control cells, and that zzso of zzso in zzso zzso showed a higher fluorescent intensity compared to control zzso Moreover, addition of zzso zzso zzso decreased the adhesive force of zzso cells to zzso zzso by zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso may be a main zzso of zzso zzso of zzso tumor through blood zzso possibly increasing the adhesive force of human zzso zzso cells to zzso in the early stage of zzso
