The synthesis and characterization of zzso zzso complexes of the general formula zzso where zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and Z zzso zzso zzso or I, are reported zzso zzso In addition, the X-ray crystal structures of zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso The zzso distances in zzso are significantly shorter zzso and zzso zzso compared to those in 1 zzso and zzso zzso All of the zzso complexes zzso exhibit a characteristic broad zzso zzso zzso resonance at zzso delta zzso Complex 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso after 24 zzso in zzso The zzso also occurs in zzso The zzso complex zzso zzso did not undergo zzso whereas the zzso complex 3 showed relatively fast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso functional theory calculations showed that the total bonding energy of zzso in zzso zzso is zzso zzso lower than that in zzso zzso The greater bonding energy is related to the contribution from strong hydrogen bonding between the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso A loss of zzso activity was observed upon zzso of the zzso zzso to an zzso zzso zzso zzso 11 zzso for 1 and zzso zzso 100 zzso for 3, against zzso zzso cancer zzso The relationship between the zzso activity and the solution and solid state structures of the zzso and zzso complexes is zzso
