To study the regulatory role of zzso in the expression of zzso receptors A and B zzso and zzso in breast cancer zzso 

Breast cancer zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso zzso containing a full-length zzso zzso or with zzso zzso via zzso 2000 to induce zzso or suppressed expression of zzso zzso zzso hours after the zzso the cells were incubated in fresh culture medium containing 100 zzso zzso for 24 zzso The total zzso extract or whole cell zzso was prepared for detecting zzso zzso and zzso expressions using zzso and Western zzso 

The protein expressions of zzso and zzso were significantly decreased whereas their zzso expressions remained unchanged in zzso cells zzso zzso In zzso cells with zzso zzso in contrast, the zzso and zzso protein expressions were markedly zzso 

In breast cancer cells, zzso and zzso zzso can both zzso the expressions of zzso and zzso at the protein zzso
