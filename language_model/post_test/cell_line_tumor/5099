zzso is an active component of seaweed that has been shown to inhibit proliferation and induce zzso cell death in several tumor zzso However, the detailed mechanisms underlying this process have not yet been zzso In the present report, we investigated the effect of zzso on the induction of zzso in human breast cancer zzso zzso Our data demonstrated that zzso reduced the viable cell number of zzso cells in a zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso did not affect the viable cell number of normal human zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso induced zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, expression of Bid was zzso whereas truncated Bid was increased by zzso zzso There was also a decline in zzso zzso and a striking increase of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso canceled the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and a series of changes in zzso Bid, and zzso zzso However, zzso inhibitor exerted a moderate zzso effect on the zzso of zzso These data indicated that zzso could induce zzso cell death through a zzso zzso in zzso zzso
