The root of zzso zzso has traditionally been used in Korea for the treatment of zzso zzso pulmonary zzso and congestion for thousands of zzso The present study was designed to validate the zzso effects of zzso zzso extracts of the zzso zzso root zzso in zzso human lung zzso zzso Exposure to MEMC was found to result in growth zzso by the induction of zzso zzso in zzso cells, which correlated with zzso expression of death zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of Bid, and loss of zzso membrane zzso In addition, zzso a characteristic finding of zzso and markers of zzso conversion of zzso protein light zzso zzso to zzso and increased zzso zzso were observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso or zzso small interfering zzso resulted in enhanced zzso cell death, suggesting that zzso zzso functions as a zzso of zzso zzso zzso was also blocked by zzso zzso and zzso indicating that zzso can regulate zzso Our data demonstrate that MEMC triggers both zzso zzso and zzso zzso and that zzso plays a protective role against zzso cell zzso
