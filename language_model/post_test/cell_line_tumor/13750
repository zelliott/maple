zzso zzso protein is expressed in normal zzso zzso cells in a zzso zzso It is an important zzso of the zzso effect of zzso on cell zzso Moreover, the expression of zzso zzso is also found to be decreased in human zzso zzso cells zzso To study the mechanism of decrease in the expression levels of zzso zzso 3 zzso cell lines, Ishikawa, zzso and zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso The zzso cells, in which zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso were zzso with zzso zzso before treatment with zzso The results showed that zzso zzso expression increased in zzso and zzso cells after treatment with zzso additionally the cell proliferation was suppressed but not in zzso zzso When the zzso zzso was zzso into zzso cells, the effect of zzso was zzso Our data suggest that the zzso of zzso and its receptors is an important cause of the decreased expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso which may account for zzso and development of zzso zzso
