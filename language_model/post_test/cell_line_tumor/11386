It has become increasingly clear that zzso not only provide zzso growth signals to cells but also cause DNA damage at replication zzso zzso zzso which activate the zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso Here we studied underlying mechanisms of zzso replication stress in cells zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso E zzso is associated with increased firing of replication origins, impaired replication fork progression and DNA damage that activates zzso zzso By zzso replication initiation factors, we show that zzso zzso replication slowing and DNA damage is a consequence of excessive origin zzso A significant amount of zzso zzso replication slowing is due to interference between replication and transcription, which also zzso the zzso of zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso replication stress is caused by deregulation of replication initiation and increased interference between replication and transcription, which results in impaired replication fork progression and DNA damage triggering the tumor barrier or zzso zzso
