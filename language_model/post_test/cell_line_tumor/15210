zzso zzso zzso is a minimally invasive energy delivery technique increasingly used for focal therapy to eradicate localized zzso zzso zzso necrosis generates an zzso source of tumor zzso known to induce zzso immune zzso However, zzso zzso immunity is insufficient to control zzso zzso We sought to characterize zzso the role of zzso dose on zzso zzso of tumor and generation of immune responses and zzso the potential zzso between vaccine zzso and zzso aimed at local tumor control and decreased systemic zzso 

zzso colon zzso cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were studied to examine the effect of zzso zzso in zzso on the zzso zzso and sensitivity to zzso zzso The effect of zzso dose was investigated in zzso zzso zzso the zzso and growth of zzso tumors and zzso the induction of zzso immune zzso Finally, the molecular signature was evaluated as well as the potential zzso between zzso and zzso vaccines expressing zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells zzso increased zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso class I molecules and zzso rendered tumor cells more susceptible to zzso zzso In zzso zzso induced zzso zzso zzso on the surface of tumor cells and zzso increased zzso responses to zzso and additional zzso Combination therapy with zzso and vaccine in zzso mice induced a synergistic increase in zzso zzso immune responses to zzso and eradicated both primary zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso administration of zzso and high-dose zzso with vaccine decreased tumor recurrence compared to zzso zzso These studies suggest a potential clinical benefit in combining zzso with vaccine in cancer patients, and augment support for this novel zzso zzso
