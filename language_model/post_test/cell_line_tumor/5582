zzso is an important and emerging industry with a projected annual market of around one trillion US dollars by zzso Concerns about the toxicity of zzso in humans, however, have recently been zzso Although studies of zzso toxicity have focused on lung disease the molecular link between zzso exposure and lung injury remained zzso In this report, we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a class of zzso that are being widely developed for clinical applications can induce acute lung injury in zzso zzso triggers zzso cell death by zzso the zzso signaling zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso rescued zzso zzso cell death and ameliorated acute lung injury caused by zzso in zzso Our data provide a molecular explanation for zzso lung injury, and suggest potential remedies to address the growing concerns of zzso zzso
