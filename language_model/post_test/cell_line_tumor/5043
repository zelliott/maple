zzso a constituent of green and red peppers, has been linked with suppression of zzso through a mechanism that is not well zzso Because the zzso factor signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso has been closely linked with zzso we investigated the effect of this zzso on the zzso zzso in human multiple myeloma zzso 

The effect of zzso on both zzso and zzso zzso zzso associated protein zzso and zzso gene products involved in zzso survival and zzso cellular zzso and zzso in multiple myeloma cells was zzso 

We found that zzso inhibited zzso zzso of zzso in multiple myeloma cells in a zzso and zzso manner, with minimum effect on zzso zzso also inhibited the zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso 1 and zzso implicated in zzso zzso was also inhibited by the zzso with no effect on zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso zzso reversed the zzso zzso of zzso suggesting the involvement of a protein zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of the zzso gene products, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth zzso Finally, zzso induced the zzso of cells in zzso phase, inhibited zzso and induced zzso as indicated by zzso zzso zzso also significantly zzso the zzso effects of zzso and zzso in multiple myeloma zzso When administered zzso zzso inhibited the growth of human multiple myeloma zzso tumors in male zzso zzso zzso 

Overall, these results suggest that zzso is a novel blocker of the zzso zzso pathway, with a potential role in the prevention and treatment of multiple myeloma and other zzso
