zzso target of zzso zzso acts as a hub zzso signals from zzso availability and growth factors and plays central roles in regulating protein synthesis and cell growth, which has been validated as a promising target for cancer zzso zzso and its zzso have emerged as the first generation of zzso zzso but their efficacy is modest in clinical zzso zzso use of zzso with other drugs is a promising strategy to improve its zzso zzso Here we developed an unbiased systematic zzso screening platform aiming to discover new remedy for zzso cancer zzso We found that zzso emerged as one of the clinically available zzso drugs screened that displayed significant zzso with zzso in zzso zzso Combination of zzso with zzso resulted in enhanced cell cycle arrest in zzso phase, which was accompanied with enhanced suppression of zzso signaling and disruption of the negative feedback loop that activate zzso upon zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso displayed synergistic activity against tube formation by human zzso zzso cells as well as outgrowth of zzso tubes and zzso both in zzso and in zzso which is associated with zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our study demonstrated that new zzso regimen could be identified via systematic drug combination screening and established a zzso rationale for a combination approach using zzso and zzso in the treatment of human zzso
