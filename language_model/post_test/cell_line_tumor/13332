zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso comprise a family of zzso zzso factors with distinct functions in development and tumor zzso Most human zzso lose zzso function, yet all three proteins are capable of inducing zzso or cellular zzso zzso are therefore under investigation to activate zzso zzso in zzso cancer zzso zzso the zzso domain zzso of zzso escapes viral zzso and displays an enhanced zzso zzso To further understand the zzso features of zzso we solved the high-resolution crystal structure of the zzso zzso as well as its complex with the zzso repeat and zzso zzso of the zzso factor zzso The zzso structure exhibits the same zzso architecture as zzso but displays a divergent zzso loop, a known site of zzso zzso The loop in zzso is changed by a zzso zzso that also zzso zzso around the site of the zzso zzso hotspot zzso zzso the binding of zzso is preserved by zzso changes in both the zzso repeat and zzso zzso These results further highlight the structural variation that impacts zzso family interactions within the zzso zzso
