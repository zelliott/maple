The precise mechanisms underlying gender disparity in zzso zzso zzso progression and prognosis are not zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso progression in zzso and in zzso and this may contribute to the gender differences in zzso zzso To investigate the role of zzso in zzso zzso we developed an zzso zzso zzso model by liver zzso of zzso zzso In combination with male zzso female zzso and zzso treatment, we tested the hypothesis that zzso contributes to gender disparity in this zzso zzso analyses were performed to examine the changes in biological zzso of liver cancer cells, and two cell lines were used to investigate possible molecular mechanisms of the zzso effect of zzso Our data showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso by reducing zzso cell invasion, arresting cell cycle zzso and promoting zzso characterized by decreased expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso A, zzso zzso and zzso and increased expression in zzso zzso zzso Through in zzso zzso we further confirmed the changes in expression levels of these related zzso gained insights into the molecular zzso of zzso zzso suppression, and indicated the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso binding activity as a pivotal event in this zzso This study represents a novel description of the mechanisms regarding the zzso effects of zzso on zzso adding a new understanding to the gender disparity in zzso zzso Copyright zzso 2012 zzso Society of Great Britain and zzso Published by John zzso & Sons, zzso
