Multiple myeloma is a zzso cancer that is considered incurable despite advances in treatment strategy during the last zzso zzso targeting single pathways are unlikely to succeed due to the zzso nature of the zzso zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso is a zzso protein essential for DNA replication and repair that is often zzso in cancer zzso Many proteins involved in the cellular stress response interact with zzso through the five zzso acid sequence zzso zzso 2 zzso motif zzso Thus zzso zzso protein interactions may be a good strategy to target multiple pathways zzso We initially found that zzso of peptides containing the zzso sequence increases the sensitivity of cancer cells to contemporary zzso Here we have designed a zzso zzso zzso zzso that targets zzso and show that it has zzso zzso We found that zzso induced zzso in multiple myeloma cell lines and primary cancer cells, while bone zzso zzso cells and primary healthy zzso were much less zzso zzso zzso was zzso and cell cycle zzso zzso also increased multiple myeloma zzso sensitivity against zzso a DNA damaging agent commonly used for treatment of multiple zzso In a zzso mouse model, zzso was well tolerated and increased the zzso activity of zzso zzso targeting zzso by zzso may be a novel strategy in multiple myeloma zzso
