Among the applications of DNA zzso expression data, identification of zzso expressed genes is widely used to search for genes involved in specific biological zzso Previous studies have shown that replication is necessary to reliably identify zzso expressed zzso In practice, however, further guidelines are required to provide references for experiment design, that is, to fulfill the needs for determining the replication number on a desired confidence level or the detection sensitivity of the zzso Here, we performed simulations to build a simple statistical table of general guidelines adapted specifically for identifying zzso expressed genes using zzso of a zzso experiment, and we present an accompanying zzso method, zzso zzso detection zzso The analysis results of the zzso cells showed that zzso is simple and zzso and that the resulting statistical table is zzso
