A series of four zzso zzso molecular squares with zzso or zzso bridges, including the previously reported zzso squares zzso zzso were investigated for their abilities to act as selective and effective human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies demonstrated that zzso squares could discriminate against duplex DNA, and show promising selectivity between zzso zzso zzso zzso and CD studies showed that zzso squares strongly induced the formation of parallel zzso zzso experiments indicated that zzso squares could bind to the zzso with high binding zzso zzso values ranging from zzso zzso All four zzso squares were effective zzso of human zzso and showed zzso zzso This was particularly the case for zzso zzso which exhibited a zzso higher zzso effect on zzso cells than zzso
