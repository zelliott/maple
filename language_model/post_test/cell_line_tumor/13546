zzso zzso actively participate in normal zzso zzso zzso and in breast zzso growth and progression by zzso zzso zzso however, little is known about the identity of zzso zzso in individual zzso The purpose of this study was to characterize zzso signaling pathways between breast zzso cells and breast zzso zzso zzso or normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from breast zzso tissue samples and adjacent normal zzso zzso tissue of 28 zzso The zzso were grown in zzso collagen gel zzso with zzso human breast zzso cells and zzso cell growth was zzso zzso zzso zzso cell growth to a significantly greater degree than zzso We detected a considerable zzso zzso of zzso interactions but identified zzso zzso zzso and zzso as factors that were consistently responsible for the activity of zzso zzso zzso from zzso but not high-grade zzso required zzso growth factor 1 and transforming growth factor beta 1 to stimulate zzso zzso Paradoxically, blocking of zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso cell growth in zzso with zzso The results were largely mirrored by treating the zzso with zzso zzso prior to zzso implicating the zzso as principal production site for the zzso zzso In zzso we identify a zzso signaling network with zzso zzso and zzso These findings have significant implications for the design of zzso zzso
