We determined the in zzso and in zzso zzso activities of zzso acid zzso and one of the possible mechanisms for its zzso zzso In zzso zzso activity of zzso was evaluated by the relative tumor growth ratio zzso in nude mice, and in zzso zzso of zzso cells was measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso blue exclusion zzso zzso repeats amplification protocol zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used to zzso detect zzso activity and the expression of human zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from our in zzso study showed that zzso tumor growth remained suppressed for up to 21 d with minimal animal weight loss in nude mice treated with zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso cells cultured in zzso was significantly inhibited ( zzso showing zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso expression were both decreased significantly, when cells were exposed to zzso acid for 24, 48 and 72 h (for 24 h zzso and for 48, 72 zzso zzso These results zzso that zzso acid could inhibit the growth of zzso cells and its tumor zzso and when treated with zzso acid for a period of time, zzso activity and expression of zzso zzso in the tumor cells were both inhibited zzso It is safe, at least in part, to conclude that the zzso zzso activity of zzso by zzso partly the expression of zzso zzso in zzso cells may be one possible mechanism for the zzso activity of zzso in the zzso
