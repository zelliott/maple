zzso of a specific zzso using double stranded zzso zzso represents one of the newest technologies for suppressing a specific gene zzso Small interfering zzso zzso are 21 zzso long, double stranded zzso fragments that are identical in sequence to the target zzso We designed 3 such zzso against the zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene is known to play an important role in the zzso of several types of zzso such as breast, zzso colon and gastric zzso Introduction of the zzso into zzso positive tumor lines in zzso greatly reduced the cell surface expression of the zzso zzso zzso a range of effects on cell zzso such as growth zzso or zzso was zzso The expression of zzso class I was observed to be zzso when zzso was silenced with zzso Treatment of zzso and zzso tumor cell lines with the zzso zzso resulted in growth arrest of cells in the late zzso Our results suggest that zzso may be an effective method of zzso the effect of zzso in zzso
