zzso zzso zzso in zzso of patients with relapsed mantle cell zzso zzso zzso more than half of patients' tumors are zzso resistant to zzso The molecular mechanism of resistance has not been zzso We generated a model of zzso zzso of the zzso cell lines zzso and zzso that were zzso to zzso less sensitive to zzso than the parental zzso Acquisition of zzso resistance was gradual and zzso zzso zzso showed increased zzso activity and tolerated lower zzso capacity than the parental zzso Using gene expression zzso we discovered that zzso resistance was associated with zzso zzso including zzso of zzso and zzso and expression of zzso In contrast to plasma cells, zzso zzso cells did not increase zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines and primary tumor cells from zzso patients with inferior clinical response to zzso also expressed zzso zzso zzso of zzso was toxic for the subset of zzso cells with zzso zzso but only slightly zzso cells to zzso We conclude that zzso differentiation in the absence of an increased zzso load can enable cells to withstand the stress of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso could serve as markers of zzso resistance in zzso This study has been registered at zzso as zzso
