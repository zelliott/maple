Recently we generated a mathematical model zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso of signaling in zzso zzso zzso modeling in combination with experimental data provided new insights into zzso zzso and allowed us to establish a threshold mechanism of life and zzso Here, we further assessed the predictability of the model zzso by a detailed analysis of the threshold behavior of zzso zzso Using the model predictions for the mechanism of the threshold behavior we found that the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso is formed at the cell membrane upon stimulation with low zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso however, zzso of zzso at the zzso is blocked due to high cellular zzso protein recruitment into the zzso Given that death signaling does not occur upon zzso stimulation at low zzso zzso zzso we also analyzed survival zzso focusing on zzso protein zzso zzso Interestingly, we found that zzso protein zzso zzso takes place under threshold zzso These findings show that triggering of zzso can signal both life or death, depending on the strength of the zzso
