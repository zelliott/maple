zzso to cervical zzso zzso zzso is significantly associated with the outcome of patients with oral zzso To provide a useful method for the detection of zzso we analyzed 115 zzso from 10 patients with oral cancer using real-time quantitative zzso chain reaction zzso based on the expression of zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso 13 zzso The sensitivity and zzso of this method were assessed by means of limited dilution of cultured oral cancer cells and a model of cervical zzso established by zzso green fluorescent protein zzso cells into the tongue of nude zzso In both zzso a few cancer cells were detected by real-time quantitative zzso but not by conventional reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected at high levels in zzso zzso In contrast, 26 of the 30 control cervical zzso did not express the gene at all, and the rest showed fairly low zzso Of 108 zzso zzso zzso 19 zzso expressed zzso zzso levels higher than the zzso value zzso mean expression of control zzso + zzso zzso zzso is not a suitable marker for the real-time zzso since it was detected frequently even in the control zzso These findings suggest that genetic diagnosis by real-time quantitative zzso based on zzso zzso expression may be clinically useful for detecting zzso tumor cells in cervical zzso
