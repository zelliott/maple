To observe the effect of polo like zzso 1 zzso gene depletion on the growth of gastric cancer cell zzso cells in zzso and zzso and discuss the feasibility and effectiveness of arranging zzso as gene therapeutic target for gastric zzso 

The zzso expression of zzso cells was inhibited by zzso interference zzso The zzso zzso and protein level were measured by real-time quantitative zzso and western zzso and the change of cell cycle distribution and zzso rate were detected by zzso and the zzso cells proliferation was measured by zzso zzso zzso cells treated with zzso zzso were transplanted zzso in nude mice and their zzso ability were observed, the zzso protein levels of the samples from nude mice in different groups were zzso 

After treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein level decreased obviously in certain time, more zzso cells accumulated at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rate of zzso cells treated with zzso zzso was higher than that of control cells at 48 h and 72 h zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells proliferated slowly than control groups zzso zzso zzso while the zzso ability obviously zzso but the zzso protein levels of the samples from nude mice in different groups were not zzso 

zzso targeting zzso can inhibit the proliferation of zzso cells in zzso and zzso zzso may be a novel therapeutic target for gastric zzso
