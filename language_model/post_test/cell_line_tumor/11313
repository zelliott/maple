The zzso activated zzso zzso are a family of zzso zzso that are downstream zzso of small zzso zzso and zzso zzso regulate cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and activity have been shown to be enhanced in cancer and to function as an zzso in zzso zzso also have been implicated in cancer zzso 

In zzso cancer, we have previously determined that zzso zzso is common in the invasive fronts of aggressive tumors and that it is functionally involved in zzso cancer cell zzso using molecular zzso We report the development of two new zzso compounds that were modified from the structure zzso a previously identified zzso inhibitor that competitively blocks zzso binding of both zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso 

zzso compounds were created by zzso chemistry predicted to inhibit zzso activity with reduced zzso zzso Two lead compounds were identified based on the ability to inhibit zzso activity in an zzso manner without discernible in zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso cancer cell zzso Both compounds reduced zzso cancer cell zzso Although they are not zzso on a zzso screening zzso the zzso activity effect of the compounds in zzso cancer cells was rescued by zzso of a zzso active zzso suggesting this activity is involved in this biological zzso 

We have developed 2 new zzso zzso with zzso activity that may serve as scaffolds for further compound development targeting this zzso zzso cancer zzso
