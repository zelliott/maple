zzso also referred to as the human zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso type III, is a zzso zzso able to zzso reduce steroids as well as zzso or reduce zzso zzso Previously, this same protein was also identified by its robust induction by phase II zzso in zzso zzso In zzso cells, both zzso and zzso zzso sequence zzso were induced by phase II zzso but not the highly related zzso and zzso family members zzso sequence zzso We now report the initial characterization of the zzso promoter of zzso in zzso cell line and the identification of a potent zzso element responsive to phase II zzso located approximately zzso zzso upstream from the zzso start zzso DNA sequence analysis of this zzso element revealed that it contained a consensus zzso response element zzso which was confirmed by zzso zzso Treatment with phase II zzso leads to increased zzso of nuclear zzso 2 zzso factor zzso 2 in the nucleus, which was associated with increased binding to this ARE as determined by zzso mobility shift zzso zzso zzso with zzso increased the zzso activity of the ARE of zzso comparable with that observed with phase II zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis also confirmed increased zzso binding to the ARE after induction by a phase II zzso The zzso promoter also zzso this same ARE element in a highly zzso region, which was also bound by zzso in a zzso zzso No induction of the ARE of zzso was detected in zzso zzso The regulation of zzso by this zzso ARE suggests that zzso zzso products of zzso zzso injury, which has important implications for both hormone and zzso zzso
