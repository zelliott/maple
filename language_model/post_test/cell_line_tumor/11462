zzso of zzso has been observed in most cancer types, such as zzso This zzso has been implicated in a number of cellular zzso including zzso possibly by directly modulating the expression of several zzso related zzso It was recently shown to directly target zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso Nevertheless, the possible effect of zzso in zzso has never been zzso This study investigates the effects of targeting zzso with zzso on chronic zzso leukemia cellular zzso and on associated drug zzso We observed that zzso zzso decreased cellular viability and zzso although no changes to the normal cell cycle profile were zzso zzso zzso also caused increased programmed cell death and a decrease in the expression levels of zzso zzso although zzso zzso was not affected, indicating that zzso was not the relevant mechanism underlying the observed zzso Treatment with zzso caused an increase in the zzso related proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso both by zzso zzso and zzso orange zzso zzso and also by transmission electron zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso increased zzso and zzso cellular sensitivity to zzso or zzso This zzso was reverted by zzso cells with zzso an zzso zzso Finally, serum zzso (an zzso zzso also increased sensitivity to these drugs, confirming that zzso zzso these cells to the effect of these zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the first description of zzso induction via zzso targeting and its involvement in drug zzso
