Lung cancer, predominantly zzso cell lung cancer zzso remains the leading cause of zzso deaths zzso Although zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling is important and well studied with respect to zzso zzso little is known about how zzso mediate zzso signaling to zzso zzso To identify zzso that target zzso we performed a zzso analysis and found that zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein expression in human lung cancer cells zzso zzso zzso We observed increases in zzso association with zzso in zzso zzso Interestingly, we observed an inverse correlation of zzso expression and zzso protein levels in human lung cancer tissue samples, suggesting that zzso directly targets zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso inhibited the growth of human lung cancer zzso Our findings suggest that zzso may act as an important zzso of zzso zzso with potential applications as a novel therapeutic target in lung zzso
