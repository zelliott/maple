zzso iron oxide zzso zzso show a great promise for a wide specter of zzso due to their characteristic magnetic properties exhibited only in the presence of magnetic zzso Their advantages in the fields of magnetic drug targeting and imaging are well established and their safety is zzso since iron oxide zzso have already been approved for in zzso application, however, according to many literature reports the bare metal oxide zzso may cause toxic effects on treated zzso zzso it is reasonable to prevent the direct interactions between metal oxide core and surrounding zzso In the current research zzso acid coated zzso zzso were successfully zzso characterized and incorporated in the zzso zzso resulting in zzso magnetic zzso zzso The carrier system was shown to exhibit zzso properties and was therefore responsive towards external magnetic zzso zzso using zzso breast cancer cells confirmed zzso of magnetic zzso zzso zzso and their zzso zzso in various zzso zzso depending on zzso of external magnetic zzso However, the number of zzso zzso observed by fluorescent and transmission electron zzso was relatively low, making such way of targeting effective only for delivery of highly potent zzso The scanning electron zzso of treated cells revealed that zzso influenced the cell zzso when external magnetic field was applied, and that treatment resulted in damaged zzso plasma membrane right after exposure to the magnetic zzso On the other hand, zzso showed only zzso reduced cellular zzso activity in zzso up to 200 zzso and, in the tested concentration the cell cycle distribution was within the normal range, indicating safety of the established magnetic carrier system for the treated zzso
