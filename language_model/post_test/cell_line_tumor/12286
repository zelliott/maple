To demonstrate an involvement of zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways in the first phase of zzso insulin zzso zzso from pancreatic beta cells, the time course of zzso from zzso cells was analyzed at zzso sample zzso zzso was zzso with the first phase being observed 120 to 390 s after zzso addition, zzso at 180 zzso and with a shoulder at 240 to 330 zzso Both 10 zzso zzso and 3 zzso zzso completely inhibited zzso or zzso insulin zzso and suppressed the peak of the first phase of zzso but did not result in complete zzso The shoulder following the peak was suppressed by 1 zzso zzso The peak, but not shoulder, disappeared under the zzso zzso zzso A significant amount of insulin zzso remained even in the combined presence of zzso and zzso The zzso channel blocker zzso (30 zzso nearly completely inhibited the first phase zzso These results suggest that the first phase of zzso from zzso cells depends on both zzso and zzso zzso The former mechanism includes the zzso zzso influx via zzso zzso calcium channel and zzso zzso release from zzso zzso via zzso zzso and the latter mechanism involves the pathways associated with zzso zzso
