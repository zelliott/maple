zzso gene plays a crucial role in the response to zzso Since it is zzso in the majority of human zzso it is strongly believed that the zzso zzso zzso resistance to zzso In this paper we analyzed the influence of two mechanistically diverse zzso zzso and zzso on the proliferation and cell cycle of two head and neck zzso cancer cell lines zzso zzso type zzso zzso but zzso zzso zzso and zzso 27 zzso zzso zzso along with the influence of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso of zzso and zzso effects, zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso 

zzso gene was introduced into tumor cells using zzso zzso zzso The cell cycle zzso were measured by two zzso flow zzso The expression of zzso zzso and zzso B1 proteins was examined using zzso and western zzso zzso 

In zzso 27 cells zzso of zzso completely zzso high S phase content observed in zzso cells into a zzso and slight zzso arrest, while it sustained zzso arrest of the cells treated with zzso along with the reduction of DNA synthesis and zzso B1 zzso On the other hand, in zzso cell line zzso zzso slightly slowed down the progression through S phase in cells treated with methotrexate, decreased the zzso B1 expression only after 24 zzso and failed to sustain the zzso arrest after treatment with zzso zzso Instead, it increased the population of S phase cells that were not actively zzso DNA, sustained zzso B1 expression and allowed the zzso cells to progress through zzso 

This study demonstrates that zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso levels enhanced the activity of low doses of zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso 27 cells through changes in the cell zzso However, the mechanisms of these effects differ depending on the genetic context and on the zzso zzso of zzso
