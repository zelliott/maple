zzso of zzso zzso on recently activated zzso T cells has been used to identify rare viral or tumor zzso T cells from peripheral zzso Here, we evaluated the zzso of zzso in human cancer and the utility of a zzso separation methodology for the identification and enrichment of fresh zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso from zzso for use in adoptive zzso 

zzso from zzso zzso cancer or melanoma were measured for surface zzso expression directly or after overnight incubation in the presence of tumor cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso were sorted and evaluated for zzso activity in zzso and in zzso 

Fresh zzso zzso and zzso naturally expressed higher levels of zzso than circulating T zzso An zzso increase in zzso expression was observed following incubation of fresh zzso tumor or zzso in zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso Enriched zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso cells, possessed zzso tumor zzso in zzso and in zzso In melanoma studies, all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression after incubation with zzso zzso cancer cells and zzso zzso function was restricted to the zzso subset in zzso zzso zzso also zzso superior zzso effects in zzso compared with zzso zzso 

Our findings reveal a role for the zzso member zzso in the zzso of human cancer where it is zzso expressed on zzso subset of zzso thus zzso its zzso engagement in zzso and its use in zzso selection for adoptive zzso zzso
