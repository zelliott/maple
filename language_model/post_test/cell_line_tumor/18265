Vitamin zzso zzso differentiation and zzso in a wide array of human cancer cell zzso Vitamin zzso zzso proceeds much more slowly than the zzso induced by conventional zzso zzso Thus, it is possible to analyze the underlying mechanism in zzso In this chapter, we focus on the zzso effects of vitamin zzso on zzso physiology with particular emphasis on changes in zzso membrane potential zzso Upon treatment of zzso cancer zzso cells with vitamin zzso zzso is produced after two to three days, followed shortly thereafter by release of zzso zzso zzso This is accompanied by other zzso features such as characteristic zzso changes and DNA fragmentation by day zzso Data suggest that zzso production might cause damage to zzso zzso open zzso transition zzso and result in disruption of zzso with subsequent release of zzso zzso Both vitamin zzso production of zzso and reduction of zzso are completely inhibited by zzso such that cell viability is zzso Thus, we propose that the loss of zzso caused by zzso might be the major cause of zzso following exposure to vitamin zzso However, other pathways may be involved since zzso A failed to completely inhibit vitamin zzso zzso
