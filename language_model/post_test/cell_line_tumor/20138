The present study investigates whether the expression levels of heat shock zzso zzso in colon cancer cells are associated with zzso zzso sensitivity in a zzso model, as well as the mechanism responsible for regulating zzso zzso zzso cells which have a high expression of zzso were zzso zzso with specific short hairpin zzso zzso in order to suppress zzso zzso The association between zzso protein expression levels and zzso sensitivity was evaluated in a mouse zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso were also analyzed in the zzso zzso The suppression of zzso protein expression led to enhanced zzso zzso The zzso expression levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not those of zzso zzso and the number of zzso cells increased in the zzso cells after zzso zzso In conclusion, the suppression of zzso expression in colon cancer cells may promote zzso sensitivity by inducing zzso despite the acceleration in zzso zzso
