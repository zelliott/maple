It has been proposed that the frequent loss of zzso zzso of an entire zzso 17 zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso is the consequence of the zzso of multiple zzso zzso genes on this zzso We report the characterization of a 453 zzso zzso locus shown previously to exhibit a high frequency of zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis further defined the minimal region of deletion to a 65 zzso zzso flanked by zzso and zzso which contains zzso zzso and zzso as zzso zzso gene zzso zzso specific expression excluded zzso as a zzso zzso was expressed at low levels in the majority of benign and low zzso potential zzso zzso and in a subset of zzso zzso zzso samples, as compared with primary cultures of normal zzso surface zzso cell zzso zzso zzso was expressed at low levels in the majority of zzso and zzso samples compared with benign and zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso was expressed at low or zzso levels in zzso cell lines exhibiting zzso characteristics and zzso in a genetically modified zzso cell line rendered zzso DNA sequence analysis identified zzso but no apparent deleterious zzso in either zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested that promoter zzso of zzso but not zzso occurred in 6 of 31 zzso zzso The results combined suggest that zzso and zzso may play distinctive roles in zzso cancer and could be added to the growing roster of zzso 17 genes implicated in this zzso
