The zzso growth factor binding protein zzso is a zzso and zzso protein in prostate cancer zzso zzso studies suggest that low zzso is associated with greater risk of aggressive, zzso prostate zzso but in zzso functional data are zzso Here we show that mice that are genetically deficient in zzso exhibit weaker growth of primary prostate tumors but higher zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso knockout mice zzso zzso failed to undergo zzso after zzso zzso prostate tumors did not develop in zzso mice, but zzso zzso occurred in zzso of female zzso mice by 80 weeks of zzso To assess the effects of zzso zzso on prostate cancer development, we crossed zzso mice with a zzso model of zzso that develops zzso zzso zzso By 24 weeks of age, zzso prostate zzso were observed in all mice regardless of zzso zzso However, by 80 weeks of age zzso mice tended to exhibit larger prostate tumors than control zzso More zzso lung zzso were observed at this time in zzso of the zzso mice but none in the control zzso Cell lines established from zzso tumors displayed more aggressive zzso in zzso invasion, and colony formation zzso relative to control zzso tumor cell zzso In addition, zzso cells exhibited evidence of zzso zzso Our findings established a function for zzso in suppressing zzso in prostate cancer, and they also offered the first reported transgenic model of spontaneous zzso prostate cancer for studies of this advanced stage of zzso
