zzso and cholesterol in particular, have long been associated with breast cancer zzso onset and zzso However, the zzso effects of elevated zzso levels and breast cancer remain largely undisclosed and were the subject of the present zzso took advantage of well-established in zzso and in zzso models of cholesterol enrichment to exploit the mechanism involved in zzso zzso BC growth and zzso We analyzed its effects in models that mimic different BC zzso and zzso data show that zzso (but not zzso promotes BC cells zzso migration and loss of zzso hallmarks of the zzso to zzso zzso In zzso studies modeling cholesterol levels showed that breast tumors are consistently larger and more zzso in zzso mice, which also have more frequently lung zzso zzso analysis revealed an over expression of zzso of zzso and zzso pathways suggesting a survival response induced by LDL, confirmed by zzso zzso Gene expression analysis also evidenced an zzso of zzso signaling zzso and decreased expression of zzso molecules zzso family zzso zzso zzso 7 and zzso in the cells exposed to zzso the present work shows novel zzso evidence that high zzso levels promote BC zzso These data provide rationale for the clinical control of cholesterol levels in BC zzso
