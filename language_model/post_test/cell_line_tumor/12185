The repression mechanisms by the nuclear zzso zzso zzso of steroid hormone zzso zzso zzso were zzso Yellow fluorescent protein zzso was distributed as zzso discrete dots, while zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso alpha zzso triggered zzso of zzso In zzso recovery after zzso analysis, mobility of the zzso was reduced by zzso zzso zzso The middle region of zzso mostly contributed to the interaction with zzso zzso and the suppression of their zzso zzso zzso impaired the zzso zzso interaction of zzso and the impaired interaction was zzso recovered by zzso of zzso and zzso zzso also impaired the zzso complete zzso focus formation of zzso zzso of zzso or zzso released zzso or zzso zzso from incomplete zzso and simultaneously recovered complete zzso of zzso fluorescent zzso These results indicate that the relative ratio of zzso and zzso determines the zzso equilibrium between zzso active and inactive zzso in the presence of zzso The zzso zzso formed by zzso zzso were completely destroyed by zzso D and zzso indicating that the focus formation does not zzso the zzso zzso The focus formation may reflect the zzso of zzso complexes released from the zzso active sites and thus be a mirror of zzso active complex zzso
