zzso is involved in zzso joint development, maintenance and repair, and the zzso zzso single zzso zzso zzso located in the zzso of zzso is zzso at the zzso significance level, with zzso zzso and with other musculoskeletal zzso including zzso zzso hip zzso and Achilles zzso There is a significant reduction in the expression of the zzso T zzso relative to the C zzso in zzso joint zzso an effect influenced by a second zzso zzso zzso also within the zzso The differential zzso expression zzso imbalance of the C and T zzso of zzso varies zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso may be modulated zzso The C zzso of both zzso form zzso zzso that are potentially amenable to regulation by zzso Here, we have examined whether DNA zzso regulates zzso expression and the zzso imbalance caused by zzso We observed zzso of the zzso promoter and zzso in cell lines and joint zzso with zzso zzso with increased zzso zzso The zzso sites created by the C zzso at zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and treatment of a zzso cell line with a zzso agent further increased the zzso expression imbalance between the C and T zzso This demonstrates that the genetic effect of the zzso zzso on zzso expression is modulated zzso by DNA zzso The zzso in zzso of zzso is therefore partly accounted for by differences in DNA zzso that could influence the zzso of this zzso in zzso to common musculoskeletal zzso
