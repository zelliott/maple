zzso DNA zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso are among the most common molecular zzso in human zzso Previous studies revealed that genetic reduction of the DNA zzso level results in opposing effects on tumor development, depending on the tumor cell type and on the different stages of the zzso For instance, reduced levels of DNA zzso in mice strongly inhibited tumor development of the zzso whereas they induced zzso zzso and liver zzso In the present study, using DNA zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso to reduce zzso zzso we examined the effects of DNA zzso on a zzso zzso zzso in the tongue and esophagus induced by zzso zzso zzso reduction of DNA zzso level led to the suppression of tumor formation in both tongue and zzso zzso analyses revealed that DNA zzso zzso inhibited the development of zzso cell zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the tongue and zzso and that pharmacological modification of zzso status might be useful for the prevention and treatment of zzso in the upper zzso zzso
