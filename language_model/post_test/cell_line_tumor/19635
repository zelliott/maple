zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibit formation of the abnormal zzso of prion protein zzso in zzso cells and prolong the incubation time of zzso zzso zzso of zzso is not tightly regulated and possible sites of zzso are randomly zzso which zzso zzso of the fundamental structures of zzso that mediate the zzso of zzso zzso To address the zzso relationship of zzso in the zzso of zzso formation, we screened the ability of various zzso zzso zzso to inhibit zzso formation in zzso zzso Among the zzso and their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibited zzso formation with 50% effective doses below 20 zzso and their zzso effect became more evident with consecutive zzso zzso comparisons suggested that a combination of an zzso group at zzso and an zzso group at either zzso or zzso on zzso might be involved in the zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso but not zzso zzso inhibited zzso formation, suggesting the importance of a zzso zzso in its zzso These results indicate that the synthetic zzso zzso are useful not only for the analysis of zzso relationship of zzso but also for the development of zzso for prion zzso
