In course of a screening for small molecules presenting potential zzso properties, a known zzso zzso zzso named zzso was isolated from the leaves of zzso zzso zzso collected in the Brazilian zzso The structure was determined by zzso methods, mainly zzso and zzso and its biological activities were investigated on cultured human zzso melanoma zzso In zzso zzso was evaluated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso concentration zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso for 24 h of drug zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso induced zzso arrest and increased the proportion of zzso zzso cells (at 11 zzso and 22 zzso and this effect was not dependent on time of zzso At these zzso a typical zzso was observed by zzso gel zzso of the extracted zzso Treatment of cells with 50 zzso zzso for 24 h caused extensive zzso and zzso Our results demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso exhibited important zzso toward human melanoma cells and that zzso and necrosis might be responsible for the observed zzso
