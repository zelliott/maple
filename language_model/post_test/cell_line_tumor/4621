The expression of zzso class II genes is strictly tissue zzso In a limited number of cells, the expression of these genes is zzso by zzso and only in zzso and B cells is expression zzso zzso blocks the zzso induction of these zzso but enhances their expression in zzso and the B cell line zzso We have observed that zzso increased surface expression by raising I-A protein and zzso zzso zzso does not enhance the expression of the zzso zzso In transient zzso experiments, zzso induced the expression of the zzso promoter, which contains an zzso box located between zzso and zzso zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso zzso of this box zzso the effect of zzso The zzso box still responded to zzso when we moved it to zzso zzso or even when it was in the opposite zzso zzso induced a complex that bound to the zzso zzso However, in zzso cells, the complex comprised zzso and zzso while in zzso cells only zzso This was confirmed by zzso immune zzso zzso and the distinct induction of zzso and zzso zzso zzso our results indicate that zzso exerts a novel regulatory mechanism in the control of zzso class II gene zzso
