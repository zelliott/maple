The aim of this study was to evaluate whether zzso cancer cells have cancer stem cell zzso zzso 

zzso pancreatic cancer cells were incubated in the presence of zzso zzso for 24 zzso and further incubated without zzso for 28 zzso To assess the capacity of zzso surviving cells were planted for zzso zzso zzso transition zzso was induced with zzso then zzso expression was evaluated by real-time zzso for zzso zzso and zzso The zzso protein levels were also examined by zzso zzso The Local invasion ability was analyzed by zzso invasion zzso 

The frequency of cells that were capable of initiating spheres was higher in zzso treated cells, which also zzso stem cell marker zzso zzso and zzso zzso invasion activity of zzso zzso cells was greater than that of control zzso zzso 

zzso cancer cells have zzso properties, zzso able to initiate sphere formation, express stem cell zzso and respond to zzso zzso
