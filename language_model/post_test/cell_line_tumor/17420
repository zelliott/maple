zzso cells accumulate in large numbers at zzso sites, where they have been shown to express a number of zzso factors, including vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso is known to strongly promote zzso and is found in increased levels at sites of chronic inflammation and around solid zzso The expression pattern of zzso and the regulation of zzso by zzso were examined in zzso zzso human mast cells zzso zzso expressed zzso for five zzso of zzso and other members of the zzso family zzso zzso and zzso with strong expression of the most potent zzso zzso zzso was a very strong zzso of zzso production by zzso and also elevated zzso zzso zzso The amount of zzso protein production induced by zzso was zzso greater than that induced by zzso zzso of zzso Moreover, the response to zzso as well as to other zzso agents such as zzso and zzso was observed under conditions that were not associated with mast cell zzso zzso expressed substantial levels of the zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso when examined by flow zzso In contrast to other reported zzso effects on mast cells, zzso production occurred via zzso of the zzso zzso These data suggest a role for human mast cells as a potent source of zzso in the absence of zzso and may provide new opportunities to regulate zzso at mast zzso zzso
