The informational spectrum method zzso is a virtual zzso method for the fast analysis of potential zzso zzso By applying the zzso approach to the zzso protein database the vascular proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso Located zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified as additional anthrax PA zzso interacting zzso This virtual molecular interaction was formally proven by solid phase zzso using zzso zzso The interaction is independent of the presence of zzso zzso and does not involve PA zzso zzso at zzso a critical zzso in zzso zzso In fact, the zzso point zzso fully prevented the cell intoxication ability of PA in the presence of zzso zzso but it was fully ineffective on the binding of zzso PA to zzso and zzso The zzso approach also led to the identification of the potential interaction sites between PA and zzso A PA zzso with a deletion at zzso zzso and solid phase zzso interaction studies as well as deletion zzso of zzso confirmed the hypothesized interaction zzso Our findings imply that the zzso surface zzso interaction is not likely to provide the full explanation for the vascular zzso and prominent zzso that follow zzso zzso infection and spreading and call into play vascular associated proteins such as zzso as potential zzso zzso
