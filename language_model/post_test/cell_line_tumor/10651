Increased numbers of mast cells is a typical feature of a variety of human zzso The major zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso type of mast cells, zzso zzso zzso and zzso may be involved in zzso cell zzso zzso zzso by inducing zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso The objective of this study was to analyze zzso whether zzso mast cells as well as zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso are present in the zzso cervical zzso In addition, the effect of zzso and zzso on zzso cervical SCC cell lines was studied in zzso Here we report that zzso and zzso mast cells are present in significant numbers in the zzso zzso of SCC zzso Also, weak zzso zzso is observed in the SCC zzso but only zzso in zzso cervical specimens with zzso zzso In cell cultures, especially zzso but not zzso was shown to induce effective detachment of viable, growing and zzso zzso SCC cells from zzso zzso also detached viable zzso SCC cells from zzso as well as zzso zzso In contrast, normal zzso underwent zzso cell death after similar prolonged zzso zzso No zzso of zzso was detected by zzso cell zzso nor did these cells express marked zzso zzso zzso mast cells containing zzso and zzso are present in the zzso zzso of zzso cervical SCC and the zzso cells are only zzso zzso for the zzso inhibitor zzso It is zzso that appears to be capable of inducing effective detachment of viable and growing SCC cells and therefore, it may release SCC cells from a tumor leading to spreading of zzso zzso
