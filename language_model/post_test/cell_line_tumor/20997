zzso acid, the major active ingredient of zzso has been shown to exhibit zzso activity both in zzso and in zzso However, its potential activity in tumor zzso remains zzso In the present study, we found that zzso acid strongly inhibited the zzso of highly zzso mouse melanoma zzso cells in zzso zzso acid also exhibited significant zzso activity on the development of in zzso artificial zzso zzso following tail vein zzso injection of the zzso melanoma tumor cells in zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis and Western zzso showed that zzso acid inhibited the cell surface expression of zzso zzso while exhibited negligible effects on the expression of zzso and zzso zzso Thus we concluded for the first time that zzso acid could inhibit the zzso and migration of zzso cells in zzso and in zzso in which zzso of zzso zzso expression was zzso
