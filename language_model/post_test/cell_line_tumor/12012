In plasma membrane zzso research, contamination of the isolated plasma membrane fraction with proteins from other zzso is still a zzso Even if highly specific isolation methods are used, such as density zzso zzso combined with selective zzso zzso proteins cannot be completely zzso To solve this problem, a protocol for the isolation of highly pure plasma membrane zzso from rat liver and two different zzso zzso cell lines was zzso zzso beads with immobilized zzso against highly expressed membrane proteins were used for specific binding of membrane zzso and their separation from other zzso zzso plasma zzso were further selectively zzso with different zzso and analyzed by use of different methods, such as Western zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and further selective zzso was validated by use of zzso against the marker integral plasma membrane protein zzso zzso cell zzso zzso 1, and identification of isolated proteins by zzso The method presented here zzso contamination with other zzso and enables further identification of membrane zzso
