The human toll like zzso 9 zzso detects differences between microbial and host DNA, based on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso of both innate and zzso immune zzso The synthetic zzso zzso zzso can substitute for microbial DNA in these responses, and is in clinical trials as an zzso agent in diseases as diverse as infections, cancer and allergic zzso Human zzso is expressed on cells of zzso origin zzso zzso zzso cells and B zzso but has also been described as being expressed on a number of other cell zzso In order to clarify the expression and function of zzso in a range of cells of both zzso and zzso origin, we investigated the level of expression of zzso zzso and the ability of the cells to respond to zzso by zzso of cell surface zzso zzso production, cellular proliferation and zzso of zzso Our data show that the cellular response to zzso depended on a threshold level of expression of zzso zzso was widely expressed amongst B cell zzso (with the exception of myeloma cell zzso but we did not find either threshold levels of expression of zzso or responses to zzso in several myeloma or zzso zzso cell lines or any zzso zzso cell lines tested in our zzso zzso cells varied significantly in their responses to zzso and the level of zzso expression beyond the threshold did not correlate with the magnitude of the response to zzso Finally, zzso induced zzso zzso and increased cellular proliferation in zzso cells that had been zzso zzso with zzso but did not affect the expression of surface markers or synthesis of zzso zzso or zzso Thus both zzso and zzso cells expressing appropriate levels of zzso respond to zzso but the nature of the zzso response is dependent on cell zzso
