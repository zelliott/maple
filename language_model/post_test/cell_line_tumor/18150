The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso signaling protein 3 zzso exerts zzso effects in aggressive inflammatory breast zzso Loss of zzso is associated with poorly differentiated zzso and increased zzso Here, we show that reduction of zzso expression occurs in zzso of invasive breast zzso and is associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, low zzso expression in invasive zzso tissue samples zzso with reduced expression of zzso In zzso zzso interference zzso of zzso in two benign human zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso decreased expression of zzso protein and zzso and reduced activity of the zzso zzso this reduction was dependent on intact zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells resulted in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Snail and zzso and enhanced their recruitment and binding to the zzso promoter as analyzed by zzso zzso zzso Small interfering zzso zzso of zzso or Snail blocked the zzso of zzso caused by zzso zzso These data show, for the first time, that zzso expression is reduced or lost in a substantial number of invasive breast zzso and that zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso Together, our results lead to a new hypothesis that Snail and zzso are downstream of zzso and play a critical role in zzso regulation of zzso in breast zzso
