zzso zzso factor zzso zzso protein has been investigated in many kinds of solid tumors due to its potent zzso zzso However, the complexity of protein zzso instability of zzso protein and requirement of repeated injections are obstacles for the zzso zzso therapy for solid zzso We successfully zzso zzso zzso and zzso which was coupled with a zzso zzso zzso a special zzso for zzso zzso zzso as the vehicle for zzso gene therapy in this zzso In zzso the competitive binding zzso showed that zzso contributed to the enhanced gene zzso efficiency of zzso in human zzso vein zzso cells zzso zzso gene delivered by zzso apparently suppressed growth of tumor with a zzso reduction and decreased zzso density in nude mice bearing zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso tumors from zzso zzso mice expressed more zzso than that of the control zzso Our study demonstrated that zzso transported the zzso gene into zzso cells more efficiently than zzso resulting in more effective zzso effects on tumor growth by zzso zzso for the first time, we have explored an effective zzso vehicle for zzso gene therapy by targeting zzso zzso
