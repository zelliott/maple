We previously demonstrated that zzso zzso was an efficient zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Here, we deeply dissect the mechanisms underlying the ability of zzso to cause zzso In particular, we demonstrate that zzso increases zzso oxygen consumption of isolated zzso and that this phenomenon is associated with zzso production and insensitive to zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso behaves as an zzso and this property is also confirmed in cell zzso zzso zzso cells show: zzso an early loss of zzso zzso zzso zzso a decrease in the expression levels of respiratory complex components and zzso a significant zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso energetic impairment zzso by zzso in zzso is confirmed by experiments carried out with zzso cells, or by zzso zzso where cell death is significantly zzso Moreover, gastric and zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells, which rely most of their zzso production on zzso zzso show a marked sensitivity toward zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso which is activated by events increasing the zzso zzso ratio, is deeply involved in the zzso process because the zzso of its zzso form completely zzso cell zzso Upon zzso zzso zzso is not zzso confirming its role as zzso zzso that positively responds to zzso energetic impairment by committing cells to zzso Overall, data obtained indicate that zzso behaves as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso oxygen species zzso This event results in zzso dysfunction and zzso decrease, which in turn triggers zzso zzso
