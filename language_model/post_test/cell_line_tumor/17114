zzso producing gastric cancer zzso rarely occurs, but it is classified as a special zzso of gastric cancer zzso This zzso as represented by the production of zzso exhibits not only specific function but also different zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso it is likely to zzso to the liver and, as a consequence, poor prognosis is recognized as one of the zzso Recently, AT motif binding zzso zzso was identified as a zzso of zzso production by zzso zzso and the decreased expression of the protein was also reported in zzso However, little is known about the biological significance of the decreased zzso In this study, to clarify the biological characteristics of zzso zzso was raised against zzso and zzso was carried zzso The zzso specifically recognized zzso and the degree of expression could be characterized by zzso zzso was expressed in zzso and the area of zzso zzso components of zzso On the other hand, the expression pattern varied in the zzso zzso components of zzso and zzso was expressed in the area without zzso zzso Taken together, these results zzso the previous reports that zzso regulated zzso expression and inhibited zzso Furthermore, in terms of differentiation zzso zzso expression was decreased in the areas with little zzso zzso This may suggest that zzso expression of zzso zzso the expression of various factors that are otherwise zzso and that this somehow determines the biological features of zzso
