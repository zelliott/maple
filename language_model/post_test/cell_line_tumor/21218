The purpose of this study was to develop a zzso iron oxide zzso zzso probe for PET and zzso scans of tumor zzso zzso zzso 

zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso using a zzso method, and particle size and magnetic properties were zzso A phantom study was used to assess the efficacy of zzso as a zzso zzso contrast zzso zzso zzso with surface zzso groups were coupled to zzso zzso zzso peptides for zzso zzso targeting and zzso zzso acid zzso zzso for PET after labeling with zzso zzso zzso zzso were further tested in zzso and in zzso to determine zzso targeting efficacy and feasibility for dual zzso 

zzso zzso made by zzso reaction have a core size of 5 zzso with a zzso diameter of 45 zzso 10 zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso is about 117 zzso of iron, and the measured zzso and zzso are zzso and zzso zzso zzso A displacement competitive binding zzso indicates that zzso zzso bound specifically to zzso zzso in zzso Both zzso PET and zzso zzso show zzso delivery of zzso zzso zzso and prominent zzso system zzso 

We have successfully developed an zzso zzso for simultaneous dual PET and zzso of tumor zzso zzso The success of this zzso imaging approach may allow for earlier tumor detection with a high degree of accuracy and provide further insight into the molecular mechanisms of zzso
