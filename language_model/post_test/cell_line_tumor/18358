zzso is a zzso zzso which has been implicated in zzso zzso of zzso zzso in prostate cancer zzso Here, we present the evidence that two zzso zzso zzso and zzso are involved in this zzso We showed that zzso is expressed in all prostate cancer cell lines zzso Both the expression level and the zzso activity of zzso are regulated by zzso in these zzso Furthermore, we showed that zzso downstream zzso zzso zzso can induce zzso zzso of zzso which is correlated with its zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso 218 in the zzso loop results in reduced zzso activity of zzso Interestingly, zzso can also be activated by zzso when they are zzso in prostate cancer cells, suggesting a possible positive feedback loop between zzso and zzso It appears that both zzso and zzso are required for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in prostate cancer cells because zzso of the zzso form of either zzso or zzso dramatically blocks the zzso zzso zzso of the two zzso together but neither one alone is sufficient to activate zzso zzso Taken together, our data suggest a zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso signaling and provide new insights into zzso zzso of zzso zzso in prostate cancer zzso
