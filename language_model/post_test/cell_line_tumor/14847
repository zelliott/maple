Human class I alcohol zzso 2 zzso zzso by the zzso zzso have large differences in kinetic zzso however, individuals inheriting the zzso for the different zzso exhibit only small differences in alcohol elimination zzso This suggests that other cellular factors must regulate the activity of the zzso 

The activity of the zzso expressed from zzso zzso and zzso zzso was examined in zzso zzso zzso cell lines, including lines which expressed human low zzso zzso zzso zzso The ability of the cells to metabolize ethanol was compared with that of zzso cells expressing rat class I alcohol zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rat zzso zzso cells, and rat zzso 

The zzso had similar protein zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, and zzso zzso cells oxidized ethanol much faster than the cells expressing the zzso zzso This was not explained by high cellular zzso levels or zzso zzso but rather because the activity of the zzso and zzso zzso was constrained by the zzso of zzso as shown by the increased rate of ethanol zzso by cell lines expressing zzso zzso plus zzso 

The activity of the human zzso zzso zzso is sensitive to zzso by zzso which likely limits its activity in zzso This study emphasizes the importance of maintaining a low zzso zzso concentration in zzso during ethanol zzso
