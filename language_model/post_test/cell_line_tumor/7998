The zzso zzso is complex, resulting from the zzso of multiple zzso zzso that lead to the deregulation of growth regulatory and cell fate controlling activities and zzso The ability to dissect this complexity, so as to reveal discrete aspects of the biology underlying the zzso zzso is critical to understanding the various mechanisms of disease as well as to reveal opportunities for novel therapeutic zzso Previous work has characterized the process of zzso growth of cancer cells in zzso as a key aspect of the tumor zzso particularly with respect to zzso zzso Nevertheless, it remains a major challenge to translate these cell biology findings into the context of human zzso We previously used DNA zzso zzso to develop expression signatures, which have the capacity to identify subtle distinctions in biological states and can be used to connect in zzso and in zzso zzso Here we describe the development of a signature of zzso growth, show that the signature exhibits characteristics of zzso zzso function and then demonstrate that the signature identifies human tumors with the potential for zzso
