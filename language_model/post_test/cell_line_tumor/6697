zzso zzso 3) in the skin is important for skin moisture as demonstrated by the studies of zzso mice, which have accelerated skin zzso Prevention of dry skin is important not only from a zzso but also from a clinical point of zzso zzso zzso cultures are cumbersome for screening substances that zzso zzso zzso 

A human zzso cell line was found to express zzso zzso and zzso which responded to zzso stimulation with zzso suggesting that the zzso expression is normally regulated in this cell zzso This cell line also expressed the type 1 zzso zzso zzso The zzso expression was unaffected by zzso acid up to zzso zzso Similarly, the zzso acid did not increase the zzso expression up to zzso concentration in rat zzso 

This cell line is useful for the screening of candidate substances that zzso zzso zzso
