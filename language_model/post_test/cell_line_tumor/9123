Generation of zzso oxygen species zzso has been observed in cancer cells treated with zzso but the underlying mechanisms and therapeutic implications remain zzso In the present study, we showed that zzso promoted zzso generation through enhancing the activity of zzso zzso zzso associated with plasma zzso Treatment of breast cancer cells caused an increased zzso of zzso a positive regulatory protein of zzso to the membrane zzso The zzso zzso generation occurred rapidly within several hours of drug exposure, with zzso and zzso zzso mainly outside the cells while the zzso zzso remained zzso zzso the increase in zzso zzso caused lethal damage to the bystander cancer cells not exposed to zzso as shown by two different methods using zzso systems where the bystander cells were differentiated from the zzso cells by fluorescent or radioactive zzso This zzso bystander effect was also observed with other zzso agents zzso and zzso but not with zzso or zzso This toxic bystander effect was enhanced by zzso that converts zzso to zzso and was abolished by a zzso that eliminates zzso Furthermore, zzso was able to induce an almost complete zzso of proliferation of the bystander cells in the zzso zzso Our study revealed a novel mechanism by which zzso zzso toxic bystander effect through generation of zzso zzso from the zzso zzso This may contribute to the potent zzso activity of zzso and provide a novel basis to improve the clinical use of this important zzso
