Acute leukemia is a zzso zzso zzso stem cell zzso In the current study, we examined the effects of zzso 5 on acute zzso leukemia cells in zzso and in zzso We also explored the mechanisms and pathways underlying the increase in zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso 5 inhibited the growth of primary acute zzso leukemia cells and zzso cells in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso 5 also induced an increase in zzso and a decrease in the zzso membrane potential zzso in zzso zzso zzso electron zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso cells displayed typical zzso characteristics zzso zzso zzso and formation of zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso 5 increased the expression of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and slightly increased zzso zzso zzso 5 also significantly decreased zzso expression and significantly increased the expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso 9 and zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso 5 in zzso cells was inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso (a specific zzso 9 zzso In addition, the zzso zzso significantly affected the expression of zzso zzso 9, whereas zzso had little effect on the expression of zzso The results suggest that zzso is located upstream of zzso 9 in this zzso signaling zzso These novel findings provide zzso insight into the induction of zzso by zzso 5 and might facilitate the development of clinical strategies to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of treatments for acute zzso zzso
