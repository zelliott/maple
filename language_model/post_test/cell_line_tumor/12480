zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that is zzso in various tumors, and high levels of zzso have been associated with poor prognosis of cancer zzso In patients with head and neck cancer, high zzso plasma levels have been associated with poor prognosis following zzso Since little is known about the relationship between zzso expression and zzso we investigated the cellular and radiation induced effects of zzso zzso in human zzso breast cancer zzso 

zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso and zzso after 24 zzso To verify the zzso zzso we measured the zzso zzso and protein levels using zzso and Western zzso zzso Furthermore, the functional effects of zzso zzso were studied by zzso to assess zzso survival, migration and induction of zzso 

Treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso resulted in an zzso decrease in the zzso zzso level and in a decrease in zzso zzso protein zzso zzso reduced zzso survival to zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased the migration rate to zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso Combination of zzso zzso and zzso at 2 zzso resulted in a further reduction of zzso survival to zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased the migration rate to zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso caused a weak zzso with an enhancement factor of zzso at 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso and a dose zzso factor zzso of zzso 

Our results suggest that an zzso zzso improves zzso effects in zzso zzso zzso zzso seems to be an attractive target to improve the effectiveness of zzso
