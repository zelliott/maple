zzso and zzso are very common zzso in biomedical zzso Blood flow at zzso zzso has different characteristics from that at zzso because of the zzso properties of zzso Using a zzso zzso system, we investigated the zzso of red blood cells zzso and cancer cells in zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso and cancer cells was strongly zzso at zzso and zzso whilst the zzso of zzso particles in pure water were almost zzso The zzso layer disappeared on the inner wall of the zzso but increased in size on the inner wall of the zzso Cancer cells frequently zzso to the inner wall of the zzso but rarely to other zzso Because the wall surface coating and the wall zzso stress were almost zzso for the zzso and the zzso the result indicates that not only chemical mediation and wall zzso stress but also zzso zzso play important roles in the zzso of cancer cells to the zzso zzso These results provide the fundamental basis for a better understanding of blood flow and cell zzso in biomedical zzso
