zzso zzso zzso is the most common and zzso form of primary brain tumors in zzso Small molecular magnetic resonance imaging zzso contrast agents are used for zzso zzso However, conventional contrast agents have several limitations, such as low zzso zzso short circulation half lives and absence of tumor zzso zzso we develop an zzso zzso labeled with zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso imaging of zzso The preparation of zzso starts with zzso zzso zzso core, followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The obtained zzso has improved zzso stability and reduced zzso compared with the zzso core zzso Meanwhile, zzso shows strong zzso zzso in zzso region and three times enhancement of zzso zzso over zzso zzso Due to the recognition between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso specifically binds to zzso cells, as evidenced by zzso zzso and zzso by zzso Furthermore, zzso demonstrates a preferential retention in subcutaneous zzso tumor zzso as shown in both in zzso zzso zzso imaging studies and ex zzso zzso zzso zzso with numerous zzso zzso and zzso contrast enhancing zzso is promising for MR imaging of zzso and zzso the tumor boundary before zzso In addition, zzso zzso characteristic of zzso zzso its potential zzso use for zzso tumor zzso
