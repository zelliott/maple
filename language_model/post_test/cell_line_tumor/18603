A series of zzso and zzso derivatives of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso formulated as zzso (R zzso Me, zzso zzso Ph or zzso L zzso zzso or zzso along with their corresponding zzso complexes zzso have been prepared and characterized by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso analysis, and melting zzso In addition, zzso X-ray zzso analyses were carried out for zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso which show coordination structures intermediate between distorted zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso are zzso coordinated by the oxygen zzso the zzso oxygen atom is further away from the metal center than the other oxygen zzso The complexes are stable zzso zzso most of them are soluble not only in zzso zzso but also in alcohols and zzso zzso In polar zzso the zzso complexes gradually decompose into the corresponding zzso complex zzso The complexes exhibit in zzso zzso activities (against a series of human tumor cell zzso which, in some cases, are identical to, or even higher than, that of zzso For the zzso complexes, the activity increases with the length of the carbon chain of the zzso zzso and is higher in the case of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso complex displays a high in zzso activity against zzso liver and zzso gastric tumors, and has a relatively low zzso
