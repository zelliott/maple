The zzso zzso zzso B zzso survival signaling is very important for cancer cell survival and zzso zzso active zzso zzso signaling in small cell lung cancer zzso is a major factor for the survival of zzso zzso zzso of this signaling zzso would be potential zzso agents, particularly for zzso Here we report that zzso which has been used as a classic delta zzso zzso inhibited growth and induced zzso in the three characteristic zzso cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso zzso treatment reduced zzso zzso of zzso on zzso zzso and zzso 308 in zzso We found that the levels of zzso zzso of zzso on zzso zzso correlate with the sensitivity of the three cell lines to zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso treatment not only reduced the zzso of the zzso upstream zzso zzso zzso but also its downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso DNA array analysis of 205 zzso genes indicated that some zzso genes were either zzso or zzso by zzso zzso zzso and microscopic analyses clearly showed that zzso induced zzso in zzso zzso zzso interference experiments confirmed that zzso cell death was associated with the zzso survival zzso Together, these results show that zzso is a new inhibitor of the zzso signaling pathway, suggesting that zzso could be a potential lead for the development of a new type of zzso that target the zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso
