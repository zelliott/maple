Most cancer cells are zzso which could be caused by defects in zzso segregation zzso zzso zzso are components of the nuclear pore complex, which is essential for nuclear transport during zzso but several zzso are also known to be involved in zzso zzso Here we report a novel function of zzso one of the zzso regulating zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso poles during zzso through the zzso region of zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso fail to align to the zzso plate, which causes zzso arrest due to the zzso assembly zzso Both the middle and the zzso regions were required for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso attaching to zzso were hardly formed in zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso interacts with zzso which plays an instrumental role in focusing zzso at zzso and zzso zzso to zzso poles is zzso in zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso promotes zzso alignment through zzso formation and recruitment of zzso to zzso zzso
