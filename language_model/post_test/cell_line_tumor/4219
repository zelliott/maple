zzso zzso play important roles in regulating gene expression of plants, animals and zzso Comprehensive characterization of host and viral zzso will help uncover the molecular mechanisms that zzso the progression of human zzso zzso zzso zzso To investigate the zzso expression profile of zzso and host cells during zzso infection, we performed zzso analysis of the small zzso isolated from zzso and zzso human zzso leukemia cell line, zzso 

We established a zzso zzso infection cell model using the zzso zzso zzso sequencing technology was used to sequence small zzso libraries of the zzso and zzso zzso and to investigate their small zzso zzso We found eight zzso including zzso zzso and zzso that were expressed by zzso during zzso zzso The expressions of the host zzso were also affected by zzso zzso zzso At least 49 cellular zzso were zzso zzso 39 were zzso and 10 were zzso upon zzso zzso zzso The expression of the human zzso zzso was significantly zzso in the zzso zzso infection zzso In addition, we found 14 cellular novel zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the target genes of the zzso expressed zzso suggested that the majority of the genes are involved in zzso pathways in cancer, zzso and zzso signaling zzso 

The small zzso zzso obtained in this study demonstrate the usefulness of the zzso combined with zzso approach in understanding of the expression and function of host and viral small zzso in zzso zzso zzso This approach can also be applied to the study of other kinds of zzso
