zzso an zzso extracted from a Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso has exhibited zzso and zzso abilities against various types of cancer zzso This study aims to investigate its zzso activity and underlying mechanisms in human pancreatic cancer cells in zzso and in zzso Human zzso and zzso pancreatic cancer cells, and human zzso liver cells were incubated with zzso at different zzso Cell viability was assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso by flow zzso zzso zzso zzso tumors were established in nude zzso mice, and zzso was zzso zzso zzso The tumors were monitored and zzso zzso sections were zzso with an zzso zzso zzso to examine cell zzso or stained with terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso labeling zzso to evaluate in zzso cell zzso The expression of zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso and several zzso proteins in cells and tumor zzso were evaluated by Western zzso zzso In in zzso zzso zzso inhibited cell viability by zzso the expression of zzso and induced cell zzso by reducing the ratio of zzso zzso zzso and increasing zzso of zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso Administration of zzso inhibited tumor growth in a zzso manner, and regulated zzso gene expression consistent with the in zzso zzso But zzso had no significant effects on the viability of zzso cells or the zzso of mice compared to zzso These results indicate zzso may be a potential and promising agent of natural resource to treat pancreatic zzso
