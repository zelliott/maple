In the mouse zzso and zzso embryonic stem cells, the zzso zzso and zzso lineages are derived from zzso zzso zzso Here, we report that surface expression of zzso zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso can be used to zzso the zzso cells in zzso zzso bodies at day zzso into populations that develop into distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso potential was restricted to the zzso population, while the zzso zzso population displayed only primitive zzso zzso The zzso population contained zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso expression zzso zzso zzso populations in mouse zzso at days zzso zzso and zzso and is a marker of zzso stage primitive zzso These findings identify zzso as a useful tool for separating distinct zzso zzso
