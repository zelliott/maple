zzso are the most abundant zzso cells, which provide zzso support for zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of natural origin, known to exhibit zzso potential via zzso of zzso zzso This study was carried out to explore the effect of zzso on zzso zzso The cell line zzso derived from rat zzso cells represents zzso zzso zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso 1 and 10 zzso for 4 zzso The effect of zzso was studied on cell survival zzso reduction and zzso zzso free zzso zzso and zzso and DNA damage zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso cell zzso and zzso cell death was evaluated by expression of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso The treatment with zzso resulted in decreased cell survival and increased free radical zzso zzso nuclear zzso and DNA damage were evident following zzso treatment in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso elevated expression of zzso and zzso that indicates zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso We further studied the effect of zzso an zzso on the observed toxic zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly suppressed zzso induced zzso effects in zzso zzso zzso effects of zzso suggest that free zzso play a major role in zzso induced zzso zzso and cellular toxicity leading to zzso of zzso zzso
