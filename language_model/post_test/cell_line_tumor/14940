We present a zzso imaging method to analyze polarity in zzso prostate zzso cells that form polarized zzso with zzso under standard zzso zzso culture zzso The first event in zzso zzso is loss of zzso followed by uncontrolled proliferation leading to zzso We demonstrate that it is possible to use optical signatures to discriminate zzso objects with distinct zzso in a large field of zzso The three metrics we present here are designed as image processing tools to discriminate zzso from zzso without any zzso zzso To demonstrate that our zzso imaging platform may be used to study the zzso organization of zzso cells, we analyzed and zzso the zzso of dynamic zzso zzso the polarity of zzso and the merging of polarized structures, upon transforming growth factor zzso zzso zzso addition to the culture zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso cell culture provides an innovative tool to study zzso tissue zzso in a large field of view and to zzso the regulation of growth, zzso and differentiation in normal and zzso human prostate zzso Moreover, such zzso would be a powerful tool to follow cancer progression and to evaluate zzso zzso
