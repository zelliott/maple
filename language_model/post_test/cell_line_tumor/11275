zzso is a naturally occurring zzso zzso in the zzso zzso that exhibits an extensive repertoire of biological zzso An increasing number of studies indicate that zzso protects normal cells, while it reducing cancer cell zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of zzso on the growth of the human leukemia cells and found that it efficiently reduced the number of cells in a zzso and zzso zzso Thus, incubation with the zzso increased the percentage of cells with a zzso DNA content, zzso the number of zzso zzso cells, and also provoked zzso changes that are features of zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso and zzso were quickly activated zzso The increase in the activity of these zzso was associated with zzso of the zzso factor zzso and also with the release of zzso c from zzso zzso of the cells with the general zzso inhibitor zzso reduced zzso zzso but it did not block cell death suggesting that zzso activates an alternative cell death zzso in the absence of zzso zzso Thus, the zzso of zzso was preceded by a fast zzso increase in zzso oxygen species zzso zzso and zzso A reduced the levels of zzso zzso by zzso indicating that the complex I and the complex III of the zzso electron transport chain are important sources of these chemical zzso However, the role of zzso in zzso cell death remains elusive because zzso that were shown to decrease zzso levels zzso zzso and zzso were unable to abrogate zzso cell zzso
