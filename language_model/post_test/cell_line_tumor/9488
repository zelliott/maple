zzso zzso zzso zzso which have been used to treat zzso patients since the mid 1990s, have been shown to zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso Because this zzso is frequently activated in human zzso and associated with resistance to zzso radiation, we investigated and confirmed that zzso could zzso zzso However, the mechanism underlying this zzso was zzso prompting the investigations in this zzso In this paper we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso leads to zzso zzso stress with zzso of zzso zzso which triggers the unfolded protein response zzso As part of the zzso the alpha zzso of zzso translation initiation factor 2 zzso is zzso resulting in a decrease in global protein synthesis and induction of the feedback regulator growth arrest and DNA zzso protein zzso which acts as a zzso in complex with protein zzso zzso This complex zzso zzso however, our data also suggest that this zzso activity can zzso zzso Furthermore, our data indicate that zzso decreases zzso zzso by triggering this zzso These findings may have important implications in understanding how zzso may increase radiation sensitivity and also result in zzso of the zzso zzso
