Despite promising initial results, recent Phase III trials of the selective zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso Wilmington, zzso in advanced head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso have been zzso zzso zzso an zzso target zzso is frequently zzso in zzso has been implicated in its zzso and is strongly associated with poor prognosis in this zzso zzso we examined the relationship between zzso zzso D1 expression and sensitivity to zzso to determine whether this frequently occurring zzso change affected the cellular response to zzso 

A panel of six zzso zzso cell lines was used to correlate zzso gene copy number, zzso D1 zzso and response to zzso The effect of zzso zzso of zzso D1 was assessed by establishing zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso 

Three of six cell lines displayed zzso D1 amplification and/or zzso and these cell lines were resistant to zzso SCC 9 clones zzso zzso D1 continued to zzso and maintained their zzso fraction when treated with zzso whereas empty zzso control clones and the parental SCC 9 cells were profoundly inhibited and displayed marked reductions in zzso The resistance of zzso zzso clones and zzso zzso cell lines was associated with maintenance of zzso D1 expression after zzso zzso 

These data suggest that zzso zzso D1 zzso may be associated with resistance of zzso to zzso zzso zzso the role of zzso D1 as a marker of therapeutic response and its utility as a zzso marker in zzso warrant additional zzso
