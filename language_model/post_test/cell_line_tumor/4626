Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated the role of zzso zzso as important zzso of T cell zzso and zzso as one mechanism by which tumors evade immune zzso In this study, we report that zzso zzso by zzso inflammatory cells and/or genetically modified tumors zzso zzso zzso levels, which leads to T cell death and immune zzso The conversion of zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso clones to lines that can induce T cell death requires 3-5 days of zzso zzso a time frame zzso that needed for zzso to stimulate zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso tumor cell lines permanently zzso with the zzso zzso are similarly toxic for T zzso which zzso with their zzso elevated levels of zzso zzso increases zzso zzso expression by enhancing the zzso levels zzso its synthetic zzso zzso zzso as demonstrated by both zzso and Southern zzso The contribution of zzso zzso to zzso T cell death was supported by the finding that zzso zzso significantly blocked T cell zzso zzso by zzso tumor cells, and by the observation that small interfering zzso directed against zzso zzso zzso zzso expression by zzso zzso diminished its zzso zzso and inhibited its zzso for T zzso Our results indicate that zzso signaling promotes zzso killing of T cells by stimulating the acquisition of a distinct zzso assembly in zzso tumor zzso
