zzso zzso zzso interacts with the zzso zzso zzso to ensure completion of zzso DNA zzso zzso also interacts with the zzso zzso to control zzso of 3' zzso during repair of zzso breaks zzso Here we describe the identification of human zzso a scaffold for DNA repair zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso show zzso zzso activity toward Holliday junctions and zzso activity toward other zzso DNA zzso Furthermore, zzso enhances the zzso activity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso with a role in processing zzso zzso cells depleted of zzso are hypersensitive to zzso that cause zzso and show defects in the resolution of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso causes a decrease in zzso zzso zzso These data show that zzso is a regulator of zzso zzso and that zzso and zzso are important regulators of zzso stability in human zzso
