The imaging potential of a new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its selectivity for zzso acid zzso zzso were investigated in zzso and by imaging of human zzso zzso 

zzso of members of the system L zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2) zzso acid zzso zzso were assessed by quantitative real-time zzso in four human zzso models, including zzso zzso cell zzso zzso prostate cancer, and Colo 205 and zzso zzso cancer zzso The first investigations for the characterization of zzso were in zzso zzso studies by comparing it with zzso zzso and in zzso by PET zzso In addition, the specific involvement of zzso zzso in zzso zzso was tested by zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso To determine the zzso activity in zzso zzso ex zzso zzso zzso was used as a zzso 

zzso cells showed the highest zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso followed by Colo zzso zzso and zzso A similar pattern of retention was observed with zzso zzso retention was strongly correlated with zzso expression both in zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso inhibited zzso zzso demonstrating a clear dependence on this zzso for zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso mirrored cellular zzso 

The zzso properties of zzso make this zzso a promising imaging probe for detection of zzso as well as for the zzso evaluation and monitoring of zzso zzso
