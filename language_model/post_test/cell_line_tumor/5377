To investigate the zzso of three C2 zzso zzso from zzso zzso on the cell growth and cell cycle of human lung cancer zzso zzso 

zzso cells were exposed to three zzso zzso zzso of different zzso zzso 10, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100 zzso zzso for 48 zzso After 48 zzso zzso zzso was used to evaluate the zzso effects of three zzso zzso zzso on the proliferation of the zzso zzso zzso growth phase zzso cells were treated with 47, 34, 60 zzso zzso zzso of three zzso zzso zzso respectively for 12, 24, 48 zzso then the changes of cell cycle were analyzed by flow zzso 

The three zzso zzso zzso could inhibit the growth of zzso cells in zzso manner and zzso is zzso 07 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The cell cycle analysis showed that zzso zzso and zzso zzso increased the percentage of zzso phase cells and decreased zzso and zzso cells while the proportion of cells in zzso was lower and in zzso phase the proportion was higher than control when the cells were cultivated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

Three zzso zzso zzso could inhibit the proliferation of zzso cells in zzso manner and the mechanism may be related to its arresting the cell zzso
