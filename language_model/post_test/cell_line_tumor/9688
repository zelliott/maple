To explore the role of a novel zzso zzso 1 zzso in cancer zzso small interference zzso zzso was used to zzso the zzso and the cells were subjected to in zzso cell migration and invasion zzso zzso of zzso significantly inhibited cell migration and invasion in breast cancer cell line zzso The zzso caused no changes in cell growth but affected zzso zzso In zzso zzso decreased zzso in zzso cells were in zzso associated with the zzso decreased zzso zzso Further, treatment of zzso a general zzso scavenger, blunted the zzso and zzso of zzso cells, similar to the effect of zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso zzso breast cancer cell migration and invasion through a mechanism that involves the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
