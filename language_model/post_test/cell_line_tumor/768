We analyzed the expression of zzso H in human blood zzso using a novel zzso zzso raised against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso H was easily detected in zzso peripheral blood zzso cells, due to its high zzso expression in zzso natural killer zzso cells, whereas zzso B was less zzso The zzso zzso cell lines, zzso and Lopez, also expressed high zzso H zzso zzso zzso and particularly zzso T cells expressed far lower levels of zzso H than zzso cells, and various agents that classically induce T cell zzso zzso and enhanced zzso B expression failed to induce zzso H expression in T zzso Also, zzso H was not detected in zzso T cells, zzso or zzso There was a good correlation between zzso and protein expression in cells that zzso both zzso B and zzso suggesting that zzso gene zzso is regulated similarly to zzso Overall, our data indicate that although the zzso and zzso genes are tightly linked, expression of the proteins is quite zzso in T and zzso zzso The finding that zzso H is frequently more abundant than zzso B in zzso cells is consistent with a role for zzso H in zzso the zzso function of zzso B in human zzso zzso
