The zzso zzso factor is a highly unstable zzso Several zzso zzso mediate zzso zzso However, zzso can be stabilized once it is zzso at the zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso or other protein zzso This zzso decreases zzso zzso and zzso The underlying mechanism for this phenomenon is still zzso Here, we show that zzso for activated zzso 1 zzso can bind with zzso and zzso zzso zzso to form a zzso When zzso is zzso at the zzso zzso is released from the complex and cannot be zzso by zzso which leads to increased stabilization and zzso of zzso These results reveal that zzso has a very important role in zzso by maintaining the stability of zzso that has been zzso at its zzso by zzso or other zzso
