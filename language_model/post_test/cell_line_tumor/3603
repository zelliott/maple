zzso zzso zzso mediates a downstream signal zzso zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso and plays an important role in survival and zzso of tumor zzso This study was designed to investigate regulation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso on proliferation and zzso of zzso cell line zzso 

zzso and zzso were zzso into zzso cells, 3 zzso zzso clones were randomly selected from each group, and amplified for further zzso The expression of zzso was detected by in zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso rate of zzso cells was evaluated by zzso zzso and zzso labeling index zzso zzso cell zzso was detected by zzso zzso 

zzso expression was significantly inhibited in zzso cells zzso with zzso while no significant change observed in zzso cells zzso with zzso Compared with parental zzso cells and zzso cells zzso with empty zzso the zzso survival rates of zzso cells zzso with zzso and zzso dramatically dropped to zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso cells zzso with zzso and zzso dropped to zzso and zzso lower than those of parental zzso cells zzso and zzso cells zzso with empty zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Nearly no zzso cells found in parental zzso cells or zzso cells zzso with empty zzso however, zzso indexes zzso of zzso cells zzso with zzso and zzso prominently increased to zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso on cell growth was statistically stronger than that of zzso zzso zzso while no difference was detected in zzso zzso and zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso may zzso proliferation and zzso of zzso cells, indicating that it may be a potential therapeutic target of gene therapy of zzso zzso
