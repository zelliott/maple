The Met zzso zzso zzso found to be zzso activated in many tumors, has become a leading target for cancer zzso zzso in Met zzso have been associated with aggressive tumor progression with several therapeutic strategies addressing this aspect of Met zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation, which zzso Met signaling via zzso Met zzso is a major negative regulator of Met zzso It is believed that one of the mechanisms by which the therapeutic zzso zzso induce cancer cell death in Met zzso tumors is via zzso and subsequent degradation of Met from the cell zzso However, a previously reported zzso zzso demonstrated intrinsic zzso activity while being capable of inducing zzso degradation of Met, suggesting that zzso degradation requires zzso zzso and zzso therapeutic zzso We have developed a potent and selective zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso Met degradation using an alternative regulator zzso In this report, we demonstrate that zzso mediates degradation of Met by zzso and this degradation does not require Met zzso Furthermore, zzso was able to zzso Met and dramatically inhibit growth of tumors with low or no zzso zzso as well as tumors with Met zzso 14 deletion that prevents Met binding to zzso In zzso we demonstrate the enhanced therapeutic potential of a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso a zzso zzso Met degradation zzso and thereby avoids the zzso that limits the effectiveness of previously reported zzso zzso
