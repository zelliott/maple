To observe the effect of zzso on the zzso zzso cells zzso zzso stem cells zzso and on zzso signaling pathway, and explore the feasibility of zzso as a novel therapeutic measure in zzso chemotherapy zzso 

OC and zzso were cultured in zzso zzso zzso was used to detect the expression of zzso and zzso in OC and zzso OC and zzso were treated with zzso in zzso of 0, 20, 50 and 100 zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used to detect the zzso zzso and zzso zzso was used to detect cell zzso and the cell zzso was observed under an zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso cellular spheres exhibited embryonic stem cell characteristics such as zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso was activated in the zzso and the expression of zzso zzso was higher in zzso zzso zzso zzso than that in zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso showed that the expression of zzso zzso was lower in zzso treated with 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than that with 0 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Cell counting zzso zzso zzso showed that the proliferation of OC treated with 20, 50 and 100 zzso zzso was significantly zzso compared with that with 0 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared with 0 zzso zzso the proliferation of zzso treated with 20 and 50 zzso zzso was not significantly inhibited zzso zzso zzso but that with 100 zzso zzso was significantly inhibited zzso zzso zzso The zzso microscopic observation revealed that zzso inhibited the formation of zzso zzso 

zzso can effectively inhibit cell proliferation and the ability of sphere formation of zzso It will provide a basis for a novel therapeutic approach in zzso chemotherapy zzso
