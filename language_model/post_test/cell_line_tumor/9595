The zzso growth factor zzso zzso is an integral regulator of many cellular zzso zzso also acts as a central zzso for zzso signals involving direct zzso of the zzso by zzso zzso or indirect zzso by G zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso We have previously shown that zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso as a result of transforming growth zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso Here we show that direct zzso of the zzso by zzso zzso produces a different pattern of zzso zzso zzso and downstream zzso zzso recruitment than zzso zzso of the zzso occurring via zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we demonstrate that this differential signaling and its consequences depend on zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus zzso zzso zzso zzso differential recruitment of signaling pathways involved in zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso Our findings zzso establish how divergent signaling outcomes can arise from the zzso of a single zzso
