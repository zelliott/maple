zzso zzso virus zzso infection is an important zzso factor in the development of several zzso including zzso zzso zzso The one zzso protein expressed in the nucleus of zzso cells, zzso has been shown to disrupt zzso leukemia zzso nuclear bodies zzso by inducing the degradation of zzso zzso leading to impaired DNA repair and increased cell zzso Although zzso zzso disruption is likely to be an important factor in the development of zzso little is known about its zzso We now show that an interaction between zzso and the host zzso zzso is crucial for zzso to disrupt zzso bodies and degrade zzso zzso zzso increases the association of zzso with zzso zzso thereby increasing the zzso of zzso proteins by zzso a modification that is known to trigger the zzso and degradation of zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso is direct and occurs through the zzso regulatory zzso of zzso and zzso zzso acids zzso to zzso The binding of zzso to the host zzso specific zzso zzso has also been shown to be important for zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso also increases the occupancy of zzso at zzso zzso and that zzso and zzso bind independently and simultaneously to zzso to form a zzso zzso The combined results indicate that zzso zzso two independent cellular pathways to trigger the loss of zzso zzso
