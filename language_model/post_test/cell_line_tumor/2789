zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso known to regulate multiple biological functions at the cell surface and within the zzso zzso Its functional activity can be modulated by zzso an zzso that zzso zzso zzso chains and whose expression has been associated with an aggressive zzso in many zzso In addition to zzso zzso by zzso its zzso zzso zzso zzso influences zzso location by zzso expression of zzso that accelerate its shedding from the cell zzso In the present study we discovered that zzso also alters the level of nuclear zzso Upon zzso of zzso expression or following addition of zzso zzso to myeloma cells, the nuclear zzso of zzso drops dramatically as revealed by zzso zzso western zzso and zzso by zzso This effect requires zzso active zzso because cells expressing high levels of zzso zzso inactive zzso failed to diminish zzso levels in the zzso Although zzso zzso function within the nucleus is not well zzso there is emerging evidence that it may act to repress zzso zzso The resulting changes in gene expression facilitated by the loss of nuclear zzso could explain how zzso enhances expression of zzso zzso tissue factor and perhaps other zzso that condition the tumor zzso to promote an aggressive cancer zzso
