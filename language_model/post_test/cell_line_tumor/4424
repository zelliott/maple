zzso of the zzso family are universal participate in multiple cellular zzso However, their exact role in the zzso of prion diseases remains zzso In this study, we proposed that human zzso was able to form molecular complex with zzso The zzso responsible for the interactions between zzso and zzso were mapped at the segments of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso within zzso and zzso zzso within zzso zzso modeling revealed that the key zzso zzso for molecular interaction were zzso and zzso in zzso as well as zzso in zzso zzso in these zzso zzso inhibited the interaction between the two proteins in zzso Our results also showed that zzso zzso encouraged zzso zzso formation, whereas zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso the mature zzso zzso in zzso Moreover, the zzso protein complexes were observed in the brain zzso of normal and zzso agent zzso infected zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was seen in the zzso of human zzso cell line zzso as well as human cervical cancer cell line zzso zzso expressing full-length human zzso Our current data suggest the zzso of zzso and zzso damage caused by zzso may be associated with their functions of zzso zzso zzso
