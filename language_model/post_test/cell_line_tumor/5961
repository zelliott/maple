In an attempt to develop potent and selective zzso agents, two novel series of zzso hybrids were zzso zzso and screened for their zzso activities against zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines in zzso Nearly all of the tested compounds showed significantly increased zzso activity compared with the corresponding zzso zzso Most of the title compounds displayed good selectivity toward zzso and zzso cell lines with zzso values ranging from zzso to zzso zzso Among them, the most promising compound zzso zzso range of zzso zzso was zzso to zzso more active than zzso zzso range of zzso zzso zzso
