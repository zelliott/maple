zzso acid zzso is a precursor in synthesis of zzso zzso used to sensitize tumor zzso in zzso therapy zzso It is administered zzso into a tumor which after the certain time, required for zzso to zzso is zzso with visible light from the proper source at established zzso Our main aim in the present study was to increase the penetration of zzso through the skin and other zzso by addition of zzso acid zzso to zzso on cell lines in zzso and on zzso We also applied zzso zzso with zzso acid to patients suffering from zzso cell zzso zzso In our study, we used zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso salt zzso and zzso together in one zzso zzso on zzso zzso We compared both therapeutic and zzso effects in zzso and in control group of zzso Our results showed that modification of zzso zzso by addition of zzso zzso caused that the treated zzso responded with rapid zzso In 12 patients with single zzso of SCC type subjected to zzso we observed zzso zzso of tumors following single or repeated zzso times zzso In zzso and in zzso in animals total zzso levels after addition of zzso zzso increased significantly ( zzso These results provide evidence that addition of zzso acid should be considered as the agent which enhances zzso penetration in zzso and thus increases the effectiveness of zzso zzso
