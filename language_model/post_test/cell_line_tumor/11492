In the current study, we aimed to understand the potential role of zzso repeats and zzso zzso 1 zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso We established zzso zzso clones zzso zzso which expressed low level of zzso but high levels of zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso by the targeted zzso interference zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, and the cells were resistant to zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso expressions, and cells were zzso to zzso Our data suggested zzso zzso target of zzso zzso zzso was important for zzso and zzso expressions in zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor and the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso expressions, both zzso also restored zzso sensitivity in zzso zzso Finally, zzso of zzso or zzso by targeted zzso zzso or by the corresponding inhibitor zzso zzso cells to zzso indicating that both zzso and zzso were important for zzso resistance in the resistant zzso zzso Based on these results, we concluded that zzso zzso zzso expression and the downstream signaling zzso interferes with zzso expressions and eventually zzso zzso cells to zzso
