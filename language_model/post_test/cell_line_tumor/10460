In this study, we tested the zzso activity of the dual zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso against gastric cancer in zzso and in zzso 

zzso cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso were incubated with zzso and assessed for cell zzso cell cycle, and zzso target zzso In zzso zzso nude mice were zzso with zzso zzso or zzso cells and treated daily with zzso zzso zzso zzso was measured via small animal zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso dose zzso decreased the cell viability of gastric cancer cell zzso The zzso activity of zzso was linked to a zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso treatment resulted in zzso target zzso as shown by zzso of zzso and zzso protein in all zzso zzso However, zzso treatment only inhibited tumor growth of zzso zzso whereas no zzso effect was observed in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso in zzso correlated with zzso of the proliferation marker zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was only significantly reduced in the zzso zzso zzso model as measured by zzso 

In conclusion, in zzso sensitivity of gastric cancer zzso to zzso did not correlate with in zzso zzso activity or in zzso zzso target zzso by zzso In contrast, zzso zzso was linked to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso PET imaging might qualify as a novel marker for zzso future clinical testing of dual zzso zzso
