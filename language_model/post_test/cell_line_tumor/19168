Human pancreatic tumor cells are highly resistant to both tumor necrosis factor zzso and to zzso zzso zzso expression has been proposed as a negative zzso marker in pancreatic zzso zzso Our approach was to zzso zzso expression on the surface of tumor cells as a therapeutic target employing zzso zzso composed of a single chain zzso zzso zzso targeting the zzso and the zzso zzso as the zzso zzso to deliver zzso directly to zzso pancreatic tumor zzso Using a panel of human pancreatic cell lines, which zzso zzso we evaluated the in zzso response of cells to zzso zzso zzso and a combination of zzso with various zzso zzso We found that all pancreatic cancer cell lines were highly resistant to the zzso effects of zzso and that zzso was highly zzso to zzso zzso pancreatic cancer cell lines at levels rivaling that of conventional zzso zzso Combination studies demonstrated a synergistic zzso effect of zzso with zzso zzso in zzso pancreatic cancer cell zzso zzso studies demonstrated that the zzso plus zzso combination specifically resulted in a zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso In addition, the combination zzso plus zzso induced zzso and this synergistic effect was dependent on zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso to zzso expressing pancreatic tumor cells, which are inherently resistant to zzso using zzso may be an effective therapy for pancreatic cancer especially when zzso in combination with zzso
