The zzso potential of solid tumors, or the ability to initiate zzso development from pre-existing host vessels, is facilitated by soluble factors zzso by tumor cells and involves breaching of zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso migration and zzso We evaluated the zzso potential of human melanoma cell lines differing in their degree of zzso based on their ability to regulate zzso persistent zzso zzso We observed that zzso zzso of the aggressive melanoma cell line zzso induced a high effective migratory response in zzso while zzso of zzso and zzso had an zzso zzso Further, the melanoma cell lines exhibited a varied expression profile of tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso expression zzso correlated with aggressiveness of the melanoma cell line, and ability of the respective zzso to induce directed zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso expression was found to be silenced in the zzso cell line, concurrent with its role as a tumor zzso Treatment with zzso human zzso and CM of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso directional zzso migration, while CM of zzso silenced zzso cells induced directed zzso zzso The functional implication of zzso expression on tumor growth and zzso potential in melanoma was evaluated in zzso We observed that zzso expression reduced tumor growth, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso tumors while zzso zzso increased tumor growth and zzso of zzso zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that zzso expression zzso with zzso of zzso persistent zzso migration and adversely affects the zzso potential and growth of zzso
