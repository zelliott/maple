zzso zzso by the zzso zzso has shown promising zzso activity in various cancer zzso However, the mechanism of zzso zzso is not completely understood and its effect on multiple myeloma cells is zzso In this study, we evaluated zzso effect of zzso alone or its combination with current zzso agents in multiple myeloma cell lines, patient samples, and a mouse zzso zzso zzso of our study showed that zzso decreased the viability of multiple myeloma cells irrespective of zzso status, with limited zzso toward normal zzso zzso Treatment of multiple myeloma cells with zzso resulted in induction of zzso zzso of colony formation, and zzso zzso restored zzso zzso of zzso zzso and induced zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso without significant zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso showed a little effect on zzso response of zzso whereas zzso of zzso led to substantial zzso of zzso activity in multiple myeloma cells, indicating that zzso zzso is, at least in part, zzso zzso zzso delayed tumor growth and prolonged survival of mice bearing multiple myeloma zzso Furthermore, combined treatment of zzso with zzso or zzso displayed synergistic effects in both multiple myeloma cell lines and primary multiple myeloma zzso zzso with our in zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso resulted in enhanced zzso activity in zzso Our study for the first time shows zzso activity of zzso and provides the rationale for its clinical evaluation in patients with multiple zzso including the high-risk group with zzso zzso
