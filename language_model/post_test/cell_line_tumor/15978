It has been proposed that an aggressive secondary cancer stem cell population arises from a primary cancer stem cell population through acquisition of additional genetic zzso and drives cancer zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso essential in stem cell zzso has been linked to breast cancer zzso However, critical mechanism linking increased zzso expression to zzso zzso tumor initiating zzso regulation and cancer progression remains zzso Here, we identify a mechanism in which zzso zzso zzso of DNA damage repair leads to zzso of zzso zzso gene amplification in zzso which activates zzso signaling to promote zzso zzso We further reveal that zzso a clinical trial drug that zzso zzso zzso could prevent breast cancer progression by eliminating zzso
