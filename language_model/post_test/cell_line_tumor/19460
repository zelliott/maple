Recent studies suggest that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly increases zzso flux through the zzso zzso The concept derives from the observation that zzso zzso of zzso gives rise to a zzso increase in zzso and presumably to increased flow through the zzso Despite the strength of this zzso the existence of heightened zzso flux has not yet been zzso zzso Here, we use the artificial zzso precursor zzso to measure zzso flux by tracking zzso unit zzso of zzso pools in human prostate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was accompanied by a massive increase in zzso and zzso zzso zzso and by a zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso In the presence of 300 zzso zzso zzso zzso led to the sequential appearance of fluorinated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso As fluorinated zzso increased, zzso zzso zzso so that the total zzso pool size remained relatively zzso At 24 zzso zzso of the zzso pool in the induced zzso cells was zzso compared with only zzso in zzso zzso Thus, zzso induction increased zzso flux by approximately zzso zzso could be interrupted by zzso of zzso zzso but not by zzso of zzso zzso Overall, the findings are consistent with a paradigm zzso flux is initiated by zzso zzso of zzso and particularly zzso followed by a marked increase in key zzso zzso The latter sustains the flux cycle by providing a constant supply of zzso for subsequent zzso by zzso The broader zzso implications of this futile zzso cycling are discussed in zzso
