While zzso is a clinically observed phenomenon after zzso zzso of zzso cells between cycles of chemotherapy is usually a neglected factor in cancer zzso As the effect of both zzso and chemotherapy on zzso cells is the same zzso on cancer zzso the response of the zzso to injury and cell loss from the two treatment methods should be similar, including zzso Cell recruitment is known to be a possible mechanism responsible for zzso regrowth after zzso The literature data regarding mechanisms of zzso after chemotherapy is very zzso The current paper employs a zzso Carlo zzso approach to implement the zzso of a widely used drug zzso into a previously developed virtual head and neck zzso and to study the effect of zzso on zzso zzso and regrowth during zzso The mechanism of cell recruitment was zzso by releasing various percentages zzso of zzso cells into the zzso cycle after each chemotherapy cell zzso The onset of zzso was also zzso with both immediate onset and late onset of cell zzso zzso during chemotherapy, if zzso is a highly potent phenomenon, similar to drug resistance, therefore it should not be neglected during zzso
