The employment of zzso zzso zzso zzso constitutes a promising alternative for cancer zzso however, in the case of zzso zzso zzso the lack of an appropriate zzso promoter and relative resistance to zzso infection have hampered the construction of zzso with clinically zzso specificity and zzso By combining zzso targeting with zzso enhancement for zzso we generated novel zzso zzso zzso zzso viral agents for the treatment of zzso We used zzso enhancement based on incorporation of an zzso motif into the zzso loop of the zzso zzso fiber zzso domain as well as replacement of the zzso zzso with the zzso zzso The zzso promoter was highly active in zzso whereas showing no significant activity in zzso cell lines and primary cells isolated from normal mouse esophagus and zzso zzso of zzso zzso revealed that the zzso and zzso binding ability of zzso were significantly more efficient than that of unmodified and zzso zzso zzso All of the zzso zzso demonstrated replication and subsequent zzso in zzso cells but not in zzso cells in zzso thus confirming the dependence of their replication on the zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso exhibited significantly improved zzso and progeny production compared with unmodified and zzso zzso without sacrificing tumor zzso Whereas unmodified and zzso zzso showed insignificant therapeutic effect in zzso zzso zzso remarkably suppressed tumor growth of established zzso in zzso Thus, our studies have demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso are selective and potent agents for the treatment of zzso
