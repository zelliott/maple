zzso is currently used to treat Alzheimer's disease zzso it behaves as a mild blocker of zzso zzso and has an zzso modulating action on zzso zzso receptors zzso In this study, we observed that zzso prevented cell death induced by the zzso zzso and zzso in the human zzso cell line zzso as well as in bovine zzso zzso The protective effect of zzso was zzso in both cell zzso maximum protection was produced at 300 zzso The zzso effect of zzso at 300 zzso against zzso or zzso zzso was reversed by zzso At zzso zzso zzso caused a mild and sustained zzso of the zzso concentration of zzso zzso measured in single cells loaded with zzso zzso of the cells for 48 h with 300 zzso zzso doubled the density of zzso zzso receptors and tripled the expression of the zzso protein zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso can prevent zzso cell death by inducing zzso through a mechanism related to that described for zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso These findings might explain the long-term beneficial effects of zzso in patients suffering of Alzheimer's zzso
