To investigate the combined zzso effects of zzso when used with zzso in zzso 

Two human colon cancer cell lines zzso and zzso were treated with zzso and zzso alone and in zzso The effects of each drug were evaluated using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso flow zzso and western zzso 

zzso and zzso showed a zzso zzso zzso When treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with its concentration ranging from zzso zzso to zzso zzso of zzso cells showed reduced zzso effect than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso attenuated zzso induced zzso of cells at zzso zzso Western zzso analyses for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso attenuated zzso induced zzso Western zzso analyses for cell cycle molecules showed that zzso arrest might be possible cause of zzso induced zzso and zzso attenuated zzso induced zzso via blocking of cell cycle progression to the zzso phase, causing an zzso of cells at the zzso zzso 

We found that zzso attenuated zzso effect of zzso zzso might act via zzso of cell cycle zzso thus preventing zzso induced by zzso
