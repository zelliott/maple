We have demonstrated the possibility that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso system might be involved in the establishment of zzso zzso zzso in oral zzso cell zzso zzso In order to further clarify the role of the zzso system in oral zzso we examined the expression of zzso and zzso in biopsy specimens from 61 patients with oral SCC by means of zzso and investigated several zzso factors, including age, sex, zzso zzso zzso invasion, recurrence and zzso The expression of zzso and zzso was observed in zzso and zzso of our subjects, zzso Although we were unable to find a statistically significant association between the expression of zzso and any zzso factors, we did find a significant association between the expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the mode of invasion zzso and recurrence of the tumors zzso were strongly associated with zzso zzso and the zzso group showed a significantly poorer prognosis than the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and scattering in zzso oral SCC cells, but the treatment did not affect the expression of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso signaling in oral SCC cells might be involved in the diverse action of oral zzso including invasion or zzso at the primary site and zzso zzso zzso
