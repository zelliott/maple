Most chemical zzso zzso are ineffective for the zzso of cells in suspension, such as zzso cell and stem cell zzso We developed two different types of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the efficient zzso of zzso zzso 

The zzso systems were prepared by zzso of zzso zzso zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso were further zzso for zzso DNA and zzso delivery to suspension zzso The particle size and surface charge of the zzso were analyzed with a zzso zzso of zzso DNA zzso and small interfering zzso zzso by zzso or zzso was evaluated by measurement of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

The zzso zzso and zzso exhibited enhanced gene and zzso delivery in the tested suspension cell lines zzso cells and zzso zzso compared with conventional zzso zzso In the case of zzso zzso the zzso and zzso show at least zzso and zzso higher zzso expression compared with zzso zzso (or zzso 2000), zzso The zzso showed more effective zzso delivery to the suspension cells than zzso zzso as assessed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso The effective zzso by the zzso and zzso is presumably due to zzso activity of zzso proteins resulting in facilitated zzso of zzso and zzso 

This study suggests that zzso zzso zzso can be widely zzso for the zzso of zzso and zzso to suspension cell zzso
