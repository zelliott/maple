The DNA zzso inhibitor zzso zzso has been found to exert zzso and zzso activities when tested against various cultured cancer zzso Furthermore, zzso has been found to play critical roles in cell cycle arrest and zzso in various cancer cell zzso however, these roles are not well zzso In this study, we investigated zzso for its potential zzso and zzso effects in human leukemia cell lines zzso and zzso Our results indicated that treatment with zzso resulted in significantly inhibited cell growth in a zzso and zzso manner by the induction of zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells was correlated with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein levels, the zzso of Bid zzso the zzso of zzso and the collapse of zzso membrane potential zzso However, zzso induced by zzso was attenuated by zzso zzso indicating an important role for zzso in zzso zzso The data further demonstrated that zzso increased zzso zzso oxygen species zzso zzso Moreover, zzso a widely used zzso scavenger, effectively blocked the zzso zzso effects via zzso of zzso production and zzso zzso These observations clearly indicate that zzso zzso in human leukemia cells are key zzso of zzso collapse, which leads to zzso induction followed by zzso zzso
