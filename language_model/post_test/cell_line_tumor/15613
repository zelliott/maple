Genes that suppress zzso can be silenced by zzso events, such as zzso DNA zzso and modification of zzso zzso zzso of DNA zzso and zzso zzso zzso can potentially reverse these zzso The aim of this study was to determine the in zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso a potent inhibitor of DNA zzso in combination with zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso on human breast zzso zzso We observed a synergistic zzso interaction between zzso and zzso in their capacity to inhibit colony formation of zzso and zzso breast zzso zzso In order to understand the molecular mechanism of this interaction, we investigated the effect of these drugs on the zzso of the zzso zzso and tissue inhibitor of zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso which were reported to be silenced by zzso zzso in many breast tumor cell zzso zzso was reported to produce G cell cycle arrest following DNA zzso zzso and zzso function as zzso of tumor zzso zzso zzso was used to determine the effect of the zzso of zzso and zzso on four breast zzso cell lines for the zzso of these zzso We observed a synergistic zzso of zzso by the combination in zzso zzso and zzso tumor zzso For zzso we demonstrated an additive to synergistic zzso by the combination for zzso and zzso tumor cells, zzso In the zzso tumor cells, the drug combination produced a synergistic zzso of zzso The association between the synergistic zzso activity and the synergistic zzso of the target genes in this study suggests that the mechanism of zzso activity of zzso in combination with zzso is probably related to their enhanced zzso of different types of tumor zzso genes that have been silenced by zzso zzso
