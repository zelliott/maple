zzso zzso are emerging as important regulators in various zzso processes in zzso zzso as a major zzso isolated from dietary zzso possesses a wide variety of biological activities particularly in cancer zzso However, the molecular mechanisms by which zzso elicits its effects on zzso cancer cells have not been fully zzso In this study, we reported that expression of zzso was higher in human zzso cancer relative to benign zzso zzso Meanwhile, zzso of zzso cells with the inhibitor of zzso suppressed growth and migration of tumor zzso Our study also found that treatment of zzso cancer cells with zzso caused an zzso of zzso cancer cell growth and zzso Further cellular zzso studies revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso which was accompanied by significantly increased expression of zzso a putative zzso target zzso Taken together, our findings reveal that zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso cancer cell growth and zzso and zzso as nontoxic zzso of zzso can block zzso cancer cell growth and migration, offering novel insights into the mechanisms of zzso therapeutic zzso
