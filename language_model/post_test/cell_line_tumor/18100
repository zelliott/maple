To investigate the relationship between the zzso of zzso zzso cells and their zzso expression zzso 

zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso were zzso with various doses of zzso zzso The cell survival rate, expression of zzso cell cycle profile and activity of zzso were respectively detected by zzso zzso zzso flow zzso and zzso 

The surviving fraction at zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were zzso vs zzso and zzso had higher zzso than zzso zzso radiation zzso the expression of zzso zzso had a significantly higher expression of zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The activity of zzso was more powerful in zzso than in zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso may play a critical role in zzso radiation resistance in zzso through its zzso and zzso dependent zzso
