Study the mechanism of gastric tumor zzso 

We have generated and characterized a novel human gastric cell line, zzso zzso from an zzso cell line, zzso zzso formerly named as zzso which was derived from putative human gastric stem zzso cell zzso zzso 

The characterization of the zzso cell line includes gene expression by zzso zzso cell proliferation and differentiation potential, zzso analysis by zzso zzso and spectral zzso analysis zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso nude mice zzso The zzso Human zzso zzso and zzso were also employed to analyze the expression of zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso gastric cell line showed cancer cell zzso zzso the ability of zzso growth high frequency zzso and to the expression of zzso a zzso factor expressed in embryonic stem cells and many types of cancer cells, and tumor development in immune deficient zzso zzso analysis indicated a characteristic zzso of the short arm of zzso 7 to zzso zzso zzso Human zzso zzso analysis showed that the expression of zzso genes was zzso while that of zzso genes was zzso in zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were highly expressed in zzso cells in culture, as well as tumor zzso developed by zzso cells in zzso mice for six to eight zzso 

Except for the zzso of the short arm of zzso 7 on zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso cells is similar to the parental zzso cells which are zzso and normal in zzso This zzso change could be the cause for the high expression of zzso genes and zzso of these cells found in this zzso Thus zzso genes might play an important role in gastric zzso
