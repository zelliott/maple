zzso of testosterone to zzso zzso by the zzso 5 zzso types 1 (5 alpha zzso and 2 (5 alpha zzso is important for normal and pathological growth of the zzso The zzso zzso in normal prostate is 5 alpha zzso However, prostate cancer zzso development is accompanied by a decrease in 5 alpha zzso and an increase in 5 alpha zzso The biological significance of increased 5 alpha zzso expression is not fully zzso zzso the aim of this study was to determine the effect of zzso of 5 alpha zzso on growth and zzso zzso zzso production in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso with zzso alpha zzso or zzso alone, were cultured in the presence or absence of testosterone at varying zzso Cell growth and zzso zzso were measured after 4-6 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels were evaluated using zzso after 24 zzso of zzso 

10 zzso testosterone increased growth of zzso alpha zzso zzso by zzso over cells grown in the absence of testosterone, compared to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Likewise, zzso zzso was increased by zzso in zzso alpha zzso zzso treated with 10 zzso testosterone, compared to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso At zzso of testosterone above 10 zzso the zzso effect on growth and zzso zzso was not distinguishable between zzso alpha zzso and zzso zzso 

These results demonstrate that zzso of 5 alpha zzso enhances the cellular response to low, but not high, zzso of zzso This explains one mechanism by which zzso zzso can zzso in the presence of zzso levels of circulating zzso
