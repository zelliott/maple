The regulation of zzso is considered to be realized by zzso zzso zzso zzso at a zzso zzso The discovery of a class of small zzso zzso called zzso implies alternative mechanism of regulation of zzso Here, we show that zzso plays an important role in zzso the adaptation of tumor cells to oxygen zzso The zzso of zzso increased the protein levels of zzso and zzso in zzso tumor zzso the increase of zzso in hypoxic tumor cells, zzso decreased the protein levels of zzso and zzso By using zzso reporter zzso system, we confirmed that zzso directly targeted the zzso of zzso and zzso On the other hand, the forced zzso of zzso in zzso tumor cells zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso in hypoxic tumor cells caused the increase of zzso The differential expression of zzso has important biological significance in tumor cells, either enhancing the growth or favoring the survival of tumor cells upon the oxygen zzso Thus, we identify a novel molecular regulation mechanism through which zzso regulates zzso and zzso and is regulated by zzso so to keep tumor cells adapting to different oxygen zzso
