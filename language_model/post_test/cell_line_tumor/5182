zzso zzso are small zzso capable of zzso zzso bond zzso of a target zzso in a zzso zzso These molecules are a new generation of artificial zzso zzso acids currently used to silence many zzso zzso The present study describes a zzso zzso directed against the zzso zzso from the E6 and zzso genes of human zzso type 16 zzso the main zzso agent of cervical zzso zzso showed efficient zzso against a bona fide zzso window at zzso zzso within zzso zzso zzso even in low zzso zzso Using a genetic analysis as guidance, we introduced diverse chemical modifications within zzso zzso core to produce a stable locked zzso acid zzso zzso zzso with significant zzso activity of full zzso zzso Cell culture testing of zzso produced a sharp zzso of zzso zzso levels in zzso cells resulting in decreased proliferation and considerable cell death in a specific and zzso zzso No significant effects were observed with inactive or scrambled control zzso nor from using zzso cells, suggesting zzso effect and high zzso The biological effects of zzso suggest a potential use for the treatment of cervical zzso
