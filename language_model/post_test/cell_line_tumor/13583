zzso 75 % of zzso zzso zzso tumors zzso harbor a zzso zzso zzso generating an zzso fusion protein that is thought to be instrumental in the zzso zzso Current evidence suggests that one function of the fusion protein is to zzso target zzso We have generated an in zzso human cellular model in which the fusion protein is expressed in zzso bone zzso stem zzso We have performed zzso analyses of these cells and identified several genes zzso in the presence of zzso which are also zzso in zzso zzso These genes and their products represent potential therapeutic targets for zzso zzso
