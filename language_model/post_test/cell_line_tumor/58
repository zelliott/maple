The main objectives of our study were to determine the zzso of omega-3 zzso to the zzso to understand its mechanisms, and to determine the feasibility of targeting the zzso zzso fatty acids zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso mice injected zzso with zzso prostate cancer cells were randomly divided into three different zzso (and same percent zzso of total zzso diet groups: high zzso zzso acid zzso high omega-3 zzso acid zzso zzso and normal zzso zzso zzso growth and zzso were examined as end points after administration of short-term (5 weeks) omega-3 and zzso fatty acid zzso zzso tissue zzso were examined for growth, zzso zzso activities, zzso and zzso zzso from the LA zzso mice exhibited the most rapid growth compared with tumors from the control and SDA zzso zzso Moreover, a diet switch from LA to SDA caused a dramatic decrease in the growth of tumors in 5 weeks, whereas tumors grew more aggressively when mice were switched from an SDA to an LA zzso Evaluating tumor proliferation zzso and zzso zzso in mice fed the LA and SDA diets suggested increased percentage proliferation index from the zzso zzso mice compared with the tumors from the omega-3 zzso zzso Further, increased zzso was observed in tumors from omega-3 SDA zzso mice versus tumors from zzso zzso zzso zzso of membrane zzso of red blood cells reflected dietary changes and correlated with the levels observed in zzso zzso or zzso acid and zzso zzso were analyzed for zzso and zzso activities by zzso liquid zzso We also examined the percent zzso or saturated fatty acids in the total zzso zzso zzso ratios, and other major zzso zzso Delta zzso and zzso of zzso zzso pathways from the zzso We observed a zzso increase in the zzso ratio in tumors from LA zzso mice and a zzso decrease in the ratio in tumors from the SDA zzso zzso There was an increased zzso and zzso zzso zzso activities and reduced estimated zzso activity in tumors from mice fed the SDA zzso zzso effects were observed in tumors from mice fed the LA zzso Together, these observations provide zzso roles of omega-3 fatty acids in slowing prostate cancer growth by altering zzso ratios through diet and by promoting zzso and zzso proliferation in tumors by directly competing with zzso fatty acids for zzso and zzso zzso
