zzso lateral sclerosis zzso is a neurodegenerative disease caused by the zzso of motor zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso were reportedly linked to familial zzso zzso is a key zzso zzso and is also one of the major targets for zzso damage in the brains of patients suffering from zzso disease zzso Several lines of evidence suggest that zzso zzso beta zzso is associated with the zzso of zzso In this report we demonstrate that zzso zzso directly interacts with zzso and that this interaction decreases the zzso activity of the zzso We observed zzso zzso in the zzso region of zzso cells, and mapped the zzso binding region to zzso zzso acids zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso binds to the zzso zzso zzso with greater affinity than to zzso zzso This resulted in considerably less zzso zzso zzso Our study implicates a potential role for zzso in the development of ALS by interacting with the zzso zzso zzso
