zzso a novel member of zzso zzso family that play important roles in regulating cell survival and zzso is frequently zzso in various kinds of human zzso including zzso zzso To explore its possibility as a therapeutic target for zzso zzso we developed a novel zzso zzso interference system by using zzso promoter and employed it to suppress zzso reporters zzso and zzso and zzso gene zzso expression and analyzed its zzso We found that expression of zzso reporters zzso and zzso was specifically inhibited in tumor cells but not in normal zzso We also observed that the specific zzso of zzso in human zzso zzso cells zzso strongly suppressed in zzso cell proliferation and in zzso zzso We observed significant zzso induction and zzso enhancement in zzso cells by the zzso zzso suppression of zzso zzso All these results indicate that zzso of zzso expression can result in potent zzso activity and zzso in human zzso zzso
