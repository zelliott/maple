The zzso capacity of cancer cells is regulated by factors intrinsic to cancer cells and by zzso factors in the zzso Here, we investigated the zzso potential of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso breast cancer cell zzso At zzso levels, zzso a zzso for zzso enhanced zzso zzso Treatment with the zzso zzso zzso inhibited this zzso zzso Because zzso directly zzso zzso translation, we investigated whether zzso zzso of zzso leads to increased zzso zzso induced the formation of the zzso translation initiation complex through an zzso zzso Indeed, zzso initiated zzso translation, shown by an increase in zzso zzso Specifically, we show that zzso zzso a rapid zzso of protein expression for zzso zzso zzso and zzso without affecting their zzso zzso Taken together, we describe a mechanism by which zzso influences translation of zzso zzso thereby providing zzso breast cancer cells with a zzso zzso
