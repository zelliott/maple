zzso zzso zzso a new member of the zzso zzso zzso was recently found to have a high level of expression in many zzso zzso The objective of this study was to examine the zzso expression and its role in zzso cell proliferation in oral zzso cell zzso 

Western zzso and zzso were used to detect zzso protein in oral zzso cell zzso zzso zzso cell lines and clinical specimens zzso The relationship between zzso expression and zzso features was zzso Cell proliferation and inflammatory zzso zzso were tested by zzso and zzso methods zzso 

zzso showed that zzso expression level was higher in zzso zzso than in paired adjacent normal zzso ( zzso and the expression level of zzso was significantly associated with zzso size zzso zzso clinical stage zzso and zzso expression ( zzso In zzso results also suggested that stimulation of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso could significantly increase zzso cell proliferation as well as subsequent zzso and zzso zzso ( zzso which could be partially inhibited by usage of zzso zzso 

It was therefore hypothesized that increased expression of zzso may be of great value in assessing the development of zzso and could be used as a new target for zzso prevention and therapy in zzso
