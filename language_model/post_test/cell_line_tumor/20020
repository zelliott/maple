Little is known about the molecular events occurring in the zzso of human zzso zzso zzso are dynamic zzso that change over the natural course of the disease, and so they might play a role in the biology of cancer cells that have departed from the primary zzso zzso we have adopted an zzso approach to identify some of these zzso Using a DNA zzso zzso platform to compare paired primary zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell lines from the same patient, we observed zzso promoter zzso island zzso as a likely target of the zzso We found that zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso occurred in the corresponding zzso zzso zzso of melanoma and head and neck cancer cells but not in the primary zzso Using in zzso and in zzso cellular and mouse models for depleted or enhanced zzso activity, we also demonstrated that zzso acts as an inhibitor of zzso growth, zzso and zzso Most importantly, the study of zzso zzso island zzso in primary zzso and zzso zzso zzso of cancer patients showed this zzso zzso to be significantly confined to the zzso zzso Overall, these results indicate the existence of zzso zzso events that might contribute to the progression of the zzso
