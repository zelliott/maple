New zzso complexes containing the water soluble zzso zzso zzso have been zzso by zzso reactions starting from zzso or zzso precursors and zzso zzso zzso Depending on the zzso counter zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso complexes or the zzso zzso species were obtained respectively and fully characterized by zzso zzso Single crystal structural characterization was undertaken for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the latter obtained by zzso of zzso zzso The zzso of analogous zzso zzso zzso derivatives zzso 1, zzso 2, zzso zzso and zzso zzso was evaluated against a panel of several human tumor cell zzso All the complexes showed in zzso zzso activity comparable to that of the reference zzso zzso Tests performed on zzso sensitive and resistant cell lines showed that against human zzso zzso cell line pair, the resistance factor of copper derivatives was roughly zzso lower than that of zzso whereas against human zzso cancer zzso cell line pair it was about zzso zzso These results, confirming the zzso of zzso resistance, support the hypothesis that zzso zzso complexes follow different zzso mechanisms than do platinum zzso
