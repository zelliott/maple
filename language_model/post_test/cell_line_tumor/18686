zzso growth zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso melanoma zzso was observed, following treatment of mice zzso and zzso with zzso extract of zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso for 4 weeks) either before or after zzso of 1 zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso after weekly injections for 4 weeks with zzso leaf preparation zzso induced significant reduction of tumor growth (both zzso and zzso and increased zzso of zzso On the other hand, zzso treatment after tumor zzso demonstrated no tumor growth zzso in the zzso treated group in comparison to the PBS treated zzso No direct zzso effect of zzso towards zzso and zzso tumor cells was observed in zzso The zzso cells of zzso treated mice when mixed with zzso of zzso tumor cells and injected into a group of mice, tumor growth was found to be significantly reduced and zzso of the tumor hosts increased remarkably in comparison to mice zzso with tumor along with normal zzso zzso zzso A zzso induced proliferation of zzso from zzso treated mice was significantly higher than the zzso of zzso zzso In in zzso zzso by itself had no zzso effects on zzso but it zzso zzso induced zzso zzso induced zzso as evidenced by increased zzso count in blood as well as zzso zzso zzso evidence suggested that increase in zzso and zzso T cells accounted for zzso The conditional tumor growth zzso observed in mice treated with zzso before tumor zzso may be regulated by zzso zzso immune zzso having prominent role in the cellular immune function of the tumor zzso
