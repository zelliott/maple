Human immune system zzso mice are new tools to investigate human immune zzso Here, we used zzso mice to study human immune responses against human zzso cancer cells and their ability to control zzso growth and zzso 

zzso zzso zzso mice were zzso with zzso or zzso human zzso blood zzso stem cells zzso and vaccinated with human zzso cancer cells zzso combined to human zzso 

Both zzso or zzso human zzso gave long-term zzso and zzso both in peripheral blood and in zzso zzso and production of human zzso zzso mice produced specific zzso human zzso An zzso zzso challenge was significantly inhibited (but not zzso in both vaccinated and zzso zzso zzso zzso were heavily infiltrated with human and zzso cells, mice showed zzso cells and production of human zzso that could contribute to zzso growth zzso zzso zzso mice showed significantly inhibited lung zzso when compared with zzso zzso mice and to zzso mice, along with higher levels of zzso human zzso zzso 

zzso responses were zzso through an zzso zzso cancer cell vaccine in zzso zzso Human immune responses zzso in zzso mice effectively inhibited lung zzso
