zzso zzso of breast cancer is based, in part, on the presence or absence of amplification of the human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso zzso which leads to zzso protein zzso While the presence of the zzso zzso protein is a necessary precondition for sensitivity to zzso therapies, many patients develop zzso Thus, identification of the downstream zzso of this zzso will help in understanding zzso of zzso and further, the identified molecules themselves may have the potential to be used as therapeutic zzso In this work, we studied the zzso changes that accompany the zzso gene amplification to identify potential new therapeutic targets and zzso We analyzed zzso zzso samples extracted from zzso zzso human breast cancer cells and their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In total, zzso unique proteins were zzso with zzso of them zzso expressed in zzso normal and zzso zzso zzso zzso Select zzso candidates of particular interest were validated by western zzso and evaluated for clinical relevance by the zzso assessment of protein abundance in breast tumor zzso zzso zzso produced marked changes in proteins related to multiple aspects of cancer biology, and the identified expression patterns were zzso in the clinical zzso 

Breast cancer is a major cause of death in zzso zzso zzso of breast cancer is based, in part, on the presence or absence of amplification of the human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso zzso which leads to zzso protein overproduction that triggers zzso signaling events that drive zzso invasion, zzso and resistance to zzso While the presence of the zzso zzso gene product, zzso zzso is a necessary precondition for sensitivity to the therapeutic zzso zzso zzso the downstream effects of zzso protein zzso are incompletely zzso In this work, we applied quantitative zzso to identify zzso changes accompanying zzso gene zzso The significance of this work includes 1) identification of new zzso associated with the zzso zzso 2) measurement of the magnitude of the zzso changes triggered by the amplification of this single zzso and 3) better understanding of the downstream biological changes triggered by zzso zzso
