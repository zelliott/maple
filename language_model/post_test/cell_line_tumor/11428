zzso zzso zzso are significant zzso involved in tumor genesis and zzso zzso we report a series of novel zzso zzso zzso which are marked by introducing zzso zzso groups as the capping zzso The zzso activity of the zzso compounds against zzso and several tumor cell lines are zzso zzso Fifteen compounds with promising activities are selected for further evaluation of target selectivity profile against zzso human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibit outstanding selectivity against zzso Analysis of zzso X-ray structure and zzso zzso zzso model indicates that these zzso differ significantly in the rim near the surface of the active zzso Although zzso has been known as a zzso zzso it exhibits outstanding selectivity for zzso over zzso For further zzso properties study, six compounds are chosen for determination of their zzso properties including zzso and zzso zzso The results suggest that compounds with a smaller framework and with zzso are likely to have better zzso zzso
