To determine whether radiation combined with zzso zzso zzso Acid zzso or zzso acid, zzso results in a better tumor response than radiation zzso 

We evaluated the responses of the zzso lung tumor in zzso rats and zzso zzso prostate tumor in Copenhagen rats, to single and zzso X-ray doses with and without zzso zzso zzso zzso were grown zzso in the flank of the zzso zzso was administered zzso twice daily for at least 2 zzso Response to treatment was evaluated according to excess growth delay and specific growth zzso 

zzso and zzso tumors treated with zzso only experienced a zzso growth zzso zzso tumors treated with 4 daily dose zzso of zzso zzso had a significant excess and specific growth delay when treated with zzso the enhancement ratio was zzso The enhancement ratio based on the calculated excess biologically effective dose of the zzso concept was zzso zzso tumors treated with a single dose of 20 zzso and zzso had no significant excess growth zzso 

The enhancement ratio of zzso for the zzso zzso but not for the zzso zzso due to zzso treatment, indicates that zzso may zzso the zzso effect of zzso radiation in distinct tumor zzso
