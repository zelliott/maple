zzso of this study were the validation of zzso involvement in zzso zzso resistance and the assessment of clinical impact of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

The involvement of zzso in zzso resistance was validated with an zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein levels at diagnosis were assessed by zzso on series of patients treated with either a zzso protocol zzso 72 zzso or with a standard zzso regimen zzso 1; 61 zzso 

zzso of zzso significantly decreased the zzso resistance level of zzso cells, demonstrating its zzso involvement in this zzso In clinical samples, a worse outcome was associated with increased levels of zzso and zzso at diagnosis in the zzso patients and of zzso in the zzso 1 zzso 

Meanwhile the adverse clinical impact of zzso zzso appeared to be closely related to the relevance of zzso in the zzso zzso that of zzso zzso was more general and not strictly zzso zzso The assessment of zzso and zzso at diagnosis, together with that of other known zzso zzso can be considered for an early identification of zzso of zzso patients with higher risk of adverse zzso
