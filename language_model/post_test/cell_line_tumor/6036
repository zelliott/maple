zzso zzso zzso is the third most common fatal cancer worldwide with more than 500,000 annual zzso zzso zzso of the patients with zzso showed zzso zzso of zzso proteins belonging to the zzso cassette protein zzso (ABC) which pump drugs out of zzso The zzso of these zzso zzso zzso on the cells a multiple drug resistance zzso which is considered a crucial cause of treatment zzso in patients with zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the zzso effect of different zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso block zzso zzso zzso zzso showing a wide range of molecular weights and zzso ratios on the functional activity of three different ABC zzso namely zzso zzso or zzso breast cancer resistance protein zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso in two human zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso First, the zzso of the different zzso (at different zzso on both liver zzso cell lines was thoroughly evaluated by means of zzso analysis using zzso V and zzso zzso zzso Thus, viable cells zzso early zzso cells zzso and late zzso cells zzso were zzso zzso pointed out zzso of intermediate to high zzso and intermediate molecular weight zzso zzso as the most zzso Then, zzso zzso 123 and zzso were used as differential zzso of these zzso zzso an zzso cell line of human cervical cancer that does not express zzso was used exclusively as a control and enabled the discerning between zzso and zzso zzso zzso to highly zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed zzso activity against zzso and zzso but not against zzso in both zzso cell zzso A remarkable dependence of this effect on the zzso concentration and zzso was zzso No zzso effect against these ABC pumps was observed with the zzso zzso These findings further evidence the potential usefulness of these Trojan horses as both drug zzso and ABC zzso in zzso zzso tumors and infections that involve the activity of these zzso zzso
