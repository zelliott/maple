The zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso and other zzso while zzso expressed in normal cells, allows for selective therapy using zzso an inhibitor of de zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso cells obtained at zzso are as sensitive to zzso toxicity as diagnosis zzso The therapeutic index of zzso can be increased by the use of a zzso zzso which protects zzso normal zzso Since zzso zzso zzso and zzso are prone to zzso associated with zzso we zzso and evaluated a potentially nontoxic zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso units zzso and zzso zzso units zzso was at least zzso to zzso less than that of zzso In addition, zzso selectively rescued zzso zzso cells from zzso toxicity at 25 zzso with negligible toxicity even at 100 zzso As for zzso zzso albeit incomplete, rescue was achieved at zzso zzso but higher zzso were zzso zzso at 20 zzso or less rescued primary zzso zzso cells and normal zzso from zzso zzso zzso these data indicate that zzso is an effective agent for salvaging zzso cells from zzso toxicity and is superior to zzso due to lower zzso
