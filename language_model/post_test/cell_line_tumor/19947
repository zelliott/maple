This investigation zzso surface zzso resonance zzso zzso to detect and zzso human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso an zzso product that is zzso in some aggressive forms of breast zzso Specifically, the zzso zzso protein zzso and its extra cellular zzso zzso are zzso targeted in this work by using a zzso zzso slide on which an zzso zzso has been immobilized by attachment to zzso G that is fixed to the gold zzso A detection limit of zzso or zzso zzso for zzso resulted when zzso was used as the zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso revealed that it binds zzso and zzso to zzso therefore complicating its detection and zzso zzso of studies that reacted a zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso domain with its specific zzso were critically different than zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso at constant bulk buffer zzso index revealed a progressive negative zzso shift over zzso A negative shift suggests that a loss of protein mass from the zzso zzso G zzso is zzso Several possibilities that may explain these negative zzso shifts are zzso
