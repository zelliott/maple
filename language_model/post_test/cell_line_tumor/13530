The clinical uses of zzso zzso or zzso which was initially prescribed to patients with zzso and zzso zzso is now extended to treat patients with multiple sclerosis zzso Previous data has shown that zzso has high affinity to the brain and readily passes through the blood brain barrier reaching zzso zzso zzso of that found in zzso However, whether long-term administration of zzso can lead to any adverse effects in patients or animal models is not yet clearly zzso 

Here we show that exposure of zzso to zzso cells zzso expressing zzso zzso increased generation and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in to the zzso zzso Interestingly, increased zzso levels were noticed even at zzso zzso of zzso zzso chronic treatment of zzso mice, a model of Alzheimer's disease with zzso for 60 days increased zzso plaque burden by more than zzso Increased zzso generation appears to result from increased turnover of zzso as revealed by zzso zzso Additionally, surface labeling of zzso with zzso and zzso of surface labeled proteins with zzso zzso also indicated increased zzso at the cell surface in zzso treated cells compared to zzso Increased turnover of zzso by zzso in turn might be a consequence of decreased protein levels of zzso 1, which is known to regulate zzso zzso and zzso of zzso Most importantly, like many other zzso drugs, zzso administration led to significant delay in acquiring a reward-based learning task in a T maze zzso 

Taken together, these data provide compelling evidence for the first time that chronic zzso administration can increase zzso processing of zzso leading to robustly increased plaque burden which may be responsible for the observed deficits in learning zzso Thus chronic treatment of mice with zzso can have deleterious effects in zzso
