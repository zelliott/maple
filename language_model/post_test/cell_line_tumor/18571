We describe the application of zzso zzso zzso and zzso to the analysis of extracts of zzso zzso This approach allowed the discrimination of samples from different sources, and to zzso them according to zzso activity without prior knowledge of this zzso The use of partial least squares analysis allowed the prediction of actual values for zzso activities for independent samples not used in producing the zzso The models were constructed using approximately zzso of the samples, with zzso used as a validation set for which predictions were zzso Models generally explained zzso of the zzso zzso in the model, and had a zzso ability, zzso of zzso This approach was also able to correlate zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso This work demonstrates the potential of zzso zzso and zzso for the development of zzso models of zzso zzso
