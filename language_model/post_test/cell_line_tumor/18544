zzso of zzso islands and associated gene zzso may lead to zzso zzso but the mechanisms of zzso island zzso in cancer are zzso The zzso gene 1 zzso also known as zzso acid zzso zzso 1 gene was first identified as an zzso gene and was shown to be zzso in prostate zzso Here, we show that this zzso is caused by the zzso of the promoter and zzso island of zzso zzso was zzso in 26 of 50 zzso primary prostate zzso but was not zzso in normal zzso or benign zzso Three of four tumors that zzso five of six that were poorly differentiated and all that were assigned a zzso score higher than 8 zzso were zzso in the promoter of zzso The samples with peripheral invasion were more frequently zzso zzso zzso than zzso without peripheral invasion zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly more frequently zzso compared with zzso 4-6 zzso zzso zzso ( zzso The zzso acid zzso beta zzso gene was frequently zzso as well zzso zzso When zzso showed zzso zzso was also zzso zzso zzso In almost all samples where zzso was not zzso zzso was also in an zzso state zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso was positively correlated zzso zzso It is possible that the zzso of the zzso response gene zzso occurred in response to the zzso and zzso of zzso These observations may contribute to our understanding of zzso events leading to zzso island zzso in zzso
