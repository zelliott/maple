zzso is an existing drug for bipolar disorder and its zzso was recently linked to reduced tumor zzso compared to the general zzso The major target of zzso action is zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso Since zzso expression and zzso are associated with prostate cancer zzso the zzso potential of zzso on prostate cancer was investigated in this zzso 

Multiple prostate cancer cell lines were treated with zzso zzso zzso Cell proliferation and cell cycle distribution were zzso DNA replication was determined using zzso labeling zzso zzso screening of gene expression was performed using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was conducted using small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso was evaluated using reporter gene zzso and zzso interaction was determined with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso significantly inhibited cell zzso which was associated with reduced DNA replication and zzso cell cycle zzso zzso significantly decreased the expression of multiple DNA zzso zzso including cell division cycle 6 zzso zzso A, zzso zzso and zzso which are regulated by zzso factor during cell zzso A novel zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso zzso also suppressed the expression of these zzso target zzso indicating that zzso zzso effect was associated with zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso suppressed zzso zzso by interrupting the interaction of zzso factor with its target gene zzso 

These data indicated that zzso suppresses cancer cell proliferation by zzso zzso interaction and subsequent zzso gene expression in prostate zzso
