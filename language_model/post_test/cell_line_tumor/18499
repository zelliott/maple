The zzso zzso protein zzso has been identified as a negative regulator of protein zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling is frequently observed in zzso the most common and most zzso zzso brain zzso Because loss of zzso function and/or expression may remove the zzso effects on zzso and promote zzso we studied 93 primary zzso and nine zzso cell lines for zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso and zzso zzso None of the tumors or cell lines had zzso deletions or coding sequence zzso However, zzso zzso expression was lower by at least 50% relative to zzso brain tissue in 37 zzso zzso and six zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were closely associated with zzso of the zzso zzso Furthermore, treatment of zzso zzso zzso cells with the zzso agent zzso and the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso A resulted in partial zzso of the zzso promoter and increased zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a common aberration in zzso
