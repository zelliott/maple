zzso zzso of human zzso has been found to be responsible for the poor activity of viral Rex zzso which is essential for zzso export of human T cell leukemia virus type 1 zzso Here, we examined the zzso barrier of zzso by establishing rat cell lines, including both adherent and zzso T cells, which express human zzso at zzso zzso We demonstrated that expression of human zzso in rat cells is not harmful to cell growth and is sufficient to restore the synthesis of the viral structural zzso zzso and zzso at levels similar to those in human zzso zzso precursor proteins were efficiently processed to the mature forms in rat cells and released into the culture medium as zzso viral zzso An zzso zzso infection system suggested that the released virus particles are fully zzso Our newly developed reporter cell system revealed that zzso proteins produced in rat cells are fully zzso which is the basis for zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we show that the early steps in infection, from zzso zzso to integration into the host zzso occur efficiently in rat zzso These results, in conjunction with reports describing efficient entry of zzso into rat cells, may indicate that zzso is unique in that its major zzso barrier is determined by zzso at a viral zzso export zzso These observations will enable us to construct a transgenic rat model expressing human zzso that is sensitive to zzso zzso
