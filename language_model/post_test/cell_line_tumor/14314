zzso and zzso a new zzso zzso were compared to zzso or frozen tissue samples of the same invasive breast zzso and were evaluated for their effects on tissue zzso and zzso as well as DNA and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso or zzso zzso tumors was similar to that observed with the matched zzso zzso zzso using various zzso showed comparable results with either zzso leading to accurate breast tumor diagnosis and determination of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso fixation preserved DNA integrity as demonstrated by successful amplification and sequencing of large DNA zzso Similarly, high-quality zzso could be extracted from zzso or zzso zzso zzso cells, whole breast tumor zzso or zzso breast tumor cells, as assessed by zzso profiles and real-time reverse zzso chain reaction zzso of various zzso Moreover, tissue zzso and zzso integrity were preserved after 8 months of zzso Altogether, these results indicate that zzso as previously zzso and zzso a promising new zzso have great potential for performing both zzso and molecular analyses on the same fixed tissue sample, even after zzso zzso and can open new doors for investigating small target zzso such as zzso breast zzso
