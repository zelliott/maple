zzso zzso zzso zzso are a group of major zzso signaling zzso In our previous study, we found that zzso of zzso activity suppressed the zzso zzso zzso gene expression in prostate cancer zzso The zzso has been considered as a critical zzso for the development and progression of human prostate zzso In this study, we sought to identify the zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso Using a zzso small interference zzso zzso approach, we determined that the regulatory zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso but not zzso were required for zzso zzso zzso and cell proliferation in prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso but not zzso gene led to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene in prostate cancer cells abolished tumor growth in nude zzso Of the dual zzso and zzso zzso activities, zzso zzso zzso activity was required for zzso zzso Further analysis by a zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso is indispensable for zzso zzso zzso Finally, gene expression analysis of clinical specimens showed that both zzso and zzso were highly expressed in zzso prostate zzso compared to the zzso zzso and their expression levels correlated significantly with disease zzso Taken together, our data demonstrated that zzso and zzso are essential for zzso zzso zzso and their zzso expression or zzso might play an important role in prostate cancer zzso
