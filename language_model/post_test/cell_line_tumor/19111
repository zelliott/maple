A new zzso of zzso drug delivery system, the zzso zzso was tested for its ability to accumulate in tumors based on enhanced zzso and retention zzso effect and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso for targeted delivery of zzso zzso zzso into certain zzso It consists of units that are zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso 50,000, zzso zzso highly zzso from cultures of zzso zzso zzso The units are active in zzso zzso disruption of zzso zzso zzso release in the zzso and protection against zzso degradation in the vascular zzso The zzso is biodegradable, zzso and zzso zzso was also coupled with zzso zzso zzso dye for in zzso zzso zzso mice received subcutaneous injections of zzso zzso human breast cancer cells into the left zzso zzso or zzso injections of human zzso cell line zzso zzso at concentration of zzso was injected via the tail zzso In zzso zzso tumor imaging was performed at different time points, zzso zzso up to zzso after the drug zzso The custom-made zzso imaging zzso system was used to examine the in zzso drug zzso in animals bearing human breast and brain zzso In breast tumors the zzso signal in large blood vessels and in the tumor increased rapidly until 60 zzso and remained in the tumor at a level 6 times higher than in zzso tissue zzso zzso ( zzso In brain tumors drug accumulated selectively in zzso without any zzso signal in zzso zzso The results of live imaging were zzso zzso by zzso microscopic examination of various zzso In addition to tumors, only kidney and liver showed some fluorescent zzso
