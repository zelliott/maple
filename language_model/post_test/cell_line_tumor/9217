An electric field is focused on one cell in zzso zzso This enables selective zzso treatment of the targeted cell without affecting its zzso While factors that lead to membrane zzso are the same as in bulk zzso quantitative description of the zzso experiments is more zzso This is due to the fact that the potential distribution cannot be solved zzso We present zzso zzso with an zzso zzso modeled with a finite element zzso Potential is calculated in the zzso the solution surrounding the cell, and the zzso The model enables calculation of the zzso potential and the fraction of the cell membrane that is above the critical zzso zzso zzso at several zzso distances of human lung zzso cells zzso stained with zzso demonstrated membrane zzso at distances shorter than approximately zzso zzso This agrees well with the zzso prediction that a critical zzso potential of 250 zzso is achieved when the zzso is approximately zzso zzso or closer to the zzso zzso predict that at short zzso zzso the zzso potential increases significantly while the total area of the cell above the critical potential increases only zzso
