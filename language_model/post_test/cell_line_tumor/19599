zzso zzso zzso and the zzso genes zzso play a major role in antivirus responses against zzso C virus zzso zzso In this study, we studied expression profiles of zzso in cells supporting zzso zzso replication zzso and screened their activities to suppress zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that the expression levels of 23 zzso were significantly lower in zzso than zzso zzso cells due to zzso suppression of the zzso response element zzso Furthermore, the expression level of zzso was also decreased in the cured zzso cells in which zzso had been eliminated zzso indicating adaptation of the cells to support zzso replication by zzso zzso On the other hand, expression of zzso zzso was significantly suppressed by zzso of several zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso down of zzso zzso and zzso by short hairpin zzso resulted in increase of zzso zzso Thus, we conclude that zzso of zzso expression is required in the host cells supporting zzso replication and that several zzso directly suppress zzso zzso The search for zzso that regulate zzso replication may help to zzso the cellular zzso zzso mechanisms against zzso zzso
