zzso zzso with an zzso binding domain zzso zzso specificity and zzso target binding to T cells for use in adoptive zzso We investigated the impact of zzso binding affinity on the zzso of grafted T zzso A series of zzso zzso zzso binding zzso with a zzso ranging from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso M was linked to zzso zzso and expressed in human zzso Solid phase bound zzso protein triggered zzso of zzso T cells in a zzso zzso The zzso threshold zzso correlated with the affinity of the zzso binding zzso The maximum level of cellular zzso however, was the same and independent of the binding zzso Upon binding to zzso cells, T cells grafted with zzso carrying a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso M were activated in a similar fashion against cells with different amounts of zzso on the zzso T cells with a low affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso however, were activated exclusively by cells with high amounts of zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso of higher affinity do not necessarily induce a more potent zzso of T cells than low affinity zzso but the higher affinity zzso exhibit less discrimination between target cells with high or low zzso expression zzso
