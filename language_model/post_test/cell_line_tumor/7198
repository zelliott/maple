The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an effective therapeutic agent for acute zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso competes with zzso zzso as a zzso for incorporation into zzso Once incorporated into DNA, it zzso DNA zzso and zzso I and zzso the zzso structure of zzso 

To determine if the substitution of zzso for zzso in zzso zzso that contain 4 specific zzso factor binding sites zzso zzso zzso and zzso alters zzso factor binding to their respective DNA binding zzso 

zzso factors were obtained from nuclear extracts from human zzso leukemia zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that contained 1 or 2 specific zzso factor binding sites with or without zzso substitution for zzso were used to assess zzso factor binding by zzso mobility shift zzso 

The substitution of zzso for zzso within and outside the zzso factor binding element zzso zzso outside the binding element only zzso zzso or within the binding element only zzso all result in a reduction in zzso factor binding to their respective DNA binding zzso 

The reduction of the binding capacity of zzso factors with their respective DNA binding elements may depend on structural changes within zzso induced by zzso zzso This altered binding capacity of zzso factors to their DNA binding elements may represent one mechanism for zzso zzso secondary to zzso of zzso of new zzso zzso and, zzso translation of new zzso
