Cell growth is promoted by zzso and survival factors, which activate zzso zzso pathways to control cell cycle progression and cellular zzso zzso signals are transmitted through Ras and zzso family small zzso coupled to zzso protein zzso zzso zzso while survival signals are zzso by zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso B zzso Recently, signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso proteins were identified as positive regulators of proliferation in a variety of cell zzso zzso zzso of these pathways is associated with zzso cell growth, whereas their zzso can halt proliferation and zzso zzso cell zzso The human pathogen zzso zzso uses zzso signal molecules zzso to regulate zzso gene zzso zzso also suppress host immune responses although the mechanism of suppression is zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso blocks proliferation and zzso zzso in human BC cell zzso zzso of zzso events reveal that zzso has little or no effect on zzso zzso partially zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of each zzso independently indicates that zzso activity is critical for BC cell proliferation and survival, while a zzso active zzso zzso resistance to zzso These results support the notion of zzso as a zzso zzso in zzso systems and a paradigm for a novel class of zzso zzso
