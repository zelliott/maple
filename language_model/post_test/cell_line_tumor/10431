To explore zzso acid zzso zzso and underlying mechanism in zzso zzso nude mice zzso were used as in zzso model to study zzso effect of zzso by observing tumor growth curve and weight of the zzso zzso of zzso cells treated by zzso was observed by zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were detected by zzso zzso zzso was applied in examining zzso index of tumor zzso The tumor isolated from mice treated by zzso zzso 16 zzso zzso took on a slow growth condition compared with control zzso The results suggested that weight and volume of the tumor from experimental groups were remarkably decreased compared with control group zzso zzso zzso zzso change of the zzso such as zzso abnormal distribution of the zzso volume of the tumor cells, even zzso bodies, were observed in zzso zzso While no apparent zzso change was observed in the normal zzso Typical zzso characteristics could be distinctly observed in the mouse treated by zzso for 20 days and zzso index in zzso group was significantly higher than model zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were significantly zzso in zzso groups in comparison with control group zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso could affect the development and progression of zzso cells through inducing zzso zzso the expression of zzso in vascular cells and zzso in tumor zzso
