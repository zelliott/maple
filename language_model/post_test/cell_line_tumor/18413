The zzso signaling zzso controls cell fate decisions and plays a critical role in normal development and zzso The human zzso zzso family members zzso 2 and 3) zzso critical zzso zzso for zzso zzso In this study, we cloned a zzso zzso that is highly zzso to the human zzso zzso zzso Mouse zzso encodes a nuclear zzso binds to the zzso repeat domain of zzso zzso forms a zzso complex with the zzso domain of zzso zzso and the DNA binding protein zzso and enhances zzso zzso of the target zzso zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso for human zzso and functions as a zzso zzso for zzso zzso We also characterized the organization of the mouse zzso zzso It spans at least 35 zzso zzso on zzso 11 and contains five zzso and four zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso region revealed that the promoter is zzso and contains consensus binding sites for zzso factors such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso response zzso protein zzso Moreover, we examined zzso expression during early mouse development and found that zzso gene is expressed widely but selectively in several zzso There seems to be close correlation of the spatial and zzso expression among zzso zzso and zzso in the central nervous system zzso during early development, implicating a role for the zzso gene in zzso
