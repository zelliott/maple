Human zzso gene zzso WW zzso zzso named zzso zzso or zzso has been studied in various types of cancer cells and shown to be a tumor zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso of zzso in zzso cells is associated with resistance to radiation therapy and poor zzso In this study, we zzso zzso to examine the zzso activity against human zzso cells harboring zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso in zzso cell lines and zzso zzso were zzso 

Our results showed that zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso zzso harboring zzso zzso by causing zzso and DNA zzso However, zzso zzso had no effect with zzso possessing wild type zzso Unlike zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso cells via a zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso inhibited viability and induced zzso in human zzso cells expressing zzso zzso via a mechanism independent of the intrinsic zzso zzso zzso the survival of human zzso cells depends upon interactions between the zzso of zzso and zzso This suggests that zzso of zzso expression may be a novel strategy for treating human zzso cells with zzso zzso
