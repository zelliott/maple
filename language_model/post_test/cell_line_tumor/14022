To investigate the effects of zzso zzso and zzso zzso on replication of zzso B virus zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso permanently zzso human liver cancer cells of the line zzso were zzso zzso and zzso at different zzso were added into the culture fluid so as to identify the nontoxic zzso by zzso zzso Then the zzso cells were treated by zzso and zzso at different nontoxic zzso respectively for 4 zzso zzso was used to detect the HB surface zzso zzso and HB e zzso zzso in the zzso The relative replication level of zzso DNA was detected by slot zzso zzso 

zzso method confirmed that the nontoxic zzso of zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso After the treatment of zzso at the concentration of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in comparison to the control group, the suppression rates of zzso expression in the zzso cells were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively (all P zzso zzso the suppression rates of zzso expression in the zzso cells were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively (all P zzso zzso and the zzso DNA replication levels were 56 zzso 16, 42 zzso 11, and 40 zzso 10 respectively zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and P zzso zzso However, zzso at different nontoxic zzso showed no significant zzso effect on the levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso the zzso replication in zzso and zzso does not exercise similar zzso
