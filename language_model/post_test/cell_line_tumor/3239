The inclusion zzso behavior of zzso with a series of zzso bridged zzso possessing bridge chains in different length zzso has been investigated in order to improve the water zzso of zzso It is found that only the zzso zzso 1 and 2 can form the inclusion complexes with zzso which are characterized by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results obtained show that zzso 1 and 2 are able to zzso zzso to high levels up to 2 and zzso zzso zzso The high complex stability of zzso 1 and zzso is discussed from zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso of these complexes assessed using a human zzso zzso cell line indicates that the zzso value of zzso complex is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso which means that the zzso activity of zzso complex is better than that of parent zzso zzso value zzso zzso zzso zzso This high zzso activity, along with the satisfactory water zzso and high zzso stability of the zzso complex, will be potentially useful for its clinical application as a highly effective zzso zzso
