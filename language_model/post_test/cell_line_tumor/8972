zzso receptors and their zzso zzso the zzso represent a complex zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding can lead to various and opposite cellular behaviors such as zzso versus zzso or cell migration versus zzso Recently, zzso zzso has been identified as one of the critical steps responsible for such zzso zzso zzso as many zzso are rapidly zzso following zzso zzso and traffic through zzso compartments prior to zzso However, it is becoming obvious that zzso controls signaling in many different zzso Here we showed that activated zzso are zzso in the zzso and that about zzso of zzso receptors are recycled back to the plasma zzso Our study is also the first to demonstrate that zzso retains the capacity to signal in zzso In particular, activated zzso zzso with the zzso family zzso zzso in zzso This association led to zzso zzso which in turn increased zzso activity and facilitated zzso zzso zzso zzso function with zzso interference impaired both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso our findings shed new light on the regulation of zzso zzso zzso trafficking and signal termination and establish zzso as an important zzso of zzso zzso
