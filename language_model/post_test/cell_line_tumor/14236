The zzso zzso are important regulators of zzso outgrowth and zzso We have recently reported that a zzso zzso zzso exchange factor, zzso zzso zzso spine zzso and zzso zzso outgrowth in primary zzso zzso and zzso cells, zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso protein is highly expressed in all regions of the brain and is highly zzso upon treatment of zzso cells with zzso acid and zzso zzso which promote zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Within zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is localized to zzso regions in the primary zzso with little or no expression from secondary zzso zzso zzso zzso extensions are highly concentrated for zzso at the zzso zzso tip of the growth zzso Additionally, we demonstrate that zzso promotes zzso outgrowth in zzso as well as differentiated zzso zzso Together, our data provide new evidence suggesting that zzso is an important regulator of multiple processes involved in zzso and zzso zzso
