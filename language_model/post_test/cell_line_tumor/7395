The role of zzso acid zzso in cancer is poorly zzso Here we provide evidence for a role of zzso in the progression of breast cancer bone zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in human primary breast tumors and a series of human breast cancer cell zzso The zzso zzso of zzso in zzso breast cancer cells specifically zzso these cells to the zzso action of zzso in zzso In zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells enhanced the growth of subcutaneous tumor zzso and promoted bone zzso formation in mice by increasing both skeletal tumor growth and bone zzso This suggested that zzso zzso was produced in the tumor zzso However, zzso cells or zzso did not produce zzso Instead, they induced the release of zzso from activated zzso which, in turn, promoted tumor cell proliferation and the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso 2 potent bone zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso deprivation in mice, achieved by treatment with the zzso zzso zzso inhibited the progression of bone zzso caused by parental and zzso zzso cells and reduced the progression of zzso zzso in mice bearing zzso zzso cancer zzso Overall, our data suggest that, at the bone zzso site, tumor cells stimulate the production of zzso from activated zzso which enhances both tumor growth and zzso bone zzso
