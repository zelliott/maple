zzso zzso zzso is a zzso expressed zzso zzso consisting of two zzso zzso and two regulatory zzso zzso zzso of zzso is highly elevated in tumor cells where it protects cells from zzso zzso zzso of zzso is known to induce programmed cell death, making it a promising target for cancer zzso In the present study we investigated zzso induction by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso in prostate tumor zzso In contrast to zzso cells zzso cells respond to zzso zzso with zzso Most interestingly we found the zzso zzso induced in zzso as well as in zzso cells as monitored by zzso of zzso and subsequent zzso c zzso In both cell lines zzso of zzso 9 was not zzso Instead, an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso stress response in zzso cells after treatment with the zzso inhibitor zzso was zzso We show that this zzso stress response led to an zzso of the death zzso zzso and subsequent zzso in zzso zzso
