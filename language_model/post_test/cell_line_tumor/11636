zzso zzso Growth zzso zzso can be generated as multiple zzso by alternative zzso Two families of zzso have been described in humans, zzso zzso typified by zzso and zzso zzso typified by zzso The practical determination of expression levels of alternative zzso of the same gene may be complicated by experimental protocols that zzso one zzso over another, and the use of specific positive and negative controls is essential for the interpretation of findings on expression of the zzso Here we address some of the difficulties in experimental design when investigating alternative zzso of zzso zzso and discuss the use of appropriate control zzso We demonstrate why use of specific control experiments can prevent assumptions that zzso is not present, when in fact it zzso We zzso and confirm previously published experimental design protocols that demonstrate the importance of using positive zzso These include using known target sequences to show that the experimental conditions are suitable for zzso amplification of zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso and to ensure that zzso does not zzso We also provide evidence that demonstrates that detection of zzso protein in mice needs to be tightly controlled to prevent detection of mouse zzso by a secondary zzso We also show that human zzso protein can be zzso from cultured human cells and that zzso zzso results in protein that is detected by zzso zzso These findings support the conclusion that more information on the biology of zzso zzso is required, and confirm the importance of the experimental design in such zzso including the use of specific positive and negative zzso
