zzso zzso growth factor is a potent zzso growth factor which is also known to alter tumor zzso by zzso zzso cell differentiation and promoting zzso of zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we analyzed the modifications induced by zzso expression of zzso a soluble zzso zzso in a rat zzso colon zzso zzso We generated colon cancer cell lines zzso expressing zzso or a mock zzso Human zzso vein zzso cells cultured with zzso medium from zzso tumor cells exhibit a significantly decreased survival, demonstrating the functionality of the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression induced a zzso decrease in zzso density in 15-day old experimental liver zzso from colon zzso zzso growth was inhibited by zzso and zzso in left and right liver zzso respectively within zzso In these tumors, zzso expression was associated with a decreased zzso cell zzso and a modification in the expression of several zzso Altogether, these results suggest that zzso zzso by zzso zzso expression results in reduced zzso tumor growth zzso and modification of immune tumor zzso
