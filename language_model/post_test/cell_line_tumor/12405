zzso zzso zzso activity involving multiple DNA zzso break events in zzso lineage leukemia and zzso cells may introduce secondary genetic aberrations leading towards zzso zzso Here, we investigated defective negative feedback signaling through the zzso zzso zzso as a possible reason for zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso On studying 28 cases of zzso leukemia and 27 zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein of 65 zzso was found to be defective in seven and five cases, zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso expression and unremitting zzso gene zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression in zzso leukemia and zzso cells results in zzso of zzso expression and prevents both de zzso zzso zzso and secondary zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso gene zzso represents a frequent feature in zzso zzso which can be attributed to zzso zzso in many zzso
