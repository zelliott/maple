zzso zzso are important regulators of cell growth and zzso In the present study, we examined the function of cell surface zzso acid in zzso zzso zzso or zzso cell zzso zzso human diffuse large B cell zzso cells were incubated with or without zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso or zzso zzso zzso analysis using zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso are present on the surface of zzso cells and that they were removed by zzso In addition, the zzso with zzso enhanced zzso and zzso cell death, an effect that was not dependent on zzso zzso Furthermore, the cell death induced by zzso and zzso was zzso distinct from zzso We further examined zzso cell death in two clones of zzso zzso zzso cells with different amounts of cell surface zzso zzso zzso zzso which is zzso was less sensitive to zzso than the zzso zzso which is zzso suggesting that the extent of surface zzso influences the sensitivity to zzso In conclusion, zzso and zzso induce cell death, and the sensitivity of human B zzso cells to these agents appears to depend on the amount of zzso acid on their cell zzso
