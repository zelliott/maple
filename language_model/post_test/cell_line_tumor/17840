The zzso zzso metabolism of zzso has been implicated in zzso events which may have impact on cellular functions including drug zzso This study was performed in two zzso melanoma clones to explore the hypothesis that zzso expression in zzso cells is implicated in zzso of cell zzso under stress zzso Our results show that zzso in melanoma cells was associated with resistance to zzso stress produced by zzso agents such as hydrogen zzso and zzso zzso In zzso cells, ability to tolerate zzso stress was evidenced by the presence of a moderate level of zzso and lack of DNA damage response following treatment with zzso Cellular response to zzso stress induced by zzso acid was zzso only in the clone with low zzso activity which also exhibited an increased zzso to zzso The increased resistance of the zzso clone was not related to zzso zzso content but rather to the increased expression of zzso and to a reduced efficiency of zzso formation of toxic free zzso Taken together, these findings are consistent with a contribution of zzso in the mechanisms of drug resistance, because induction of zzso stress is a relevant event in the zzso response to zzso zzso
