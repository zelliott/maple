To investigate the effects of zzso on the features and zzso of cancer stem cells in zzso cells and underlying zzso 

The zzso interference zzso zzso targeting zzso was zzso and zzso into zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso cells were established after zzso selection and the expression of zzso was zzso The cellular features including zzso zzso formation, cell cycle, zzso and zzso zzso were measured in zzso cells cultured under hypoxic condition in zzso zzso cells were sorted from zzso cells with flow zzso zzso formation test and zzso treatment were carried out, and the expressions of related genes zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells were zzso 

zzso zzso zzso cells was successfully established, as evidenced by the reduced zzso and protein expressions of zzso The zzso cells cultured under hypoxic zzso showed higher proliferation and zzso formation activity, cell cycle arrest in zzso lower zzso zzso zzso however the effects of zzso reduced in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were successfully sorted from zzso cells, and the zzso cells showed increased zzso formation activity and zzso treatment resistance in zzso Also the effects of zzso on zzso cells decreased with zzso zzso showing zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso can induce the features of cancer stem cells in zzso cells and increase zzso differentiation and zzso ability of zzso cells, which might be correlated with the changes in expressions of zzso and related genes regulated by zzso
