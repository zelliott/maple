We have previously shown that zzso cell zzso zzso cell lines expressed a complex set of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso It is also reported that zzso and zzso have a zzso value for zzso a patient's prognosis in zzso However, zzso is infrequently expressed in zzso as compared with zzso and zzso In the present study, therefore, we performed a functional analysis of these zzso as a cell zzso zzso using zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso compact zzso formation was observed, and it was inhibited by zzso zzso In contrast, in zzso lines, zzso apparently played a role to form relatively loose zzso and this zzso formation was inhibited by zzso zzso In both zzso the zzso zzso could not inhibit their formation, suggesting that zzso was not an essential zzso for zzso formation in the cell lines expressing complex zzso The zzso zzso inhibited zzso formation only in the cell line that expressed zzso zzso Using western zzso analysis, zzso and zzso these zzso were linked to zzso to make a functional zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso and zzso are shown to act in zzso zzso whereas zzso might play a somewhat different role from zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso
