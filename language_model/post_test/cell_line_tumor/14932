zzso growth factor zzso zzso expression has been linked to progression of zzso breast zzso Many breast cancer cells harbor the zzso and produce its family of zzso suggesting they may participate in zzso and zzso signaling with cells of the tumor zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso in the zzso breast cancer cell line zzso where zzso zzso and zzso were the three zzso most highly zzso zzso signaling was modulated through zzso or zzso of these three zzso using zzso zzso and the impact measured using zzso zzso and zzso expression zzso Changes in zzso zzso and zzso turnover were zzso zzso of zzso or zzso in zzso resulted in decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso and decreased expression of zzso zzso zzso of zzso increased zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso did zzso zzso zzso had no effect on any cellular zzso All the cells with altered zzso production were zzso into female zzso nude mice to form zzso fat pad tumors, followed by zzso analysis for zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso or zzso increased survival zzso zzso zzso while decreasing zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor growth zzso zzso zzso and zzso attraction zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso appeared to elicit a greater effect than zzso on zzso fat pad tumor growth by increasing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso attraction to the tumor zzso zzso zzso We propose these changes in zzso tumor growth were the result of increased recruitment of zzso to the tumor by cells with altered zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso and zzso were somewhat interchangeable in their effects on zzso zzso however, zzso had a greater effect in zzso and zzso had a greater effect in zzso
