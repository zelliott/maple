In the present study, series of zzso incorporated calcium zzso bone zzso with different amounts of doped zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were prepared by mixing a calcium zzso zzso powder and solutions of zinc zzso and the effect of zzso on some physical, zzso and biological properties of the zzso were zzso zzso calcium zzso cement was also made as control, with the mentioned powder and distilled water as liquid zzso The initial setting time and zzso strength of the cement significantly changed from 17 zzso and zzso zzso for the pure calcium zzso to 6 zzso and 6 zzso for the zzso calcium zzso zzso Compared to pure calcium zzso more gypsum zzso were formed in the zinc zzso added samples with a zzso of thin, zzso and zzso zzso The biological properties of the samples were analyzed in the terms of cell viability and cell activity on human zzso zzso using zzso zzso and alkaline zzso zzso activity in the cell culture zzso The best increased cell density and zzso activity were achieved for the calcium zzso cement with a content of zzso zzso % zzso whereas a toxic behavior was observed for the samples with zzso zzso more than zzso
