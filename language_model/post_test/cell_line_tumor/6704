A role of zzso protein 2 zzso as negative zzso of insulin zzso has been suggested, but the zzso pathways regulating zzso zzso gene expression have been established in zzso zzso We show here that the underlying sequence motifs are not zzso in the human gene and provide evidence for regulatory mechanisms involving the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso gene in zzso zzso Two zzso hormone response elements zzso located at zzso zzso and zzso zzso were identified, and zzso of either zzso or zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso zzso Furthermore, two zzso motifs at zzso zzso and zzso zzso are involved in the regulation of zzso gene expression by zzso regulatory element binding protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis revealed that the presence of either E1 or zzso is sufficient to mediate zzso of zzso gene zzso by nuclear active zzso zzso zzso liver X zzso expression of zzso as well as zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso These zzso responses are antagonized by orphan nuclear zzso short zzso partner zzso which might explain its positive effects on zzso insulin zzso in zzso zzso zzso We also provide evidence that despite a lack of sequence zzso within the regulatory region, the principal mechanisms regulating zzso gene expression are similar in rats and humans, being consistent with a role for zzso as a zzso of insulin zzso in zzso
