zzso has been shown to be one of the risk factors for prostate zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of remnant zzso on cell growth in prostate cancer cell zzso 

zzso zzso were isolated as remnant like particles zzso from human zzso We used zzso for zzso zzso and low density zzso zzso for zzso zzso respectively and examined the effect of zzso on proliferation of zzso and zzso cells using zzso zzso Moreover, we studied the effect of zzso and LDL treatment on the regulation of zzso receptors in prostate cancer cells to investigate the relationship between zzso cell proliferation and zzso zzso expression using real-time zzso Western zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso effectively induced zzso cell proliferation more than LDL, whereas both zzso and LDL could not induce zzso cell proliferation except at a higher concentration of zzso LDL zzso zzso was expressed in both prostate cancer cells but there was a sharp difference of zzso regulation between two zzso In zzso cells, LDL decreased the zzso expression in some degree, but zzso did zzso Meanwhile zzso expression in zzso was easily zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso function significantly inhibited both zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso 

This study demonstrated that zzso zzso cell proliferation more than zzso however, both zzso and LDL hardly induced zzso cell zzso The differences of proliferation by zzso might be involved in the regulation of zzso zzso
