Three zzso zzso zzso facilitate nerve zzso Parallel zzso have been shown to guide zzso extension and zzso cell migration on flat sheets via topographical zzso However, incorporation of aligned zzso into zzso zzso to accelerate nerve zzso has proven zzso We report an zzso technique to incorporate parallel zzso into zzso zzso at high surface areas while retaining an open zzso The nerve guide consists of many zzso lined with a thin layer of zzso zzso This design aims to maximize benefits of topographical cues without zzso cellular zzso We support this hypothesis by demonstrating efficient cell zzso in zzso Additionally, this new technique reduces wall thickness compared to our previous design, providing a greater total area for tissue zzso This approach results in an architecture that very closely mimics the structure of zzso nerve but with larger zzso diameters to encourage cell zzso We believe that zzso the native architecture is the first step toward matching autograph zzso Furthermore, this design can be combined with other zzso cues to promote nerve zzso
