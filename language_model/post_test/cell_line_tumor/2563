zzso a selective inhibitor of novel zzso of protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso has been shown to exert multiple effects on cancer cells, including zzso of cell proliferation and zzso However, the molecular mechanisms responsible for these effects are not fully zzso We found that zzso dramatically induced zzso zzso drug activated zzso zzso expression in both zzso zzso and zzso cancer cell lines, suggesting that zzso zzso is a common response to zzso that occurs independently of zzso in multiple cell zzso Although zzso is known to inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso did not affect zzso induction of zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso via a zzso zzso zzso We also observed that zzso protein levels were significantly increased by zzso but zzso zzso did not affect zzso zzso zzso In addition, we demonstrated the involvement of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso signal zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso of zzso attenuated zzso zzso zzso the results of this study zzso for the first time, that zzso of zzso contributes to zzso zzso in cancer zzso
