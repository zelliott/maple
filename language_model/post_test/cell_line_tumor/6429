Directed zzso differentiation is crucial for development of cell therapy and investigation of zzso However, limited zzso agents are available and most of current differentiation regimens are zzso Here we carried out a zzso zzso screen with a random zzso library on zzso zzso cell differentiation toward zzso zzso Two zzso screened from the library were able to direct zzso zzso determined by zzso zzso and zzso zzso This is the first trial of a screening procedure for zzso zzso agents arising from a random zzso library and demonstrates that a random zzso library can be considered as a new resource in efforts to seek new agents for directed zzso As the random zzso library has a broad coverage for the entire zzso screening using random zzso library can be expected to greatly augment the repertoire of zzso for directed zzso
