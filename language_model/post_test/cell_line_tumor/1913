To explore the feasibility of zzso interference in the treatment of melanoma by zzso the zzso gene expression in mouse zzso melanoma cells using zzso interference zzso in zzso 

Small interfering zzso zzso was designed according to zzso zzso A short hairpin zzso zzso zzso expression zzso was constructed and zzso into mouse zzso cells, and zzso interference was induced in zzso Western zzso and real-time zzso were performed to detect the expression of zzso zzso zzso was applied to detect the changes of zzso zzso zzso and other zzso The zzso cells after interference were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to monitor the proliferation of zzso zzso 

zzso could suppress the expression level of zzso zzso the zzso ability of tumor cells on the proliferation of zzso zzso and reduce the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and other zzso in particular the expression of zzso 

zzso interference can inhibit the expression of target gene zzso in mice melanoma cells and the proliferation of tumor zzso It can also reduce the zzso on the proliferation of zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso
