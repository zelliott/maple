zzso zzso zzso zzso are considered zzso in clinical trials of cancer zzso Here, we investigated the zzso of zzso T zzso tumor cell zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso production were enhanced after zzso of tumor cells with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso We examined zzso and zzso pancreatic zzso zzso cell zzso of head and neck and lung zzso zzso treatment of pancreatic zzso followed by zzso with zzso T cells resulted in an zzso of zzso on the tumor zzso The interaction of zzso and the corresponding zzso zzso expressed on zzso T cells is responsible for triggering zzso function in zzso T zzso Moreover, treatment with zzso zzso zzso class I molecules on tumor cells possibly resulting in a reduced binding affinity for zzso zzso zzso expressed on zzso T zzso These results indicate that zzso or zzso zzso stimulation of tumor cells enhances the zzso activity of expanded zzso T cells of cancer patients in zzso
