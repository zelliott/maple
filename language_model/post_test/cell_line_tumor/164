zzso acid, as a terminal zzso zzso on cell surface zzso plays an important role in a variety of biological zzso However, the precise nature of the molecules in gastric zzso has not been unveiled nor documented to be of clinical zzso zzso we measured the expression of alpha 2, zzso zzso acid zzso by using a specific zzso as well as the potential of invasion and zzso of gastric cancer was zzso 

The expression of alpha 2, zzso zzso acid zzso in 100 cases of gastric cancer samples was evaluated using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and flow zzso were employed to determine the zzso positive cells in the gastric cancer cell zzso The activities of invasion and migration were evaluated using the zzso of cell zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso in gastric cancer zzso showed that high levels of alpha 2, zzso zzso acid zzso were closely associated with the invasive depth zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In gastric zzso cell lines, zzso the highly zzso cell line, displayed the most positive reaction with zzso among the selected cell zzso The potential of invasion and migration was confirmed using the zzso of zzso and zzso chamber that zzso exhibited the high activity of zzso to zzso zzso zzso and penetration to zzso 

These results suggested that high level of alpha 2, zzso zzso acid zzso was associated with zzso potential of gastric cancer zzso
