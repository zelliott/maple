zzso screening zzso allows the exploration of complex cellular zzso by automated zzso and is increasingly being adopted for small interfering zzso zzso screening and zzso drug zzso We introduce a series of zzso evaluation metrics that have been implemented and validated in a zzso zzso for regulators of the membrane trafficking protein zzso 1 zzso and have also proved useful for the development of a zzso zzso zzso for regulators of zzso zzso Imaging metrics evaluate imaging quality such as zzso and focus, whereas cell biology metrics are fuzzy zzso zzso describing complex biological parameters such as zzso zzso and zzso The evaluation metrics were implemented in a zzso pipeline, which first filters out cells that do not pass a quality criterion based on imaging metrics and then uses cell biology metrics to zzso cell samples to allow further analysis of homogeneous cell zzso Use of these metrics significantly improved the zzso of the zzso zzso tested, as revealed by an increase in zzso factor, zzso distance, and strict standard mean zzso Cell biology evaluation metrics were also implemented in a novel supervised learning zzso method that combines them with zzso features in a statistical model that exceeded conventional zzso methods, thus improving zzso zzso zzso zzso
