zzso can interact with zzso thereby zzso cell growth and inducing zzso To clarify the roles of zzso in gastric zzso and zzso its expression was examined by zzso on a tissue zzso containing gastric zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 50), and zzso zzso zzso zzso with its comparison with zzso parameters of the zzso zzso expression was analyzed in gastric zzso zzso and cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by Western zzso and reverse zzso chain zzso zzso protein was found to distribute to the zzso of gastric zzso cells with similar zzso zzso zzso An increased expression of zzso zzso zzso was observed in gastric zzso in comparison with paired zzso zzso zzso zzso Lower expression of nuclear zzso was detected in gastric zzso and zzso than that in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed more expression of zzso zzso than did gastric zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Nuclear zzso expression was zzso correlated with tumor size, depth of invasion, zzso zzso zzso and zzso staging zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso was positively associated with depth of invasion, zzso invasion, zzso zzso zzso and zzso staging zzso zzso zzso Nuclear zzso was more expressed in older than younger zzso patients zzso zzso zzso There was a higher expression of nuclear zzso in zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas it was the converse for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Survival analysis indicated that nuclear zzso was closely linked to favorable prognosis of zzso patients zzso zzso zzso albeit not zzso It was suggested that zzso zzso expression may contribute to zzso growth, and invasion of gastric zzso and could be considered as a promising marker to gauge aggressiveness and prognosis of gastric zzso
