There is high current interest in the zzso potential of zzso vegetables zzso particularly due to their content in zzso zzso which upon zzso zzso release the corresponding zzso zzso Some zzso such as zzso zzso from broccoli ( zzso zzso zzso have been found to possess zzso activity through induction of zzso in selected cell lines, as well as indirect zzso activity through induction of phase II detoxifying zzso Japanese daikon ( zzso zzso zzso is possibly the vegetable with the highest per capita consumption within the zzso zzso Thanks to a recently improved gram scale production process, it was possible to prepare sufficient amounts of the zzso zzso zzso as well as the corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso from its zzso This paper reports a study on the zzso and zzso activities of zzso compared with the oxidized counterpart zzso zzso zzso on three human colon zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso together with a detailed kinetic investigation of the direct zzso scavenging ability of zzso and zzso Both zzso and zzso reduced cell proliferation in a zzso manner and induced zzso in the three cancer cell zzso The compounds significantly ( p zzso zzso increased zzso and decreased zzso protein zzso as well as producing zzso and zzso zzso after 3 days of exposure in the three cancer cell zzso zzso treatment was shown to have no toxicity with regard to normal human zzso zzso zzso zzso in comparison with zzso zzso growth zzso zzso and zzso were able to zzso the zzso zzso with zzso rate zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively (at zzso K in zzso whereas the corresponding value measured here for the reference zzso zzso was 425 zzso 40 M zzso s zzso zzso reacted with zzso and zzso zzso in water zzso zzso at 37 degrees C, with rate zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso s zzso zzso recently developed synthetic zzso being zzso zzso converted to zzso It is demonstrated that zzso has interesting zzso scavenging properties, associated with a selective zzso activity toward three human colon zzso cell lines, and very limited toxicity on normal human zzso
