zzso (for zzso zzso is a zzso that is zzso in a variety of human zzso Its product, a zzso of zzso zzso zzso displays intrinsic zzso zzso activity and functions genetically to maintain embryonic zzso gene zzso Here we report the zzso zzso of zzso and demonstrate that it associates with a cohort of proteins shared with the zzso and human zzso zzso zzso complexes, including a zzso of zzso another zzso group zzso Two other members of the novel zzso complex identified here are host cell factor 1 zzso a zzso zzso and the related zzso both of which specifically interact with a zzso binding motif in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and provide a potential mechanism for regulating its zzso zzso zzso zzso a product of the zzso tumor zzso zzso is also a component of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression zzso loss of zzso and reveals a critical role for zzso in the maintenance of zzso gene zzso zzso zzso forms of zzso retain an ability to interact with zzso but not other identified complex zzso These studies link the zzso tumor zzso protein with the zzso zzso zzso machinery, with implications for zzso gene expression in development and leukemia zzso
