The process of inflammation requires the selective expression of a suite of genes in cells of the zzso zzso To identify candidate regulators of zzso we used zzso zzso to compare the zzso of inflammatory zzso zzso zzso zzso bone zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, and zzso We identified genes that were zzso restricted and further elevated in inflammatory zzso and characterized the function of one such zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was enriched in zzso cell lines and zzso zzso and strongly zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells exhibited a zzso distribution and zzso with the zzso marker coat protein zzso Upon zzso of zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso from the zzso apparatus to zzso compartments scattered toward the zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells caused a zzso reduction in the production of the zzso zzso and zzso and the inflammatory zzso NO in response to zzso zzso mice, which have an zzso point zzso in the zzso zzso exhibited reduced numbers of zzso cells, elevated numbers of zzso zzso zzso and higher levels of zzso zzso in response to zzso Thus, zzso acts as a negative regulator of zzso inflammatory zzso
