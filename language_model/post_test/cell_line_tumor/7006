zzso growth of the zzso human zzso can be balanced by the zzso properties of zzso To study the molecular basis behind this, gene expression profiling was performed using complementary DNA zzso zzso In this study, the human zzso cancer cell lines zzso and zzso were used as zzso The zzso cell line, which expresses high levels of zzso zzso alpha and is zzso in growth by zzso was used to study zzso regulation of gene zzso The zzso zzso line zzso expressing both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and inhibited in growth by zzso was used to study zzso regulation of gene zzso Using these two zzso human zzso cancer cell lines, 148 zzso and 148 zzso genes were zzso After functional zzso the zzso and zzso genes could be zzso in different biologically relevant zzso Within the group of zzso growth and/or zzso 81 genes were zzso from which a number of genes could be involved in arranging the cross talk that exists between zzso and zzso zzso On the basis of analysis of the current findings, it is hypothesized that cross talk between zzso and zzso signaling does not occur by zzso of single zzso but rather at the level of differential regulation of different genes within the same functional zzso
