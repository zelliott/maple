zzso in zzso gene expression greatly affect cell zzso zzso factors zzso interact with zzso binding sites in zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso elements zzso are abundant and similarly represented among zzso zzso zzso are important in gene regulation, but their function is not well zzso We have characterized a TE containing functional zzso sites for the zzso zzso zzso zzso responsive element zzso and the zzso transition regulator zzso zzso zzso A zzso promoter database was scanned for zzso to predict zzso with other zzso We identified an overrepresented zzso zzso B1 zzso containing zzso and zzso sites within 35 zzso of each other zzso as zzso This zzso zzso differed from classic zzso by the presence of the zzso site and by its differential zzso conservation outside the zzso zzso zzso zzso appeared recently in evolution, close to the zzso zzso Comparative gene expression in 61 mouse zzso revealed that zzso genes had lower median expression levels than those with zzso B1 zzso suggesting a repressive role for zzso Indeed, zzso was functional and able to bind zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso zzso and zzso and, importantly, to repress zzso zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso were recruited to zzso in zzso and zzso the zzso expression of zzso zzso Our results demonstrate the existence of a widely present B1 zzso in the zzso Because zzso and zzso are relevant in tumor development and zzso zzso may represent a zzso regulatory mechanism and a tool to zzso gene zzso
