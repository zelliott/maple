The ability of zzso stem cells zzso to preserve cancer cells potentially constitutes the adverse effect of zzso cell therapy in the context of zzso zzso In an effort to reverse this zzso feature of zzso we manipulated human zzso zzso zzso zzso to express zzso zzso an zzso that zzso immune suppression by zzso T cell proliferation and triggering zzso in immune zzso zzso of human zzso were generated by plastic adherence zzso zzso zzso of human zzso was cloned into zzso shuttle zzso Then, the zzso virus harboring zzso gene was produced in zzso cells and used to zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein was detected within infected zzso and zzso of zzso was observed in the zzso Two human leukemia cell lines, zzso and zzso were cultured on the zzso of native or infected zzso zzso It was observed that forced zzso expression abolished the zzso effect of zzso on these leukemia cells and enhanced their proliferation zzso effect on activated human zzso as well as leukemia zzso These results suggested that zzso zzso with zzso could be one of the reasonable strategies to reverse their zzso effect zzso for clinical zzso
