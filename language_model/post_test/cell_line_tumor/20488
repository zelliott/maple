A recently identified zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, previously known as zzso is a novel zzso associated with zzso zzso that is required for cellular resistance against DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso The mechanisms of zzso regulation have not yet been zzso Here, we provide evidence that zzso is zzso during zzso exit, suggesting that zzso may be a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso complex zzso Indeed, zzso but not zzso was capable of regulating the protein level of zzso through the zzso box and the zzso Moreover, the zzso and zzso of zzso affected the progression to zzso zzso zzso these data suggest that zzso may be a new zzso zzso of zzso that plays a key role during zzso zzso
