zzso zzso developing in susceptible mice infected by zzso virus complex are associated with highly zzso zzso insertions at one of three zzso called zzso zzso or zzso leading to zzso expression of zzso zzso or zzso zzso factors or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of each of these three zzso has been independently shown to contribute to cell proliferation of zzso zzso Previous studies showed a close relationship between zzso and zzso which belong to the same zzso family, zzso zzso zzso zzso and both zzso and zzso zzso multiple common target genes involved in zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrated that zzso and zzso are also involved in direct zzso zzso zzso through their binding to a zzso zzso binding site in its zzso Moreover, we demonstrated that zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso are able to partially rescue the proliferation loss induced by zzso zzso and identified zzso as a target of these zzso in zzso zzso These results establish that three of the most zzso activated zzso in zzso zzso are actually involved in a same zzso network controlling cell zzso The putative contribution of a similar zzso network module in other normal or pathological zzso contexts is zzso
