A three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue model system was developed to test the zzso of zzso drugs in conjunction with liver zzso Liver cells with different zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso brain cancer cells were cultured in two separate chambers connected in zzso Both chambers contained a zzso tissue engineering scaffold zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso using a zzso zzso We used this model system to test the zzso of zzso drugs, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso With the liver cells, zzso showed a much lower toxicity to zzso cells under both zzso and zzso cell culture zzso Comparing zzso zzso cells cultured in zzso had much high viability under zzso zzso zzso was used to test the zzso zzso zzso zzso with different expression levels of zzso differed dramatically in their ability to activate zzso which led to strong zzso zzso to zzso zzso These results demonstrate that our zzso system could provide a more zzso realistic in zzso environment than the current zzso zzso for testing zzso toxicity of zzso zzso It could therefore be used as an important platform for better prediction of drug dosing and schedule towards personalized zzso
