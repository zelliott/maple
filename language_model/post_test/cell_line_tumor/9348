zzso zzso culture medium was chosen to simulate body zzso and after exposure to zzso approximately zzso T zzso magnetic fields zzso surface tension, zzso dissolved zzso and zzso spectrum were zzso Compared with the control group in the normal zzso field, the pH value increased about zzso units, dissolved oxygen increased about zzso and the zzso zzso were different in peak intensity but without a shift in the zzso Surface tension showed no significant difference in the two zzso This data suggests that zzso can change some of the physical and chemical properties of zzso zzso solution, and may contribute to understanding biological effects of zzso
