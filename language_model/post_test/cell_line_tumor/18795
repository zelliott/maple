zzso a principal component of zzso may contribute to the zzso progression of Barrett's zzso zzso acid exposure in zzso and in zzso has been shown to increase cell zzso The mechanisms underlying the zzso response are not well zzso but may include zzso in zzso zzso activity and zzso signaling zzso 

To ascertain the effects of zzso acid exposure on gene expression in a Barrett's zzso cell line zzso 

zzso cells were exposed to either zzso zzso at pH zzso zzso M zzso zzso or pH zzso zzso for 20 zzso followed by zzso of the zzso Total zzso was extracted before acid exposure and over a zzso time course zzso 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 zzso and zzso to zzso human zzso zzso zzso Data were analyzed using the zzso statistical expression zzso Only zzso in gene expression that were zzso or zzso 2 and zzso or zzso zzso fold were studied further and a subset was further investigated by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso zzso was zzso in zzso cells by western zzso for zzso zzso 3 and an zzso zzso zzso 

Changes in expression were identified for 138 zzso Analysis of gene function identified immediate zzso of genes associated with zzso and early zzso of genes associated with zzso The gene expression profiles suggest that zzso pathways may be involved and suppression of zzso may occur via zzso zzso 

zzso analysis of gene expression changes in a Barrett's zzso cell line has identified cellular pathways that may be disrupted following acid zzso
