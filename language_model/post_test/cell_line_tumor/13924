zzso zzso are almost zzso fatal and display exquisite radiation zzso zzso cells lacking zzso zzso zzso function are more susceptible to zzso zzso than their zzso counterparts expressing zzso zzso We explored the mechanisms of such zzso and found that, in the absence of zzso zzso radiation increases zzso expression and zzso zzso of zzso expression using zzso zzso or small interfering zzso zzso zzso partially blocks zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of the zzso death zzso by expression of zzso has no effect on zzso zzso activity or zzso Our data indicate that, in contrast to commonly accepted models of zzso zzso zzso in our cell system, radiation relies on zzso activity to help mediate zzso cell zzso In a system of zzso zzso activity, zzso activated zzso and, zzso decreased cellular zzso effects that were abolished by zzso zzso In this model, in the absence of zzso zzso zzso is not zzso and zzso activity is sustained and allows zzso and zzso of zzso This model may explain why zzso zzso in adult zzso paradoxically correlate with improved survival and enhanced response to zzso
