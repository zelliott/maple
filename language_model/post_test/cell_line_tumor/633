Many zzso zzso bacteria possess zzso or zzso zzso systems to inject zzso proteins directly into host cells to zzso cellular processes in their zzso A common target is the zzso linked to the delivery of a single zzso zzso by zzso zzso and multiple zzso by zzso zzso coli zzso zzso Here we report zzso as a powerful strategy for defining zzso protein function and mechanisms by which they zzso cellular zzso This is exemplified by our finding that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso a zzso event linked to zzso zzso While this zzso process is dependent on the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso it unexpectedly revealed evidence for zzso zzso independent of zzso interaction and zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, the work defined a long awaited role for protein zzso A zzso zzso of zzso at zzso and zzso Our data are consistent with a model zzso zzso activates zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso then zzso zzso at zzso associated with reduced zzso and inhibited cell zzso Thus, the zzso approach is a powerful strategy for defining novel zzso function with important implications for characterizing mechanisms and regulatory zzso pathways in bacterial zzso
