zzso disease zzso is an zzso dominant zzso zzso characterized by a wide range of clinical zzso An unstable zzso zzso repeat expansion in zzso gene on long arm of zzso 14 has been identified as the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was previously shown to be responsible for the zzso cell death of the zzso In this study, we zzso human zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso full-length zzso with 78 zzso repeats to examine the effects of zzso expansion on zzso cell survival in the early stage of zzso Various zzso agents were used to assess the tolerance of the zzso cells and to compare the differences between cells with and without zzso zzso zzso and zzso experiments showed that the increase in zzso cell death was more pronounced and accelerated in cells containing expanded zzso via zzso zzso Interestingly, under zzso conditions, Western zzso and zzso analyses showed a significant decrease of zzso protein expression and an increase of zzso c in cells containing expanded zzso when compared with those of the parental zzso The same reduction of zzso was further confirmed in zzso cells with zzso zzso In addition, zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso These results indicated that zzso cell death plays a role in the zzso of zzso In our cellular model, full-length expanded zzso that leads to neurodegenerative disorders significantly impaired the expression of zzso zzso which may be, at least in part, responsible for the weak tolerance to zzso toxicity at the early stage of disease and ultimately resulted in an increase of zzso cell death upon zzso zzso
