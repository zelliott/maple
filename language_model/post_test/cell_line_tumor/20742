zzso zzso is a zzso growth factor zzso in various human zzso In the current study, a positive correlation was observed between zzso expression and zzso serum levels of gastric cancer zzso In addition, zzso zzso significantly increased zzso expression in gastric cancer zzso The soluble zzso expression was also zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso inhibited zzso and zzso B zzso thereby suppressing the natural killer zzso cell zzso in zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and its promotion of zzso expression were also observed after zzso treatment and zzso zzso was indirectly bound to the zzso promoter region by interacting with zzso leading to zzso zzso Overall, the current study shows that zzso expression in tumor cells indirectly suppresses zzso zzso by inducing zzso expression and suppressing zzso zzso
