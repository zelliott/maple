Two new zzso zzso fluorescent zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and their detection of zzso and zzso zzso was zzso zzso show that both compounds are highly selective for zzso and zzso zzso over other metal zzso However, zzso is detected directly, while detection of zzso involves a zzso reaction to zzso zzso zzso and zzso of which 3 is able to react with zzso or zzso zzso The interaction between the tested compounds and copper or iron zzso is associated with a large zzso decrease, showing detection limits of zzso zzso zzso zzso studies employing zzso zzso demonstrate that zzso and zzso zzso can be zzso in human zzso zzso cells treated with the tested zzso
