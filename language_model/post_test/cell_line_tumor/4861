Although zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is a clinically zzso therapy for zzso zzso in zzso and recurrence zzso these mechanisms have not been fully zzso We studied the effects of zzso infection zzso zzso on target cancer cells and host immune systems in zzso zzso zzso The zzso cancer cell line, zzso was used in zzso mice in zzso and in zzso In zzso zzso against the cancer cell line were measured by zzso zzso release zzso For zzso cells, zzso zzso cells were obtained from mice injected zzso with zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso infection of cancer cells did not affect the proliferation speed in zzso the mice injected zzso with zzso zzso cells survived significantly longer than those given zzso cancer zzso The mice surviving without tumor growth after injection of zzso cancer cells could not reject a second injection of intact zzso zzso In zzso zzso was enhanced by zzso infection of target cancer cells, but not by zzso the mice with zzso from which zzso cells were zzso Moreover, zzso disappeared by depleting natural killer zzso cells from zzso zzso Although in zzso zzso was increased by zzso the mice with zzso zzso zzso cells, survival did not improve in these zzso These results suggest that a major part of zzso zzso effects can be attributed to the elimination of zzso cancer cells by zzso zzso
