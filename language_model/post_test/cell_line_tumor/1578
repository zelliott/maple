zzso zzso is a candidate zzso and prognosis marker in several kinds of zzso This study was aimed to analyze its expression and biological functions in gastric zzso The expression of zzso was evaluated by zzso western zzso and zzso The biological function of zzso was determined by zzso proliferation zzso zzso colony formation and cell invasion zzso using small interference zzso technique in gastric cancer cell zzso We also explored the regulation of zzso expression by zzso zzso was zzso in gastric cancer cell lines and primary gastric zzso zzso tumors were more likely to be found in old age group and associated with zzso nuclear zzso In diffuse type gastric zzso zzso expression was correlated with age zzso T stage zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in diffuse type gastric zzso was associated with poor disease specific survival by zzso analysis zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cell lines suppressed proliferation ( zzso reduced zzso colony formation ( zzso inhibited cell invasion and migration ability ( zzso and induced zzso phase zzso zzso could also suppress cell growth in zzso ( zzso zzso We finally confirmed that zzso is a putative downstream target of zzso in gastric zzso Our findings supported an zzso role of zzso in gastric zzso zzso might serve as a zzso marker and a potential therapeutic target for gastric zzso
