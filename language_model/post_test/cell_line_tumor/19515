zzso zzso box expressed in T zzso a zzso T box zzso factor, controls many kinds of immune cells, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, and B zzso This study was to explore potential effects of zzso gene on biological functions of mouse zzso zzso cells in zzso 

The zzso expression zzso carrying mouse zzso zzso was constructed and identified by consequence analysis, double restrictive zzso zzso and zzso chain reaction zzso The gene expression in zzso cells was detected by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso into zzso cells zzso cell cycle, zzso zzso expression levels, zzso activity of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso level, and the zzso of zzso cells to mouse leukemia cell line zzso were evaluated 48 hours after zzso 

zzso expression zzso which could express zzso protein in zzso cells was successfully zzso There was no difference in cell cycle between zzso group and zzso zzso There was significant difference in zzso I expression level between zzso group zzso and zzso group zzso zzso but not in zzso II expression zzso there was also difference in mean zzso intensity of zzso zzso between zzso group zzso and zzso group zzso zzso there was also significant difference in NO zzso level between zzso group zzso zzso and zzso group zzso zzso zzso without zzso zzso zzso meanwhile, significant difference was also observed between zzso group zzso zzso zzso and zzso group zzso zzso zzso under the stimulation of zzso (10 zzso for 20 zzso there was also difference in zzso of zzso cells to zzso cells in zzso between zzso group zzso and zzso group zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso I expression and NO zzso level in zzso cells, increases their zzso to zzso cells, but has no influences on the cell cycle and zzso II zzso
