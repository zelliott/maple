It has recently been shown that zzso are the components of vitamin E responsible for zzso the growth of human breast cancer cells in zzso through an zzso zzso Although zzso act on cell proliferation in a zzso manner and can induce programmed cell death, no specific gene regulation has yet been zzso To investigate the molecular basis of the effect of zzso we injected zzso breast cancer cells into zzso nude zzso Mice were fed orally with 1 zzso of zzso fraction zzso for 20 zzso At end of the 20 zzso there was a significant delay in the zzso zzso and size of the tumors in nude mice supplemented with zzso compared with the zzso At autopsy, the tumor tissue was excised and analyzed for gene expression by means of a zzso array zzso Thirty out of zzso genes were significantly zzso Ten genes were zzso and 20 genes zzso with respect to zzso animals, and some genes in particular were involved in regulating the immune system and its zzso The expression of the zzso zzso zzso gene was significantly zzso in tumors excised from zzso animals compared with control zzso Within the group of genes related to the immune system, we also found that the zzso zzso precursor gene was zzso Among the functional class of zzso zzso the zzso gene was significantly zzso in tumors by zzso zzso Our observations indicate that zzso supplementation significantly and specifically affects zzso cell response after tumor formation in zzso and therefore the host immune zzso The observed effect on gene expression is possibly exerted independently from the zzso activity typical of this family of zzso
