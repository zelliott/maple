Several typical characteristics of prostate tissue have been identified including the ability to accumulate zzso However, this feature of prostate cells is lost during zzso and, thus, prostate cells are unable to accumulate zzso zzso in high zzso zzso we can expect that zzso zzso can significantly contribute to the progression of zzso disease and to the ability of prostate cell lines to zzso In this study, we aimed our attention on determining the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes in two prostate cell lines, as the zzso cell line, a model of aggressive partially zzso prostate cancer and the zzso cell line, a normal prostate cell line zzso Moreover, we were interested in the mechanisms through which exposure of these cell lines to zzso zzso could influence expression of the zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso caused elevated expression of zzso a marker of zzso extremely low expression of zzso high expression of zzso and no changes in the expression of zzso Our experimental data show different effect of zzso zzso on expression of the zzso regulatory zzso which may give us more information on their impact on cancer development and progression with possible using for cancer zzso
