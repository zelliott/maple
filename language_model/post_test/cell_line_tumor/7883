The work demonstrates the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for enhanced in zzso zzso and skeletal muscle gene zzso In this report, zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were used as a delivery vehicle for controlled and sustained release of zzso DNA zzso in in zzso as well as in zzso zzso The zzso zzso complex showed remarkable zzso efficiencies against the zzso cells as well as muscle cells in zzso which is otherwise very difficult to achieve by using zzso zzso In in zzso experimental settings, this intelligent zzso zzso is shown to improve the zzso efficiency of zzso zzso zzso complex when used zzso The effect of zzso on the surface charge and particle size of its various complexes with zzso and zzso was also zzso The release profile of zzso from the zzso gel was investigated and pH of the zzso zzso was also monitored to ascertain its zzso arising due to the increased acidity as observed with other zzso zzso The rapid zzso transition of zzso under zzso stimuli with zzso release of zzso under zzso stimulation has potential for site specific, efficient and controlled zzso of therapeutic zzso In short, zzso provides the silver lining in combat against the hurdles encountered in zzso to zzso or other muscle zzso
