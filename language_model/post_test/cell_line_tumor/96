zzso zzso zzso zzso is difficult to diagnose at an early zzso The present study attempted to obtain a zzso zzso against zzso derived from zzso B zzso in zzso by using a zzso severe combined zzso zzso mouse model, and to identify the zzso recognized by the zzso Among the zzso zzso the clinical usefulness of zzso zzso in the zzso was evaluated from the viewpoint of diagnosis of zzso and monitoring of therapeutic zzso zzso tissue specimens from two patients with zzso were zzso zzso in zzso mice and blood samples were obtained and pooled every 2 weeks after zzso until 14 weeks when the mice were zzso A zzso library was constructed from the zzso of a zzso cell line zzso zzso of the libraries was carried out by zzso identification of zzso by a zzso expression cloning method zzso and four zzso were identified as zzso zzso Among them, zzso zzso against two zzso zzso and zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso plaque zzso as the first zzso zzso systems correlated with the zzso plaque zzso to detect zzso zzso against the two zzso were constructed using zzso peptides of the zzso zzso The zzso value was decided by the average and standard zzso of normal healthy zzso zzso against zzso was detected in 10 out of 18 zzso zzso patients and zzso against zzso was detected in 16 out of 18 zzso zzso zzso No patients with lung cancer regardless of zzso exposure exhibited positive zzso zzso against the two zzso Furthermore, the serum zzso zzso decreased after surgical treatment of zzso and increased after recurrence of the zzso The zzso of the zzso against zzso and zzso could be used as tumor markers for the diagnosis and follow up of patients with zzso
