Mouse zzso 1 zzso is a close zzso of zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso possesses a zzso zzso active site zzso suggesting that like zzso it could play a role in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso zzso accumulated significantly less zzso and had increased production of zzso zzso (an indicator of zzso during zzso with zzso zzso acid when compared to empty zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso Reduction of cellular zzso persisted in the presence of zzso inhibitor zzso indicating that zzso zzso lowering can be largely explained by reduced zzso of zzso fatty acids to zzso and increased zzso to zzso rather than by increased zzso zzso zzso supplementation increased zzso synthesis in both control and zzso expressing cells to similar extent suggesting that zzso expression did not reduce flux of zzso zzso through the zzso zzso While zzso expression reduced cellular zzso levels, zzso of zzso and zzso B remained unchanged when compared to control zzso Overall, these results suggest that zzso limits zzso zzso zzso by promoting zzso
