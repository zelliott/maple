zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso T cells is a promising emerging therapy for zzso Prior to clinical testing, it is mandatory to evaluate human therapeutic cell products in meaningful in zzso zzso zzso Here, we describe the use of fused zzso zzso zzso imaging to monitor real-time migration of zzso zzso zzso T cells in immune compromised zzso zzso zzso Following intravenous administration, human T cells migrate in a highly similar manner to that reported in man, but penetrate poorly into established zzso By contrast, when delivered via zzso or subcutaneous routes, T cells remain at the site of zzso with minimal systemic zzso of the presence or absence of zzso Together, these data support the zzso of zzso testing of human zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso In light of their established zzso regional administration of engineered human T cells represents an attractive therapeutic option to minimize toxicity in the treatment of selected zzso
