Most of the Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso in zzso precursor protein zzso which cause abnormal production of zzso zzso are localized at the major zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, using an zzso mouse zzso cell line, our data demonstrated that at the zzso positions of the zzso site at zzso and the zzso site at zzso aromatic zzso acids caused a strong reduction in total zzso On the other hand, zzso with a long side chain caused a decrease in zzso and a zzso increase in zzso and zzso These findings indicate that the structures of the substituting zzso at these key positions strongly determine the efficiency and preference of zzso zzso processing, which determines the ratio of different zzso zzso species, a crucial factor in the disease zzso Our findings provide new insight into the mechanisms of zzso zzso processing and, specifically, into why most zzso zzso zzso are localized at major zzso zzso zzso This information may contribute to the development of methods of prevention and treatment of Alzheimer's disease aimed at modulating zzso zzso
