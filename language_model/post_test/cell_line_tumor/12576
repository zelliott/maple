zzso zzso zzso is commonly found in Southern China and South East zzso zzso virus zzso infection is well associated with zzso and has been implicated in its zzso Moreover, various zzso zzso were reported in zzso However, the underlying mechanism of zzso zzso remains zzso Furthermore, the relationship between zzso and zzso zzso with respect to the zzso of zzso has not been zzso We zzso that during zzso or zzso zzso zzso are initially zzso at the base of the zzso loop domain zzso Upon DNA repair, cell may survive with rearranged zzso 

In this study, cells were seeded at various zzso to induce zzso zzso DNA extracted was processed for Southern zzso In order to investigate the role of zzso especially the zzso membrane protein 1 zzso zzso gene was zzso in zzso cells and zzso breaks were analyzed by inverse zzso chain zzso zzso 

Southern analysis revealed that high cell density resulted in zzso of the mixed lineage leukemia zzso gene within the zzso cluster region zzso This high cell zzso zzso was significantly reduced by zzso zzso zzso Similarly, zzso analysis showed that zzso expression enhanced zzso of the zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that these breaks occurred within the zzso attachment zzso attachment region zzso 

Since zzso locates at zzso a common deletion site in zzso our results suggest a possibility of zzso or zzso zzso in the initiation of zzso zzso at zzso The zzso analysis results also support the role of zzso structure in defining the site of zzso zzso
