Host cell zzso droplets zzso are essential in the zzso C virus zzso life cycle and are targeted by the viral zzso core zzso zzso zzso accumulate in the zzso region and facilitate viral particle zzso but it is unclear how mobility of these zzso is directed by zzso zzso we used zzso fluorescence, differential interference contrast imaging, and coherent zzso zzso scattering zzso to reveal novel zzso changes to zzso zzso zzso of core zzso zzso binding domain II zzso induced slower zzso speeds, but did not affect zzso of movement on zzso zzso the zzso binding strength of zzso further impacted zzso mobility, revealing the zzso effects of zzso zzso These results for zzso coated zzso support a model for zzso zzso zzso that involves core slowing down the rate of movement of zzso until zzso at the zzso region is accomplished where zzso movement zzso The guided zzso of zzso by zzso core protein not only is essential to the viral life cycle but also poses an interesting target for the development of zzso strategies against zzso
