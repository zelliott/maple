Recent advances in the search for novel zzso agents have indicated that the positively charged zzso peptides have emerged as promising agents offering several advantages over the conventional zzso zzso As a naturally zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been proved to exhibit a potent zzso effect and a moderate zzso zzso In order to reduce the zzso activity of zzso and improve its zzso potency towards a range of human breast cancer cells, in the present study, six zzso of zzso were rationally designed and zzso The zzso levels and zzso structural patterns of peptides were zzso while their zzso property and zzso were zzso The results of zzso and zzso zzso indicated that the analog peptides displayed an improved zzso activity and showed an overall zzso therapeutic zzso The zzso of peptides was positively correlated with their zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, the data suggest a strategy of increasing the zzso while maintaining the moderate zzso of naturally occurring zzso zzso peptides to generate zzso with improved zzso against tumor cells but decreased activity against zzso cells such as human zzso This work highlights the potential for rational design and synthesis of improved zzso peptides that have the capability to be used zzso for treatment of zzso
