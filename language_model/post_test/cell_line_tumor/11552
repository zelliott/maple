zzso is an zzso tumor originating from the zzso lineage of the neural zzso It approximately accounts for about zzso of all pediatric zzso zzso Despite advances in zzso therapy, zzso zzso tumors at diagnosis remain a clinical zzso zzso are a class of compounds known to induce both terminal differentiation and zzso of zzso zzso Among them, zzso zzso has been considered one of the most promising zzso agent but it is partially zzso due to both poor zzso zzso and rapid zzso Here, we have developed a novel zzso zzso by which the drug was zzso into zzso stabilized zzso zzso according to the zzso Phase zzso zzso This procedure led to a higher structural integrity of zzso in organic zzso for a longer period of time, in comparison with our previous zzso zzso developed by the film zzso Moreover, zzso were further coupled with zzso peptides for targeting the tumor zzso cell marker, zzso N zzso zzso zzso zzso mice treated with zzso lived statistically longer than mice zzso or treated with free zzso zzso vs both control and zzso zzso Also, zzso resulted in a statistically improved survival zzso vs both control and zzso zzso but to a less extent if compared with that obtained with zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso of tumor sections with zzso specific for zzso and for either zzso or zzso cells evidenced that zzso reduced zzso growth through both zzso and zzso effects, mainly when delivered by zzso Indeed, in this group of mice a marked reduction of tumor zzso of zzso vessel counts and zzso zzso together with a marked zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso In conclusion, the use of this novel targeted delivery system for the zzso and zzso drug, zzso could be considered as an zzso tool in the future treatment of zzso zzso
