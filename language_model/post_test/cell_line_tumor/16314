zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is activated at zzso low zzso zzso in pancreatic zzso However, the molecular mechanisms by which zzso is activated under these conditions and its role in zzso function are poorly zzso In this report, we investigated, in dispersed rat zzso of zzso and mouse zzso zzso cells, the relationship between zzso zzso zzso the free zzso zzso zzso calcium concentration zzso measured directly using an zzso targeted zzso resonance energy zzso calcium zzso and the zzso of zzso We found that a decrease in zzso concentration leads to a zzso reduction in zzso that parallels the zzso of zzso and the zzso of its zzso zzso initiation zzso We provide evidence that this decrease in zzso is caused by a decrease in zzso zzso pump activity zzso by a reduction in the energy status of the zzso zzso we also report that zzso zzso initiation zzso zzso at low zzso concentration plays a significant role in 1) the regulation of both zzso and global protein zzso 2) cell zzso and 3) zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso Taken together, these results provide evidence that a decrease in the zzso status of the cell in response to a decrease in zzso concentration results in zzso zzso pump zzso the zzso of zzso from the zzso and the zzso of zzso which plays an important role in both pancreatic zzso function and zzso
