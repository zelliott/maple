To facilitate the study of the mechanisms of breast cancer zzso we have previously characterized a pair of breast tumor cell lines that originate from the same breast tumor cell line zzso but which have zzso opposite zzso zzso These cell lines constitute a stable and accessible experimental system for the identification of zzso genes and for the study of their role in the process of zzso In this study, we used a combination of zzso arbitrarily zzso chain reaction zzso zzso and zzso zzso (here termed zzso to identify genes zzso expressed with respect to zzso zzso zzso was used to generate radioactive zzso of reduced complexity for zzso to nylon zzso containing 588 zzso of known zzso Single zzso fingerprint zzso zzso from 61 zzso to 116 zzso of the filter array targets, with a signal detection overlap of approximately zzso A total of 344 zzso of the 588 target genes were detected by five single zzso zzso The advantage of using reduced complexity zzso was highlighted by the fact that the combination of zzso zzso before zzso compromised the overall detection rate by up to zzso zzso application of zzso zzso allowed the screening of a greater, and an alternative fraction of the transcript population than was achieved with a zzso total zzso zzso zzso by quantitative reverse zzso confirmed significantly increased expression of zzso 9 zzso in zzso breast tumor cells and of zzso zzso in zzso zzso The differential expression of zzso 9 and zzso was maintained between cells grown as primary zzso in zzso zzso The zzso method enabled the detection of genes not revealed using other screening methods and that are candidates for further investigation in the context of zzso zzso
