zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso is the best marker of sensitivity to the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso but a marker for the zzso zzso zzso has not been identified in lung zzso The present study investigated markers for sensitivity to zzso zzso to zzso and zzso was compared with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso gene copy numbers in lung cancer cell zzso We also studied the effect of these agents on the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso cell zzso We found one zzso cell line with zzso zzso among 19 lung cancer cell zzso Analysis of molecules downstream from zzso revealed that zzso zzso was suppressed in this cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso of a zzso induced resistance to zzso Acquisition of zzso resistance was associated with zzso zzso in this cell line, while pharmacological zzso of zzso markedly enhanced the growth zzso effect of zzso zzso of zzso in association with zzso zzso is a candidate marker for sensitivity to zzso and combined use of an zzso zzso inhibitor with zzso could be a novel therapeutic strategy for lung zzso
