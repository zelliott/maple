In order to achieve zzso targeting of zzso virus zzso gene zzso the promoter of the zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso gene was cloned upstream of the enhanced green zzso protein zzso and the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis performed at 48 h after transient infection with zzso zzso viral particles revealed an increase of zzso in all the cell lines zzso However, zzso expression under control of the zzso promoter element zzso was limited to the tumor cells and zzso zzso Evidence for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was found in all zzso tumor cell lines compared to zzso controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not in zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, tumor cells and the zzso zzso cell line zzso showed a zzso reduction in cell number zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso No statistically relevant zzso effect was observed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso Furthermore, a reduction of zzso incorporation into the DNA was seen after treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 37% zzso In a therapy study of zzso tumors with zzso we achieved total tumor zzso
