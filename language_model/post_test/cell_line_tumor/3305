zzso in the expression of the recently discovered zzso A5 gene strongly affect plasma zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the contribution of zzso to the liver X zzso zzso zzso effect on plasma zzso zzso Following treatment with the zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso zzso levels were decreased in zzso cell zzso The observation that no zzso of zzso promoter activity was obtained by zzso X zzso zzso zzso prompted us to explore the possible involvement of the known zzso target gene zzso zzso regulatory zzso protein zzso In fact, we found that zzso with the active form of zzso zzso zzso promoter activity in a zzso zzso We then scanned the human zzso promoter sequence and identified two putative zzso elements that were able to bind specifically zzso in zzso zzso and were shown to be functional by zzso zzso zzso suppression of zzso zzso through small interfering zzso interference abolished the decrease of zzso zzso in response to zzso Finally, administration of zzso to zzso transgenic mice revealed a significant decrease of zzso zzso in liver tissue and circulating zzso zzso protein in zzso confirming that the described zzso also occurs in zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that zzso gene expression is regulated by the zzso zzso zzso in a negative manner through zzso These findings may provide a new mechanism responsible for the zzso of plasma zzso levels by zzso zzso and support the development of selective zzso zzso not affecting zzso as beneficial zzso of zzso zzso
