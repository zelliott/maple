We aimed to identify putative zzso protein zzso of zzso 

Three breast cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso were used as in zzso models to study zzso Inherent zzso were examined using a zzso survival zzso It was revealed that each cell line differed in their response to zzso These parental breast cancer cell lines were used to establish novel derivatives zzso zzso and zzso displaying significant resistance to zzso zzso zzso cells were compared with parental cells to identify putative zzso associated with the zzso zzso To identify these zzso complementary zzso screening approaches were exploited encompassing two-dimensional gel zzso in combination with mass zzso liquid zzso coupled with tandem mass zzso and quantitative zzso using zzso zzso 

A large number of potential zzso were identified, and several of these were confirmed using Western zzso zzso In particular, a decrease in the expression of the zzso zzso was found in all zzso derivatives when compared with the respective parent zzso zzso expression of this target was also found to be associated with zzso zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso in a small pilot zzso zzso 

These findings suggest that the zzso zzso may provide a general zzso zzso for zzso zzso
