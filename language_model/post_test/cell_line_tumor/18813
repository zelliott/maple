zzso is a prostate zzso protein that is uniquely and abundantly expressed in normal and zzso prostate zzso Due to this expression profile, we examined the zzso of zzso as a potential vaccine candidate for prostate zzso To determine the presence of zzso T cells specific for naturally processed zzso zzso in healthy individuals, we developed and applied an in zzso stimulation zzso Using this zzso we identified zzso T cells specific for zzso in the peripheral blood of a male and a female zzso zzso zzso T cell clones specifically recognized zzso targets, including prostate tumor cell lines expressing the relevant zzso zzso zzso T cell clones isolated from the male donor were significantly less effective in recognizing target cells compared to cells isolated from the female donor and appeared to recognize zzso zzso The identification of a zzso zzso T cell repertoire supports the development of zzso in vaccination strategies against prostate zzso Furthermore, the naturally processed zzso zzso identified provide tools for the development of zzso vaccination strategies against prostate cancer and for monitoring of zzso responses in vaccinated zzso
