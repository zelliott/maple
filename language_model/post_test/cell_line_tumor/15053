Recently zzso have been extensively studied and have proven to be a promising candidate for cancer treatment and zzso In the current study, we examined the zzso activity of a mixture of zzso zzso and zzso zzso solution known as zzso against zzso zzso human zzso leukemia zzso and zzso cells zzso Cancer cells were cultured with different zzso of zzso zzso (1 zzso 10 zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso in the presence of selected zzso of zzso zzso zzso Cancer cell survival was determined by zzso zzso drug zzso by flow zzso and zzso laser scanning zzso zzso and holes and structural changes by atomic force zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso plus zzso resulted in the reduction of the zzso to zzso This was associated with increased zzso of holes inside the cells as compared with control zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso cells did not show changes in their drug zzso zzso with zzso and zzso We conclude that zzso is an effective zzso as indicated by the reversal of zzso cells to zzso and may represent a potential novel zzso for the treatment of zzso human zzso zzso
