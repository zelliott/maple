zzso zzso is the fourth leading cause of cancer death zzso Novel treatment strategies derived from increased knowledge of molecular zzso are constantly being developed to cure this zzso Here, we used zzso display to identify a novel zzso zzso which binds specifically to zzso zzso zzso In zzso the zzso clone zzso was shown to bind to zzso zzso cell lines by zzso and flow zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso specifically to tumor zzso but not to normal visceral zzso in severe combined zzso mice bearing human zzso zzso zzso This zzso ability could be competitively inhibited by synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed that zzso localized to tumor zzso and that it could not be detected in zzso tumor zzso In addition, zzso recognized the tumor tissue but not zzso tissue in surgical specimens from zzso zzso patients, with a positive rate of zzso (19 of zzso With the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso the targeted drug delivery system enhanced the therapeutic efficacy against zzso zzso zzso through enhanced tumor zzso and decreased tumor zzso Our results indicate that zzso has the potential to improve the systemic treatment of patients with advanced zzso zzso
