The recent findings of bone zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso in juvenile zzso and frequent zzso zzso in colon cancer suggest a role for zzso in the zzso zzso and colon zzso We investigated the role of zzso in the zzso 

We assessed zzso zzso expression in cell lines using the zzso zzso chain reaction and zzso We investigated the effect of zzso on cell lines using the zzso zzso and by zzso for markers of zzso zzso and zzso We assessed the expression of zzso its zzso and signal zzso elements in mouse and human colon tissue using zzso We also investigated the effect of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso in mice by assessing colon tissue with zzso and zzso Finally, we investigated the expression of zzso in zzso from familial zzso zzso zzso 

zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso II are all expressed in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell growth in zzso promoting zzso and differentiation and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are expressed predominantly in mature zzso at the zzso surface in normal adult human and mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso and proliferation in mouse zzso zzso in zzso zzso expression is lost in the zzso of familial zzso zzso zzso 

These data suggest that zzso acts as a tumor zzso promoting zzso in mature zzso zzso zzso
