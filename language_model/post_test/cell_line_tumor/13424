The zzso pathway, associated with cancer development and disease zzso is recognized to be an zzso drug target that could present important therapeutic zzso However, no targeted zzso medicines have been zzso yet, reflecting that drug selection procedures requires significant improvement from early research to clinical zzso Thus, new methods permitting both the evaluation of zzso and proliferation zzso effect on cancer cells but also to provide a global fingerprint of the drug action mechanism of new zzso inhibitor candidates are of major zzso Because it can detect very subtle molecular changes and could provide a global fingerprint of drug effects on cells, zzso infrared zzso zzso appears to be a promising method to develop new zzso and zzso tools for chemical library screening zzso In this study, we combine zzso zzso advanced zzso analysis and zzso by standard biological zzso to establish a basis of a zzso methodology for rapid and automated assessment of cell response to zzso zzso and quantitative evaluation of their zzso zzso Our results shows that our methodology is able zzso to detect cell response to an zzso inhibitor exposure even for very low doses, zzso to provide zzso information of interest about its effects on the cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso to predict accurately resulting cell proliferation zzso zzso Thus, further based on a large spectral data base, our methodology could contribute to facilitate preliminary screening of chemical libraries and improving the selection procedure of drug candidates in laboratory zzso
