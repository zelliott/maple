zzso zzso used for cancer gene therapy are usually delivered by direct zzso zzso We studied the role of zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso in an attempt to achieve higher zzso rates zzso larger volume of zzso 

zzso zzso containing either the human zzso zzso zzso or green fluorescent protein zzso as reporter genes were zzso For in zzso studies, human lung cancer zzso cells were zzso with the virus and zzso for zzso expression by radioactive zzso zzso or green zzso activity using a zzso or zzso respectively in the presence and absence of zzso For in zzso studies, zzso tumors were established zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso viral zzso were injected zzso when the tumors reached zzso zzso in zzso Different timing sequences of zzso were examined and viral spread was assessed using zzso or zzso zzso 

In the in zzso studies, zzso cells infected with the zzso construct did not show any difference in gene expression level in the presence or absence of zzso In zzso the effect of zzso on the volume of gene expression in zzso tumors was highly variable with some groups of mice showing better spread in the presence of zzso and others showing reduced spread with zzso 

zzso in zzso zzso spread in response to zzso were not consistently observed in a mouse tumor model using two quantitative zzso of gene zzso
