zzso zzso type D strain zzso which produces the zzso mosaic zzso was isolated from cattle killed by the recent zzso outbreak in zzso The zzso mosaic zzso is the most toxic of the zzso zzso zzso characterized to zzso Here, we determined the crystal structure of the zzso binding domain of zzso from strain zzso in complex with zzso at a resolution of zzso In the structure, an electron density derived from the zzso was confirmed at the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the significant contribution of the zzso surrounding the zzso to zzso zzso In addition, a loop adjoining the zzso also plays an important role in zzso zzso In contrast, little effect was observed when the zzso located around the surface previously identified as the protein zzso binding site in other zzso were zzso The results of cell binding analysis of the zzso were significantly correlated with the zzso binding zzso Based on these zzso a cell binding mechanism of zzso from strain zzso is proposed, which involves cooperative contribution of two zzso binding zzso
