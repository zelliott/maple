zzso a novel gene located on human zzso zzso in the zzso zzso is abundantly expressed in breast zzso zzso expression has been reported to positively correlate with grade and stage of cancer zzso however the functional significance of zzso zzso in cancer biology is not zzso Here, we show that zzso is highly expressed in prostate cancer cell lines and tumors, compared to minimal expression in normal prostate cells and zzso Cellular zzso studies by zzso and total internal reflection zzso zzso revealed zzso expression of zzso in the zzso with intense zzso in the membrane of prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in decreased migration and invasion of zzso prostate cancer cells, and suppressed the zzso activity of nuclear zzso zzso zzso factor resulting in reduced expression of downstream target genes zzso zzso 9, zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth zzso zzso of zzso was also reduced upon zzso zzso suggesting zzso acts as a signaling zzso that increases invasive potential of prostate cancer cells by zzso downstream target zzso Our data strongly suggest zzso zzso in prostate cancer functionally enhances migration and invasion of tumor cells, and is an important target for cancer zzso
