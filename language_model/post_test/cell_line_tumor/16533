zzso progression is controlled by signals from cellular and zzso zzso including zzso cells and the zzso zzso zzso three-dimensional in zzso tumor models are essential to study the interaction of tumor cells with their zzso appropriately in a biologically relevant zzso We have previously used zzso zzso to analyze the zzso growth of human zzso cell zzso zzso cell lines on a zzso equivalent in zzso In this model, SCC cell lines are grown on a zzso gel containing zzso Since zzso play a critical role in the progression of many tumor types, we now have expanded this model by zzso zzso into the collagen gel of these zzso tumor zzso This model was established as a zzso and a human system of skin zzso The effect of zzso on tumor progression depends on their zzso We demonstrate that zzso polarization in zzso zzso can be modulated towards and zzso or an zzso zzso by adding zzso zzso and zzso or zzso respectively to the growth zzso zzso stimulation of zzso cultures resulted in enhanced tumor cell invasion evidenced by degradation of the basement zzso enhanced zzso activity and increased zzso and zzso Interestingly, extended zzso with tumor cells for three weeks resulted in spontaneous zzso polarization of zzso without zzso zzso Thus, we demonstrate that zzso can be successfully integrated into zzso zzso of zzso or human skin zzso and that this model can be exploited to analyze zzso zzso towards a tumor supporting zzso
