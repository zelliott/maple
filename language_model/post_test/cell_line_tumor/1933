zzso zzso are short zzso zzso molecules that have a critical role in the regulation of gene zzso zzso in zzso expression levels have been observed in multiple tumor types and there is clear evidence on their active involvement in cancer zzso Here, a comprehensive zzso expression profiling in 16 pancreatic cancer cell lines and four normal pancreatic samples provided a specific molecular signature for pancreatic cancer and enabled us to identify 72 zzso expressed zzso with approximately half of them being zzso and half zzso in cancer cells as compared with normal zzso Of these, zzso was selected for further functional analyses based on its interesting zzso type expression profile, zzso very low or even absent expression in normal zzso and in six of the pancreatic cancer samples but extremely high expression in the remaining 10 cell zzso Quite unexpectedly, both the zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso pancreatic cancer cells with high zzso expression and forced expression of zzso in zzso zzso with low zzso levels led to reduced cell zzso migration, and zzso More importantly, in zzso cells further enhancement of zzso also resulted in reduced cell migration and invasion, implicating that the level of zzso is critical for these zzso This study highlights a specific zzso expression pattern in pancreatic cancer and reveals that manipulation of zzso expression leads to reduced cell migration and invasion in pancreatic zzso
