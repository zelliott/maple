zzso is a member of the zzso of zzso zzso which has been shown to be broadly expressed in various tumor zzso and which plays an important role in zzso immune zzso The role of zzso in zzso however, remains zzso In this study we used zzso to analyze zzso expression in 61 primary zzso zzso with zzso adjacent normal zzso and 37 zzso and 20 bone zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was expressed in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the intensity of zzso expression in zzso was significantly increased compared with adjacent normal zzso zzso and bone zzso zzso zzso ( zzso Patients with high tumor zzso levels had a significantly shorter survival time and recurrence time than patients with low tumor zzso levels ( zzso Moreover, tumor zzso expression zzso correlated with the number of zzso zzso T cells ( zzso In zzso increasing expression of zzso promotes zzso cell invasion, at least in part by zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, our study provides the first evidence of zzso expression in zzso cells as a potential mechanism controlling tumor immunity and invasive zzso and which is correlated with patients' survival and zzso
