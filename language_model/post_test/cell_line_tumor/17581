zzso of the zzso early protein zzso in transgenic mice leads to the development of zzso primitive zzso tumors zzso In light of earlier reports on the association of zzso with zzso in humans and the involvement of the zzso signaling zzso in the development of zzso tumors, we investigated the interplay between zzso and zzso the key protein of the zzso zzso Our results demonstrate the physical interaction of zzso with zzso through the central domain of zzso spanning zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso located between zzso acids zzso and zzso The association of zzso with zzso zzso the level of zzso in the cells due to increased in the stability of the zzso In the presence of zzso zzso was found in the zzso of cells, suggesting that the interaction of zzso with zzso zzso its nuclear zzso In cells expressing zzso zzso with no nuclear zzso domain, zzso was found in the zzso zzso of zzso with zzso increased the zzso of the zzso promoter, a known downstream target of zzso and artificial promoter whose activity is zzso zzso These observations ascribe a new zzso zzso for zzso and offer an alternative mechanism for the deregulation of the zzso zzso through stabilization of zzso upon its association with the viral zzso
