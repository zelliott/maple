zzso signaling activates gene expression through the induced formation of complexes between zzso zzso factors zzso and the zzso zzso zzso In zzso cancer, zzso zzso zzso zzso transform zzso cells through the inappropriate zzso of a zzso target gene zzso Through a DNA zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso occupancy, we have identified zzso zzso zzso sites in the zzso zzso cancer cell zzso Most zzso sites are located at large distances from zzso start sites, while target genes are frequently zzso by multiple binding zzso zzso discovery zzso define the in zzso zzso site as zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso regions significantly correlate with zzso gene expression profiles derived from primary human zzso and often behave as zzso enhancers in transient reporter zzso
