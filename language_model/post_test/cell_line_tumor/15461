We evaluated the feasibility of zzso zzso zzso in diagnosis and prognosis of zzso prostate cancer zzso in patients with prostate cancer zzso 

zzso zzso are detected from PC cell lines zzso and zzso and zzso using a zzso zzso 800 zzso Then, principal component analysis zzso and support zzso machine zzso are applied for zzso A zzso zzso is used to train and test the zzso 

There are 50 qualified patients, including 33 with zzso prostate cancer zzso and 17 with zzso The spectral changes at zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso between zzso and zzso are detected in both cells and zzso models, which are assigned to specific zzso acids and zzso zzso zzso provided a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso for diagnosing zzso zzso Furthermore, 14 patients with zzso progressed to zzso within 12 zzso These patients are separated into two groups depending on whether their zzso progressed to zzso within 12 zzso zzso could differentiate these two groups with a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso 

zzso has the potential in diagnosis and prognosis of zzso in clinical zzso
