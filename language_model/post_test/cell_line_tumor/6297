Five zzso zzso zzso zzso oxide donor zzso were developed by a parallel synthesis zzso The biological screening revealed that compounds with a zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso chain between zzso and the zzso oxide donor exhibited high zzso potency at zzso and zzso breast cancer as well as at zzso colon cancer zzso Moreover, zzso possessed at least zzso higher zzso at zzso cells than the parent compound zzso although they showed less zzso activity at zzso and zzso A correlation between zzso zzso and growth zzso properties is not zzso However, the high levels of zzso oxide production of the compounds may result in their high zzso zzso
