zzso cancer remains a worldwide burden as the second leading cause of zzso zzso Drug resistance of chemotherapy looms as a major clinical obstacle to successful zzso Recent evidence indicated that zzso can restore the sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso and zzso The expression of zzso and zzso were investigated in gastric cancer zzso and cells zzso and zzso by zzso A zzso reporter zzso was done to understand the potential correlation between zzso and zzso zzso was zzso in zzso cells to confirm whether zzso could regulate zzso zzso zzso was knocked down to explore the role of zzso on sensitivity of chemotherapy in gastric cancer by zzso Western zzso analysis was performed to further explore the mechanism of zzso in regulating drug zzso The results showed that zzso was significantly lower in zzso zzso than those in the paired normal zzso whereas the expression of zzso was just the zzso The significant difference of zzso and zzso were observed between zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso has target sites in the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso reporter zzso zzso of zzso reduces zzso zzso Meanwhile, the zzso of zzso enhanced the sensitivity of zzso cells and changed expression of some zzso These suggested that zzso regulated the sensitivity of chemotherapy to zzso zzso in gastric cancer by possibly targeting zzso
