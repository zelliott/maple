zzso zzso zzso and the resulting fusion protein zzso zzso zzso zzso are detected in 50% to zzso of zzso large cell zzso zzso which is a zzso cell zzso zzso showing zzso zzso with cell surface expression of zzso Because zzso zzso expression was also observed in the zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso transgenic mice, we tested the hypothesis that there might be a functional relationship between the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso In this study, we used the zzso interference method to zzso zzso protein expression in zzso zzso zzso 299 zzso We observed decreased zzso expression when zzso was zzso Further analysis suggested that zzso functioned as the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso cells, which had low zzso zzso were characterized with lower cell proliferation compared with cells in the control group, suggesting that altered zzso expression may correlate to zzso tumor cell growth zzso Combination of zzso repression and zzso zzso leads to significantly increased tumor cell growth zzso compared with one method alone, suggesting its potential application for zzso cancer zzso
