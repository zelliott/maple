Strategies for zzso cancer zzso such as active zzso with zzso particle zzso vaccines, are gaining increasing zzso We developed zzso zzso B virus core zzso zzso that display a surface zzso of the highly selective zzso cell lineage marker zzso zzso 2 zzso flanked by a zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso with these zzso zzso in 2 relevant species zzso and zzso bind with high precision to native zzso at zzso zzso on the surface of living cells but not to the corresponding zzso of the zzso zzso zzso that differs by merely one zzso zzso The induced zzso are capable of efficiently killing zzso expressing cells in zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, they provide partial protective immunity against the challenge of mice with zzso tumor cells zzso expressing zzso Our study provides a first zzso that zzso combining zzso as zzso carriers with specific zzso zzso of a highly selective differentiation zzso may elicit zzso with high zzso and zzso zzso
