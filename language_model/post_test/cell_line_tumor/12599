To investigate the zzso activities of the zzso composed of zzso IV zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso prepared with different zzso The zzso were prepared by linking zzso to zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso or zzso as the intermediate drug zzso zzso of the zzso were determined by zzso The zzso of the zzso were examined by zzso zzso In zzso zzso effects of the zzso were evaluated in nude mice bearing zzso implanted zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso retained part of the zzso of zzso against the zzso The zzso of the zzso and zzso to zzso cells were significantly zzso compared with zzso zzso and free zzso In animal models at the same condition, free zzso zzso and zzso inhibited the growth of zzso tumor by zzso zzso and zzso while zzso and zzso reached zzso and zzso zzso The median survival time of the mice treated with free zzso zzso and zzso were prolonged by zzso zzso and zzso respectively, compared with that of zzso zzso zzso the median survival time of zzso and zzso were prolonged by zzso and zzso respectively, indicating that zzso was more effective than zzso in tumor suppression and life span zzso zzso has more marked selective zzso efficacy and lower zzso and might be a novel candidate for cancer zzso
