Signaling of the zzso zzso zzso member zzso activates zzso pathways to elicit zzso and zzso zzso zzso signaling is regulated by the expression of its zzso zzso on zzso of zzso cells and zzso Here, we analyzed the role of the zzso interaction in the zzso control of solid tumors in zzso zzso In zzso zzso mice, the zzso interaction increased the frequency of regulatory T cells zzso reduced zzso zzso responses, increased zzso and promoted tumor zzso zzso signaling reduced zzso of zzso in zzso and induced zzso zzso T cells zzso to produce zzso a key survival factor for zzso zzso the frequency of zzso and growth of solid tumors were reduced in zzso mice or in zzso mice treated with zzso zzso to block zzso zzso Our findings, therefore, provide a novel mechanism by which the zzso immune system enhances tumor growth and may offer an attractive strategy to treat solid zzso
