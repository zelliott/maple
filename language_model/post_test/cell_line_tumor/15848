zzso defects account for zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso both zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso defective in zzso zzso one of the most frequent organic zzso causing variable neurological zzso Most of the zzso zzso identified affect the zzso 3' zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso sites, the latter predictably through lowering the strength of base pairing with zzso Among the zzso zzso zzso we have focused on the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso identified in four patients (three zzso and one zzso of common geographical origin and causing zzso 13 zzso To study the potential of zzso zzso to restore zzso function, we analyzed the effect of transient zzso in patients' cells with modified zzso adapted to compensate the zzso change and other zzso at different positions of the zzso zzso Using this strategy normal transcript could be efficiently recovered with the zzso disappearance of the zzso zzso skipping transcript, as observed after standard zzso and sequence analysis or using fluorescent zzso and zzso zzso Different efficiencies with up to zzso zzso inclusion were observed depending on the zzso conditions and specifically on the adapted zzso used, confirming previously reported zzso between zzso at the zzso zzso for its correct recognition by the zzso The reversal of the zzso zzso did not result in a significant increase in zzso activity, suggesting other factors must be taken into account for the application of zzso of zzso factors such as zzso as therapeutic strategy for zzso zzso
