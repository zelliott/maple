zzso is a potent zzso membrane zzso employed by aggressive cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso at membrane zzso called zzso where it plays a central role in degradation of the surrounding zzso zzso zzso Previous reports suggested a role for a continuous supply of zzso in zzso zzso However, the turnover rate of zzso and the extent to which the turnover contributes to the zzso degradation at zzso have not been zzso To approach this problem, we first performed zzso zzso Recovery after zzso experiments with zzso zzso focusing on a single zzso and found very rapid recovery in zzso signals, zzso by zzso plots with time zzso of 26 s and 259 zzso The recovery depended primarily on zzso zzso but zzso on lateral zzso Next we constructed a zzso model employing the observed zzso of the zzso zzso The simulations successfully reproduced our zzso zzso Next we inhibited the zzso transport both zzso and in zzso zzso of drugs zzso zzso transport blocked zzso degradation zzso and the simulation showed no appreciable zzso degradation under conditions zzso zzso zzso In addition, the degree of the reduction in zzso degradation depended on the degree of the reduction in the zzso zzso Thus, our experiments and simulations have established the role of the rapid turnover of zzso in zzso degradation at zzso Furthermore, our simulations suggested zzso contributions of zzso activity and the zzso turnover to zzso degradation because there was a zzso and marked reduction in zzso degradation if both factors were reduced zzso Thus our zzso model provides a new in zzso tool to design and evaluate intervention strategies in cancer cell zzso
