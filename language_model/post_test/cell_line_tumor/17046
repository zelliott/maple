zzso immune receptors represent an zzso ancient system that allows organisms to detect and rapidly respond to zzso and zzso zzso zzso are predominantly expressed in immune cells and mediate such a zzso Although this class of pattern recognition receptors is involved in zzso disorders, the knowledge of zzso leading to zzso of zzso and to subsequent zzso damage is zzso We report in this study that zzso causes zzso and zzso dependent on zzso in the zzso zzso is not only expressed in zzso the major immune cells of the brain, but also in zzso of the zzso zzso delivered zzso an zzso derived from zzso and an established zzso of zzso zzso zzso cell death dependent on zzso and the central adapter zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso is involved in zzso damage zzso by zzso This zzso zzso cell death induced by zzso is amplified in the presence of zzso that mount an inflammatory response to zzso through zzso zzso administration of zzso causes widespread zzso in zzso but not in zzso mice, confirming that zzso cell death induced by zzso through zzso occurs in zzso Our results point to a possible mechanism through which zzso delivered zzso contributes to zzso damage and determine an obligatory role for zzso in this zzso
