Although disturbed zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells is thought to generate zzso zzso cells, differentiation of Hodgkin's zzso zzso cells is not fully zzso Recent studies indicate that cells found in a side population zzso share characteristics of cancer stem zzso In this study we identified an SP in the zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso This SP almost entirely consists of distinct small zzso cells, whereas the zzso is a mixture of relatively large cells with H or zzso zzso zzso Culture of the small zzso cells in the SP from zzso generated a zzso Single cell culture of the SP cells generated large cells with H or zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso and zzso nuclear zzso zzso activity, both of which are characteristics of zzso cells, are shared between the SP and zzso cells for both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso induced zzso in both zzso whereas the SP cells were resistant to a conventional zzso agent zzso The results show that zzso cell lines contain an SP, that is enriched for distinct small zzso cells and generates larger cells with H and zzso zzso zzso The results also stress the significance of zzso zzso for zzso of zzso zzso
