To investigate the relationship of the zzso genes and its copy numbers variation in the highly zzso human zzso zzso cancer cell line zzso 

The zzso expressed genes and its copy number variation between zzso cell line and normal zzso zzso was detected by human zzso zzso zzso gene chip and human mapping zzso array zzso gene zzso and the data was analyzed by zzso Some of zzso genes were validated the results of single zzso zzso zzso and zzso chips by zzso in zzso zzso zzso and real-time quantitative zzso 

zzso analysis of two gene chips data showed that there were 385 zzso expressed genes in the same and zzso zzso zzso point (6 of them, included 2 zzso between zzso cell line and normal zzso zzso these copy number amplification of zzso zzso zzso point of zzso were zzso or zzso 3, which had zzso deletion zzso or zzso 1 had zzso zzso location analysis showed that there were 385 zzso expressed genes located at all zzso and 261 of them zzso zzso located at 10 zzso included that 34 zzso 33 zzso 28 zzso 27 zzso 25 zzso 24 zzso of them located at zzso 3, 2, 9, 10, 1 and 11 respectively, and 23 zzso of them at zzso 6 and 12 each, 22 zzso of them at zzso 4 and 5 zzso For the function of zzso expressed zzso the results showed that 99 zzso genes belonged to the family of zzso and their regulators, 54 zzso genes associated with signal zzso 50 zzso genes associated with zzso acid zzso and 36 zzso genes associated with protein zzso 

We have demonstrated that there are 4 kinds of zzso expressed genes related to zzso of zzso cancer, which belonged to the families zzso and its regulator, zzso acid zzso signal zzso and protein zzso and located at zzso 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11 and zzso
