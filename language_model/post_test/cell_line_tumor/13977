zzso in the form of zzso zzso induced zzso zzso and zzso proteins in normal human and mouse zzso zzso and zzso are known to be associated with each other, resulting in enhanced zzso DNA binding by zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced the DNA repair branch of the zzso pathway, while zzso and cell cycle arrest were zzso zzso zzso with zzso protected normal zzso from subsequent DNA zzso In the current study, zzso and zzso were shown to interact zzso with zzso in targeting a zzso DNA repair zzso Moreover, like zzso and zzso zzso was required for zzso DNA damage protection, as zzso zzso mouse zzso were not protected from zzso by zzso zzso These findings indicate that besides zzso and zzso zzso is required for zzso protection from DNA zzso The data are consistent with selective induction of the DNA repair branch of the zzso zzso by zzso
