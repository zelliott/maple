zzso zzso zzso lung zzso eventually become resistant to treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The combination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso can overcome acquired resistance in mouse models and human zzso Because zzso is also a potent zzso zzso we investigated the role of zzso in zzso tumor zzso We show in zzso and in zzso that zzso plus zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso resistance or sensitivity, respectively, in all studied cell line zzso FISH analysis revealed that zzso was amplified in zzso of tumors with acquired resistance versus only zzso of zzso lung zzso zzso zzso amplification and zzso were mutually zzso zzso these results reveal a previously zzso mechanism of resistance to zzso and provide a rationale to assess the status and possibly target zzso in zzso tumors with acquired resistance to zzso
