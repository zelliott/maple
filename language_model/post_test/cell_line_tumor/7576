The aim of this study was to determine the efficacy of zzso zzso zzso zzso in comparison with zzso C zzso to prevent tumor cell zzso in an animal model of superficial zzso cancer and search for possible zzso of zzso Female Fisher 344 rats were used to study the effects of zzso and zzso C for the prevention of transitional cell tumor zzso zzso Twenty rats served as a control, tumor zzso and saline wash zzso Sixty rats were treated with zzso zzso 200 and 400 zzso zzso for 60 or 120 zzso after tumor zzso Thirty other rats were divided equally and zzso with 400 zzso zzso or saline for 120 zzso before tumor zzso In a separate series of experiments, 30 rats were treated 2 weeks after tumor initiation with saline or zzso zzso zzso In a different experiment 39 rats were treated with: saline zzso zzso zzso 400 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 400 zzso zzso were sacrificed 3 weeks following zzso Gross and zzso analyses were performed on the zzso zzso and zzso C prevented zzso tumor growth in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso or treatment 2 weeks post tumor zzso did not have therapeutic zzso zzso modeling suggests that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso prevents zzso tumor zzso with a slightly better efficacy than zzso C in this experimental zzso The data suggest that zzso lowers zzso activity and lowers probability of cancer cell zzso rather than direct cancer cell zzso
