To evaluate a novel strategy of zzso of human zzso by targeting the neural cell zzso zzso zzso which is zzso on zzso 

zzso expression on the cell surface of established zzso cells was shown by flow zzso A zzso mouse model using zzso zzso cells to induce subcutaneous zzso growth was zzso zzso was used to label zzso zzso specific zzso zzso generating the zzso zzso which showed a high affinity to zzso also after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso showed low zzso zzso zzso zzso of injected dose per gram of zzso after 72 zzso which continuously decreased over the 96 h investigation period, demonstrating clearance of zzso In contrast, zzso accumulated zzso continuously up to a peak of zzso at the 96 h time point zzso at 72 zzso This specific zzso could be blocked by application of zzso zzso zzso zzso of blood specific zzso revealed a characteristic clearance over the first 72 zzso With 37 zzso zzso zzso reached therapeutic doses after 96 zzso 

These results indicate that zzso zzso has the ability to probe zzso zzso cells in zzso with high efficiency and is a promising zzso for the diagnosis and treatment of zzso human zzso especially for zzso
