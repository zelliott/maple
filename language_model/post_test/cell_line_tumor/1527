Gender bias in the zzso of zzso cancer is well known, however, the underlying mechanism is largely zzso The current study determines variations in the molecular characteristics of zzso zzso between men and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were collected from a total of 125 men and women who underwent surgical zzso zzso levels in serum and zzso cancer zzso were elevated in women while it decreased in men compared to respective control zzso zzso zzso binding activity increased in men and decreased in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression increased in a majority of men while it decreased in a majority of women except those with zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso of women, zzso correlation analysis showed a positive correlation of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso zzso showed a negative correlation with zzso In case of men, zzso zzso showed a positive correlation with zzso and zzso D1 proteins in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso showed a positive correlation with zzso Our study identified for the first time that zzso is zzso regulated by zzso in zzso cancer zzso Further, our in zzso studies with a zzso cell line zzso showed zzso as the potent inhibitor of zzso that zzso cell proliferation even in the presence of zzso Thus, the current study suggests that: zzso the varying pattern of testosterone level and zzso status in zzso zzso of men and women may zzso to the gender specific zzso of zzso tumors and zzso zzso plays a significant role in determining the zzso gene expression pattern and thus, zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso
