zzso controls the differentiation and proliferation of zzso zzso cells both during development and in the adult, while its expression is frequently zzso in prostate zzso zzso control of zzso expression and in particular, factors that function via the zzso zzso zzso promoter are poorly zzso 

zzso reporter zzso zzso zzso shift zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso were performed to identify and functionally characterize sites of zzso factor binding within the initial zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso reporter studies of the zzso zzso zzso promoter sequence localized positive zzso activity between zzso and zzso zzso analyses identified the presence of two overlapping zzso binding sites within this region, designated zzso and zzso which exhibited zzso and zzso zzso respectively, to the zzso consensus binding zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicated binding of both zzso zzso and a zzso zzso protein solely to zzso a result that was confirmed in zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter reporter activity and zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein levels in the zzso prostate cancer cell line, demonstrating a functional role for zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso expression in zzso cells is zzso in part via its interaction with an zzso located in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may regulate zzso during prostate development, with the zzso zzso expression and cellular zzso frequently observed in human prostate tumors potentially contributing to the abnormal expression of zzso
