zzso zzso is an important factor in assessment of both cancer progression and cancer treatment zzso This has driven a substantial effort toward development of imaging zzso that can directly measure oxygen distribution and therefore zzso in zzso Although several approaches to measure zzso exist, direct measurement of tissue oxygen through an imaging approach is still an zzso zzso To address this, we present a new approach based on in zzso application of zzso lifetime imaging zzso to map the distribution of oxygen partial pressure zzso in zzso This method zzso zzso blue, a dye widely used in clinical applications, as an zzso imaging zzso zzso measurement of oxygen relies upon zzso zzso lifetime of the zzso A zzso imaging system was designed and built to achieve ultrasound zzso zzso and zzso imaging within the same zzso zzso mice bearing zzso zzso zzso tumors were used as the target zzso zzso regions were identified within the tumor in a combined zzso zzso Finally, the statistical zzso of zzso in zzso normal, and control zzso were compared with zzso by a zzso oxygen zzso A statistically significant drop in mean zzso was consistently detected by both methods in zzso
