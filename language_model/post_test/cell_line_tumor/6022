Clinical trials combining zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso with zzso chemotherapy in zzso cell lung cancer zzso have not produced a survival zzso This may be caused by antagonism between the two drugs or zzso that promote such, possibly zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso a critical growth regulator downstream of zzso may play a zzso This study aimed to explore the relationship between zzso zzso and cell cycle arrest in combination zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were treated with zzso and/or the zzso inhibitor zzso and analyzed with median effect zzso Cell cycle distribution and zzso zzso were assessed using flow zzso and zzso zzso Effect on zzso after zzso zzso by zzso was also zzso 

zzso interaction was dose dependent with antagonism at high dose zzso zzso arrest was observed with both high dose zzso and high dose zzso and therefore was zzso associated with zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was increased by zzso and its suppression by zzso was related to antagonism particularly in zzso zzso effect in antagonism was further confirmed by using zzso Greater antagonism was observed in the zzso zzso cell line and zzso zzso by zzso resulted in increased sensitivity to zzso as well as combination zzso 

Our findings are consistent with a model in which zzso zzso favors zzso and the outcome depends on the balance between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance to zzso as well as combination zzso
