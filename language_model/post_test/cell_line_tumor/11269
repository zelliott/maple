Distant zzso is the major cause of zzso death in patients with zzso cancer zzso Although the zzso zzso family is a crucial inhibitor of zzso transition zzso in human cancer, the role of zzso members in the zzso of zzso zzso has not been zzso 

zzso pairs of primary zzso and corresponding matched liver zzso tissue specimens were zzso for expression and zzso status of the zzso family zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso was investigated in zzso cell lines, and cells were zzso for zzso invasion and zzso zzso of several zzso target genes zzso zzso and zzso and zzso markers zzso and zzso in zzso cell lines and tissue specimens was zzso 

Liver zzso zzso showed higher expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso liver zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso liver zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso than did primary zzso which was significantly associated with zzso of the promoter region of these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso liver zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The invasive front in primary zzso zzso revealed low zzso expression by in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso precursors resulted in enhanced cell proliferation but reduced invasion and migration zzso in zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cell lines caused reduced expression of putative gene targets, and resulted in increased zzso and reduced zzso zzso The associations between zzso target genes and zzso markers were validated in primary zzso and matching liver zzso zzso 

zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso Its expression is zzso zzso and zzso may serve as a potential diagnostic marker and therapeutic target for patients with zzso
