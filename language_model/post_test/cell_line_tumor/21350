zzso work on differential protein expression in zzso is zzso and we therefore used zzso cells zzso incubated with either zzso or zzso to arrest zzso zzso were identified by zzso and zzso with subsequent zzso of spot volumes with specific zzso zzso was used for zzso of selected zzso zzso of 10 individual proteins were increased and levels of 6 proteins were decreased zzso by both zzso These proteins were constituents of heat shock and zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA replication signaling as well as zzso and zzso zzso Identification of zzso proteins is of importance for the interpretation of previous work and for designing future zzso
