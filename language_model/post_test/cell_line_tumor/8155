zzso and zzso zzso that are engineered to zzso play a key role in providing solution for sustained zzso This study is focused on preparation, drug zzso efficiency, zzso drug release, zzso cellular zzso and cell viability of zzso grafted zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were prepared by a modified zzso emulsion method and characterized by laser light zzso atomic force zzso zzso and zzso zzso The drug zzso efficiency was determined zzso and zzso drug release was estimated using dialysis zzso Breast cancer cell line zzso was used to image and measure the cellular zzso of fluorescent zzso zzso Cancer cell viability was assessed by treating zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso by crystal violet zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso zzso were superior in properties such as drug zzso efficiency, the cellular zzso and the cancer cell zzso
