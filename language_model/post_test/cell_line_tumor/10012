zzso peptides exert multiple biological effects by binding to two types of G zzso receptors known as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in human breast cancer was recently reported, but up to now the consequences of its stimulation are zzso Our aims were zzso to investigate the capacity of zzso to trigger cell proliferation in breast cancer cells, zzso to explore some of the downstream events occurring after zzso stimulation that may be linked to cell zzso and zzso to determine whether human breast tumors express potentially active zzso assessed by the binding of a zzso zzso Breast cancer cells expressed both the zzso and the zzso protein of zzso that once zzso triggered cell proliferation at zzso zzso of the zzso zzso studies suggested that the zzso effects depend on the activity of zzso growth factor zzso and subsequent zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso binding sites, were detected in 3/4 zzso in zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso invasive zzso zzso The zzso growth factor zzso zzso may be a key interaction that maintains tumor growth, and antagonism of zzso may be a valuable alternative for the treatment of breast zzso
