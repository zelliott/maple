zzso mechanisms in zzso lung cancer remain poorly understood leaving this tumor with the worst prognosis among all lung zzso Unlike other cancer types, sequencing zzso approaches have been of limited success in zzso lung cancer, zzso no zzso zzso with potential driver characteristics have emerged, as it is the case for zzso zzso of zzso growth factor zzso in zzso lung zzso zzso gene expression analysis has also produced zzso signatures with limited application, since they are generally not robust across zzso Nonetheless, additional zzso approaches are warranted, due to the increasing availability of suitable zzso lung cancer zzso Gene zzso network approaches are a recent and promising zzso since they have been successful in identifying gene zzso that drive zzso traits in several biological systems, including other cancer zzso 

We derived an zzso zzso from weighted gene zzso network analysis zzso of a lung cancer zzso The zzso termed zzso hub network zzso robustly separates zzso from other lung cancer types across multiple zzso and multiple platforms, including zzso and shotgun zzso The zzso was also zzso in zzso cell zzso zzso is enriched for zzso signaling network hubs strongly associated with the zzso zzso Twenty of these hubs are zzso zzso with zzso potential, among which zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits one of the highest overall statistical associations to zzso In patient tissue zzso and cell lines, zzso can be separated into zzso and zzso zzso zzso decreases proliferation rate and increases cell death of zzso zzso cell lines, suggesting a role for zzso as an zzso driver in a subset of zzso 

zzso treatment has thus far been limited to chemotherapy and zzso Our zzso analysis identifies zzso both as a candidate zzso to zzso zzso patients and as a potential therapeutic zzso In zzso zzso represents an alternative strategy to large scale sequencing for the identification of potential zzso drivers, based on a systems view of signaling zzso This strategy is especially useful in cancer types where no zzso zzso have zzso
