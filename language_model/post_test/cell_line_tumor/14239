Cell culture models of zzso resistance often involve applying selective pressures of zzso deprivation simultaneously with addition of tamoxifen or zzso zzso zzso zzso which makes it difficult to distinguish events in development of zzso resistance from those in loss of response to zzso or other zzso We describe here time courses of loss of zzso response using either zzso or zzso zzso cells in which the only zzso to the culture medium was addition of zzso M tamoxifen or zzso M zzso In both zzso and zzso models, loss of growth response to tamoxifen was not associated with loss of response to zzso However, loss of growth response to zzso was associated in both models with zzso loss of growth response to zzso zzso of zzso zzso alpha zzso and zzso zzso beta zzso zzso by real-time zzso together with zzso and zzso protein by Western zzso revealed substantial changes to zzso levels but very little zzso to zzso levels following development of zzso zzso In zzso cells, tamoxifen resistance was associated with raised levels of zzso zzso However by contrast, in zzso zzso cells, where zzso deprivation alone had already resulted in increased levels of zzso zzso long-term tamoxifen exposure now reduced zzso zzso zzso long-term exposure to zzso reduced zzso zzso levels in the zzso cells to a level barely zzso by Western zzso and zzso in inducing gene expression zzso reporter or zzso in zzso cells the reduction was much less substantial and these cells retained an zzso of both the zzso reporter gene and the zzso zzso gene which could still be inhibited by zzso This demonstrates that whilst zzso can be zzso by zzso and increased by tamoxifen in some circumstances, this does not always hold true and mechanisms other than zzso to zzso must be involved in the development of zzso resistant zzso
