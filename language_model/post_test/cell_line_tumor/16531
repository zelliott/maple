zzso is a member of the Ras zzso of small zzso that has been linked to poor outcomes in patients with breast zzso The zzso zzso is zzso zzso in most human breast zzso and also zzso a poor zzso The present results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso positive zzso breast cancer zzso We show that zzso forms a complex with zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso promoter and activates zzso gene zzso in an zzso zzso In turn, zzso contributes to the zzso of zzso abundance in breast cancer cells by attenuating degradation of zzso in zzso zzso of an inactive zzso zzso in zzso breast zzso cells confirmed that zzso regulates zzso zzso The functional significance of the zzso interaction is supported by the demonstration that zzso zzso the formation of zzso by a zzso zzso Analysis of zzso databases further showed that zzso zzso is expressed at higher levels in breast zzso as compared to that in normal breast zzso zzso zzso and zzso breast zzso have increased levels of zzso zzso and zzso patients with zzso breast tumors have a significantly decreased zzso overall survival as compared to those with zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso and zzso function in an zzso loop that contributes to zzso of zzso in breast cancer zzso
