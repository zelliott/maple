zzso zzso is frequently observed in zzso and its association with zzso has been zzso through the interaction between zzso Lewis zzso present on this zzso and zzso zzso of soluble zzso recognized by zzso zzso zzso were also frequently elevated in the zzso of lung zzso zzso The aim of this study was to demonstrate the presence of zzso carrying zzso zzso zzso designated as zzso and subsequently evaluate the clinical significance of circulating zzso in patients with lung zzso We developed a sandwich zzso system using zzso zzso and zzso zzso to detect zzso and also measured circulating zzso levels in 97 healthy controls and 103 patients with lung zzso zzso zzso levels were measured in the zzso taken before treatment and then were evaluated to clarify whether such levels were related to the clinical zzso zzso of circulating zzso were significantly higher in lung zzso patients than in healthy subjects, and a higher serum zzso level was correlated with the presence of distant zzso The overall survival rate for patients with high serum zzso levels was significantly poorer than that of patients with low serum zzso zzso The survival analysis restricted to the patients with distant zzso also showed the same zzso In a zzso survival analysis in lung zzso patients, a high serum zzso level was indicated as an independent zzso zzso In conclusion, the circulating zzso level at diagnosis is useful for predicting a poor prognosis in patients with lung zzso
