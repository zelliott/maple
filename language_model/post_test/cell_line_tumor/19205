Current zzso protein profiling methods such as zzso and fluorescent zzso difference in gel zzso zzso evaluate small portions of complex zzso zzso sample zzso is essential for more comprehensive zzso coverage and detection of zzso zzso In this study, we describe the combination of zzso labeling with zzso solution zzso zzso zzso and subsequent analysis on slightly overlapping narrow pH range zzso zzso By zzso tagging and mixing samples and controls prior to zzso complications resulting from minor zzso variations during zzso zzso of multiple samples are zzso This greatly improves the reliability of quantitative zzso To illustrate its utility, this 3-D zzso strategy was applied to analysis of human melanoma cells and mouse lung tissue zzso zzso 1000 zzso spots can be obtained from narrow range zzso gels of individual zzso zzso and approximately zzso spots can be obtained from entire zzso zzso changes in closely related samples could be more reliably detected and the method has a greatly increased capacity to distinguish between closely related protein zzso Thus the 3-D zzso strategy produces a powerful method for more comprehensive and more reliable quantitative comparisons of protein profiles of very complex zzso
