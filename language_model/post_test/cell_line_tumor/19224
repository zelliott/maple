The zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso is expressed at higher levels in breast cancer, especially in zzso breast cancer, than in normal breast zzso Furthermore, it is known that an increased expression of the zzso protein triggers an increase in cell zzso According to in zzso experiments, it was supposed that it is the nuclear fraction of the zzso which causes the increase in cell zzso Here, we examined the zzso distribution of the zzso protein within the living cell, zzso the import of the zzso protein into the zzso The nuclear import zzso of zzso zzso breast cancer cells were compared to the import zzso of zzso cells similar to normal breast zzso zzso zzso showed a highly significant increase in the recovery of zzso zzso in the cancer cells, so that a differentiation of zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso cells on the basis of transport processes of the zzso protein between the nucleus and the zzso seems to be zzso zzso of the mobility and zzso of the zzso protein in normal and in cancer cells in zzso could constitute a new basis to characterize the zzso and zzso potential of breast zzso
