zzso plays a major role in Parkinson zzso zzso the mechanisms of zzso zzso is essential to understand the formation of zzso bodies and their involvement in zzso cell zzso zzso is zzso in zzso bodies, but the role of zzso zzso has been zzso We now report that the zzso zzso zzso seven in zzso zzso zzso directly interacts with and zzso zzso and promotes its zzso in zzso and in zzso which is toxic to zzso Mass zzso analysis demonstrates that zzso zzso zzso at zzso 12, 21, and 23, which were previously shown to be zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10, 34, 43, and 96 as zzso zzso of zzso expression by short hairpin zzso to zzso and zzso abolished zzso zzso in zzso cells, indicating that zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso with zzso from brain zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso of a zzso zzso less prone to zzso zzso increased zzso of zzso by zzso zzso increased the zzso of zzso in zzso At the electron zzso level, zzso zzso promoted the formation of massive amounts of zzso zzso zzso also increased zzso zzso in zzso as observed by increased formation of zzso inclusion bodies within zzso zzso These inclusions are toxic to cells, and their formation was prevented when zzso zzso expression was zzso Our data suggest that zzso represents a possible trigger event for zzso zzso and zzso body zzso
