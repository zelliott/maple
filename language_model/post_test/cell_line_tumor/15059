The human zzso 4 zzso is zzso expressed in pancreatic zzso and tumor cell lines, while remaining zzso in normal zzso indicating its important role in pancreatic cancer zzso Although its zzso regulation has been investigated in considerable detail, some important elements remain zzso The aim of the present study was to demonstrate the existence of a novel zzso element in the zzso promoter and characterize some of its binding zzso By zzso reporter zzso we located the zzso element between zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso promoter using a series of deletion and zzso reporter zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso with zzso cell nuclear extracts revealed that one protein or protein complex bind to this zzso The proteins binding to this element were zzso and identified as zzso Yang 1 zzso by mass zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed that zzso binds to this element in zzso and in zzso Moreover, transient zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso promoter activity and zzso zzso protein zzso In conclusion, we reported here a novel zzso element in the human zzso zzso This provides additional data on zzso gene regulation and indicates that zzso may be a potential target for abnormal zzso zzso
