zzso zzso is the most common type of bone zzso Even with early diagnosis and aggressive treatment, the prognosis for zzso is zzso In the present study, we investigated the proliferation and invasion zzso effect of zzso zzso on human zzso cells and the possible molecular mechanisms zzso We demonstrated that zzso can inhibit zzso decrease migration, reduce invasion and induce zzso in human zzso zzso Using an in zzso tumor animal model, we confirmed that zzso can prevent zzso formation and maintain intact bone structure in zzso zzso In addition, we examined the possible molecular mechanisms zzso the function of zzso We found that the total protein levels and zzso activity of zzso in zzso cells are reduced by zzso treatment, and this may result from the increased zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso effect of zzso on zzso cells is reversed by zzso of zzso but is further enhanced by zzso of zzso zzso zzso our results reveal that zzso can inhibit tumor growth of zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a promising chemotherapy agent in the treatment of human zzso
