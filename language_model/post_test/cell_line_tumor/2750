zzso interference zzso is a potent and specific mechanism for eliminating the zzso of specific zzso This gene zzso mechanism occurs naturally and is highly zzso from plants to human cells, holding promise for functional zzso and for zzso medicine due to its unlimited potential to treat zzso zzso and infectious zzso However, efforts to unleash the enormous potential of zzso have met with significant zzso zzso is problematic because short interfering zzso zzso are zzso charged zzso that zzso enter cells and undergo rapid zzso degradation in zzso In addition, the synthesis of zzso is expensive for long-term research and therapeutic zzso Recently, we have shown that zzso bacteria can be engineered to activate zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso This new approach offers several advantages and has significant zzso First, this method allows the establishment of a long-term stable gene zzso system in the laboratory against genes of interests in zzso and in zzso and enables zzso functional zzso screening in zzso zzso zzso libraries can be constructed, zzso zzso zzso and used with the help of zzso coli as currently done with gene zzso Second, this technology provides a clinically compatible way to achieve zzso for therapeutic applications due to the proven clinical safety zzso bacteria as a gene carrier, zzso also eliminates the zzso manufacture issue, and may circumvent or mitigate host zzso responses since zzso is produced zzso
