Although zzso of zzso contributes to regulation of gene zzso few methods have been available to determine the zzso zzso zzso profile in specific cells or zzso We have now developed a zzso screening method, differential zzso scanning zzso to isolate zzso fragments embedded in zzso subject to differential zzso This zzso screening was applied to a human gastric cancer cell line incubated with or without an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso activity, resulting in the rapid identification of more than 250 zzso zzso Interestingly, a number of zzso genes were revealed to be the targets of zzso in the cancer cells, including those for zzso protein 73 and cell division cycle zzso Such differential zzso of zzso was also shown to be linked to the regulation of zzso activity of the corresponding zzso Among the isolated zzso fragments, zzso zzso of them were confirmed to be bound to zzso zzso zzso and the genes corresponding to zzso zzso of them exhibited differential zzso activity consistent with the level of zzso zzso With its high zzso the zzso method should open a possibility to rapidly compare the zzso zzso zzso profiles and to provide novel insights into molecular zzso
