The zzso adapter zzso zzso in zzso induction by recruitment of downstream partners such as members of the zzso family, leading to zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso A zzso zzso search for zzso proteins yielded the zzso domain zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We showed that zzso associates with two different zzso of zzso in both dependent and independent zzso zzso The zzso association requires the zzso binding ability of zzso It takes place downstream of the zzso domain of zzso within an zzso zzso characteristic of the binding of zzso to its targets, where the central zzso zzso is zzso Its zzso association takes place at the C zzso of zzso zzso strongly zzso the ability of zzso to activate the zzso and zzso pathways and to induce zzso zzso depletion of zzso can increase zzso induction in response to zzso or zzso zzso This zzso is dependent on the zzso association of zzso at the C zzso of zzso where it zzso the association of zzso with its downstream partner zzso zzso induction was strongly inhibited in cells arrested in zzso by zzso which provokes increased expression of zzso zzso Interestingly, depletion of zzso from these zzso cells could zzso at least zzso zzso zzso Altogether, these data demonstrate a new function for zzso as a regulator of zzso induction and provide the basis for the development of zzso preventing the zzso association to sustain innate zzso
