In this study, we examined the role of zzso I zzso I) in lung cancer cell growth in zzso and in zzso and its influence on these tumor zzso sensitivity to zzso 

We established stable zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso lung zzso cell lines with zzso I zzso to zzso their zzso I zzso We then examined their in zzso zzso changes and used nude mice zzso of these cell lines to compare tumor invasion, spontaneous zzso capacity, and sensitivity to zzso 

The zzso I zzso zzso of both cell lines showed a significant reduction in zzso I protein zzso zzso I zzso zzso grew more slowly than did the wild zzso As zzso in mice, zzso zzso I zzso zzso showed a zzso delay in the generation of palpable zzso The zzso of spontaneous zzso of zzso I zzso zzso was significantly less than that of the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso I zzso zzso caused more than twice the growth delay compared with the wild zzso 

The results of these studies suggest that zzso of zzso I may be a promising approach to improve the treatment outcome of patients with lung zzso
