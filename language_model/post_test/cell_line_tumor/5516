zzso zzso in cell populations arises from a combination of intrinsic and zzso zzso This zzso has been measured for gene transcription, zzso cell zzso and drug zzso and used to explain various aspects of cellular zzso In all cases, however, the causes of zzso were not zzso Here we zzso for the first time, the zzso patterns of related cellular activities, namely virus infection, zzso and membrane zzso composition in adherent human zzso We reveal correlations with specific cellular states that are defined by the population context of a cell, and we derive zzso models that can explain and predict most cellular zzso of these activities, solely on the basis of each cell's population zzso We find that accounting for zzso zzso is essential for interpreting differences between the activity levels of cell zzso Finally, we reveal that zzso between two molecular zzso focal zzso zzso and the zzso zzso enhances the zzso pattern of zzso virus 40 zzso zzso Our findings provide an explanation for the origin of zzso patterns of cellular activities in adherent cell zzso
