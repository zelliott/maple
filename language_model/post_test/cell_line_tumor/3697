In this study, we investigated the role of the naturally occurring B zzso T cell zzso in the zzso efficacy of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has a dual specificity for both zzso and zzso and has previously been shown to effectively direct the zzso potential of zzso T cells toward zzso zzso B zzso zzso instigated T zzso cell interaction caused a zzso zzso of T cells that was 30 times stronger when compared with T cell zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso The zzso of T cells by zzso and B cells appeared functional and resulted in the rapid induction of high zzso potential in freshly isolated peripheral T zzso zzso T zzso cell interaction resulted in a significant zzso of zzso on B cells and the zzso of T cells was found to be dependent on the interaction of zzso with zzso and zzso by the zzso zzso Also, the zzso potential of freshly isolated T cells activated via zzso appeared to be dependent on zzso signaling in the target B zzso Interestingly, the zzso signaling effects described in this study appeared specifically related to the targeting against zzso because targeting against zzso by a zzso zzso zzso was significantly less effective in inducing T cell zzso and T zzso B cell zzso Together these results demonstrate that the zzso B cells actively contribute to their own demise upon zzso zzso zzso T cell zzso
