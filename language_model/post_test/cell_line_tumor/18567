Abstract zzso is a zzso type zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso that enhances its zzso zzso zzso cause familial zzso lateral sclerosis zzso through the gain of zzso toxic zzso We previously showed that the zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso triggered the release of zzso zzso followed by the zzso of the zzso cascade and induction of zzso cell zzso In the present study, therefore, we investigated whether zzso can zzso the level of zzso zzso in the zzso and subsequent zzso zzso We showed that zzso significantly reduced the amount of zzso zzso in the zzso the release of zzso c and the zzso of the following zzso zzso thereby preventing eventual zzso cell death in a zzso cell model of zzso These results suggest that reducing the zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso may be a new therapeutic strategy for zzso zzso zzso and that zzso may play a significant role in zzso
