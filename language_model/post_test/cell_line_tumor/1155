An efficient model is currently used to study zzso C virus zzso replication in cell zzso It involves zzso in zzso a zzso cell line, of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso proteins from zzso to zzso However, strong and sustained replication is achieved only on the appearance of zzso zzso in viral zzso The most effective of these zzso zzso are concentrated mainly in zzso not only into the original zzso but also in the recently established zzso and zzso zzso zzso This suggests that the expression of zzso zzso zzso may not allow efficient zzso zzso replication in cell zzso With the use of a zzso reporter gene as a marker for zzso replication and zzso zzso analysis, the replication of different zzso zzso in zzso experiments was zzso Comparing zzso with zzso zzso the strong evidence accumulated showed that the expression of zzso zzso was actually able to inhibit the replication of zzso zzso This feature was characterized as a dominant negative zzso Interestingly, an zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso zzso was dominant negative on an zzso zzso but was not inhibited by the original zzso zzso In conclusion, these studies revealed that the original zzso zzso zzso is not only incompetent for replication in cell culture, but is also able to interfere with zzso zzso
