zzso zzso tract expansions have been associated with an increasing number of human zzso Here, we have undertaken a functional study of the effects of zzso expansions in the context of the zzso factor zzso involved in zzso and zzso zzso Using two cellular models, we show that zzso zzso expansions lead to protein zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso The fraction of cells containing zzso zzso displays a zzso relationship with respect to the length of the zzso zzso suggesting the existence of a threshold length above which protein zzso zzso The existence of such a threshold might be rationalized if we consider that the longer the zzso tract is, the higher its tendency to zzso or to inducing zzso interactions with zzso zzso To study the zzso dynamics of zzso zzso we performed zzso recovery after zzso zzso The most unexpected result concerned the zzso protein containing 19 Ala zzso in the run, which was virtually zzso although this zzso does not present a classical zzso zzso zzso zzso and real time zzso of many potential target genes showed that zzso expansions induce different losses of activity according to the target promoters zzso We provide molecular explanations for these zzso Although our main focus is the mechanisms of zzso of zzso zzso we discuss the potential relevance of zzso length variation in zzso and zzso because zzso proteins tend to be zzso zzso
