zzso zzso was applied to zzso zzso and zzso and normal zzso zzso The cells were incubated for different lengths of time after zzso The cell responses to the therapy were examined by changes in zzso activity, zzso and mode of the cell zzso zzso induced dynamic changes in zzso zzso Initially, an increase in zzso activity was observed, and after 6 hours of culture it decreased to the control zzso zzso obtained from zzso and the comet zzso indicate that zzso caused immediate cell death via zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso Our studies confirm that zzso is involved in the response of both cancer and normal cells to zzso
