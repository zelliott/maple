During important cellular processes such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso at the zzso interacts with dynamic zzso in an apparent zzso zzso It is well-established that zzso can generate forces by moving zzso along the zzso zzso but much less is known about zzso interaction with dynamic zzso zzso In this paper, we review recent in zzso experiments that show that zzso attached to an artificial cortex, is able to capture zzso ends, regulate zzso dynamics and mediate the generation of pulling forces on shrinking zzso We further review existing ideas on the involvement of zzso cortical pulling forces in the positioning of zzso organizing centers such as zzso Recent in zzso experiments have demonstrated that cortical pulling forces in combination with pushing forces can lead to reliable centering of zzso zzso in zzso two-dimensional zzso zzso In these experiments, pushing leads to slipping of zzso ends along the chamber zzso resulting in an zzso distribution of cortical zzso contacts that favors zzso once pulling force generators become zzso This effect is predicted to be strongly zzso and we therefore finally discuss ongoing efforts to repeat these experiments in zzso zzso and zzso zzso
