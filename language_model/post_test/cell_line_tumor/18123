zzso zzso zzso and rich in zzso zzso also known as zzso or zzso is a zzso component of the zzso zzso that has been reported to be involved with a variety of cellular zzso Although zzso expression levels are frequently altered in a variety of tumor types, the exact implications of zzso zzso zzso it zzso zzso or has no effect on tumor zzso remained zzso Our recent gene expression analyses have shown that zzso is significantly zzso in highly zzso human prostate cancer zzso To test the role of zzso zzso in zzso directly, we examined cancer progression and zzso in zzso and zzso mice using two separate transgenic mouse tumor models: transgenic zzso of the mouse prostate zzso and zzso zzso tumor zzso middle T zzso Surprisingly, in both instances, we found that loss of zzso had no significant effects on tumor zzso progression or zzso zzso zzso and collagen deposition were also largely zzso Our results indicate that, although differential zzso expression may be a useful marker of aggressive, zzso tumors, loss of zzso is not sufficient either to promote or to inhibit cancer progression in two spontaneous mouse tumor zzso
