The zzso zzso zzso is a part of the innate immune system sensing zzso molecular patterns zzso Recently, zzso 2 and 4 have been demonstrated for the zzso zzso which result in the induction of zzso Here we investigated the expression of zzso 2 and 4 on zzso vessels producing zzso zzso zzso 21 zzso in the human small zzso The specificity of zzso to zzso was tested on a human zzso leukemia cell line, zzso vein zzso cells zzso and zzso ligament zzso zzso with the examination for the zzso gene expression by the reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso vessels were identified by zzso for zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso The expression of zzso was not clearly detected on collecting zzso vessels in the zzso while it was generally observed on the central zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The reaction of zzso to zzso 2 and 4 was also not clearly detected on collecting zzso vessels in the zzso and central zzso of zzso but generally observed on zzso zzso expressing zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of tissue where the expression of zzso and zzso was not clearly observed in blood zzso These may suggest that the expression of zzso and zzso 2 and 4 is predominantly induced in the peripheral zzso zzso of the small zzso zzso The zzso zzso may contribute to allow zzso cells to home into secondary zzso tissue through the expression of zzso the zzso engagements of which result in the induction of zzso
