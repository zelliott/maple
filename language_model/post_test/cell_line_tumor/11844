To identify targets whose zzso may enhance the efficacy of zzso in pancreatic cancer and thus improve survival, we conducted an zzso library screen in pancreatic cancer zzso We investigated zzso a scaffolding zzso of protein zzso 2A zzso as a lead zzso zzso 

We determined the effect of zzso zzso by genetic zzso zzso and zzso zzso a small zzso entering phase I clinical zzso approaches on zzso of zzso and zzso pancreatic cancer cells both in zzso and in zzso 

zzso depletion by zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells, with radiation enhancement ratios of zzso zzso zzso zzso Likewise, zzso produced similar zzso in pancreatic cancer cells, but minimal zzso in normal small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso caused zzso zzso zzso likely resulting from zzso of the active forms of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibited zzso zzso focus formation and zzso zzso repair zzso ultimately leading to persistent zzso DNA damage, as reflected by zzso zzso Finally, we identified zzso as a key zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso as depletion of zzso partially reversed zzso zzso In a mouse zzso model of human pancreatic cancer, zzso produced significant zzso with minimal weight zzso 

zzso our data show that zzso zzso zzso pancreatic cancer both in zzso and in zzso via zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso and provide zzso evidence that zzso is a promising target for the improvement of local therapy in pancreatic zzso
