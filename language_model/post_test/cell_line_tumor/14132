zzso of the oral cavity are highly zzso zzso zzso of zzso networks was shown to limit the access of nutrients and oxygen to tumor cells and inhibit tumor zzso Here, we evaluated the effect of the zzso of an artificial death switch zzso expressed in zzso zzso cells on the progression of oral zzso We used zzso scaffolds to zzso human zzso zzso zzso cells zzso expressing zzso zzso with oral cancer cells expressing zzso zzso or zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso with oral cancer cells, and a zzso targeted zzso zzso was injected locally to deliver zzso to zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso demonstrated that tumor progression was zzso and zzso showed that zzso density was zzso when zzso was activated in zzso zzso We conclude that zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells is sufficient to inhibit the progression of zzso oral zzso
