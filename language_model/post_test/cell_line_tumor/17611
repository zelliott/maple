In this study, we developed a zzso zzso targeted zzso system by zzso zzso lipids to zzso zzso The two zzso zzso used were both tumor specific, that is, zzso recognizes the zzso zzso zzso present in zzso and zzso recognizes the zzso protein in breast and zzso zzso zzso was performed under zzso conditions by zzso zzso The zzso procedure appeared to be zzso and the binding capacity of the zzso was not affected by linking them to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso efficiency was zzso with target cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso as such appeared to be an effective zzso zzso for various cell zzso After zzso zzso to the zzso zzso or zzso fragments, it was shown that the targeted zzso zzso preferably bound to target cells, compared to binding to the zzso cells, especially for the zzso zzso More importantly, zzso of the target cells could also be improved with these targeted zzso In conclusion, we have shown that by using zzso zzso zzso zzso cells targeted gene delivery can be zzso and also a higher number of zzso target cells was zzso
