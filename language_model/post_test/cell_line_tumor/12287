The purpose of this study was to determine whether zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso is a plausible therapeutic strategy in pancreatic zzso 

A human pancreatic cancer cell line zzso was evaluated for the presence of zzso with zzso and zzso zzso were grown in the presence of either 50 or 100 zzso of zzso zzso for 72 hours and evaluated using the zzso zzso zzso zzso Eighty-six zzso zzso mice underwent zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells and were blindly zzso into four groups: zzso Control; zzso zzso a zzso zzso inhibitor zzso at 400 zzso zzso zzso zzso at 100 zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso and in zzso effects of zzso with and without zzso were zzso 

zzso demonstrated high levels of expression of both the zzso gene and the gene zzso In zzso both doses of zzso significantly reduced proliferation of zzso at 48 zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso versus zzso + zzso zzso P zzso zzso and 72 h zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso paired zzso zzso In zzso each treatment group demonstrated a significant survival advantage zzso zzso zzso group 2, P zzso zzso group 3, P zzso zzso group 4, log rank zzso over zzso Mice treated with zzso showed reduced tumor zzso size, weight, zzso potential, and zzso as compared to controls and zzso mice (all P zzso zzso zzso exact zzso 

zzso zzso antagonism is not only a plausible therapy for treatment of zzso zzso of the zzso but is also superior to zzso zzso zzso alone or in zzso
