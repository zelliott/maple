zzso zzso growth factor zzso is the most potent zzso factor of zzso Its expression is induced by zzso oxygen species zzso in hypoxic conditions and by insulin in zzso zzso Both zzso and insulin can activate zzso protein zzso zzso and induce the zzso factor zzso components that are essential for zzso gene zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the role of zzso producing zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso gene zzso To achieve this goal we chose zzso cells as our model system as these cells express the zzso zzso zzso zzso and respond to insulin stimulation with enhanced zzso production and zzso zzso and production of zzso We demonstrate that in control cells insulin stimulation leads to zzso generation, a zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the induction of both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso abrogates zzso production and zzso exclusively the second phase of zzso zzso zzso and zzso DNA binding and thus prevents zzso of zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, our results demonstrate that zzso a zzso generating zzso zzso plays an integral role in zzso zzso zzso signal transmission and zzso zzso
