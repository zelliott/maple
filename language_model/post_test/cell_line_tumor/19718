Human tumors zzso release zzso zzso transporting a broad array of biologically active molecules with potential zzso effects on different immune zzso Here, we report the first evidence that zzso zzso alter zzso cell function by zzso zzso differentiation into zzso cells and promoting the generation of a zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso isolated from healthy donors and differentiated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso factor in the presence of zzso zzso turned into zzso cells, retaining zzso expression and failing to zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso These zzso changes were paralleled by a significant release of different zzso including zzso tumor necrosis zzso and transforming growth zzso zzso and a zzso zzso activity on activated zzso and zzso functions, which could be reversed by zzso zzso zzso isolated from plasma of advanced melanoma patients, but not from healthy donors, zzso comparable effects on zzso zzso skewing their differentiation toward zzso cells with zzso zzso activity on zzso Interestingly, a subset of zzso zzso cells zzso zzso activity on T zzso was found to be significantly expanded in peripheral blood of melanoma patients compared with healthy zzso These data suggest the development in cancer patients of an zzso circuit by which tumors promote the generation of zzso zzso cells through the release of circulating zzso and without the need for zzso zzso zzso interventions on the crucial steps of this zzso may contribute to restore zzso system interactions favoring zzso control of tumor growth in cancer zzso
