zzso the zzso interference zzso has shown promise for developing novel and effective treatment of zzso B virus zzso zzso To advance this approach, we analyzed the zzso efficacy of a panel of 10 Pol III zzso zzso short hairpin zzso zzso that target zzso sequences of the zzso zzso open reading zzso To facilitate zzso processing, the zzso included zzso in the zzso stem region and a terminal loop of zzso Two zzso zzso 5 and zzso 6) showed zzso of zzso markers by zzso in zzso zzso and also in a zzso zzso injection model of zzso zzso zzso processing of hairpin zzso with the intended strand bias correlated with zzso zzso Moreover, markers of zzso replication were inhibited without inducing genes associated with the zzso zzso zzso To assess the zzso efficacy of the zzso in a context that is similar to natural zzso infection, zzso zzso were tested against the virus in a zzso transgenic zzso zzso When delivered using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 and zzso zzso 6 zzso significant zzso zzso zzso these observations indicate that zzso zzso 5 and zzso zzso 6 are promising candidates for therapy of chronic zzso zzso
