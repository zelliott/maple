The combination of tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulted in a greater zzso than could be accounted for by the addition of the zzso effects of the agents zzso In this study, we hypothesized that the synergistic interaction between the two zzso can be changed when both the sequence and the time zzso between the two treatments are zzso To test the hypothesis, human zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were either zzso with zzso zzso TRAIL for various times zzso zzso followed by treatment with 5 zzso zzso or zzso with 5 zzso zzso for various times zzso zzso followed by treatment with zzso zzso zzso In latter case, the synergistic effect was gradually increased when the time zzso between the two treatments was zzso In former case, a zzso zzso occurred within zzso h of zzso with zzso However, the synergistic effect was gradually decreased when the time zzso between the two treatments was zzso Data from zzso analysis reveal that a similar pattern emerged for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The synergistic effect is not associated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, a complex pattern of synergistic interaction between TRAIL and zzso is related to the zzso of zzso Although zzso of zzso protected cells from zzso zzso and zzso death, zzso of zzso zzso by replacing zzso and zzso zzso with zzso did not further enhance zzso zzso Taken together, zzso zzso reflects zzso damage, but it does not cause zzso
