zzso is a zzso zzso Normally, the zzso is only produced by white blood cells where it regulates functions such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso migration and zzso 

zzso breast tissue and primary breast zzso were zzso by zzso for zzso zzso The zzso breast cancer cell line zzso was engineered to zzso express either zzso or zzso small interfering zzso zzso zzso were then performed in zzso to assess zzso zzso zzso zzso migration and zzso An zzso mouse model zzso ability to produce zzso in zzso 

zzso breast zzso cells exhibit expression of the zzso domain of zzso in the zzso but not the zzso The majority of these normal cells are also negative for expression of the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso breast zzso cells exhibit zzso expression both in the zzso and nucleus and the majority express the zzso in the zzso Using differential patterns of zzso expression of the N and C zzso of zzso we define six zzso of breast cancer that are independent of zzso and zzso status zzso zzso zzso with zzso resulted in the zzso breast cancer cell line exhibiting increased zzso zzso decreased zzso migration, increased zzso to zzso increased vulnerability to zzso by natural killer cells and decreased ability to produce zzso in zzso 

Our results indicate that zzso patterns of zzso expression define a new molecular zzso of breast cancer and that zzso represents a novel therapeutic zzso
