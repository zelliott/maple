zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso controlling cell zzso migration, and zzso We previously showed that zzso is involved in the control of zzso in cultured zzso zzso These data led us to the hypothesis that zzso may play a role in the zzso signaling in bone zzso We zzso analyzed tissue sections from zzso from 21 patients with zzso zzso These zzso expressed low levels of zzso compared with zzso and zzso in normal zzso zzso human zzso cells also produced lower zzso levels of zzso than normal zzso zzso Moreover, the presence of zzso correlated with spontaneous zzso in zzso zzso as assessed by detection of DNA fragmentation in zzso zzso of zzso resulted in decreased number of zzso and invading zzso zzso cells in zzso In addition, zzso of zzso zzso human zzso cells to zzso zzso increasing the response to methotrexate, zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso using stable zzso with a zzso coding small interfering zzso resulted in zzso of zzso zzso Analysis of zzso expression both in zzso and in corresponding zzso tumors, as well as in cells treated with zzso or zzso showed that the zzso action of chemotherapy can be associated with an increase in zzso These results provide support for a zzso function for zzso and suggest that zzso of zzso may be related to abnormal zzso expression or induction in zzso Moreover, our data identify zzso as a new factor zzso the zzso effect of zzso zzso
