The full realization of the therapeutic potential of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the field of pancreatic cancer has been hindered by limited tumor zzso and zzso replication zzso 

We zzso zzso enhancements and zzso promoters zzso for pancreatic zzso zzso was enhanced both by incorporating an zzso motif and by substituting the zzso region with Ad zzso 3 zzso zzso An zzso zzso was tested in an zzso pancreatic cancer model by systemic zzso 

Among a panel of 8 zzso the zzso zzso zzso promoter profile was most advantageous in the pancreatic cancer cell lines, whereas 4 more promoters were also zzso An zzso zzso zzso controlled with zzso promoter was found to safely exhibit replication within a tumor in this model and was found to suppress tumor growth after systemic zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso promises useful clinical applications for pancreatic cancer gene zzso
