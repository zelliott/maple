As with standard zzso zzso it is possible to zzso zzso in zzso form into cells with zzso efficiency to obtain transient expression of zzso Packaging zzso expression zzso into zzso zzso however, enables up to zzso zzso even with zzso cells, such as primary, zzso and differentiated zzso Moreover, the zzso delivery does not produce the specific cellular responses typically associated with chemical zzso such as cell death resulting from toxicity of the zzso zzso When zzso into target cells, the zzso construct zzso into zzso DNA and provides stable expression of the small hairpin zzso zzso zzso zzso or reporter zzso Target cells zzso expressing the zzso zzso can be isolated using a zzso marker contained in the expression zzso construct such as zzso or zzso After zzso particles zzso target cells, they cannot replicate within target cells because the viral structural genes are absent and the long terminal repeats zzso are designed to be zzso upon zzso There are three main components necessary for efficient zzso zzso zzso The zzso expression zzso that contains some of the genetic elements required for packaging, stable integration of the viral expression construct into zzso DNA, and expression of the zzso or zzso zzso The zzso packaging plasmids that provide the proteins essential for zzso and packaging of an zzso copy of the expression construct into zzso zzso zzso This protocol uses the zzso plasmids zzso that zzso for zzso zzso and rev from the zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso g protein zzso for the viral coat zzso zzso zzso producer cells zzso from zzso zzso that express the zzso large T zzso which is required for zzso zzso production and a zzso resistance zzso useful for zzso the cells for zzso An overview of the viral production protocol can be seen in Figure zzso zzso production starts by zzso zzso producer cells with the zzso expression zzso and the packaging zzso zzso particles are zzso into the zzso After zzso hours the cell culture media is zzso Cellular debris is removed from the cell culture media, and the viral particles are zzso by zzso with zzso for zzso Produced zzso particles are then zzso and can be used to zzso target zzso Details of viral zzso are not included in this zzso but can be found at: zzso This protocol has been zzso using the specific products zzso Other zzso may be zzso but the same results cannot be zzso
