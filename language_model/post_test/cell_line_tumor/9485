We previously developed a zzso factor decoy targeting signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso and reported zzso activity in both in zzso and in zzso models of zzso cell zzso of the head and neck zzso Based on the known existence of zzso zzso the high sequence zzso between zzso and zzso as well as expression of both zzso and zzso in zzso we examined whether the zzso decoy interferes with zzso zzso zzso cell lines with different zzso expression levels (but similar zzso zzso were zzso Both cell lines were sensitive to the zzso effects of the zzso decoy compared with a zzso control zzso zzso zzso signaling was demonstrated by zzso zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Treatment with the zzso decoy (but not a zzso control zzso resulted in zzso of zzso protein expression in both cell lines, indicating specific zzso of zzso signaling by the zzso zzso Because zzso is a potential tumor zzso we also investigated whether zzso signaling zzso the therapeutic efficacy of the zzso zzso In both zzso and zzso cells, zzso zzso treatment resulted in decreased zzso zzso without altering the zzso activity of the zzso zzso Likewise, the zzso effects of the zzso decoy were not altered by zzso zzso upon zzso zzso These results suggest that the therapeutic mechanisms of zzso blockade using a zzso factor decoy are independent of zzso zzso
