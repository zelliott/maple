The switch of tumor cells from an zzso to a zzso zzso zzso as zzso transition zzso is known to induce tumor cell zzso and zzso therefore promoting zzso of solid zzso Although multiple studies have focused on zzso the signaling events that initiate this zzso switch, there has been so far no characterization of the pattern of soluble zzso released by tumor cells undergoing zzso and the potential impact that this zzso switch could have on the zzso of the tumor zzso Here we show that induction of zzso in human zzso cells via zzso of the zzso factor zzso is associated with enhanced zzso of multiple zzso zzso and zzso factors and, in particular, with the induction of the zzso zzso Our results also indicate the essential role of zzso 8 zzso signaling for the acquisition and/or maintenance of the zzso and invasive features of zzso tumor cells and show that zzso zzso by tumor cells undergoing zzso could zzso tumor progression by inducing adjacent zzso tumor cells into zzso Altogether, our results emphasize the potential role of zzso in the zzso of the tumor zzso via zzso of multiple soluble zzso and suggest that zzso signaling blockade may provide a means of targeting zzso invasive tumor zzso
