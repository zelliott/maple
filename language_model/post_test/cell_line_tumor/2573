To evaluate the effects of zzso focused ultrasound zzso zzso on the pancreatic cancer zzso 

The human pancreatic zzso cell line zzso zzso suspension and pancreatic zzso zzso in nude mice were zzso by zzso using zzso zzso The temperature at the focus was controlled at below zzso The cell zzso in zzso was tested by flow zzso at 3, 6, 12, 24 and zzso after zzso zzso Colony formation was used to evaluate the cell growth zzso of zzso in zzso The tumor volume of the zzso was measured before and after zzso zzso Then the slides of the tumor were under zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso to evaluate the effect of zzso on pancreatic zzso zzso in zzso 

The maximum cell suspension temperature of the zzso zzso group was zzso The cell zzso rate peaked at zzso after zzso zzso the differences between the zzso zzso group and control group were statistically significant ( zzso Colony formation rates were zzso for the control group and zzso for zzso zzso group ( zzso For the zzso in nude mice, the mean tumor volumes of the control group and the zzso zzso group 15 days after zzso were zzso and zzso ( zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed both zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso could induce cell zzso and inhibit the proliferation of pancreatic cancer zzso
