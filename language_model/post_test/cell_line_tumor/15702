zzso pancreatic beta cells are known to be extremely susceptible to the zzso stress and zzso generated following zzso transplantation in diabetic zzso We hereby present a novel in zzso selection strategy based on the isolation of zzso cells with enhanced protection after repeated rounds of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso in zzso zzso and transplanted in the zzso cavity of zzso After 2 days the beads were retrieved and cells were recovered from zzso and zzso in zzso until submitted to a second round of zzso and zzso Three days later, the surviving cells, named zzso were isolated from the zzso beads and their protection and functional activity zzso Compared to parental zzso cells, the selected zzso cells were more resistant to hydrogen zzso zzso oxide, zzso and zzso This enhanced protection of the selected cells correlated with the increased level of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Although selected cells expressed more insulin than parental cells, no change in their insulin response to zzso was zzso We conclude that the in zzso selection strategy is a powerful tool for the engineering of insulin producing cells with a broad spectrum of defense zzso
