We investigated DNA copy number aberrations in 37 cell lines derived from multiple zzso zzso using comparative zzso zzso and 11 zzso showed high-level gain indicative of gene amplification at zzso A corresponding zzso mapping using zzso zzso extracted three zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso within the smallest region of overlapping in zzso Among them zzso showed amplification and zzso zzso in the zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso was observed in primary cases of zzso as zzso zzso cell lines with amplification of zzso exhibited the resistance to zzso zzso and zzso cell death compared with zzso cell lines without its zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso with an zzso zzso zzso a cell line zzso to zzso zzso and zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso is likely to be one of targets for zzso amplification in zzso and may be associated with the zzso zzso including drug resistance, in this type of zzso
