We report a novel approach for determining the zzso activity within a single suspended zzso Using a zzso zzso delivery device and timed exposure to the zzso agent zzso we controlled the plasma membrane zzso of individual zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso were exposed to a series of zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso alkaline zzso zzso with and without zzso an alkaline zzso zzso We generated quantitative estimates for zzso zzso activity and were able to construct both zzso and zzso zzso at the zzso level, resulting in an apparent zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso standard error of the mean zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso constant Ki of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity could be monitored just 40 s after zzso and five point zzso zzso could be obtained within 150 zzso This rapid approach offers a new methodology for characterizing zzso activity within single zzso
