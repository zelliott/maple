A series of zzso was prepared as a result of our efforts to modify a series of zzso that proved to be potent zzso agents with a unique mechanism of zzso zzso On the zzso zzso a zzso group is optimal for activity among zzso groups zzso The zzso relationship for the rest of the zzso resembles that of zzso A lead compound zzso retained in zzso potency compared with zzso In the mechanism of action studies, it behaved in the same manner as zzso In addition, it is also capable of overcoming zzso resistance due to zzso These findings strongly suggest that this series of zzso binds at the same site and in the same binding mode as zzso Further modifications of the zzso group are zzso
