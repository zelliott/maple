When grown on permeable zzso pancreatic duct zzso zzso cells establish very high values of zzso resistance zzso The addition of ethanol produced a zzso zzso drop in the zzso of these cells, ranging from zzso (with zzso zzso to zzso (with zzso zzso The ethanol effect was rapid and zzso The resistance decrease was associated with an increase in zzso zzso to zzso No significant decrease in cell zzso was detected for ethanol zzso lower than zzso zzso vertical sections of zzso zzso of zzso cells, grown on zzso showed a progressive zzso of domes zzso after 5 zzso of treatment with zzso zzso zzso in an zzso medium caused a progressive dome zzso zzso analysis of zzso cells indicated that zzso and zzso exhibited clear cut distribution changes while the zzso zzso pattern was slightly zzso zzso zzso showed that a discrete zzso space was zzso between adjacent zzso cells but not between control zzso These data indicate that ethanol is a tight junction barrier opener in pancreatic duct zzso
