Several studies have reported targeted zzso at the cellular level using remote zzso of zzso by zzso zzso To date, methods to zzso zzso zzso dose have not been zzso In this report we study the relationship between radio wave exposure and zzso zzso with and without zzso zzso The findings are used to devise a strategy to zzso targeted zzso dose in a primary human liver cancer cell zzso 

Water bath or zzso external zzso zzso generator zzso zzso zzso was used for zzso zzso zzso activity was measured using a zzso zzso and viability was assessed using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Heat shock proteins were zzso using western zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was observed in zzso cells exposed to zzso field that preceded measurable loss in zzso Loss of zzso activity was higher in zzso gold zzso zzso treated zzso Using a standard curve from water bath experiments, the zzso zzso dose was zzso zzso treated with zzso accumulated zzso times higher zzso zzso dose than the zzso controls over initial 4 zzso of zzso zzso 

Cancer cells when exposed to an external zzso field exhibit zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso can be used to zzso zzso dose delivered after zzso zzso to cancer cells with and without zzso
