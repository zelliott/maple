zzso zzso zzso imaging using zzso green zzso is a promising technique to obtain real-time assessment of the extent and number of zzso liver zzso during zzso The current study aims to zzso dosage and timing of zzso zzso 

Liver tumors were induced in 18 male zzso rats by zzso zzso of zzso rat zzso cancer cells into three distinct liver zzso zzso were divided in two groups: imaging after 24 and 48 h or 72 and 96 h after intravenous zzso zzso In each time group, rats were allocated to three dose groups: zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging and ex zzso zzso were performed using the zzso imaging system and confirmed by zzso zzso Fluorescence intensity was zzso using the zzso software and the difference between tumor signal and liver signal zzso zzso zzso was zzso 

In all 18 rats, all zzso liver zzso zzso zzso zzso some as small as zzso zzso were identified using zzso and the zzso imaging zzso Average zzso ratio zzso over all groups was zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher in the 72 h time group compared with other time zzso zzso dose did not significantly influence zzso but a trend was found favoring the zzso zzso dose zzso Fluorescence zzso demonstrated a clear fluorescent rim around the zzso 

This study demonstrates that zzso cancer liver zzso can be clearly identified during surgery using zzso and the zzso imaging system, with optimal timing of 72 h zzso and an optimal dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging has the potential to improve zzso detection of zzso and, thus, the zzso of zzso
