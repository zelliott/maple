zzso zzso particles were zzso zzso (with zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso and successfully used to target cell lines expressing the zzso characteristic of zzso cancer zzso zzso The zzso zzso material device, consisting of surface decorated zzso zzso suspended as a zzso magnetic fluid zzso sample, labeled zzso was characterized and tested against two cell zzso a zzso expressing cell line zzso and a zzso expressing cell line zzso Whereas X-ray zzso was used to assess the average core size of the zzso zzso particles zzso zzso zzso in zzso dynamic light scattering and zzso mobility zzso were used to obtain the average zzso diameter zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso device, zzso Additionally, zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to track the surface decoration of the zzso zzso particles from the very first zzso up to the attachment of the zzso zzso The zzso peak at zzso zzso absent in the free zzso spectrum, is the signature of the zzso binding onto the zzso magnetic zzso Whereas zzso zzso was used to confirm the low cell toxicity of the zzso device, zzso and zzso blue iron zzso tests performed with both cell lines zzso and zzso confirm that the zzso zzso zzso is highly specific for zzso zzso Finally, transmission electron zzso analyses show that the association with zzso seems to increase the number of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso whereas no such increase seems to occur in the zzso cell zzso In conclusion, the zzso sample is a zzso device that can specifically target zzso suggesting its potential use as a zzso tool for zzso tumors, zzso and zzso zzso
