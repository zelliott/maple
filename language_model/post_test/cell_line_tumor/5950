zzso zzso zzso expressed in tumors may offer novel therapeutic approaches to zzso zzso is zzso in various zzso including colon zzso in which in zzso studies have established zzso and zzso zzso zzso was connected recently to cancer through its capacity to zzso the zzso zzso zzso To date, zzso replacement therapy has been hampered by the lack of robust zzso delivery methods for in zzso zzso Here we report a method of zzso delivery by using zzso zzso delivery of unmodified zzso using zzso and zzso to zzso validate the method in a mouse model of colon zzso After systemic or local application of low molecular weight zzso complexes, intact zzso molecules were delivered into mouse zzso tumors, where they caused profound zzso zzso zzso delivery reduced tumor proliferation and increased zzso with zzso repression of zzso and zzso as novel regulatory target of zzso Similarly, systemic injection of zzso zzso was validated as a novel therapeutic targeting method for zzso with zzso effects comparable with zzso direct in zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso Our findings show that chemically unmodified zzso zzso with zzso can be used in an efficient and zzso strategy of zzso replacement therapy, as illustrated by zzso delivery of zzso and zzso complexes in colon zzso
