Current published data suggest that DNA mismatch repair zzso triggers prolonged zzso cell cycle checkpoint arrest after zzso damage from zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, analyses of zzso zzso and zzso human zzso colon cancer cells revealed that although zzso signaling controlled zzso arrest in zzso cells, zzso zzso was not involved in zzso zzso zzso Instead, we discovered that zzso zzso activity using zzso zzso a zzso zzso or stable zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso stabilization, induction of zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso also increased the survival of zzso zzso cells to a level comparable with zzso zzso Furthermore, knocking down zzso (but not zzso protein levels affected zzso zzso arrest zzso Thus, zzso zzso arrest responses triggered by zzso are dependent on a human zzso signaling zzso and zzso Furthermore, our data suggest that caution should be taken with therapies targeting zzso zzso because increased survival of zzso zzso may be an unwanted zzso
