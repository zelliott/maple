zzso and zzso acid zzso are two zzso drugs currently in use for treating zzso They have different mechanisms of action but both have been shown to delay the onset of zzso events in patients with giant cell tumor of bone zzso However, the zzso mechanisms of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso cells remain zzso In this study, we focused on the direct effects of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso cells and compared with zzso The microscopic view demonstrated a reduced cell growth in zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to exhibit a zzso zzso in cell growth in all zzso zzso cell lines tested and cause zzso in two out of three cell zzso In contrast, zzso only exerted a minimal zzso effect in one cell line and did not induce any zzso zzso significantly inhibited the zzso expression of zzso zzso of nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in two zzso zzso cell lines whereas their protein levels remained zzso On the contrary, zzso did not regulate zzso and zzso expression at both zzso and protein zzso Moreover, the protein expression of zzso zzso Factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Type I were not regulated by zzso and zzso zzso Our findings provide new insights in the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso cells and raise a concern that tumor recurrence may occur after the withdrawal of the zzso
