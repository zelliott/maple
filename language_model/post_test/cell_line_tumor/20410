zzso proteins are powerful regulators of cell proliferation and zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is involved in the zzso of several types of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acts as a zzso zzso and zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that reducing expression of the zzso gene zzso activates zzso zzso and zzso the development of certain types of zzso In the present study, we examined the expression of zzso in human primary zzso zzso zzso zzso Studies using zzso reverse zzso chain reaction and zzso analysis revealed that zzso expression is lower in human zzso than in normal brain zzso To clarify the role of zzso we zzso zzso human zzso cells, which do not express zzso with the zzso zzso to restore zzso zzso The results of cell zzso colony formation and zzso zzso as well as flow zzso indicate that zzso zzso has no effect on zzso cell zzso but does arrest cells at the zzso phase and inhibit cell zzso zzso our data suggest that zzso is a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso
