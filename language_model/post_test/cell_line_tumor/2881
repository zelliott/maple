zzso cells have an invasive and zzso zzso that is the main cause of death for cancer zzso zzso establishment and penetration consists of a series of complex processes involving multiple changes in gene zzso In this study, zzso administration of a high concentration of zzso acid inhibited tumor establishment and increased survival of zzso mice implanted with zzso zzso cancer zzso To identify proteins involved in the zzso zzso zzso of tumor zzso changes in the liver zzso associated with zzso acid treatment of zzso mice implanted with zzso were investigated using two-dimensional gel zzso and mass zzso Eleven protein spots were identified whose expression was different between control and zzso acid treatment zzso In particular, zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso A5 expression were zzso zzso The increase in zzso protein level was detected in the tumor tissue and accompanied by an increase in zzso zzso Our results suggest a possibility that these proteins are related to the zzso zzso suppression of tumor zzso
