Because of the vital importance of the zzso pathway, chemicals affecting zzso activity could disrupt essential cellular zzso Although the toxicity of zzso to both zzso and zzso is well known, the essential cellular target of zzso has not been well zzso We zzso that the zzso is a molecular target of environmental toxic zzso 

Our goal was to test the above hypothesis by investigating whether zzso could inhibit the activity of zzso and cellular zzso and, if so, the involved molecular mechanisms and downstream zzso 

We found that some toxic zzso zzso zzso zzso can zzso and zzso inhibit the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso and human breast cancer cellular zzso zzso zzso binding of tin atoms to cellular zzso is responsible for the observed irreversible zzso zzso of cellular zzso by zzso in several human cell lines results in the zzso of zzso proteins and natural zzso target zzso accompanied by induction of cell zzso 

The zzso is one of the molecular targets of environmental toxic zzso in human cells, and zzso zzso by zzso contributes to their cellular zzso
