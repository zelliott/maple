zzso transition zzso is important for tumor zzso zzso of zzso protein expression and observation of zzso changes are commonly used to identify zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and measuring apparent diffusion zzso zzso values are zzso techniques for characterizing tumor zzso We investigated the difference in zzso values between zzso and zzso subcutaneous mouse zzso tumors using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells were generated from tumor zzso zzso factor 4 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso values of zzso tumors from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were significantly lower than those from their zzso counterparts zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso Our results suggested that zzso is a potential tool for observing zzso or zzso characteristics of subcutaneous zzso zzso
