To investigate the potential of zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso for a zzso for prostate cancer zzso 

zzso was conducted with zzso zzso and zzso using the zzso zzso The cell study was conducted with zzso and zzso which are prostate cancer cell lines, and zzso which is a breast cancer cell zzso The cells were treated or zzso with zzso zzso zzso to block the zzso chains expressed on the surface of the prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso was added into the cell culture media and cellular zzso of zzso zzso was evaluated at 1, 3 and 6 hours of zzso For the in zzso zzso study, zzso cells were implanted in zzso male zzso The animals were injected zzso with zzso zzso At 24, 48 and 72 hours after zzso injection, the animals were sacrificed and the activity levels of blood and tissue samples were zzso 

The zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso cells increased according to the incubation time, while the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells did not show any increase up to 6 zzso The increase of zzso zzso was not observed when the zzso and zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso In the zzso studies, zzso zzso showed marked zzso into the implanted zzso zzso In zzso zzso mice, the tumor muscle ratio of zzso was increased for up to 72 hours in a zzso zzso 

zzso zzso showed excellent prostate cancer cell targeting in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso seems to be a potential candidate for an zzso for prostate cancer zzso
