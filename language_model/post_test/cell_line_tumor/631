zzso is a small zzso zzso inhibitor that has recently been shown to inhibit zzso family zzso zzso and also has activity against zzso Of importance to zzso zzso which frequently zzso to bone, zzso are also vital to the regulation of bone zzso We sought to determine the ability of zzso to inhibit growth of zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso cells were injected into zzso of zzso mice and treated with zzso alone or in combination with zzso zzso zzso zzso levels, bone mineral density, zzso and zzso were zzso 

Treatment with zzso alone significantly lowered sacrifice serum zzso zzso levels compared to control, zzso vs zzso zzso Combination therapy improved efficacy over zzso alone zzso zzso increased bone mineral density in zzso zzso by zzso over control zzso zzso ( zzso 

zzso zzso growth of zzso cells in bone with improved efficacy when combined with zzso Additionally, zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso These data support further study of zzso in clinical trials for men with zzso bone zzso
