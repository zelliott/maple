zzso of the zzso of zzso initiation factor 2 is the major regulatory step in the initiation of protein synthesis in zzso zzso a cellular zzso protects zzso of zzso from zzso Previously, we reported that the zzso zzso of zzso has higher levels of protection of zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we report that the zzso zzso and its double zzso containing zzso zzso zzso at the five zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso show increased zzso activity in zzso rat tumor zzso zzso zzso to those cells did not abolish their increased zzso activity except the zzso double zzso The latter zzso shows slight zzso of zzso activity during serum zzso and this zzso increased significantly during serum zzso zzso cells zzso expressing the zzso zzso showed slightly decreased levels of zzso zzso and significantly low level of zzso of zzso 1 and zzso The zzso zzso also showed increased binding with zzso and zzso and almost similar binding with zzso 1 and 2 as compared to wild type zzso Altogether, our data demonstrate that the increased binding of the zzso zzso with the zzso of zzso may be in part the cause for its high zzso zzso
