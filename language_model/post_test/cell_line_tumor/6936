Secondary bacterial infections often complicate respiratory viral infections, but the mechanisms zzso viruses zzso to bacterial disease are not completely zzso We determined the effects of infection with respiratory zzso virus zzso human zzso virus 3 zzso and influenza virus on the abilities of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to adhere to respiratory zzso cells and how these viruses alter the expression of known receptors for these zzso All viruses enhanced bacterial zzso to primary and immortalized cell zzso zzso and zzso infection increased the expression of several known receptors for zzso bacteria by primary zzso zzso cells and zzso cells but not by primary small airway zzso zzso zzso virus infection did not alter zzso zzso zzso zzso bacterial adherence to primary zzso zzso cells and immortalized cell lines by zzso zzso cell receptors for these zzso whereas this mechanism was less significant in primary small airway zzso cells and in influenza virus zzso Respiratory viruses promote bacterial zzso to respiratory zzso cells, a process that may increase bacterial colonization and contribute to zzso These studies highlight the distinct responses of different cell types to viral infection and the need to consider this variation when interpreting studies of the interactions between respiratory cells and viral zzso
