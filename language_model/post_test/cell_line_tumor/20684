zzso A and zzso B (also known as zzso are closely related peptides zzso by zzso zzso They orchestrate diverse central and peripheral processes by stimulation of two zzso coupled zzso zzso and zzso Recent studies have demonstrated the ability of zzso to promote a robust zzso in different cancer cells in culture and a potent growth reduction of human colon tumors in mice zzso Here we report effects of zzso on survival of rat zzso zzso cells, an experimental model for studies on zzso zzso zzso zzso real-time zzso demonstrated the expression of both types of zzso receptors in zzso zzso zzso A and zzso B did not affect rat zzso zzso cell proliferation as assessed by zzso incorporation zzso zzso of the cells with zzso A zzso zzso resulted in a marked decrease of cell zzso The observed effect was zzso as it was blocked by zzso a pan zzso zzso In addition to that, a parallel increase in zzso activity was zzso It is suggested that stimulation of zzso receptors zzso death of rat zzso zzso cells through zzso of zzso zzso
