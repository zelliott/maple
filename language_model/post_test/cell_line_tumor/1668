Following an increasing interest in the gold drug therapy field, nine new neutral zzso zzso zzso compounds have been zzso and tested as zzso zzso The zzso zzso used in this study are zzso and zzso zzso with zzso groups such as zzso zzso or zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso is the zzso or the more zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The studied zzso complexes are: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the related zzso complexes zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso The presence of zzso groups on the zzso rings improves the zzso of these complexes in polar zzso zzso zzso contain the zzso environment, whilst compound 9 is the only one to contain a zzso zzso Crystal structures for compounds 1 and 2 have been obtained and zzso Interestingly, the newly zzso zzso compounds were found to possess a pronounced zzso activity on several human cancer cells, some of which were endowed with zzso or zzso zzso In particular, among zzso zzso complexes, 1 and 2 proved to be the most promising derivatives zzso an zzso effect up to 70 times higher than zzso zzso experiments indicated that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso might be involved in the zzso behavior of these gold zzso
