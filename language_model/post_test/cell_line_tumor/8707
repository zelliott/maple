zzso zzso result in clinical resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in chronic zzso leukemia zzso Although in zzso 50% zzso concentration zzso values for specific zzso have been suggested to guide zzso choice in the clinic, the quantitative relationship between zzso and clinical response has never been zzso We used zzso equation for in zzso response of zzso cells zzso with various zzso zzso to determine zzso and the slope of the zzso zzso We found that slope zzso between zzso tracked with in zzso zzso resistance, provides particular additional interpretive value in cases where in zzso zzso and clinical response are zzso Moreover, unlike zzso alone, higher zzso potential at peak concentration zzso which zzso zzso zzso and peak concentration zzso correlated with improved complete zzso response zzso rates in zzso patients treated with zzso Our findings suggest a metric zzso in zzso and clinical data may provide an improved tool for zzso zzso zzso zzso
