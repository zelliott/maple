zzso zzso and zzso gene 1 zzso are the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso family of zzso zzso These complexes are involved in essential processes such as cell cycle, growth, zzso and zzso Using imaging approaches in a cell line that harbors tandem repeats of zzso integrated copies of the steroid responsive zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso terminal zzso we show that zzso and zzso are recruited to the zzso promoter in a zzso zzso The recruitment of zzso and zzso resulted in zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso repeat as demonstrated by an increase in the restriction zzso accessibility and in the size of DNA zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso event was zzso with an increased occupancy of zzso zzso II and zzso zzso at the zzso zzso The expression of zzso forms of zzso zzso or zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of local and higher order zzso zzso structure and resulted in the zzso of zzso In zzso zzso experiments provided direct evidence that zzso zzso and zzso zzso complexes have distinct kinetic properties on the zzso zzso and they zzso associate with and zzso from zzso zzso in a manner dependent on hormone and a functional zzso zzso Our data provide a kinetic and zzso basis for the zzso and zzso zzso complexes in regulating gene expression at a steroid hormone zzso zzso
