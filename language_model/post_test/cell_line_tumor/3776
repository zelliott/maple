We previously reported that zzso caused zzso of cancer cells by inducing expression of zzso We here present that zzso zzso zzso of prostate cancer zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso which mediates zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso caused by zzso was not substantially relieved by zzso zzso zzso but was relieved by zzso zzso active zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso expression is regulated by zzso zzso Interestingly, membrane zzso of zzso by insulin exposure was abolished in the cells zzso with zzso suggesting that zzso directly zzso with zzso of zzso to the plasma zzso In addition, zzso activated zzso by zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the nucleus and increased zzso of zzso and other target zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso exhibited increased zzso expression and zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso expression and cell zzso These results suggest that zzso may be a target gene of zzso and is regulated by zzso zzso Taken together, zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells by interfering with membrane recruitment of zzso resulting in zzso zzso and zzso zzso which leads to zzso of zzso
