zzso resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso is becoming a major challenge in the treatment of many zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso is zzso in zzso zzso notably those of the head and neck zzso and can be targeted with several zzso We aimed to identify soluble proteins suitable for development as markers of zzso zzso resistance in cancer patients to aid in early and minimally invasive assessment of therapeutic zzso 

zzso zzso cell lines were generated by exposure to an zzso zzso zzso in zzso Cell lines were zzso for their biological zzso in zzso zzso growth zzso zzso flow zzso western zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso and in zzso zzso subcutaneous zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso patients were zzso by zzso 

Two independent zzso of zzso 27 and a zzso zzso with acquired resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso cells grew as highly aggressive zzso leading to reduced host survival rates compared with zzso sensitive zzso This suggested a link between resistance in zzso and poor prognosis in zzso A significant zzso of proteins linked to zzso zzso and invasion was identified in resistant zzso This zzso protein zzso zzso was detected in the zzso of a small cohort of zzso patients and was associated with reduced zzso 

We have identified a protein signature associated with zzso resistance that may also be linked to poor prognosis and warrants further investigation as a potential clinical zzso
