Two major zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso are involved in the zzso of human zzso by zzso A third, zzso is zzso expressed by zzso of zzso origin and zzso Although zzso is also a zzso zzso its low-level expression on human zzso suggests a function distinct from that of zzso the major zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso We studied the expression of zzso during zzso differentiation of human zzso zzso cells in order to determine the role of zzso in zzso 

zzso cells exposed to zzso zzso zzso zzso to induce zzso differentiation were examined by light zzso and flow zzso zzso zzso surface expression of zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso zzso and quantitative zzso were used to evaluate the expression of zzso 1, 3, and 4 zzso zzso cells were also exposed to zzso and zzso zzso 

In baseline studies, zzso zzso cells were found to express comparable levels of zzso and zzso by Northern zzso zzso expression of zzso was detected by zzso but not by Northern zzso Exposure to zzso but not zzso or zzso resulted in zzso differentiation as evident by increased cell size and nuclear complexity, increased zzso and enhanced expression of zzso a specific marker of zzso zzso zzso cells showed enhanced zzso zzso expression zzso zzso increase by day 2) by flow zzso In contrast, there was no change in zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis zzso zzso and quantitative zzso zzso zzso confirmed the zzso of zzso zzso expression (by 24 zzso in cells exposed to zzso This did not occur with exposure to zzso 

These data demonstrate increased expression of zzso zzso and protein in zzso cells undergoing zzso maturation following zzso exposure, suggesting a zzso role for zzso Furthermore, regulation of zzso expression appears to be specifically coupled to the protein zzso C system, but independent of the zzso zzso zzso
