zzso cancer is the second most common zzso cancer worldwide, and its molecular mechanism has not been completely zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso family and can play important roles in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso invasion, zzso and drug resistance in several zzso including zzso zzso In the current study, we downloaded two zzso from Gene zzso zzso database and sought to explore the regulation mechanism of zzso in zzso cancer by zzso analysis of gene expression zzso zzso analysis identified a total of zzso genes that were regulated by zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of these genes revealed that zzso may be involved in several biological zzso both zzso and zzso such as system development, response to zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso production, zzso cell zzso cell zzso and signal zzso Further, DNA zzso analysis of the zzso found that zzso zzso of them were zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso Our results provide insight into the mechanism of zzso regulating the zzso of its target genes in the complex and zzso process of zzso cancer zzso
