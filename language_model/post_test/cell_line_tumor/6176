The ability to screen compounds in a zzso manner is essential in the process of small zzso drug zzso Critical to the success of screening strategies is the proper design of the zzso often zzso a compromise between zzso and a biologically relevant zzso zzso is a major neglected disease with limited therapeutic zzso In order to streamline efforts for the design of productive drug screens against zzso we compared the efficiency of two screening methods, one targeting the free living and easily cultured zzso zzso stage, the other targeting the clinically relevant but more difficult to culture zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso library of zzso compounds against zzso zzso revealed 59 hits in the zzso primary screen and 27 in the zzso zzso screen, with 26 hits shared by both zzso This suggested that screening against the zzso stage, although more suitable for automation, fails to identify all active compounds and leads to numerous false positive zzso Of particular interest was the identification of one compound specific to the zzso zzso stage of the zzso This compound affects zzso but not zzso zzso suggesting a host zzso mechanism of action, opening new avenues for zzso zzso
