We have demonstrated that zzso cells zzso genetically modified to express zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso elicit more potential zzso effect than those loaded with peptides because they can prime zzso zzso T cells resulting in production of zzso zzso In this study, we showed the importance of zzso presentation via a major zzso complex zzso class II zzso in cancer immunity against zzso bound zzso such as the melanoma zzso zzso by using zzso derived from zzso class zzso mice zzso zzso were prepared by zzso of zzso zzso into zzso zzso cells obtained from zzso followed by differentiation with zzso zzso When zzso were zzso into zzso mice, the mice scarcely primed the zzso zzso cells and developed fewer zzso T cells than did those zzso with zzso zzso prepared from normal zzso The attenuated zzso effect was also confirmed in a zzso setting where, while two of eight control mice eradicated the pre-existing melanoma cell line zzso zzso no mice zzso with zzso zzso These results suggested not only the limitation of current protocols using zzso class zzso tumor peptides but also the usefulness of zzso expressing zzso in vaccine therapy against zzso
