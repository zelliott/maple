zzso semiconductor quantum dots zzso are novel zzso zzso that have found zzso Here we zzso a cell line of mouse zzso zzso were actively taken into the target cells by zzso zzso The zzso of zzso held in the zzso could be studied for more than a week and remained stable zzso against cell zzso induced by zzso A, zzso zzso zzso zzso and calcium zzso zzso These results suggested that zzso was stable and did not affect either cell zzso or cell zzso When zzso cells were zzso injected into zzso they remained in the peripheral blood in a concentration of approximately zzso up to 5 days after injection using both zzso zzso and flow zzso In addition, approximately zzso of zzso were detected in the zzso liver, zzso and zzso and could still be observed 7 days after zzso These results suggested that fluorescent zzso of zzso might be useful as zzso tools for tracing target cells over the period of a week in zzso
