Many studies have recently suggested that zzso zzso contribute to the development of various types of human zzso as well as to their invasive and zzso zzso Previously, our zzso expression signature of zzso cell zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso was significantly reduced in cancer zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate the functional significance of zzso and to identify its target genes in zzso zzso Restoration of mature zzso in two zzso cell lines zzso and zzso caused changes in the zzso cell zzso characteristics of the zzso transition zzso Restoration also significantly inhibited migration and invasion in the two zzso cell lines, suggesting that zzso functions as a tumor zzso zzso gene expression analysis zzso zzso and zzso clinical zzso and zzso database studies showed that zzso zzso is a promising candidate target gene of zzso It is well known that zzso is one of the most widely expressed zzso intermediate filament zzso Recent studies showed that zzso functions in cell zzso migration, survival and cell signaling processes via dynamic zzso in cancer zzso We focused on zzso and investigated whether zzso was regulated by tumor zzso zzso and contributed to cancer cell migration and invasion in zzso zzso Restoration of zzso in zzso cell lines suppressed zzso expression at both the zzso and protein zzso zzso studies of zzso in zzso cell lines demonstrated significant zzso of cell migration and invasion activities in zzso zzso In clinical specimens of zzso the expression levels of zzso were significantly zzso in cancer zzso compared to adjacent zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso showed that zzso expression levels in zzso specimens were significantly higher than those in normal zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso may function as an zzso and is regulated by tumor zzso zzso The existence of a tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso provides new insights into the potential mechanisms of zzso zzso and zzso
