With the use of zzso fluorescent cells and a highly sensitive zzso imaging system with both zzso and zzso we report here the development of zzso real-time imaging of cancer cell trafficking in live zzso To observe zzso and nuclear dynamics in the living zzso tumor cells were labeled in the nucleus with green fluorescent protein and with red fluorescent protein in the zzso zzso cancer cells were injected by a vascular route in an abdominal skin zzso in nude zzso The mice were zzso with an zzso zzso zzso imaging system with a sensitive zzso camera and five objective lenses, zzso and zzso enabling imaging from zzso to zzso We observed the nuclear and zzso behavior of cancer cells in real time in blood vessels as they moved by various means or zzso to the vessel surface in the abdominal skin zzso During zzso real-time zzso imaging showed that zzso processes of the cancer cells exited the vessels first, with zzso following along the zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso underwent deformation during zzso Different cancer cell lines seemed to strongly vary in their ability to zzso With the zzso cancer cells and the highly sensitive zzso imaging system described here, the zzso dynamics of cancer zzso can now be observed in live mice in real zzso This imaging technology will enable further understanding of the critical steps of zzso and provide visible targets for zzso drug zzso
