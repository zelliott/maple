The zzso of spontaneous calcium zzso zzso zzso in zzso presents a challenge because of the large irregularities in the zzso zzso and initiation times of the underlying zzso In this article, we use a zzso context to account for such zzso zzso which is based on previous models for cellular zzso zzso First, we found that passive zzso influx from the zzso space determine the zzso concentration of this zzso in the zzso Second, we demonstrated the feasibility of zzso both the zzso zzso zzso production levels and the average number of zzso zzso channels in the zzso clusters from zzso zzso imaging through the combination of a filtering strategy and a zzso zzso We estimated these two zzso parameters using data from zzso adult mice and zzso transgenic mice zzso the zzso zzso of human zzso zzso precursor zzso We found that, together with an increase in the passive zzso influx, a significant reduction in the sensitivity of G zzso receptors might lie beneath the abnormalities in the zzso zzso zzso as was observed in zzso models of Alzheimer's zzso This study provides new, to our knowledge, zzso for a quantitative analysis of zzso in normal and pathological zzso
