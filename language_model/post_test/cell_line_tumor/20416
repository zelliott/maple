In the treatment of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso improves long-term survival in combination with conventional zzso However, because the majority of patients with zzso eventually zzso the development of more effective therapies is zzso Here, we evaluated the zzso effects of a combination treatment involving zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso mice zzso To determine the efficacy of the combination treatment, zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso mice were monitored for tumor size and survival and subjected to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, the cell proliferation status of excised tumors was examined by zzso zzso In zzso zzso and Mino zzso mice, the combination treatment of zzso and zzso induced significant tumor growth zzso and tumor zzso compared with either single zzso On day 3 after the initiation of treatment a significant decrease in both zzso and zzso tumor zzso from zzso levels was observed in combination treatment zzso The zzso proliferation index was significantly decreased on day 3 in the zzso models treated with combination treatment, suggesting that the combination of zzso and zzso reduced cell proliferation and zzso zzso Furthermore, compared with zzso combination treatment prolonged survival times of severe combined zzso mice with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our findings demonstrate that zzso and zzso combination treatment enhances zzso activity in zzso zzso and zzso and zzso PET imaging may allow the early functional evaluation of treatment responses in patients with zzso
