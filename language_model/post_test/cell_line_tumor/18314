Recently, we combined a zzso expression cloning with a simple screening method using zzso cells and panning zzso zzso 315 zzso zzso In this study, we applied this method to identify the zzso recognized by an zzso zzso zzso raised against a zzso cell line, and identified it as the zzso zzso of zzso This simple method is useful for characterizing unknown zzso that recognize cell surface zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso identified as an zzso zzso zzso will be useful for studying zzso molecular zzso
