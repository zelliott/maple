zzso zzso cells zzso are significantly increased in cancer patients and tumor zzso zzso zzso into tumors and promote tumor invasion and zzso To identify the zzso responsible for the zzso property of zzso we used zzso We found zzso zzso protein zzso was decreased zzso in zzso from zzso zzso zzso mice compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were decreased in bone zzso and in zzso zzso by 45 and zzso respectively, in zzso zzso mice compared to zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso medium reduced zzso cell zzso expression by zzso zzso suggesting that a zzso factor mediates gene zzso zzso analysis shows a putative zzso domain in zzso and zzso analysis confirms zzso a novel zzso zzso It inhibited zzso B activity by nearly zzso in zzso zzso expression in zzso tumor cells suppressed cell invasion, delayed primary tumor growth, and greatly reduced lung zzso in zzso A zzso reduction of zzso activity was found in tumors expressing zzso compared to zzso zzso significantly reduced tumor zzso to zzso from zzso and zzso to zzso from zzso zzso zzso was zzso only in zzso tumors, and the number of zzso cells increased to zzso from zzso in zzso Taken together, this study identifies a negative regulator of tumor zzso in zzso zzso which is zzso in zzso zzso The finding suggests that zzso tumors promote zzso not only through zzso of zzso but also zzso of zzso zzso
