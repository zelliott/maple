In this study, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which are major zzso compounds zzso of garlic, were used as experimental materials to investigate their zzso effects on cell viability and cell cycle in human liver tumor cells zzso According to the results of cell viability zzso 50 or 100 zzso zzso significantly decreased the cell viability as compared with the control zzso zzso zzso in dose and time dependent zzso zzso of cell number loss, shape deformation and zzso were observed after treatment with 100 zzso zzso for 24 zzso Cell cycle studies showed that zzso cells were significantly arrested in zzso phase as the cells were treated with 100 zzso zzso 10, 50 or 100 zzso zzso for 24 h zzso zzso zzso zzso was more effective in arresting cells in zzso phase than zzso and the phenomena of arresting zzso cells in zzso phase increased obviously in dose and time dependent zzso According to the Western zzso analysis, zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activate zzso protein levels in zzso cells but increased zzso B1 protein zzso The zzso potency to zzso B1 and zzso expressions was in the order of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso potency to zzso B1 and zzso protein levels increased with increasing in zzso concentration and culture zzso In conclusion, zzso might affect cell viability and cell zzso changes in zzso cells and lead cells to be arrested in zzso phase via controlling the expression of zzso B1 and zzso in zzso cells, and the controlling action might relate to the zzso atom numbers in the structures of all these zzso zzso
