To investigate the potential effects of zzso the main zzso of zzso zzso on zzso activity and its regulation in zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso for zzso cells was determined by neutral red zzso A modified zzso chain reaction zzso zzso repeat amplification protocol was used to estimate relative zzso activity in zzso cells in comparison with the zzso control zzso Relative expression level of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene and zzso zzso were estimated using zzso real-time reverse zzso zzso Cell zzso in treated cells was demonstrated using a zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso in zzso cells was not zzso and tended to reach plateau immediately after the living cells were reduced in number to slightly higher than zzso However, 12 zzso concentration of zzso was considered as zzso where the zzso zzso effects were zzso zzso zzso data showed that the expression of zzso increased zzso in zzso treated zzso cells in comparison with the zzso zzso zzso treated zzso cells showed zzso features after 24 h and a small fraction of cells appeared with single zzso cell zzso The relative expression level of zzso dropped to less than 50% of control cells at a zzso concentration of zzso and subsequently increased to higher than zzso at zzso zzso activity was reduced considerably after administration of very low doses of zzso whereas higher zzso of zzso did not remarkably enhance the zzso zzso zzso experiments indicated a drastic decrease in expression level of zzso zzso of zzso under treatment with zzso zzso treatment of cells with very low doses of zzso caused a decline in growth rate by 4 zzso and many of the cells appeared to be aged with large volume and dark zzso in the zzso zzso 

zzso reduces zzso activity through zzso of zzso zzso zzso induction might not be directly caused by reducing zzso activity as it occurs after a few population zzso
