zzso methods were used to analyze quantitative differences in zzso membrane activities of two rat prostate cancer cell lines zzso and zzso of strong and weak zzso potential, zzso Each cell's zzso activity was determined by zzso zzso zzso Digital images of the patterns of zzso zzso were evaluated by zzso zzso generalized zzso dimension zzso and its zzso transform zzso as well as zzso zzso function system -- zzso zzso zzso These approaches revealed consistently that, under control conditions, all zzso parameters and zzso codes determined had values greater for zzso compared with zzso zzso This would agree generally with the zzso activity of the strongly zzso zzso cells being more developed than the corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso All the parameters studied were sensitive to zzso zzso zzso of the cells, which blocked zzso zzso channels zzso Some of the parameters had a zzso dependence on zzso activity, zzso zzso with zzso reduced the values for the zzso cells and eliminated the differences between the two cell zzso For other zzso however, there was a zzso dependence on zzso zzso The possible zzso meaning of the mathematical parameters studied and the nature of involvement of zzso activity in control of zzso are zzso
