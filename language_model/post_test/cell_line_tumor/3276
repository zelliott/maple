The identification of nontoxic agents that can enhance the efficacy of zzso zzso for patients with zzso zzso zzso remains a challenge in zzso We evaluated human zzso cell lines for their responsiveness to zzso an zzso compound used commonly in Asia as an zzso In experiments measuring zzso survival, treatment with a nontoxic dose of zzso rendered zzso cells more sensitive than zzso control cells to zzso Such zzso was not observed in parallel experiments with primary human zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso could be integrated with zzso zzso to selectively promote residual zzso tumor cell death
