zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso are an attractive option for quantitative imaging with zzso zzso zzso zzso in a scouting procedure prior to zzso zzso In this study, three important items in the zzso of zzso with zzso were introduced to obtain optimal and zzso product zzso restoration of zzso zzso deterioration of the starting zzso solution, radiation protection during and after zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 

A new method was applied, using an zzso carrier mix, zzso in one step zzso restoration of deteriorated zzso into the zzso form and chemical control over the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso 425 and zzso were zzso with zzso using the so-called zzso zzso method, as this method provides optimal quality zzso under challenging radiation zzso As a zzso condition, zzso carrier mix was added at a zzso zzso zzso ratio of zzso For comparison, zzso were zzso with zzso and with a mixture of zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso with zzso in this setting resulted in overall yields of zzso a zzso purity of zzso and preservation of zzso integrity and zzso including at the patient dose level (85 zzso No significant quality differences were observed when compared with zzso products, while the zzso isotope mixture gave exactly the same zzso efficiency for each of the zzso excluding a different chemical zzso of zzso The scouting performance of zzso zzso zzso at the patient dose level was evaluated in zzso studies upon zzso with zzso zzso zzso and by PET imaging in nude mice bearing the head and neck cancer zzso line zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso ratio gave fully zzso tissue zzso zzso Selective zzso zzso was confirmed with zzso revealing zzso of 15 out of 15 zzso 

These results pave the way for renewed evaluation of the potential of zzso for clinical zzso
