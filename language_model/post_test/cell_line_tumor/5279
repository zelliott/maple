This study was to explore whether the efficacy of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso plus zzso agents zzso zzso and zzso zzso may benefit from sequencing of the zzso 

Three head and neck cancer cell lines were used to study the effect of various combinations of and relative sequencing of D, zzso and Z in cell growth zzso A population zzso stimulation study was conducted on Z in zzso and used together with the growth zzso data to derive principles for future in zzso use of this drug zzso 

The zzso effects of Z on combinations of D and P were sequence zzso Treatment simultaneously with zzso or with zzso followed by Z zzso showed synergistic effects in all 3 cell zzso However, sequencing with Z followed by zzso zzso gave an zzso effect, suggesting that D and P should be administered when the effect of Z is zzso The induction of zzso was also sequence zzso The in zzso zzso study suggested the feasibility of zzso a zzso regimen for zzso in which D and P administration zzso when levels of Z are low, allowing levels of Z to accumulate sufficiently during the remainder of the zzso 

These data suggests that it is feasible to design clinical trials with these settings to maximize the efficacy of this combined drug zzso
