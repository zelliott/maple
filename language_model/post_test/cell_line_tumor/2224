zzso cancer often diagnosed at late stages when treatment options are severely zzso Thus, greater understanding of tumor metabolism leading ultimately to novel approaches to diagnosis is zzso Our laboratory has been utilizing zzso to evaluate compounds appearing in kidney cancer patients' zzso at zzso different from control zzso Here, we collected urine samples from kidney cancer patients and analyzed them by zzso coupled to mass zzso Once zzso to control for urinary zzso samples were analyzed by two independent zzso After technical zzso we now show differential urinary zzso of several zzso as a function of both cancer status and kidney cancer grade, with most zzso being increased in the urine of cancer patients and in those patients with high cancer zzso This finding was validated in a mouse zzso model of human kidney zzso Biological validation shows carbon chain zzso effects of the zzso on zzso in zzso and higher chain length zzso demonstrated zzso effects on zzso zzso suggesting an immune zzso effect of these zzso Thus, zzso in the kidney cancer urine may reflect zzso in zzso cell component synthesis and/or immune zzso and may help explain the profound chemotherapy resistance seen with this zzso This study shows for the first time the value of a novel class of zzso which may lead to new therapeutic approaches for cancer and may prove useful in cancer zzso zzso Furthermore, these findings open up a new area of investigation into the zzso basis of kidney zzso
