There are multiple mechanisms by which cells evade zzso growth zzso zzso In this report, we describe a novel mechanism by which cells become resistant to zzso growth zzso Although having all the components of the zzso signaling pathway, different cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso have different sensitivities toward zzso growth zzso The zzso resistance of zzso a zzso zzso cell line, was due to zzso zzso of zzso zzso II zzso and only transient zzso induced nuclear zzso of zzso and zzso With zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso treatment, zzso sensitivity was restored by stabilizing zzso expression and sustaining zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso blocked both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso In zzso and zzso two zzso cell lines, which had higher zzso levels of zzso and zzso compared with zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso and blocked subsequent zzso zzso Similar results were also obtained with normal B cells, where zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and subsequent zzso zzso zzso active zzso but not zzso active zzso induced zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso physically zzso with the zzso active zzso but not with zzso zzso indicating involvement of active zzso in stabilizing zzso zzso our data suggest a novel mechanism for zzso in regulating the sensitivity to zzso signaling by stabilizing zzso
