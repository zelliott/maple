The aim of this study was to confirm the expression profile of zzso zzso in comparison with that of zzso in oral zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso and to clarify an association of zzso with the zzso zzso 

The expression of zzso and zzso was zzso examined in 105 patients with zzso and 108 patients with zzso A correlation of zzso expression with zzso variables was carried zzso The zzso levels of zzso zzso were analyzed by real-time zzso in 5 zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso were detected in 101 zzso zzso and three zzso zzso of the 105 zzso zzso zzso was significantly expressed in zzso zzso compared to zzso differentiated zzso zzso zzso zzso As detected in 19 of the 34 zzso zzso zzso zzso and 36 of the 74 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso As detected in 11 of the 34 zzso zzso zzso and 52 of the 74 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The relative expression of zzso zzso in zzso was significantly higher than in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the relative expression of zzso zzso in zzso was significantly higher than in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso expression could be associated with the differentiation and the zzso of zzso A combination pattern of zzso might be a suitable marker of zzso zzso
