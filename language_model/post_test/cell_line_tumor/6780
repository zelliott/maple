zzso of zzso zzso is regarded as a zzso factor in the onset of zzso of the zzso In this study, we investigated the effects of zzso zzso acid zzso on zzso zzso in zzso breast cancer zzso zzso of transient zzso studies revealed that treatment with a zzso mix or selected zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso ranging from 20 to 80 zzso attenuated zzso zzso induced by the zzso agent zzso zzso In addition, the zzso mix inhibited zzso activity of the zzso zzso Using zzso mobility shift zzso we found that the zzso mix reduced zzso recruitment of nuclear proteins to a zzso response element zzso in the zzso promoter and a consensus zzso element zzso in the zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso are binding sites for zzso zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that the zzso zzso zzso was more effective than the zzso mix or zzso zzso in reducing binding of zzso to either the zzso zzso or zzso zzso whereas zzso acid increased binding to both zzso zzso of the zzso member, zzso reversed the zzso effects of the zzso mix on zzso transcription, and restored binding of nuclear proteins to the zzso and zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso
