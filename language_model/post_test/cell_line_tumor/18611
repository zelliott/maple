A zzso zzso involving the zzso gene is characteristic of zzso zzso zzso and represents a molecular disease marker with diagnostic and clinical zzso The detection of zzso zzso is hampered by technical problems, including the distribution of the zzso over a very large zzso region of approximately 1,000 zzso In this article, we report on the testing and validation of a segregation zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso on a large series of zzso A zzso of overlapping zzso clones was generated, and two probe sets zzso the zzso gene were zzso Both probe sets were tested in an zzso FISH segregation zzso on 8 zzso zzso cell lines and 32 zzso samples with proved zzso abnormalities and validated in 47 zzso from The Netherlands, Brazil, and zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified in zzso of the tumors of the test series and in zzso of the cases of the validation zzso In zzso of all positive samples, the zzso were located between 190 zzso zzso and 50 zzso 3' of zzso Nine cases had more distant zzso and in one patient an zzso of zzso into the zzso region was zzso In two of the three zzso lacking zzso zzso no zzso could be zzso suggesting that zzso is a zzso marker of zzso We did not find consistent differences between zzso and zzso zzso in zzso of an zzso zzso
