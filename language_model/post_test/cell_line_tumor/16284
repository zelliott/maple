In this study, we applied D, zzso zzso zzso as a chemical inhibitor for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso to reverse zzso zzso resistance of human leukemia cell line zzso zzso zzso showed that either zzso or zzso enhanced zzso effect of zzso on zzso cells, while zzso of these two drugs had a more significant effect on zzso Using flow zzso analysis, we confirmed that the enhancement effect was accompanied by elevated cellular zzso zzso and zzso zzso According to reverse zzso chain reaction and western zzso the reversal effect of that composite might owe to the significant zzso of zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso zzso diminished zzso gene expression and zzso also zzso zzso gene zzso Moreover, a positive correlation was observed between zzso and zzso Thus, our results suggest that a potential clinical application of zzso in combination with zzso may enhance zzso in zzso
