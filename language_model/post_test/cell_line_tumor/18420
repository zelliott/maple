We are developing zzso zzso zzso libraries zzso zzso to human zzso cancer cells as an zzso therapeutic zzso To test the hypothesis that zzso with preferential recognition of tumor cells as compared to normal cells could be generated, a zzso zzso display library zzso to human zzso cancer cell lines was absorbed with normal human blood zzso zzso analysis of the absorbed zzso zzso display library showed that zzso of tested clones reacted to zzso cancer zzso zzso of the library to blood cells was reduced zzso with many clones zzso to one or more of the blood cell zzso DNA fingerprint analysis of zzso zzso clones showed that the absorbed library remained zzso The H and L chain V region gene pairs of the absorbed library were transferred in mass from the zzso zzso display zzso to a zzso zzso and expressed as zzso following zzso into zzso myeloma zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso of zzso expressed zzso and of those zzso were positive for binding to the zzso human zzso cancer cell zzso A template of 95 zzso zzso was zzso designated zzso and zzso zzso from a consolidated mass zzso The zzso zzso zzso was compared to the clinically used zzso cancer zzso zzso by zzso and flow zzso for binding density on zzso zzso cancer cells and on normal human blood zzso The results showed that zzso bound to zzso cells at higher density than zzso zzso and that its binding to normal human blood cells was reduced zzso relative to an zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso was more effective than zzso zzso at zzso the growth of zzso cells in zzso These results suggest that a zzso zzso library with preferential zzso to cancer cells as compared to normal cells could be zzso
