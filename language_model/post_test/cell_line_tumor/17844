Since zzso zzso status is the zzso Alzheimer's disease zzso genetic risk factor, functional single zzso zzso zzso in brain zzso receptors represent excellent candidates for association with zzso Recently, we identified a zzso zzso as modulating the zzso efficiency of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 12 in female human liver and in zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso minor zzso was associated with significantly higher LDL and total cholesterol in women within the zzso zzso Study zzso Since zzso is a major zzso zzso in the brain, we hypothesized that zzso zzso zzso zzso in neural zzso and associates with zzso To evaluate this hypothesis, we first zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso cells and found that the zzso zzso reduces zzso 12 inclusion in this neural zzso We then evaluated the association of zzso zzso with zzso 12 zzso efficiency in zzso by zzso zzso zzso in human anterior zzso tissue obtained at zzso the zzso zzso is associated with decreased zzso zzso 12 zzso efficiency in aged zzso but not zzso Lastly, we evaluated whether zzso associates with zzso by zzso DNA from zzso men and zzso women drawn from three zzso zzso The zzso zzso was associated with increased zzso odds in males zzso model, odds ratio zzso of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso of zzso zzso P zzso zzso but not in zzso In zzso these studies identify a functional zzso zzso zzso that is associated with zzso in a zzso zzso
