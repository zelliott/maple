The protective effects of zzso on breast cancer have been zzso from zzso evidence and described in animal zzso The molecular mechanisms responsible have not been identified but laboratory evidence suggests that zzso may inhibit cancer promotion through zzso of the zzso zzso To zzso the role of zzso in breast cancer, the effect of zzso zzso solution zzso zzso zzso zzso on gene expression was analyzed in the zzso responsive zzso breast cancer cell zzso zzso analysis identified 29 genes that were zzso and 14 genes that were zzso in response to zzso zzso The altered genes included several involved in hormone metabolism as well as genes involved in the regulation of cell cycle zzso growth and zzso zzso zzso confirmed the array data demonstrating that zzso treatment increased the zzso levels of several genes involved in zzso metabolism zzso zzso and zzso while decreasing the levels of the zzso responsive genes zzso and zzso This report presents the results of the first gene array profiling of the response of a breast cancer cell line to zzso zzso In addition to zzso our understanding of the effects of zzso on breast cancer, this work suggests that zzso may be useful as an zzso therapy in the zzso manipulation of the zzso zzso in women with breast zzso
