Recently, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have emerged as a highly effective tool for zzso zzso A pair of zzso binds to two DNA recognition sites separated by a zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso at the C terminal then cleave DNA in the zzso Because of its modular design and capacity to precisely target almost any desired zzso zzso zzso is a technology that can revolutionize the entire biomedical research zzso Currently, for zzso editing in cultured cells, two plasmids zzso a pair of zzso are zzso followed by limited dilution to isolate cell colonies with the intended zzso zzso However, uncertain zzso efficiency becomes a zzso especially in zzso cells, reducing the overall efficiency of zzso zzso We have developed a robust zzso system in which each zzso zzso also encodes a zzso zzso Thus, cells zzso with both zzso zzso a prerequisite for zzso editing, can be isolated by zzso cell zzso Our improved zzso system can be applied to all cultured cells to achieve highly efficient zzso zzso Furthermore, an zzso procedure for zzso editing using zzso is also zzso We expect our system to be widely adopted by the scientific zzso
