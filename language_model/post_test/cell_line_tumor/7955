zzso a zzso regulated zzso zzso is a major tumor zzso whose expression is lost in multiple tumor zzso However, the mechanisms contributing to it are zzso We have recently shown that zzso binding zzso zzso is required for the zzso and zzso gamma zzso expression of zzso in many cell zzso zzso interacts with the zzso zzso a zzso complex that couples zzso bound zzso factors to the zzso zzso machinery in an zzso dependent manner for regulating zzso zzso Specifically, the zzso zzso zzso associates with the zzso bound zzso at the zzso site of zzso in an zzso dependent manner for stimulating gene zzso zzso we investigated if the mechanism responsible for the loss of zzso expression in human zzso involves a failure to recruit zzso and/or zzso to the zzso zzso We compared the relative occupancy of these factors at the zzso promoter at zzso sites in normal and cancer cell zzso A significantly lower binding of these factors to the zzso site of zzso promoter occurred in human cancer cell lines than in normal zzso We show that loss of zzso expression zzso with a corresponding loss of zzso expression in a number of primary human lung zzso zzso levels were significantly lower in cancer cell lines than in normal zzso zzso we show that restoration of zzso zzso the expression of zzso in these cancer cells and also zzso their zzso potential in zzso Our studies reveal a critical zzso limiting zzso expression in cancer cell zzso
