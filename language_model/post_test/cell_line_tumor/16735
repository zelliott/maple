zzso small cell lung cancer zzso is the leading worldwide source of zzso zzso Although some drugs targeting zzso zzso have been developed, most advanced cases are still zzso New targets for zzso drugs are zzso The zzso 1 domain of zzso growth factor alpha chain zzso is a potent zzso zzso It has also emerged as a potential zzso factor in zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso protein in patients with zzso has not been reported to zzso 

Here, we assessed zzso expression by Western zzso in 103 cases with advanced zzso to investigate the impact of zzso on zzso 

zzso revealed 33 zzso patients were classified as high zzso this being significantly associated with less remote zzso zzso zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There was also a significant association between zzso expression and tumor size zzso zzso zzso as well as clinical stage zzso zzso zzso zzso survival analysis showed that both overall survival zzso and progression free survival zzso of patients with zzso expression were longer than those of patients without zzso expression zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso zzso reversed zzso zzso in the resistant zzso cell line zzso but did not inhibit the proliferation of zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells by zzso was related to decreased zzso of zzso and zzso 

zzso may be a useful zzso factor of advanced zzso patients and a potential drug for zzso resistant zzso
