Recently a new zzso zzso complex zzso zzso has been zzso and found to exhibit zzso activity in zzso zzso it has been demonstrated that zzso shows little or no zzso against a number of the zzso resistant zzso cancer cell lines in zzso suggesting a different mode of action for the zzso In this study, zzso radiation infrared zzso zzso has been used on drug treated single zzso cells in order to determine if this different mode of action can be identified zzso The aim of the study was to zzso zzso if single cell zzso could be used to give insight into the cellular response on treatment with different zzso agents relative to zzso cells zzso and zzso that if the zzso drugs elicit a different zzso response these responses could be distinguished from each zzso The most striking features obtained after Principal zzso Analysis zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso corrected single cell zzso of drug treated zzso zzso cells are: zzso The zzso obtained for the control are quite zzso and several hundred zzso are required to adequately define the nature of the zzso zzso after drug treatment at the zzso level for 24 h with zzso zzso methotrexate, zzso or zzso the cell zzso as represented on a zzso scores plot, generally concentrate in certain well defined areas of the control, there are however a small number of zzso that fall outside of the area defined by the zzso and zzso a differentiation between cell zzso obtained on treatment with different drugs is observed which fits well with different in zzso cell culture zzso and a flow zzso cell cycle analysis of the control and drug treated zzso zzso of the loading plots shows that zzso is essentially the same for all plots and reflects changes in cell zzso related to the cell zzso zzso however, on comparison of the control versus zzso or zzso versus zzso is indicative of differences induced by drug treatment and has been termed as cell zzso zzso These data are shown to be consistent with that obtained using zzso zzso by averaging a number of single cell zzso and carrying out a zzso but zzso offers more insight into how the drug is affecting the cell zzso More importantly, this approach enables the influence of the cell cycle on both the control and drug treated samples to be taken into consideration when evaluating the zzso zzso
