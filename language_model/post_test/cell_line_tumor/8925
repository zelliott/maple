The present investigation was undertaken to study the effect of in zzso exposure of zzso zzso cells, to zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso on cell survival and evolution of resistance to zzso drug zzso zzso zzso cells showed zzso of survival accompanied by an zzso induction of zzso Changes in cell survival properties were associated with zzso in zzso zzso pH zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso generation of zzso oxide, expression pattern of some key cell survival regulatory zzso zzso zzso active zzso and zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso also altered their zzso to the zzso of zzso accompanied by altered expression of zzso resistance regulating zzso and zzso zzso This study for the first time zzso some of the key molecular events underlying zzso of cell survival of cancer cells of zzso origin by zzso and its contribution to zzso against zzso Thus these findings will be of immense help in further research for zzso the use of zzso for improving the zzso efficacy of zzso drugs like zzso
