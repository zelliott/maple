Breast cancer cell lines have been used widely to investigate breast cancer zzso and new zzso Breast cancer is a zzso zzso disease, and it is important to understand how well and which cell lines best model that zzso In particular, zzso studies have identified molecular zzso A, zzso B, zzso zzso and zzso characteristic zzso patterns and underlying DNA copy number zzso zzso Here, we studied a collection of breast cancer cell lines to catalog molecular profiles and to assess their relation to breast cancer zzso 

zzso DNA zzso were used to profile gene expression and zzso in a collection of 52 zzso breast cancer cell lines, and comparisons were made to existing profiles of primary breast zzso zzso zzso was used to identify zzso zzso and Gene Set zzso Analysis zzso to discover biological features of those zzso zzso and zzso profiles were integrated to discover within zzso zzso candidate cancer genes with zzso altered gene copy number and zzso 

zzso profiling of breast cancer cell lines identified one zzso and two zzso (A and zzso zzso zzso lines displayed an zzso zzso zzso signature and resembled zzso tumors, zzso lines were associated with zzso and zzso signatures and resembled zzso tumors, and zzso lines displayed zzso and zzso zzso Compared to tumors, cell lines exhibited similar patterns of zzso but an overall higher complexity of zzso zzso simple zzso tumors were not zzso and only partial conservation of zzso zzso We identified 80 high-level DNA zzso and 13 zzso zzso and the resident genes with zzso altered zzso highlighting known and novel candidate breast cancer zzso 

Overall, breast cancer cell lines were genetically more complex than tumors, but retained expression patterns with relevance to the zzso zzso zzso The compendium of molecular profiles defines cell lines suitable for investigations of zzso zzso cancer stem cell biology, zzso and therapies, and provides a resource for discovery of new breast cancer zzso
