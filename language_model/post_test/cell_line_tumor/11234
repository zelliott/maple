The objective of this study was to examine the zzso and zzso hormone removal efficiency of zzso zzso zzso iron zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 101 zzso activated carbon zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso materials from zzso grade water and constructed zzso system zzso treated dairy farm zzso zzso test studies were performed and hormone concentration analysis carried out using highly sensitive reporter gene zzso zzso The results showed that hormonal interaction with these materials is selective for individual classes of zzso Connelly zzso and zzso 101 zzso were more efficient in removing testosterone zzso than zzso zzso and showed faster removal rates of zzso and zzso than the other zzso zzso zzso zzso was more efficient in removing zzso than zzso zzso zzso OC achieved the lowest final concentration of zzso equivalent zzso and provided maximum removal of both zzso and zzso
