The zzso zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso is frequently detected in breast cancer cell lines but not in normal breast zzso zzso zzso has been classified as an zzso because zzso active zzso can mediate zzso transformation in cultured cells and tumor formation in nude zzso Since zzso appears to play an important role in breast cancer, it is of interest to investigate zzso genes and zzso zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso genes in human breast zzso zzso Upon zzso of zzso a zzso active zzso form, in zzso zzso immortalized breast zzso cells, the total zzso was extracted and subjected to zzso zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso protein zzso zzso 5 zzso was markedly induced (more than zzso increase, zzso by zzso zzso zzso result also demonstrated that zzso zzso was significantly induced by zzso in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso was further confirmed by Western zzso in zzso breast zzso zzso Furthermore, in zzso breast zzso cells, which express high levels of activated zzso and zzso zzso protein was significantly reduced by using zzso short interfering zzso The reduction of zzso was consistent with zzso zzso in this breast zzso cell zzso We also investigated zzso expression in different breast zzso cell lines and breast cancer zzso using tissue array zzso Compared with zzso breast zzso cells or normal zzso without zzso active zzso zzso zzso protein levels are remarkably higher in breast zzso cell lines and cancer zzso with zzso activated zzso Taken together, our findings suggest that zzso active zzso zzso zzso in the breast zzso zzso zzso may be one of the zzso genes and plays its essential roles in zzso zzso by zzso activated zzso signaling in breast zzso and zzso
