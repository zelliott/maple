alpha zzso is an zzso protein coded by zzso a gene mapped to zzso a common deleted region in lung zzso In this study we characterized the expression of alpha zzso and alpha zzso an alternatively spliced zzso of alpha zzso in lung cancer cell lines and zzso cell lung cancer zzso samples from early stage lung cancer zzso In zzso zzso an zzso analysis showed zzso expression of alpha zzso and alpha zzso in normal lung zzso zzso In contrast, alpha zzso zzso was not found in zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso whereas all of the tumors expressed alpha zzso Besides, lack of alpha zzso expression was associated with high proliferation of the tumor zzso by zzso zzso By zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso cell lines and tumors showed zzso losses at zzso zzso with the absence of the zzso On the other hand, no zzso in the coding region of the gene were found in any of the 24 cell lines zzso By Northern zzso and real-time reverse zzso we detected the expression of alpha zzso and alpha zzso messages in zzso and small cell lung cancer cell zzso Our data demonstrate an abnormal expression of alpha zzso in lung cancer, possibly associated with an altered processing of the alpha zzso zzso leading to a zzso expression of alpha zzso This may be considered as an example of alternative zzso involved in tumor zzso gene zzso Finally, induction of alpha zzso expression reduced cell growth, in agreement with its proposed role as a tumor zzso and suggesting an association of this zzso protein with lung zzso
