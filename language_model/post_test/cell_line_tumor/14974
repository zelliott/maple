zzso melanoma is zzso to various zzso including zzso agents such as zzso Previous studies have suggested a link between zzso zzso and zzso resistance through zzso in the properties of the zzso zzso We found that zzso treatment induced temporary zzso arrest in 7 melanoma cell lines irrespective of the zzso level, suggesting that zzso had no significant influence on zzso zzso On the other hand, the amount of zzso an zzso zzso was well correlated with zzso zzso Treatment of the zzso cell lines with zzso an inhibitor of zzso and zzso or simultaneous zzso of zzso and zzso dramatically increased the zzso sensitivity, while zzso of zzso another member of the zzso family, had only a minimal zzso Our results suggest that the zzso sensitivity of melanoma cells is attributable to zzso zzso rather than a change in zzso properties and that zzso and zzso play a pivotal role in the zzso
