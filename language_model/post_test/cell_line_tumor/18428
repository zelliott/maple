Recently, we demonstrated that zzso zzso and its product, zzso zzso zzso were zzso of zzso acid released in cells in response to zzso and calcium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Spiegel, zzso Roddy, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso interference technology abolished the ability of zzso to induce zzso acid release in zzso cells, demonstrating that zzso is the key zzso zzso downstream of zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso induced the zzso of full-length zzso from the zzso to the zzso zzso regions, which are known sites of zzso in response to zzso zzso also induced the zzso of the zzso domain of zzso in the same manner, suggesting that this domain is responsive to zzso either directly or zzso In zzso studies were then conducted to distinguish these two zzso In zzso binding studies disclosed that zzso interacts directly with full-length zzso and with the zzso domain in a zzso and zzso manner with a zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso induced a zzso increase in zzso zzso activity as well as lowering the zzso of calcium for the zzso from 191 to 31 zzso This study identifies zzso as an zzso zzso that zzso and directly activates zzso demonstrating a role for this zzso zzso in the mediation of inflammatory zzso
