During tumor development, constant interplay occurs between tumor cells and surrounding zzso zzso We report evidence that gastrointestinal zzso tumor zzso cells invade the zzso zzso through the release of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso which triggers the zzso conversion of zzso smooth muscle cells to zzso zzso These recipient cells display zzso changes and acquire zzso zzso including enhanced zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso pathways downstream of zzso expression of zzso Cell of zzso zzso and release of various zzso zzso zzso particularly zzso This report shows stimulation of zzso production by zzso cells via zzso of zzso zzso which leads to tumor cell zzso zzso derived from zzso patients but not healthy donors show enhanced zzso zzso by smooth muscle cells and tumor cell invasion, whereas selective blocking of zzso zzso zzso decreases tumor zzso Our study indicates that zzso release and subsequent zzso induction creates a positive feedback mechanism established between tumor and zzso cells that drives zzso development and offers unique insights for potential therapeutic strategies to block zzso progression and zzso zzso
