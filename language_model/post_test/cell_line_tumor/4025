zzso are dynamic structures that must be zzso condensed and unfolded to accommodate zzso division and zzso zzso zzso modifications are involved in the striking zzso reconfiguration taking place during zzso However, the mechanisms that regulate activity and function of zzso factors as cells enter and exit zzso are poorly zzso Here, we show that the zzso complex or zzso zzso is involved in the zzso turnover of zzso zzso zzso zzso a common component of zzso zzso zzso complexes, and that the zzso degradation of zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression of both zzso and zzso reduced the levels of zzso zzso protein and induced its zzso zzso zzso or stabilization zzso multiple zzso zzso including lagging zzso zzso bridges and zzso zzso In addition, lack of sister zzso cohesion and impaired zzso zzso were found after zzso zzso or zzso By using a truncated form of zzso we show that zzso delay is associated with a global zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso modifier zzso is targeted for destruction in a cell zzso zzso They also suggest that degradation of zzso by the zzso is necessary for a proper zzso of zzso and proper zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso may represent a fundamental arm for zzso orchestration of the zzso zzso
