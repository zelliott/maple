The zzso zzso has been implicated in all major types of human zzso We recently showed that zzso zzso expression causes stem cell compartment expansion resulting in the initiation of zzso We have previously shown that zzso regulates zzso a zzso involved in DNA zzso implicating zzso in zzso zzso Here, we have demonstrated using primary normal human oral zzso zzso that zzso of zzso suppressed the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso through promoter zzso zzso of zzso using zzso zzso the zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso of two DNA zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression during zzso progression across a panel of normal primary zzso strains zzso zzso zzso and head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso cell lines zzso correlated positively with zzso expressions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso with zzso and zzso zzso modification and zzso promoter analysis using absolute quantitative zzso zzso showed that zzso of zzso significantly induced zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso in primary zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso profiling method, we revealed that zzso zzso expression in primary zzso induced a global zzso pattern similar to that found in an zzso zzso cell zzso Following validation experiments using absolute zzso we have identified a set of zzso zzso zzso found to be zzso correlated with in zzso zzso expression levels of clinical zzso zzso biopsy zzso This study provided the first evidence, using primary normal human cells and zzso zzso that zzso zzso of zzso orchestrated a DNA zzso signature that mimics the cancer zzso landscape, from which we have identified a unique zzso zzso signature which may have clinical zzso zzso as zzso for early cancer zzso diagnostic and/or therapeutic zzso
