zzso zzso zzso actively participate in zzso communication with tumor cells and with other cell types in the zzso contributing to a zzso neighborhood and promoting tumor zzso The aim of this study is the characterization of how zzso from primary human colon tumors promote migration of colon cancer zzso 

zzso zzso cultures from 15 primary human colon tumors were zzso Their enrichment in zzso was evaluated by the expression of various zzso and zzso specific zzso zzso zzso of primary zzso with different colon tumor cells were performed to evaluate zzso zzso effects on cancer zzso Gene expression profiles were developed to further investigate zzso zzso 

zzso zzso showed significant differences in zzso zzso zzso effects on cancer zzso Moreover, the association between zzso zzso effects on cancer cells and classic zzso zzso or zzso markers was zzso zzso gene expression profiles were analyzed by zzso to identify zzso genes in different zzso zzso The gene expression signature, derived from the most zzso zzso was zzso Interestingly, this zzso zzso showed a remarkable zzso value for the clinical outcome of patients with colon zzso Moreover, this zzso value was validated in an independent series of 142 patients with colon cancer, by quantitative real-time zzso zzso with a set of four genes included in the zzso zzso 

In zzso these studies show for the first time the zzso of primary zzso effect on colon cancer cell zzso A zzso gene expression signature able to zzso patients with colon cancer into zzso and low-risk groups was zzso
