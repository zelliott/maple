In the present investigation, we have examined the zzso regulation of zzso zzso coli zzso gene expression in the spontaneously immortalized human normal breast zzso cell line, zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso levels and the zzso zzso promoter zzso activity were increased in zzso cells after treatment with zzso A sequential deletion analysis and zzso zzso of the zzso promoter revealed that the zzso response is zzso through a zzso zzso Also, the zzso binding agent zzso A, which prevents binding of proteins to the zzso region, abolished zzso increase of the zzso promoter zzso The specificity of the proteins binding to the zzso region was characterized by zzso zzso An increased binding of the zzso binding proteins was observed in the zzso analysis with nuclear extracts from zzso zzso cells, which corresponded to the increased levels of zzso and zzso zzso However, a zzso of the zzso complexes was observed with only zzso zzso Based on the zzso zzso results, the zzso appeared to be a genuine protein binding to the zzso site of the zzso zzso In zzso interference experiments, in which the zzso expression was knocked down, the zzso response on the zzso promoter activity was reduced, suggesting that the binding of zzso to the zzso site is critical for zzso zzso promoter zzso From these results we conclude that the increased zzso promoter activity in the zzso cell line in response to zzso treatment is zzso by zzso
