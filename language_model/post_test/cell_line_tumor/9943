Advanced prostate cancer has long been known to respond to zzso zzso but disease inevitably zzso to become zzso zzso zzso the responsive period is an important, yet zzso clinical zzso This study aims to determine whether zzso zzso zzso are potentially useful agents in zzso zzso zzso 

The expression of zzso in human prostate surgical zzso both benign and zzso zzso dependent and independent, was determined by zzso zzso mice, in which prostate cancer zzso had been established, were zzso and zzso to receive either zzso inhibitor or vehicle for 8 zzso Time to zzso independence zzso growth rate and rate of zzso rise were compared between zzso zzso zzso at the zzso and protein level, was determined in the native zzso cell line and in zzso of varying zzso sensitivity derived from the zzso 

In human zzso zzso protein was expressed in prostate zzso and was zzso in prostate cancer and remained zzso after zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso obtained from the zzso zzso model showed variable zzso zzso with some evidence of zzso in zzso The addition of a zzso inhibitor to zzso does not zzso the time to zzso zzso zzso rate of zzso growth zzso zzso or rate of zzso rise zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso 

This study does not support a role for zzso zzso in zzso zzso responsiveness in prostate zzso
