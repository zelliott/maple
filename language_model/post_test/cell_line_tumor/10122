zzso control of stem cell genes is a critical step in differentiation of embryonic stem cells and in zzso of zzso cells into stem zzso Here we report that zzso a regulator of repressive zzso at zzso also plays an important role in zzso of stem zzso genes such as zzso We found that zzso zzso is gained during in zzso differentiation of several stem zzso genes (in 11 of 12 promoter zzso and thus appears to be a common zzso zzso zzso depletion prevents complete zzso of stem cell gene expression and zzso promotes the maintenance of stem cell characteristics in zzso zzso is required for establishment of DNA zzso patterns at stem cell genes during zzso in part by regulating access of zzso to its zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso is involved in the control of stem cell genes and suggest that zzso is an important zzso zzso during early stem cell zzso
