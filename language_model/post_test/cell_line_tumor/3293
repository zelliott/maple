We have recently reported the synthesis of a series of original zzso zzso hybrid zzso The biological activity of these compounds was evaluated in zzso on zzso dependent and independent zzso and zzso human zzso and zzso zzso The hybrid molecules present higher affinity than that of zzso for the zzso zzso alpha zzso The zzso and the affinity of the hybrid molecules are explained using molecular modeling zzso This study further confirms that the derivatives made of a zzso zzso displayed superior activity against the cell lines particularly when the connecting arm is 8-10 carbon atoms zzso zzso modeling shows that a long side chain can facilitate the access of the zzso zzso to zzso The novel compounds also prove to be moderately zzso against platinum resistant zzso and zzso cancer cell zzso
