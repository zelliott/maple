zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso disease of the lower zzso zzso The increased occurrence of high-risk human zzso zzso infection seems to be associated with the increasing frequency of zzso zzso of zzso DNA into host zzso has been hypothesized to be a critical step in the zzso of cervical zzso resulting in altered expression of two viral transforming genes E6 and zzso 

We analyzed zzso and zzso DNA, and integrated transcripts of zzso and zzso zzso in 30 zzso cases with 53 zzso using a zzso protocol for the amplification of zzso zzso transcripts zzso 

24 of 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (in 23 zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso was observed in eight zzso of 21 zzso positive zzso III zzso All eight zzso were zzso and had zzso disease zzso including one case that progressed to zzso zzso Five of eight zzso were found to have zzso specific zzso fusion transcripts only, two of eight showed zzso zzso fusion zzso and one of eight had both zzso derived and zzso zzso fusion zzso In 10 zzso of 12 zzso zzso III patients, all specimens derived from the same patient zzso the same zzso type and zzso transcript pattern suggesting zzso 

zzso is the most prevalent type among zzso zzso zzso and zzso DNA integration into host cell zzso seems to be related to the progression stage of zzso zzso and, therefore, may be necessary for development of zzso invasive zzso zzso
