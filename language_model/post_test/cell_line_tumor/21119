zzso of cell cycle leads to cell transformation and cancer zzso Here we present profiling the zzso dynamics using zzso and constructing the associated functional networks during the cell cycle of human zzso cells, zzso The protein dynamics was validated by zzso zzso analysis on the zzso and by Northern zzso zzso on the selected zzso zzso Of the zzso protein spots, 201 with variation zzso of expression dynamics zzso throughout the cell cycle were subjected to zzso Degree of the global protein dynamics was phase dependent with the greatest in transitional zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of pathways zzso zzso progression versus arrest, and/or pathways regulating zzso versus zzso was always identified during the cell cycle, suggesting the existence of zzso mechanisms for zzso zzso Data mining of the results suggested that the key zzso factors in zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso zzso Our findings for the first time provide insights into the regulation of zzso zzso progression at the zzso level, and grant a model to study disease mechanisms and to discover therapeutic targets for zzso zzso
