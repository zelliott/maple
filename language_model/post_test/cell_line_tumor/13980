In a previous study, we reported that zzso growth factor zzso produced a rapid increase in the zzso of zzso breast cancer zzso Others have demonstrated that zzso treatment in zzso species produces rapid zzso zzso zzso zzso cells do not produce zzso thus, in the present study, zzso cells were zzso zzso with a zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso and empty zzso cell lines zzso 

A zzso expression zzso containing a zzso zzso was zzso into zzso cells, and two stable clones zzso and zzso were zzso Western zzso of zzso medium from these clones was used to confirm the expression of zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso zzso cells was compared using zzso zzso and a cell culture wounding model which examined cell migration over a period of 1-3 zzso 

The Western blots demonstrated that the expression of zzso in both the zzso and zzso cell lines was higher than the zzso and zzso cell zzso The cell proliferation and migration distance was significantly greater for both zzso zzso cell lines than the zzso and zzso cell lines under the same experimental zzso Further, changes in zzso zzso were observed in both the zzso and zzso cell zzso In addition, the zzso clone was found to produce much larger tumors than both the zzso and zzso clones in mouse zzso These results indicated that zzso production of zzso in the zzso zzso cell lines enhanced cell migration, zzso zzso and zzso tumor zzso 

zzso zzso cells displayed a much greater zzso than zzso cells, confirming the zzso zzso enhancement effect which we previously zzso The use of zzso breast cancer cells in the zzso model may help to study the mechanism of zzso cell zzso and to identify specific zzso zzso that may be used to prevent or impede zzso zzso zzso
