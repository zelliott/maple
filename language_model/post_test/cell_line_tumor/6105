Recent advances in the study of zzso indicate that they have an important role in regulating cellular activities such as zzso zzso zzso and differentiation by regulating the expression of various zzso zzso is highly expressed in hair zzso and in some tumor cells, suggesting its participation in tumor zzso but it is significantly zzso in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso The mechanism underlying these effects is not yet zzso Here, we dissect the effects of zzso on zzso zzso cells, and zzso and zzso breast cancer cell zzso We found that expression of zzso promotes proliferation and survival of zzso cells as well as breast cancer zzso zzso zzso inhibited both zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso activity, which was confirmed by a reporter construct bearing the zzso region of zzso However, zzso of zzso completely zzso the enhancement of zzso activities on cell zzso survival and sensitivity of tumor cells to zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso targeting of zzso might have an important role in breast cancer tumor zzso making it a potential candidate for intervention in zzso
