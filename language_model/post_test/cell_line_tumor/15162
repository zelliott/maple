zzso zzso is one of the most common and aggressive primary brain tumors in zzso High zzso levels are thought to contribute to zzso zzso While research has focused on understanding zzso signaling in zzso cells, little is known about the role of zzso between zzso and zzso zzso To study the relationship between zzso and tumor cells, the zzso zzso zzso cell line was zzso We hypothesized increased zzso zzso by zzso would zzso affect zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells were zzso for 7 days in a zzso chamber in the presence of 5 zzso zzso zzso were treated with zzso an zzso synthetic zzso known to increase zzso zzso expression in zzso Our results indicate zzso can increase zzso zzso through the zzso zzso leading to less zzso available for zzso cells, ultimately resulting in increased zzso cell zzso These data suggest that zzso in the tumor zzso can be targeted by the drug, zzso affecting tumor cell zzso
