zzso zzso leukemia chronic phase zzso zzso cells contain numerous DNA zzso breaks whose unfaithful repair may contribute to zzso instability and disease progression to blast phase zzso These phenomena are often associated with the appearance of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso Here we show that zzso zzso and zzso zzso promoted zzso zzso unfaithful zzso zzso repair zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso domain interacts with zzso zzso regions, resulting in direct zzso of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the complex with zzso zzso zzso to the nucleus, and enhances formation of the nuclear zzso indicative of zzso zzso zzso and zzso nuclear zzso were strongly reduced by zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso mimicking zzso fragment, but not that with zzso zzso zzso diminished zzso zzso formation and inhibited zzso in leukemia zzso In conclusion, we zzso that zzso zzso zzso promotes unfaithful zzso in leukemia cells, which may contribute to zzso of secondary zzso aberrations responsible for zzso zzso and zzso
