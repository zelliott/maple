The previous works about safety evaluation for constructed zzso tissue specific zzso are poorly zzso Thus, we investigated the zzso and body toxicity of zzso specific zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso providing meaningful information prior to embarking on human clinical zzso 

zzso replicate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were constructed with zzso tissue specific zzso promoter to induce the expression of zzso gene and zzso fusing zzso and zzso was inserted at upstream of promoter to enhance the function of zzso Based on the zzso and zzso effect of zzso cancer, these zzso were zzso injected into subcutaneous zzso tumor in nude zzso We then determined the toxicity through general health and behavioral assessment, zzso and zzso toxicity zzso zzso and microscopic zzso zzso The spread of the zzso zzso of zzso was detected with zzso and Western zzso zzso replication and distribution were examined with zzso administration and zzso zzso 

General assessment and body weight of the animals did not reveal any zzso in general zzso The zzso zzso of groups which were injected with zzso zzso or higher dose zzso zzso of zzso and zzso showed no difference in comparison with PBS group, and only slight increased zzso in contrast to PBS group at zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso did not zzso to zzso outside of zzso zzso zzso replication was not detected in other zzso beside tumor according to zzso zzso 

Our study showed that zzso zzso zzso and zzso appear safe with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso injection in mice, without any zzso effects on general health and zzso
