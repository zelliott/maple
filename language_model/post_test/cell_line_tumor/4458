zzso contributing to the zzso of cancer possess zzso and nuclear structural zzso that accompany their zzso zzso zzso and molecular zzso Although it is known that architectural changes in primary and zzso tumor cells can be zzso through variations in cellular density at the zzso and zzso spatial zzso the zzso relationships among nuclear and zzso density as a function of zzso potential has not been thoroughly zzso We present a combined optical approach utilizing quantitative phase zzso and partial wave zzso zzso to perform parallel structural zzso of cellular zzso Using the zzso zzso and zzso cell lines as a model of zzso and zzso transition in zzso cancer, we demonstrate that nuclear and zzso zzso disorder, zzso dry mass content, mean dry mass density, and shape metrics of the dry mass density zzso are uniquely correlated within and across different cellular compartments for a given cell zzso The correlations of these physical parameters can be interpreted as networks whose zzso importance and level of connection independence differ according to disease zzso This work demonstrates how zzso derived zzso parameters are linked within and across different cellular compartments during the architectural orchestration of the zzso zzso
