The zzso zzso membrane protein 1 zzso of zzso virus zzso is involved in the zzso of human zzso zzso zzso and zzso We and other authors have shown earlier that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso tumor growth in mice, but the mechanism underlying these processes has not been investigated so zzso In the present study, we show that zzso of zzso renders the zzso zzso cell line zzso resistant to various zzso drugs zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso a zzso regulated protein shown earlier to inhibit zzso zzso of zzso binding protein zzso with small hairpin zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso reduces zzso level and renders both zzso cells and zzso zzso cell lines sensitive to zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso pathways are required for zzso suppression of zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso further confirm that the zzso zzso factor zzso mediates the zzso zzso of zzso gene zzso zzso zzso also increases the resistance of zzso tumors to zzso in mice, therefore confirming the relevance of our findings in zzso This study reveals the molecular mechanism underlying the zzso activity of zzso during zzso zzso zzso
