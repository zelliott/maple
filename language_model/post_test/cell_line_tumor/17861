zzso zzso has been shown to play a pivotal role in zzso zzso interactions between breast cancer cells and zzso zzso during tumor cell zzso However, the zzso for zzso and its role in zzso breast cancer cell zzso migration remain zzso 

By assessing migration of various breast cancer cells across zzso zzso human zzso vein zzso cells zzso we found that breast cancer cells migrated across zzso zzso zzso and that zzso was zzso zzso Cell surface labeling with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso capacity of breast cancer cells was correlated to both the expression level and zzso pattern of zzso binding zzso on the tumor cell zzso The zzso strongly bound to zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells, but not zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso was abolished by removal of tumor cell surface zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso affinity column, we further zzso the zzso of zzso from zzso breast cancer zzso The zzso protein sequence and zzso sequence identified this zzso zzso as a approximately 170 zzso human zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso showed a high affinity for zzso via zzso zzso and, as expected, zzso cell zzso to and migration across zzso zzso were significantly reduced by zzso of tumor cell zzso via zzso zzso 

We demonstrated, for the first time, that breast cancer cell zzso is a major zzso zzso in zzso tumor cell migration across zzso zzso This finding offers new insights into the molecular basis of zzso adhesive interactions that mediate breast cancer cell zzso zzso
