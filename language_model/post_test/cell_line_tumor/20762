The underlying premise of these investigations was that the zzso hormone zzso which partitions into and (at relatively high zzso zzso the fluid mechanics of the zzso would zzso integral associations between membrane lipids and exporter pumps that otherwise zzso drug zzso That zzso can affect zzso of zzso zzso cells and zzso to zzso was zzso 

The zzso human cell lines zzso and zzso were treated for 24 hours with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and platinum were measured by zzso zzso and zzso coupled plasma mass zzso zzso zzso mice were zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso (2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso regimens were initiated zzso at one week (when zzso were zzso and continued to six weeks zzso zzso zzso zzso and platinum zzso were assessed upon zzso at 24 hours after the final injection of zzso 

There were no significant in zzso zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced platinum zzso and induced drug toxicity in both cell zzso zzso was suppressed by zzso The treatment zzso was related to elevated tumor platinum and zzso evidence of zzso 

It appears that the addition of zzso to zzso cancer therapeutic zzso represents a step in improving zzso
