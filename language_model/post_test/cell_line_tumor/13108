Previous studies have shown that altered forms of zzso a protein known to play a vital role in DNA zzso break repair, DNA zzso and zzso maintenance are associated with cancer zzso We investigated the role of zzso in breast cancer in both clinical and in zzso zzso 

We examined zzso expression in tumor zzso from invasive zzso zzso breast cancer patients zzso zzso zzso by zzso and associations with zzso characteristics and overall survival were assessed using Cox zzso hazards zzso models and zzso survival zzso Effect of zzso zzso and zzso on cell zzso invasion, and zzso was assessed in zzso using breast cancer cell lines zzso and zzso We also investigated the mechanisms zzso Effect of zzso zzso on tumor growth was assessed in an zzso zzso model zzso zzso 8 mice per zzso All statistical tests were zzso 

Of the 254 tissue samples, zzso and zzso showed high and low zzso zzso zzso High zzso expression was statistically significantly associated with zzso cancer behavior compared with low zzso expression zzso stages III and IV vs stage I, P zzso zzso poor overall survival, P zzso zzso zzso zzso in breast cancer cell lines promoted cell proliferation through zzso cell cycle entry, invasion and migration, and zzso via enhanced DNA repair activity and also inhibited zzso zzso of zzso had the opposite zzso In zzso zzso mice zzso zzso 8 per group), increased tumor growth was observed in the zzso group compared with the control group zzso volume at week 8, control vs zzso tumor originating from zzso cells, mean zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso vs mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

High zzso expression was associated with a more zzso behavior in breast zzso zzso may be a novel zzso and may therefore serve as a new therapeutic intervention against breast zzso
