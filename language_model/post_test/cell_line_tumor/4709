A series of zzso compounds were identified as zzso of zzso signaling in a zzso zzso screen of a diverse library of small zzso These highly related compounds were subsequently found to inhibit zzso II in zzso at zzso similar to that required for the zzso of zzso signaling in zzso The most potent zzso discovered is approximately zzso more active than zzso zzso a zzso II inhibitor in clinical zzso The zzso also inhibit zzso I activity, with approximately zzso less zzso Moreover, the zzso in contrast to zzso induce a profound cell cycle arrest in the zzso phase of the cell cycle, do not induce zzso DNA breaks, are not zzso for zzso resistance zzso export from the cell, and are amenable to synthetic zzso In addition, the zzso zzso with zzso zzso in cell zzso zzso zzso done on a panel of human tumors maintained ex zzso in nude mice show that the most active compound identified in the screen is selective against tumors compared with normal zzso stem zzso However, this compound had only moderate activity in a mouse zzso zzso This novel class of zzso II inhibitor may provide additional zzso strategies for the development of zzso agents with proven clinical zzso
