A zzso B zzso 4 containing a highly zzso S atom has been zzso as a zzso zzso zzso for zzso Following zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso comparable zzso of zzso and zzso signals were observed upon addition of zzso this suggests that zzso 4 effectively avoided the zzso zzso caused by the zzso nature of zzso zzso 4 can selectively recognize zzso in zzso media in the presence of other trace metal zzso in organisms (such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso abundant cellular zzso (such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the prevalent toxic metal zzso in the environment (such as zzso and zzso with high sensitivity zzso limit zzso or zzso zzso and a rapid response time zzso or zzso zzso Moreover, by virtue of the zzso as fluorescent probe for zzso zzso and zzso zzso experiments revealed a significant increase of zzso zzso concentration and the zzso distribution of zzso which was zzso into the living zzso cells upon incubation in growth medium supplemented with 50 zzso zzso for 20 zzso
