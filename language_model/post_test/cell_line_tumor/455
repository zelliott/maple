zzso evidence has indicated that zzso plays an important role in zzso death in chronic liver zzso However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying liver zzso in these diseases are largely zzso zzso certain molecules expressed to counteract zzso might provide survival advantage of certain liver zzso zzso we investigated a possible expression of decoy zzso 3 of the zzso necrosis factor zzso family in chronic liver diseases since decoy zzso 3 is known to inhibit zzso zzso by zzso zzso necrosis factor family zzso including zzso zzso 

A series of liver zzso from patients with different stages of zzso were subjected to zzso and in zzso zzso 

Both decoy zzso 3 protein and zzso were mainly expressed in zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso in the diseased zzso Most zzso intense decoy zzso 3 expression was observed in newly developing zzso zzso in zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso of zzso zzso In addition, decoy zzso 3 zzso in zzso zzso cells in culture was via the zzso of zzso protein zzso 

zzso zzso 3 was specifically expressed in chronic liver diseases and zzso zzso cells, and decoy zzso 3 might facilitate the survival of liver cells by exerting its zzso activity during the progression of liver zzso and zzso
