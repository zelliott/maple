The correlation between cell sensitivity to zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and the zzso of molecules involved in the control and execution of zzso is well zzso However, tumor cells with comparable zzso zzso may display variable degrees of zzso addiction, due to the differential expression of molecular zzso which are still scarcely zzso In this study, we investigated the effects of zzso on growth, death, and zzso activity of zzso zzso cell lines cultured in standard versus nutritional stress conditions partially mimicking those found in the tumor zzso We report that, in each cell line, the toxic effects of zzso were amplified by nutritional stress and paralleled by zzso zzso Still, the cell lines displayed different levels of sensitivity to zzso zzso which did not correlate with their relative degrees of zzso and nutritional zzso zzso nor with the relative magnitude of the zzso zzso induced by the zzso Thus, we tested the hypothesis that the cell zzso sensitivity to zzso was related to their variable dependence on recycling of zzso constituents by zzso In fact, the cell line with the highest sensitivity to the toxic effects of zzso was zzso for zzso due to the deficient expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso in these cells reduced their sensitivity to zzso zzso Based on these results, the assessment of zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso may allow the identification of zzso of tumors with an increased sensitivity to the toxic effects of this zzso
