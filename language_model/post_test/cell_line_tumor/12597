zzso clear cell zzso zzso is an aggressive human cancer that is generally resistant to zzso To explore the genetic origin of zzso we determined the zzso sequences of eight tumors after zzso zzso of cancer zzso Through comparative analyses of normal cells from the same patients, we identified four genes that were zzso in at least two zzso zzso which encodes a zzso of zzso zzso and zzso which encodes a well-known zzso had previously been implicated in zzso The other two zzso genes were previously unknown to be involved in zzso zzso encodes a regulatory zzso of zzso zzso 2, and zzso encodes zzso zzso interactive zzso protein zzso which zzso in zzso zzso The nature and pattern of the zzso suggest that zzso functions as an zzso and zzso as a zzso zzso In a total of 42 zzso zzso had zzso in zzso and 57% had zzso in zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso contributes to the zzso of zzso
