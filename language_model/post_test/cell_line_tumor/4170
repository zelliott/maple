Although zzso of zzso cancer zzso express zzso zzso zzso only a minor proportion of patients respond to zzso treatment with zzso zzso tamoxifen zzso The mechanism underlying zzso resistance in the course of zzso progression is incompletely zzso However, zzso zzso plays a critical role in the development and progression of zzso Here we explore an association between zzso and zzso zzso We demonstrate that both zzso (a relatively short period of treatment with zzso zzso and zzso zzso (by zzso with zzso zzso for sense zzso induce zzso resistance in zzso zzso cells, while deleting of zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso cells (by zzso with zzso zzso for zzso zzso promotes the sensitivity of these cells to zzso Further investigation indicates that zzso resistance caused by zzso is associated with the zzso of zzso zzso and steroid hormone zzso zzso zzso expression levels, the protein interactions between zzso and zzso but not zzso as well as zzso of zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso These results show that zzso zzso by zzso cells may contribute to the zzso of these cells to zzso via zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso not only plays an important role in zzso progression but also contributes to zzso zzso Our studies suggest that zzso zzso therapy may lead to a more effective intervention than zzso zzso
