zzso checkpoints are activated to arrest cells and promote survival upon zzso zzso Efforts have been taken to target checkpoint zzso 1 zzso approved gene symbol zzso a crucial checkpoint zzso for therapeutic zzso However, improvement of the potency and specificity of such zzso remains a major zzso This prompted us to develop a novel zzso strategy by constructing a potent zzso zzso zzso zzso was generated by combining two artificial features into a zzso zzso type 5 zzso First, zzso was engineered with a zzso deletion in the zzso region to zzso zzso zzso Second, an zzso zzso zzso was zzso for viral zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this design, zzso exploited the zzso zzso promoters to express zzso zzso zzso in a viral zzso fashion and zzso silenced the zzso gene in tumor zzso By virtue of combining zzso with zzso zzso zzso exhibited potent zzso efficacy in zzso and in zzso zzso administration of zzso plus a low dose of zzso cured zzso of zzso zzso zzso mouse models that were otherwise resistant to zzso These findings have directed us toward the development of novel zzso zzso that will be potentially zzso to a wide range of zzso zzso
