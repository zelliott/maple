Flowers of zzso zzso were extracted under different experimental conditions, and their zzso activity was determined by zzso radical scavenging zzso zzso obtained with higher concentration of zzso zzso zzso or zzso were found to contain the greatest amount of total zzso zzso 250 zzso zzso acid zzso of dried zzso and high correlation between total zzso content and zzso activity was observed zzso zzso zzso Based on the total zzso content and zzso activity, some extracts were selected for investigation of zzso activity toward zzso zzso and zzso human cancer cell lines in zzso All tested extracts exhibited moderate activity against zzso cells zzso zzso whereas the extract obtained with zzso zzso zzso was the most active against zzso and zzso cell lines zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed significant correlation between total zzso content and zzso activity against zzso and zzso zzso zzso identification of zzso compounds from the extracts indicated the presence of zzso zzso and zzso as free zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Among zzso zzso displayed moderate zzso activity against all cell lines zzso zzso
