The zzso family contains a panel of proteins which are zzso regulators of zzso in zzso cells, like the zzso protein zzso According to its significant role in altering zzso to zzso the deciphering of the mechanism of zzso expression zzso may be crucial for identifying zzso strategies for zzso Treatment with zzso agents, including zzso and zzso zzso generally leads to a decrease in zzso zzso zzso Whereas the interest for these zzso is accompanied by advances in the fundamental understanding of their zzso properties, the molecular mechanism underlying changes in zzso expression remains poorly zzso We report here that zzso contributes to zzso zzso zzso Indeed, the decrease in zzso protein levels observed during zzso zzso was correlated to the decrease in zzso levels, as a result of the zzso of zzso zzso and promoter zzso In this context, we evaluated zzso contribution in the zzso zzso zzso We identified, by zzso zzso a novel zzso binding site in the zzso promoter, within a region upstream zzso zzso We showed that zzso treatment increased this interaction in zzso zzso This work strengthens the links between zzso and zzso at a zzso level, upon zzso agent zzso Our study also provides answers that will be useful to assess zzso agents' mechanism of action and that may help to better understand and increase their zzso
