zzso of zzso is one of the most frequent genetic zzso in many tumors, including zzso zzso cell zzso zzso In our recent study, deletion of zzso was frequently detected in zzso and one candidate tumor zzso gene zzso zzso factor zzso was identified within the zzso In this study, zzso of zzso was detected in zzso zzso of primary zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso cell zzso A further study found that zzso of zzso was also associated with zzso of the promoter region of zzso zzso zzso zzso found that promoter zzso was detected in zzso zzso of primary zzso and zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso In addition, the expression of zzso could be zzso in zzso cell line zzso after zzso treatment with zzso zzso studies showed that zzso was able to suppress zzso of zzso cells both in zzso and in zzso including zzso formation, colony formation in soft zzso and tumor formation in nude zzso zzso study found that the tumor zzso mechanism of zzso was associated with its role in cell cycle arrest at the zzso checkpoint by the zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso In conclusion, zzso might be the target zzso responsible for the zzso deletion event, which has an important role in the development and progression of zzso
