In human zzso zzso cells, the effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso and proliferation was zzso The proliferation was enhanced by zzso zzso zzso and was decreased by zzso zzso zzso The effect of zzso on the increases in zzso free zzso levels zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso and zzso (an inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso In cell zzso with 20 or 80 zzso zzso the zzso increases induced by all zzso were zzso In the presence of 20 zzso zzso the decreased zzso responses with the zzso were attributed to a defective zzso influx because this decrease was zzso in zzso zzso increases in the absence of zzso zzso In the presence of 80 zzso zzso both the zzso influx component and the zzso releasing (from zzso component were zzso These results suggest that zzso could alter proliferation and inhibit zzso zzso
