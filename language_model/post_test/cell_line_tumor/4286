In an effort to search for new cancer-fighting zzso we identified a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso from plant zzso zzso zzso zzso F suppressed cancer cell growth in a zzso and zzso manner in human cancer cell lines of various tissue zzso We found that zzso F induced zzso and zzso zzso arrest, which was associated with strong induction of zzso and zzso and reduction of zzso B1 and zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso of zzso via genetic knockout or short hairpin zzso zzso approaches significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso arrest and zzso and zzso B1 zzso These results suggest that zzso seems to play a crucial role in zzso zzso regulation of zzso and zzso B1 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induction was found to occur at the zzso level and involved zzso promoter zzso zzso F was also found to induce cell death in several cancer cell lines and to activate zzso In contrast with its strong growth zzso effects on tumor cells, zzso F had minimal zzso effects on zzso zzso cells zzso zzso our data also demonstrate that zzso F exhibited strong growth zzso of zzso tumors in nude zzso zzso F was well tolerated in treated animals without significant zzso Taken together, our results, for the first time, demonstrate that zzso F exhibits zzso activity in zzso and in zzso and has strong potential to be developed as an zzso zzso
