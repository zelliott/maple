A program currently ongoing in our laboratory envisions natural zzso zzso zzso targeting the molecular zzso zzso Such zzso can be potential zzso agents due to their ability to induce the breakdown of a variety of zzso zzso In this account, we first concern ourselves with a vastly important total synthesis of such an zzso We accomplished this via a new approach, which we term the zzso zzso directed to the synthesis of zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso The key features of the zzso involve zzso zzso zzso zzso to generate zzso followed by zzso reaction with zzso zzso zzso to elaborate the zzso zzso A number of interesting zzso were zzso using this zzso They were evaluated for their zzso activity against the growth of breast cancer cell line, zzso The potency of their zzso was found to be consistent with their ability to degrade the zzso zzso zzso From these zzso zzso was identified as a most promising candidate for further zzso
