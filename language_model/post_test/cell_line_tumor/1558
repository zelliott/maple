zzso is a common feature of solid tumors and an important contributor to tumor zzso zzso is the most consistently and robustly induced zzso under zzso in different types of tumor cells and normal zzso In the present study, to explore the feasibility of zzso as an effective therapeutic target, zzso zzso zzso gene transfer technique was employed to zzso zzso expression in hypoxic human zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells, and zzso changes of which were zzso zzso led to an increased zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression and cell arrest in the zzso phase in all cell zzso zzso zzso significantly suppressed cell zzso induced cell arrest in the zzso phase, increased zzso rate and enhanced zzso in hypoxic human zzso zzso Moreover, zzso factor, zzso 3 zzso was identified as a direct target gene of zzso zzso zzso by zzso attenuated radiation induced zzso in zzso zzso hypoxic human zzso zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso might be a potential therapeutic target and specific zzso of zzso expression in combination with zzso might be expected to exert strong zzso effect on hypoxic human zzso zzso
