zzso zzso are zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso in length that regulate gene expression through zzso repression by binding to a target zzso It is thought that the expression level of zzso which act like zzso is frequently reduced in zzso because of zzso deletion and zzso zzso Since the processing of zzso has been characterized to be zzso in nature, the expression levels of zzso are closely associated with the activity and levels of such zzso Here, we found that zzso 143 and 145 expression levels were extremely reduced in colon cancer cells and commonly in the other kinds of cancer cells zzso The zzso of each precursor zzso into the cells demonstrated a significant growth zzso in human colon cancer zzso and zzso cells, and zzso was determined to be the target gene of zzso zzso Since the presence of zzso zzso of the zzso was confirmed by zzso in the cell lines and the precursor zzso exhibited a growth zzso effect in zzso and zzso cells, the early processes such as zzso and zzso modification from primary zzso to precursor zzso seemed to be commonly zzso These findings indicate that the zzso 143 and 145 could become good tumor markers and provide an important clue in the study of the mechanism of zzso involving zzso
