Response to the zzso drug zzso may be variable in part due to genetic differences in the zzso and zzso responsible for its metabolism and zzso The aim of our zzso study was to identify gene zzso significantly associated with zzso response that may help to personalize treatment in the zzso 

We analyzed two independent data zzso zzso zzso data from zzso cell lines using the zzso zzso zzso platform combined with zzso zzso data in those cell lines, and zzso zzso association studies zzso data from zzso pancreatic cancer patients treated on an zzso phase III clinical zzso We also performed a subset analysis on the zzso data set for 135 patients who were given zzso zzso and systems biology analyses were performed on each individual data set to identify zzso significantly associated with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso in the ABC zzso zzso zzso and the zzso family members zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were found to be significant in both the zzso and zzso data zzso We report significant association between drug response and zzso within members of the zzso zzso family zzso whose role in zzso response is yet to be zzso 

zzso identified in this zzso analysis may contribute insights into zzso response zzso As zzso data become more readily available, similar studies can be conducted to gain insights into drug response mechanisms and to facilitate clinical trial design and regulatory zzso
