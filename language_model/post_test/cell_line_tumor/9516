In our previous study, two point zzso of zzso zzso designated zzso and zzso revealed peculiar characteristics in their zzso and zzso zzso In order to determine the putative therapeutic potential of these zzso several in zzso and in zzso evaluations were zzso In the zzso state, zzso showed more profound zzso activity against LDL zzso than did the zzso zzso or zzso zzso in an in zzso zzso In the zzso state, zzso showed an enhanced cholesterol delivery activity to zzso cells in a zzso manner, as compared to zzso zzso and zzso We assessed the zzso activities of the zzso in zzso using zzso mice zzso zzso zzso zzso preparations containing each of the zzso zzso were injected into the mice at a dosage of 30 zzso of zzso of body zzso Forty eight hours after injection, the zzso of the zzso injected group showed the most potent zzso abilities in the zzso acid removal zzso The zzso or zzso mice showed no zzso zzso and zzso striking increases in their serum zzso levels, as compared to the mice injected with zzso or zzso In conclusion, zzso exhibited the most pronounced zzso activity and zzso activity, both in zzso and in zzso These results support the notion that zzso may prove beneficial due to its capacity to induce accelerated cholesterol zzso as well as its enhanced zzso and zzso effects and zzso zzso zzso
