zzso exerts its zzso effects via induction of zzso zzso zzso Such zzso zzso are not always successfully repaired prior to DNA zzso which may result in a blocked replication zzso To alleviate this stall, cells zzso DNA damage tolerance systems involving either zzso damage avoidance or zzso zzso zzso Studies in zzso suggest the modification of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso chains as a key zzso of the zzso damage avoidance zzso Recently, we extended this observation to human cells, showing the occurrence of zzso of zzso in zzso human zzso In the present study, we hypothesized that zzso the formation of zzso chains zzso damage avoidance and favors zzso repair involving zzso zzso zzso zzso causing increased zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, we generated zzso cells expressing either a zzso zzso zzso which blocks further zzso through zzso or the wild type zzso zzso We show that zzso is zzso in these cells upon zzso and that disruption of zzso chain formation has no effect on zzso zzso In contrast, significantly higher zzso of zzso zzso zzso were observed in zzso expressing cells, of which the majority zzso was zzso zzso zzso treatment caused an enhanced recruitment of zzso to the replication machinery of the zzso expressing cells, where it zzso with zzso zzso of zzso expression by using zzso resulted in a 50% reduction of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso In conclusion, we demonstrated that formation of zzso chains protects zzso human cells against zzso zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso guards against chemical zzso by preventing zzso and thus contributing to zzso zzso
