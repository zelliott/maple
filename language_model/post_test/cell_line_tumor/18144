zzso is used in the treatment of zzso B cell zzso and other B cell zzso zzso Its clinical efficacy might be further improved by combinations with other drugs such as statins that inhibit cholesterol synthesis and show promising zzso zzso The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of statins on zzso killing of B cell zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was assessed by zzso and zzso blue zzso as well as zzso blue zzso and zzso cellular zzso zzso was assessed by a zzso release zzso zzso were found to significantly decrease zzso zzso and zzso of B cell zzso zzso zzso of B cell zzso cells with statins decreased zzso zzso in flow zzso studies but did not affect total cellular levels of zzso as measured with zzso and Western zzso Similar effects are exerted by other zzso agents zzso and zzso but not zzso III, indicating that the presence of plasma membrane cholesterol and not zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso zzso using double zzso with zzso zzso zzso directed against a zzso zzso and a linear zzso zzso revealed that zzso is present in the plasma membrane in comparable amounts in control and zzso zzso Atomic force zzso and limited zzso indicated that zzso through cholesterol zzso induce zzso changes in zzso that result in impaired binding of zzso zzso An in zzso reduction of cholesterol induced by short-term treatment of five patients with zzso with zzso resulted in reduced zzso binding to freshly isolated B zzso 

zzso were shown to interfere with both detection of zzso and zzso activity of zzso These studies have significant clinical zzso as impaired binding of zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso by statins could delay diagnosis, postpone effective treatment, or impair zzso activity of zzso
