zzso zzso which are derived from the zzso of circulating bone zzso zzso consist primarily of a polarized zzso zzso zzso population and are associated with poor prognosis in various zzso In the present study, we attempted to assess whether zzso derived from bone zzso stimulate the promotion and progression of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were injected either alone or coupled with zzso into the zzso fat pads of zzso female zzso zzso zzso were prepared by treating zzso isolated from female zzso mouse bone zzso with zzso zzso cell growth was determined using an in zzso imaging system and the expression of cell zzso zzso and zzso proteins in tumor zzso was zzso zzso To evaluate the effects of the zzso between zzso cells and zzso on the zzso and zzso expression of zzso and the migration of zzso zzso cells and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso real-time zzso and zzso migration zzso were zzso 

The zzso of zzso into the zzso fat pads of mice increased solid tumor growth and lung zzso of zzso cells as well as the zzso of zzso zzso into tumor zzso The proportions of zzso zzso cells and the expression of zzso zzso zzso vascular zzso cell growth factor A, zzso vascular zzso cell growth factor C, and zzso vessel zzso zzso were increased significantly in the tumor zzso of mice zzso with zzso cells and zzso The in zzso results revealed that the proliferation of zzso cells, the migration of zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso factor, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso zzso zzso zzso inflammatory zzso and zzso were increased when zzso cells were zzso with zzso as compared with when the zzso cells were cultured zzso 

The zzso between zzso cells and zzso increased the production of zzso which may have induced immune cell zzso into tumor zzso tumor cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso thereby increasing solid tumor growth and lung zzso
