zzso zzso zzso are crucial natural interactions that initiate a number of biological and pathological zzso We present here the simple construction of a unique class of zzso zzso based on a zzso zzso of zzso zzso to a zzso zzso for the detection of zzso zzso receptors expressed on a zzso cell zzso We show that an zzso interface confined with densely clustered zzso zzso is able to ingeniously recognize the zzso receptors on live zzso cells employing simple zzso zzso The only facility used is a personal laptop in connection with a cheap and portable zzso zzso
