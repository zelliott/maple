zzso targeting membrane proteins play an important role in various zzso diseases of the nervous zzso So far, zzso allowing proper analysis of such zzso are largely zzso A serum zzso to zzso 4 zzso is associated with zzso zzso zzso Although several zzso are able to detect this zzso they do not allow determination of the biological activity of zzso zzso 

To develop a zzso for zzso and characterization of human zzso zzso 

We developed a novel zzso for zzso and characterization of human zzso zzso based on high-level expression of native zzso zzso protein on the surface of human zzso zzso The test was validated in 2 independent zzso of patients with zzso spectrum zzso 

We detected zzso with a sensitivity of zzso and specificity of zzso in patients with zzso spectrum diseases, suggesting that our zzso is at least as sensitive and specific as the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso belonged predominantly to the zzso zzso and bound with high affinity to the zzso domain of zzso Our data suggest that the zzso exerts pathological properties because zzso zzso induced cell death of zzso cells by zzso cellular natural killer cell zzso effect and complement zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso strongly correlated with in zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso this zzso may help to unravel the biological function of zzso Our findings demonstrate the potential of zzso to characterize biologically relevant zzso in human zzso zzso
