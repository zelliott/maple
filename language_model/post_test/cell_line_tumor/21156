This review presents compelling evidence that human zzso is a zzso tumor composed from tumor cells and small portion of cancer stem cells -- zzso cells, which have a high zzso potential and a low proliferation zzso zzso cancer stem cells are zzso similar to the normal stem cells, they express zzso gene and other genes characteristic of neural stem cells and posses the zzso zzso Cancer stem cells derived from zzso are capable zzso original zzso tumors when zzso to nude zzso They are zzso and zzso and therefore responsible for tumor progression and recurrence after conventional zzso zzso Cancer stem cells contribute to zzso zzso by an increase of DNA repair capacity through preferential zzso of the DNA damage response zzso Potential therapies that zzso or target cancer stem cells are also zzso zzso stem cells and/or neural stem cells were shown to target brain tumors therefore these cells are considered as an effective delivery system to target and zzso therapeutic agents to brain zzso Stem zzso gene therapies for zzso were shown in experiments to be effective way to target brain zzso zzso of bone zzso protein zzso on zzso cancer stem cells are also zzso zzso reduces effectively proliferation of zzso positive cells in zzso and the tumor growth in zzso zzso may act as a key zzso regulator of cancer initiation and therefore may be used in combined stem zzso therapy as a zzso therapeutic zzso
