Previous studies have shown that zzso an zzso member of the zzso zzso family, may play an opposite role to zzso in regulating cell proliferation and zzso To explore the relationship between zzso and the zzso zzso of human cancer, we have determined the expression patterns of zzso in varying grade of human cancer zzso and tested the effects of zzso expression in several zzso zzso cancer cell zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso lung and breast zzso respectively, showed that zzso protein expression was significantly decreased in most cancer cases compared with that of adjacent normal zzso zzso zzso expression could markedly inhibit zzso migration and invasion and induce zzso of the cancer cells which have relatively low levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could strongly increase zzso expression in zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso indicated that zzso significantly enhanced the activities of zzso promoter compared with zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso data are presented showing that zzso may participate in human cancer progression and act as a candidate target of zzso and these findings also strongly suggest that zzso may be a new candidate tumor zzso and could serve as a potential target in the gene therapy of zzso
