Provide a safer way for treating various zzso with zzso zzso zzso To improve the safety of zzso treatment for colon cancer, zzso solution was embedded into zzso zzso zzso by bulk zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso nude mice were then treated with zzso zzso cell nuclear zzso and Terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to measure proliferation and zzso in the tumors, zzso zzso zzso SP was used to detect the expression levels of zzso In addition, the zzso density zzso of the tumors was zzso zzso zzso induced zzso by increasing the expression of zzso and by decreasing the levels of zzso and zzso in the colon cancer tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of tumor growth is seen with zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso has a similar zzso efficiency to using the zzso seeds for the treatment of colon tumors zzso zzso zzso The findings therefore provide a potentially safer method for treating various tumors with radioactive zzso
