zzso zzso is well zzso however, no single mechanism of action for this effect has yet been zzso As zzso cells are integral for both the intact and injured nervous system, we hypothesized that zzso zzso may partly be attributed to zzso of zzso cell zzso allowing them to protect zzso following zzso To assess the protective effects of zzso on zzso zzso rat zzso cells were treated for 24 h with 500 zzso zzso Cell viability was determined by zzso zzso zzso and zzso was confirmed by cell zzso and DNA zzso zzso with 10 zzso zzso zzso increased cell viability and attenuated zzso Treatment with the zzso zzso or zzso plus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly less effective, indicating that zzso was zzso zzso treatment zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso bovine serum zzso zzso was also zzso indicating zzso of zzso receptors on the cell zzso zzso free zzso was increased after zzso zzso This increase was attenuated in cells zzso with zzso zzso increased the activity of zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso and these zzso activities were significantly attenuated by zzso The mechanism by which zzso decreased zzso zzso was examined by zzso cell viability after using zzso that either blocked zzso zzso influx or prevented the release of zzso zzso zzso While several zzso increased cell viability in zzso cells, none were as protective as estrogen, and zzso zzso significantly increased cell zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso may be related to effects on zzso entry but that these effects are not limited to any one of these zzso entry points zzso
