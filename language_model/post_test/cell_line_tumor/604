To investigate the zzso effect of zzso expressing zzso containing human zzso zzso (1 - 3) zzso zzso combined with soluble tumor zzso zzso zzso inducing zzso zzso genes on human gastric cancer zzso in nude zzso 

zzso plasmids of zzso and zzso were constructed by zzso zzso Twenty nude zzso mice were zzso with human gastric cancer cells of the line zzso zzso into the zzso One week later after the appearance of implanted tumors the mice were randomly divided into 4 groups with zzso zzso zzso blank zzso and normal saline zzso injected into the tumors respectively once the other day for 7 zzso The size of tumor was zzso 7 days later the mice were killed with their tumors taken zzso zzso was used to detect the expression of zzso and zzso The zzso density zzso of tumor was observed and recorded by detecting the protein of zzso with zzso on the zzso 

The zzso of tumor in the zzso and zzso groups were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, significantly lower than those of the zzso and zzso groups zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, all P zzso zzso but there was no significant difference between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression and protein expression of zzso and zzso were positive in the zzso and zzso zzso The tumor volumes of tumors of the zzso and zzso groups were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, both significantly lower than those of the zzso and zzso groups zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, all P zzso zzso 

zzso zzso tumor zzso through zzso the growth of vascular zzso cells, and TRAIL zzso tumor cell zzso zzso zzso combined with TRAIL can inhibit tumor growth more zzso
