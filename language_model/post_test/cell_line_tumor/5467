The development of pulmonary zzso is the major cause of death in zzso and its molecular basis is poorly zzso In this study, we show that zzso zzso is highly expressed in human zzso cell lines and tumor zzso Furthermore, highly zzso zzso cells have increased levels of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression by zzso and disruption of zzso zzso function by zzso of zzso zzso zzso was sufficient to zzso this highly zzso zzso in the zzso model without significantly affecting primary tumor zzso These findings suggest a role for zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso in human zzso zzso In addition, we identified a previously zzso interaction between zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso protein that is implicated in the zzso behavior of zzso The zzso zzso interaction appears to be critical for maintenance of zzso zzso zzso These data begin to integrate zzso and zzso zzso expression into a model of action for the mechanism of zzso zzso
