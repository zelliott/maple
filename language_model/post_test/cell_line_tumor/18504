zzso zzso and zzso act zzso to increase zzso zzso growth, development, and zzso Based on their roles in the normal zzso these hormones have been studied to determine their interactions in the development and progression of breast zzso However, most studies have evaluated only zzso zzso and did not take into account the recent discovery that zzso is zzso by human zzso cells, permitting zzso zzso To examine the effects of this zzso zzso we engineered zzso cells to zzso zzso human zzso zzso Using this zzso zzso cell line, we studied effects on cell growth, zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels, and zzso target zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso increased zzso alpha levels as well as zzso responsiveness in these cells, suggesting that effects on breast cancer development and progression by zzso may be amplified by zzso of zzso alpha levels by zzso zzso The long zzso zzso was also zzso by zzso but not zzso zzso This model will allow investigation of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells and will enable further dissection of zzso effects on other hormone signaling pathways to determine the role of zzso in breast zzso
