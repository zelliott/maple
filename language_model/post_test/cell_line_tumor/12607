The liver is the most common organ for tumor zzso The development of new methods to zzso zzso zzso is of great importance in improving zzso The aim of this study was to observe the effects of zzso index ultrasound contrast on zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso models were established by injecting human colon zzso zzso cells into the zzso of zzso zzso The rats were divided into a control group, a zzso plus ultrasound group, a simple ultrasound group, and a simple zzso zzso The ultrasound contrast agent zzso (1 zzso was injected via the tail zzso and zzso index ultrasound contrast zzso zzso zzso mechanical index, zzso was performed on the zzso zzso for 2 zzso The animals were sacrificed after 10 days, and the sizes and number of zzso zzso were measured and zzso zzso pathology and zzso zzso were zzso 

The number and sizes of zzso zzso zzso decreased in rats in the zzso plus ultrasound group zzso zzso zzso There were no obvious differences among the control group, simple ultrasound group, and simple zzso group in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pathology showed that the number of tumor cells in the zzso decreased zzso and massive zzso zzso and zzso were observed in the tumor and zzso zzso of rats in the zzso plus ultrasound zzso zzso electron zzso showed that the zzso of tumor cells and zzso cells were clearly zzso and there were gaps among zzso cells and zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

This research shows that intermittent zzso index ultrasound contrast may inhibit the zzso zzso of cancer in a rat zzso
