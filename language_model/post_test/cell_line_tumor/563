The zzso zzso factor, a master regulator of zzso gene zzso promotes the zzso of several zzso However, little is known about its expression and function in gastric zzso In the present study we determined whether zzso is zzso in gastric cancer, and whether it is required to maintain an zzso zzso of gastric cancer zzso The zzso of zzso was observed in zzso zzso specimens from patients with gastric zzso When zzso in gastric cancer cells was zzso impaired zzso and cellular zzso occurred independently of zzso and zzso zzso zzso depletion led to the zzso of its target genes zzso and zzso coupled with the zzso of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso the zzso zzso cellular zzso and zzso zzso was attenuated by the abolition of zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso the key component of zzso essential for cellular zzso was also inhibited in the zzso zzso Taken together, the zzso gene is zzso activated in gastric cancer and its zzso triggers zzso and zzso zzso of cancer cells by regulating the expression of zzso and other zzso These findings provide zzso insights into the role of zzso in the zzso of gastric cancer, which may have diagnostic and therapeutic implications in gastric zzso
