The ability of cholesterol to zzso zzso increases in the zzso release of the organic zzso zzso has been zzso zzso of cholesterol from zzso zzso by zzso of the cells with 5 zzso zzso zzso for 10 zzso resulted in a 40 to 50% reduction in cholesterol and an enhancement of the ability of zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to stimulate zzso zzso when monitored under zzso zzso zzso zzso release of zzso was also enhanced by cholesterol zzso but less zzso Both zzso and zzso increases in zzso zzso were zzso via a zzso organic zzso and zzso channel in control and zzso zzso Studies with the zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicated that the zzso effect of CD zzso could be reversed by incubation of the cells with either zzso or zzso donor complexes and that cholesterol depletion increased zzso zzso but not zzso The ability of cholesterol depletion to promote the zzso zzso stimulation of zzso release was most pronounced under conditions of zzso or mild zzso In contrast to CD zzso zzso of the cells with cholesterol zzso a condition under which zzso zzso are also zzso had no effect on either zzso or zzso zzso zzso Taken together, the results suggest that cholesterol regulates zzso zzso release via its effects on the zzso properties of the plasma zzso rather than its presence in zzso zzso
