The therapeutic efficacy of zzso drugs like zzso can be significantly increased by their incorporation into zzso but an ability to actively target the zzso zzso to tumors could well provide an even greater zzso zzso In this work, a commercial preparation of zzso zzso zzso was modified by incorporation of the metal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to enable zzso of zzso targeting zzso Our results show that when zzso with zzso a zzso zzso containing a sequence zzso to bind zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be targeted to zzso cells in zzso leading to increased zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso is known to be expressed on zzso in the tumor zzso however, when zzso zzso zzso were administered to mice bearing subcutaneous zzso tumors, minimal zzso into tumors was zzso In contrast, an alternative targeting zzso zzso was found to actively direct zzso to tumors zzso zzso zzso when injected into zzso mice, zzso zzso significantly decreased the tumor growth rate compared with zzso These results indicate that the incorporation of zzso into zzso drugs could represent a simple modification to the drug to allow zzso of targeting molecules and to increase its zzso
