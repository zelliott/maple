We applied a zzso approach to investigate the role of zzso in cell zzso growth arrest in zzso zzso Our data revealed that zzso metabolism in zzso cells significantly differs depending on the zzso population zzso At high cell density, cells exhibited zzso zzso arrest and reduced zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso was significantly zzso In addition, our zzso experiments showed that zzso cells at high cell density zzso zzso very long chain zzso zzso and dramatically decreased synthesis of zzso zzso Moreover, densely populated zzso cells showed increased message levels of both anabolic and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso our zzso experiments indicated reduced zzso zzso activity at zzso which was confirmed by direct measurement of zzso zzso activity in zzso and in zzso zzso we could reduce zzso zzso activity in zzso cells by applying conditional media from zzso cells, as well as by adding reducing agents, such as zzso and zzso to the zzso In conclusion, our data suggest a role of the zzso pathway, zzso zzso in particular, in zzso growth arrest in zzso zzso
