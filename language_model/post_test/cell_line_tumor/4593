zzso of the zzso zzso reduces the zzso effect of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso Although this zzso effect is specific for zzso receptors in zzso and zzso it also affects zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso expressing the zzso zzso To test whether this difference could be due to the zzso of these cells, they were differentiated to a zzso zzso zzso with zzso The differentiated cells ceased to divide and grew long, thin zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso transient by zzso of zzso receptors was either unaffected zzso increased zzso reduced zzso or lost zzso Following a 20 zzso incubation with zzso the effect of zzso was reduced, as in zzso cells, but the effect of zzso was no longer zzso zzso differentiation did not modify the zzso of the zzso and zzso receptors to the zzso zzso We suggest that the specificity of the effect of zzso may not reside in the molecular mechanism of its zzso activity itself but in the organization of receptors within the zzso
