In this study, the light chain zzso and heavy chain zzso sequences of the zzso zzso against vascular zzso growth factor zzso were zzso into the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso expression zzso using the traditional and zzso zzso zzso To express the zzso the zzso plasmids were zzso into the Chinese zzso zzso zzso and the zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso was then zzso using the protein A affinity zzso Furthermore, in order to demonstrate the zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the bovine zzso zzso like cells were zzso The results showed specialization and conjunction of the zzso zzso to the zzso It was also indicated that the zzso expression in the zzso cell lines was higher than the zzso cell zzso Furthermore, the in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso which were produced from the zzso cell line, and the zzso cell line, were zzso This proved that the zzso cell line is a good substitute for the zzso cell line in the production of the zzso zzso
