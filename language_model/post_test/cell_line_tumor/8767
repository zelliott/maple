We report zzso the zzso property of a zzso zzso zzso complex for the detection of zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso was employed as the zzso recognition unit, while the zzso complex was used to monitor the formation of the zzso structure induced by zzso The sensitivity and fold enhancement of the zzso were higher than those of the previously reported zzso using the organic dye crystal violet as a fluorescent zzso This zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits high sensitivity and selectivity towards zzso with a limit of detection of zzso zzso
