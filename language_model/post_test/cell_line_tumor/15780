zzso is a zzso zzso or zzso gene with potential zzso zzso However, the mechanism underlying zzso zzso induction is not completely zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso zzso the expression of zzso which in turn directly binds to the promoter and increases the expression of zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso reveal that zzso zzso binds to one of the two putative binding sites on the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso by zzso markedly inhibited zzso but not zzso expression of zzso These data provide new insight into the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso
