zzso cartilage has been used for its beneficial effects on various zzso There are zzso that shark cartilage stimulates cellular and zzso immune responses, which makes it an zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso effect of shark cartilage derived proteins on the zzso activity of natural killer zzso cells from healthy human peripheral blood zzso cells was zzso 

The shark cartilage was extracted and its zzso proteins were zzso using zzso zzso zzso and sequential zzso on zzso zzso zzso The effect of each protein fraction on the zzso of zzso activity of zzso cells, as zzso against zzso as target cells, was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The most zzso effect on the zzso activity of zzso cells was observed for zzso zzso containing proteins with molecular weight of about zzso on the zzso zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso gel zzso 

Among the examined shark cartilage derived zzso the most zzso effects on the zzso cells zzso was found for zzso fraction with molecular weight of about zzso We zzso direct interactions of shark cartilage derived proteins with zzso cells surface receptors may lead to the enhancing in the zzso activity of zzso zzso 

Thus zzso zzso proteins of about zzso has a novel zzso effect on the zzso cells activity in zzso and if confirmed by in zzso trials, it may lead to its future clinical applications as, zzso of cancer, zzso and zzso of host immune system related zzso zzso
