zzso zzso is a physical phenomenon characterized by zzso and bubble formation in liquids under low local pressures, and their implosion following their release to a higher pressure zzso zzso of the bubbles releases high energy and may cause damage to exposed zzso We recently designed a zzso to exploit the destructive nature of zzso zzso for biomedical zzso We have previously shown that zzso zzso could kill leukemia cells and zzso kidney zzso In this study, we analyzed the effects of zzso on prostate cells and benign zzso zzso zzso zzso We showed that zzso zzso could kill prostate cells in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not lead to programmed cell death, zzso classical zzso or zzso zzso Following the application of zzso we observed no prominent DNA damage and cells did not arrest in the cell zzso zzso we concluded that zzso forces directly damaged the cells, leading to their zzso Upon application to zzso zzso from patients, zzso could lead to a significant level of tissue zzso Therefore similar to zzso zzso we propose that zzso zzso has the potential to be exploited and developed as an approach for the zzso of zzso pathological zzso including zzso
