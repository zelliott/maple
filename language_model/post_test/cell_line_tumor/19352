zzso (for brother of the regulator of imprinted zzso a zzso of the zzso factor, zzso is a novel member of the zzso zzso zzso The aims of the present study were as zzso zzso to investigate zzso expression in breast cells and zzso using zzso zzso western and real-time zzso analyses and zzso assess potential correlation between zzso levels in zzso with zzso zzso zzso was detected in all 18 inspected breast cell lines, but not in a primary normal breast cell zzso In zzso (41 of 58 zzso zzso was observed in breast zzso High levels of zzso correlated with high levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The link between zzso and zzso was further confirmed by the ability of zzso to activate the promoters of the zzso and zzso genes in the reporter zzso zzso of zzso in a high proportion of breast cancer patients implies potential practical applications of zzso as a molecular zzso of breast zzso This may be important for diagnosis of the condition and for the therapeutic use of zzso The ability of zzso to activate promoters of the zzso and zzso genes points towards possible involvement of zzso in the establishment, progression and maintenance of breast zzso
