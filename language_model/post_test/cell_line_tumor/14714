Breast cancer progression depends upon the zzso of a zzso sufficient for the zzso of the developing zzso Breast tumor cells frequently contain a zzso form of zzso zzso a protein which promotes their zzso The aim of this study was to determine whether combination therapy targeting zzso and zzso zzso (AP) on tumor blood vessels might be an effective therapeutic strategy for suppressing advanced breast zzso We examined the therapeutic effects, zzso or in zzso of zzso zzso and induction of massive zzso zzso which zzso zzso and zzso tumor cell zzso and zzso a zzso zzso that zzso tumor zzso by targeting zzso on the surface of tumor zzso cells and causes zzso destruction of tumor blood vessels, leading to zzso and tumor cell zzso zzso from two tumor cell lines containing zzso zzso and zzso were grown in nude mice to provide models of advanced breast zzso After treatment with zzso and/or zzso zzso tumors were analyzed for vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso blood vessel loss, and zzso zzso Individual drug treatment led to partial suppression of breast cancer zzso In contrast, combined treatment with zzso and zzso was extremely effective in suppressing tumor growth in both models and completely eradicated approximately zzso of tumors in the zzso zzso zzso no toxic effects were observed in any treatment zzso zzso studies determined that zzso zzso zzso and also exposed zzso on the surface of tumor cells as determined by enhanced zzso zzso Combination treatment led to significant induction of tumor cell zzso loss of zzso zzso as well as destruction of tumor blood zzso Furthermore, combination treatment severely disrupted tumor blood vessel zzso in both tumor zzso The observed in zzso zzso exposure of tumor zzso cell zzso might provide a target for zzso and contribute to the increased effectiveness of such combination therapy in zzso We conclude that the combined targeting of zzso and the tumor zzso is a novel effective strategy for combating advanced breast zzso
