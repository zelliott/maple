zzso compounds are excellent zzso drug candidates, but they have yet to find success in clinical zzso A major limitation in developing further compounds has been a general lack of understanding of the mechanism governing their zzso To determine factors necessary for zzso we tested the zzso of different zzso compounds in conjunction with zzso studies and mass zzso zzso zzso These studies demonstrated that the zzso compound of zzso acid zzso is zzso to zzso lung cancer cells, unlike those of zzso and zzso Although serum proteins are implicated in the activity of zzso compounds, we found that these interactions do not play a role in zzso zzso zzso compound characterization revealed zzso properties necessary for zzso These findings establish the importance of the zzso in the zzso of zzso compounds, provides insights for developing next-generation zzso zzso compounds, and reveal zzso as a unique candidate zzso zzso
