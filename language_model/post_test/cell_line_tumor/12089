To investigate the synergistic effects on cell zzso and growing restriction of zzso cells by the combination of compound herbal medicinal prescription zzso with zzso zzso 

zzso and two zzso for zzso zzso and zzso blood circulation zzso which was zzso serum, were prepared and used to treat the human zzso zzso cell line zzso By serum zzso method, the growth and zzso of zzso cell were observed at different time zzso 96 zzso with different zzso of zzso zzso zzso of drug interaction zzso between zzso and zzso was studied by zzso zzso The effects of control zzso zzso zzso zzso group zzso group), zzso zzso group), zzso + zzso zzso group), zzso + zzso zzso zzso cell were studied by flow zzso and the cell zzso was observed by zzso zzso the expressions of zzso zzso on each group were analyzed by Western zzso zzso 

zzso effects were found between herbal medicinal zzso and zzso zzso rate of zzso and zzso serum concentration was not in a zzso manner as zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso was found to be significant difference zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso It showed that the combined treatment was able to get better effect than single drug zzso The performed zzso zzso revealed the extracted DNA to show a typical zzso patterns for cell zzso The analysis results of western zzso showed the increased expressions of zzso and zzso after combined using of medicine, which were zzso to the rates of zzso 

zzso drug zzso show the synergistic effects with zzso and the suppressing functions in the course of cell zzso and the inducing effect on zzso of human zzso zzso cell line zzso in zzso And this mechanism is showed to be sponsored by the zzso of zzso and zzso
