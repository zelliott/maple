zzso transfer protein zzso plays an important role in regulation of zzso Previously published studies have shown that zzso zzso transfers and zzso bacterial zzso In the current study we tested the hypothesis that zzso can also regulate zzso pathways in zzso zzso of zzso differentiated zzso cells and human zzso zzso with zzso zzso in the presence or absence of tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso or zzso gamma zzso significantly increased nuclear levels of active signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3, zzso ( zzso Similar results were obtained in the presence of a zzso zzso without zzso transfer activity zzso suggesting that zzso zzso transfer is not required for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso by chemical zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso reversed the observed zzso zzso of zzso In addition, zzso reduced nuclear levels of active nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso in zzso media of differentiated zzso cells and human zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso has zzso capabilities in zzso
