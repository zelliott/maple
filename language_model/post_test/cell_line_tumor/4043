This study was performed to investigate the role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cancer zzso progression and zzso zzso samples from patients with zzso were used to examine the correlation between zzso expression and clinical stage of zzso The role of zzso in zzso progression and zzso was evaluated in zzso by zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cell zzso To zzso the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso tumor progression and zzso the expression and activities of some signaling molecules associated with zzso were zzso We found zzso of zzso in advanced stages of zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells resulted in the reduction in cell growth, migration, and invasion in zzso which may be caused by zzso interaction with zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could significantly decrease the sensitivities of zzso cells to zzso which might be ascribed to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso Taken together, the results suggest that zzso contributes to both zzso and zzso resistance in zzso Thus, zzso is a potential therapeutic target for zzso
