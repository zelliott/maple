We have characterized the kinetic response of gene targets throughout the zzso zzso to zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso In contrast to a model in which multiple genes are either zzso or activated during the zzso response, the vast majority of responsive genes are subject to complex regulation profiles, frequently with alternate zzso and repression zzso We also observe that zzso binding at response elements does not always correlate with the target gene response zzso Thus, the cellular response to zzso stimulation involves a highly orchestrated series of regulatory actions and not simply a zzso response to zzso
