The standard zzso is a laboratory instrument widely used by biologists and medical technicians for preparing cell zzso Efforts to automate the operations of zzso cell zzso and solution exchange that a zzso performs in a simpler and smaller platform have had limited zzso Here, we present a zzso chip that replicates the functions of a zzso without moving parts or external zzso The device operates using a purely fluid dynamic phenomenon in which cells selectively enter and are maintained in zzso zzso Continuous and sequential operation allows enrichment of cancer cells from spiked blood samples at the zzso zzso scale, followed by fluorescent labeling of zzso and zzso zzso on the cells without the need for manual zzso and washing zzso A versatile zzso may open opportunities in zzso low-cost and zzso sample preparation as an alternative to the standard zzso zzso in standardized clinical zzso or resource poor zzso
