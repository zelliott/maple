zzso after initial diagnosis of lung cancer is higher than from any other zzso Although zzso in several zzso such as zzso and zzso have been associated with clinical outcome, technical complexity, cost and time have rendered routine screening prohibitive for most lung cancer patients prior to zzso In this study, using both novel and established technologies, we developed a clinically practical zzso to survey the status of three frequently zzso genes in lung cancer zzso zzso and zzso and two genes zzso and zzso with known hotspot zzso in many other zzso A single zzso plate was designed targeting a total of 14 fragments (16 zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In 96 lung zzso patients, the zzso zzso of three major genes zzso zzso and zzso were between zzso zzso out of 96 zzso patients had a zzso in at least one of the five zzso zzso zzso positively correlated with smoking zzso zzso zzso zzso were frequent in zzso zzso Asians zzso and zzso I lung cancer zzso There was also a trend towards an association between the presence of any zzso and improved recurrence-free survival zzso We demonstrate that our novel zzso zzso zzso technology can rapidly and zzso screen for zzso in lung zzso This screening zzso can be used in the clinical setting for the large-scale validation of prognosis and/or predicting therapeutic response so that the majority of lung cancer patients can benefit from leveraging up-to-date knowledge on how zzso profiles may influence treatment zzso
