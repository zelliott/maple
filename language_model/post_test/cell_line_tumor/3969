zzso virus zzso nuclear zzso 1 zzso is essential for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These effects are zzso by zzso binding to zzso zzso DNA, which comprise 20 imperfect copies of a zzso zzso symmetry zzso and an origin for DNA zzso To identify cell proteins essential for these zzso functions, zzso associated cell proteins were immune zzso and analyzed by liquid zzso mass zzso zzso zzso was identified to be zzso zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso and zzso zzso zzso were critical for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso depletion substantially reduced zzso recruitment to zzso DNA, zzso zzso of an zzso zzso zzso reporter, and zzso zzso maintenance in zzso cell zzso zzso zzso domain zzso was critical for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso binding to zzso and transcription, whereas zzso zzso was zzso Moreover, zzso zzso impaired zzso cell line zzso These experiments reveal a surprisingly critical role for zzso zzso in zzso zzso maintenance and transcription, which may be a target for therapeutic zzso
