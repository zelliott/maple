zzso show an increased zzso zzso that is zzso by zzso transport zzso We have analyzed the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in short-term cultures of zzso cell zzso of the head and neck zzso by zzso Distribution of the zzso protein in zzso zzso was investigated by zzso While we observed in zzso zzso short-term cultures the zzso zzso we found no zzso zzso zzso zzso expression occurred zzso in cultures originating from moderately and well differentiated zzso In tumor zzso a zzso zzso zzso restricted to differentiated tumor cells was seen in zzso zzso zzso In normal zzso zzso zzso was also confined to differentiated compartments and lacked in zzso zzso Our data indicate a zzso expression of zzso in zzso This is important knowledge for the planning of zzso therapies and suggest zzso as a differentiation marker in head and neck zzso
