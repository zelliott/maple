Gap junctions zzso mediate zzso communication between adjacent zzso Previously, we showed that zzso 43 zzso the main zzso protein in the immune system, mediates zzso transfer between human zzso cells zzso and is recruited to the zzso zzso during T cell zzso This zzso contributed to T cell zzso zzso zzso responses, and zzso zzso However, the role of zzso in zzso cell zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso against tumor cells remains zzso In this study, we found polarization of zzso at the zzso and zzso zzso sites, accompanied by the formation of functional zzso between zzso and zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso communication zzso between human zzso and zzso was zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso cell zzso though it affected neither the zzso nor the function of zzso zzso zzso or zzso using zzso peptides greatly reduced zzso and zzso expression and zzso release by zzso zzso zzso Moreover, blocking zzso strongly inhibited the zzso zzso tumor cell zzso associated with zzso of zzso B activity and zzso zzso Our data identify a novel and active role for zzso in human zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso functions that may be important for the design of new immune therapeutic zzso
