zzso zzso viruses present a novel approach for treating zzso zzso These zzso are designed to induce zzso zzso of tumor cells after selective viral propagation within the zzso zzso zzso is considered to be a critical step in zzso and its activity is closely correlated with human zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso We investigated the zzso effect of the zzso zzso zzso on human cancer zzso 

We constructed an zzso 5 zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso promoter element drives expression of zzso and zzso genes linked with an internal zzso entry site, and we examined the selective replication and zzso effect in human cancer cells in zzso and in zzso 

zzso induced selective zzso and zzso expression in human cancer cells, but not in normal cells such as human zzso zzso zzso efficiently and induced marked cell killing in a panel of human cancer cell lines, whereas replication as well as zzso was highly attenuated in normal human zzso lacking zzso zzso In zzso mice carrying zzso human lung tumor zzso zzso injection of zzso resulted in a significant zzso of tumor zzso No evidence of zzso was identified in zzso outside of the tumors, despite the presence of zzso in the zzso Moreover, zzso replication in the distant, zzso tumors was zzso 

Our results suggest that the zzso promoter zzso competence for selective replication of zzso in human cancer cells, an outcome that has important implications for the treatment of human zzso
