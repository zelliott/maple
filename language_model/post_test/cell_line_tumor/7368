zzso proteins play a central role in the interaction of the cell with its environment and in the function of zzso zzso The current study focused on developing a better understanding of the membrane zzso of two zzso breast cancer cell zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso followed by a combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso to obtain zzso peptides from membrane zzso The complex zzso zzso obtained were separated by zzso liquid zzso coupled online with a zzso zzso zzso trap mass zzso zzso zzso The strong zzso exchange column used in the first dimension of the separation was zzso in an automated fashion using a series of salt steps of increasing zzso zzso zzso from each of the salt steps were separated using a zzso zzso zzso column, the output of which was directed through a zzso fused zzso tip into the mass zzso zzso were fragmented by zzso zzso zzso and analyzed by zzso zzso followed by database searching using the zzso zzso Analysis of the data revealed both similarities and expected differences between proteins identified from these cell zzso As demonstrated by others, zzso and the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells is up regulated compared to its level in zzso while the expression of the zzso zzso alpha is known to be up regulated in zzso zzso As expected, our studies showed identification of peptides from zzso in zzso while zzso zzso peptides were detected in the zzso zzso A total of zzso proteins were identified from zzso zzso while 313 proteins were found from zzso The results are discussed in terms of the known differences in both protein and zzso expression between these two breast cancer cell lines and also in the context of other known zzso differences between these zzso
