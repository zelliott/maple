zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso are just beginning to be zzso We have earlier reported its cancer zzso induction of zzso in breast cancer cells, which was zzso through the zzso of zzso signaling zzso To gain further zzso insight, here, we show for the first time that zzso effectively reverses zzso transition zzso that is, it zzso zzso transition zzso in aggressive zzso zzso and zzso breast cancer zzso This was associated with zzso of zzso marker zzso and zzso of zzso markers zzso zzso and zzso We also found that zzso zzso the expression of zzso and zzso family zzso zzso which provides a molecular mechanism for the observed reversal of zzso to zzso zzso of cells with zzso zzso zzso attenuated the effect of zzso on zzso induction through reversal of zzso to zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso could also reverse the zzso effect of zzso on breast cancer cell zzso Moreover, treatment with zzso resulted in increased zzso of zzso zzso with its reduced nuclear zzso The results were also validated in zzso in a zzso mouse model where zzso was found to inhibit zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso These novel findings suggest that the zzso activity of zzso against aggressive breast cancer cells is, in part, due to reversal of zzso zzso which is mechanistically linked with the deregulation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso
