In this paper we investigated whether protein zzso C zzso zzso and zzso members of the classical and novel zzso family, respectively, induce zzso zzso that could be associated with tumor progression and zzso dissemination in a zzso model of breast zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells altered their ability to zzso zzso and survive, and impaired their zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso induced the zzso of zzso an zzso zzso zzso which loss has been associated with the acquisition of a transformed zzso in different cell models, and exerted an important zzso on zzso production, effects that probably impact on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso survival, zzso growth, and caused a significant increase in spontaneous lung zzso Our results suggest zzso functions as an zzso protein for tumor growth and zzso dissemination whereas zzso drives zzso dissemination without affecting primary tumor zzso
