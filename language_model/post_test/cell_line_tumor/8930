The zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso in many zzso tumors, is emerging as an attractive target for cancer zzso zzso to the zzso region of zzso play a key role in the development of a zzso understanding and cancer zzso In the present study, we demonstrated for the first time that zzso zzso domain zzso which was expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso cells in the form of inclusion bodies, could be zzso and zzso The zzso protein was zzso by gel zzso and zzso affinity zzso with high purity zzso and zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso which could bind its zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso zzso was used for zzso zzso zzso from a human synthetic zzso zzso display zzso Combined with an additional zzso zzso screen, a novel zzso zzso was obtained with zzso more potent on the binding to zzso tumor cells (the zzso zzso cell line zzso and the zzso of zzso cells proliferation than zzso zzso suggesting that the E10 has the potential to be developed as therapeutic agents to solid tumors associated with zzso zzso
