Previous studies have demonstrated the feasibility of zzso protein zzso imaging to zzso and zzso human breast zzso zzso cells in zzso using a zzso zzso zzso probe zzso This study aimed to extend the use of the zzso probe to a more biologically relevant and clinically important tumor zzso as well as to assess our ability to zzso detect the presence and progression of breast cancer cells in the zzso The in zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and free zzso zzso dye were zzso evaluated in zzso zzso mice and zzso control mice zzso once a week from two to five weeks zzso The in zzso zzso zzso illustrate distinct clearance profiles for zzso and free zzso zzso resulting in preferential zzso of the zzso probe in the zzso tumor bearing zzso zzso with significant tumor contrast over normal muscle tissue zzso zzso zzso at five zzso p zzso zzso at four zzso In addition, the zzso zzso demonstrated significant contrast over the zzso of mice injected with free zzso dye zzso zzso zzso at four and five weeks) as well as over the zzso zzso zzso zzso of control mice zzso zzso zzso at four and five zzso Overall, zzso molecular imaging appears useful for visualizing and zzso breast cancer zzso zzso in the zzso brain and may assist in zzso zzso diagnosis and monitoring of zzso disease as well as drug zzso Furthermore, these results indicate it should be possible to perform zzso of breast cancer cells in the brain using zzso zzso agents, particularly in light of the fact that zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso have been successfully used to image zzso in the zzso
