To investigate the effect of zzso on multiple myeloma cell line zzso zzso and its zzso cell viability was estimated by zzso blue dye zzso zzso zzso zzso potential zzso zzso zzso and zzso oxygen species zzso labeled by zzso were examined by flow zzso the expression of zzso zzso was detected by zzso zzso The results showed that the zzso inhibited the growth of zzso cells and reduced cell viability accompanied by appearance of zzso characteristics of zzso zzso at 50 zzso increased zzso V zzso and zzso intensity of zzso because of zzso generation while it decreased the delta zzso m of zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene zzso zzso also zzso It is concluded that zzso inhibited the growth and reduce cell viability of zzso zzso zzso can induce zzso cells zzso by intrinsic cell zzso zzso
