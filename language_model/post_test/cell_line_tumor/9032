We have previously reported zzso expression in human breast cancer cells and demonstrated that the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso However, zzso expression and its possible molecular targets in human breast tumor samples and potential clinical implications have not been fully zzso Here, we demonstrate zzso expression in human breast tumor samples, and several established breast cancer cell lines, in which zzso treatment selectively zzso cell zzso The zzso of zzso in zzso cells abolished zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso may be the main site of zzso zzso zzso therefore, undertook a zzso approach to identify key zzso targets of zzso in zzso zzso We identified 54 zzso and 13 zzso proteins that were zzso expressed in control and zzso treated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified as one of the most promising targets of zzso Both zzso II zzso zzso and zzso expressions were higher in human breast tumor zzso compared to the matched normal and there was a strong correlation between zzso II and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso had significant zzso of zzso II expression that preceded the induction of zzso zzso Small zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso II in zzso and zzso cells led to significant zzso of both the zzso gene and protein zzso As zzso is a key player in folate zzso our data provides a novel link between zzso and folate metabolism in human breast cancer, both of which are critical for tumor cell zzso
