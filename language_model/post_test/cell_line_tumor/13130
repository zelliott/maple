The zzso cascade of cancer involves a process of parallel zzso A biological interface zzso in which cells is linked with zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso has been proposed as a tool for tracing cancer zzso zzso 

A mathematical model was established to simulate cancer cell zzso Human zzso zzso zzso in zzso cell migration zzso quantitative real-time zzso western zzso dynamic zzso and an in zzso zzso mouse model were used to verify the zzso findings of our zzso 

The return to origin probability zzso and its related zzso expression ratio in tumors, so-called zzso zzso gradually decreased with increased tumor size, and approached the zzso zzso random walk constant zzso in a periodic zzso The zzso pattern of cancer cell migration revealed that cancer cells initially grew together and subsequently began zzso A higher zzso of zzso applied to the cancer surface was associated with a significantly greater zzso effect on cancer migration, in accordance with the zzso zzso 

The zzso probability and zzso interface zzso in the zzso framework helped us decipher cancer zzso zzso in addition we modeled the methods of cancer control by manipulating the zzso plasticity or zzso the zzso expression to the zzso random walk, zzso zzso
