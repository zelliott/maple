To detect the zzso level of a novel gene zzso associated with the zzso of zzso mole in human cell lines and screen the cell lines with low zzso expression to construct a stable zzso expression system for zzso zzso 

The expression level of zzso zzso was detected with fluorescent quantitative zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso PC and zzso cell zzso zzso cell line was zzso with zzso zzso via zzso to allow stable zzso zzso and the positive cell clones were selected by zzso The zzso and expression of zzso gene in the zzso cells was analyzed using fluorescent quantitative zzso 

zzso zzso was expressed zzso in these cells lines, and the zzso cells, PC and zzso cells showed the highest zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso and zzso cells and further by zzso cells, and zzso and zzso cells had the lowest zzso After zzso zzso cells showed zzso integration of zzso gene and high expression level of zzso zzso 

The pulmonary zzso cell line zzso with stable expression of zzso gene has been established, which may facilitate further study of the biological functions of zzso zzso
