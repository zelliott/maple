The search for newer compounds against zzso species continues unabated due to drug zzso Traditionally, zzso zzso zzso zzso has been used for the treatment of various zzso and microbial zzso 

To evaluate the zzso activity of the ethanol extract of zzso zzso roots and its zzso against prostate and zzso cancer cell lines followed by zzso zzso 

The zzso screening was carried out using zzso zzso radical scavenging zzso with serial zzso ranging from 2 to 100 zzso and zzso was evaluated against prostate zzso and zzso cell lines using zzso zzso test zzso zzso with zzso ranging from 500 to zzso zzso Isolation of the ethanol extract was carried out using column zzso zzso 21 zzso were obtained zzso and the most active isolate was subjected for characterization using ultraviolet zzso infrared zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso and mass zzso zzso 

The ethanol extract scavenged zzso free zzso thereby exhibiting zzso activity with an zzso of zzso zzso In addition, the extract zzso noticeable zzso against the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso cell lines zzso of zzso zzso Among all the zzso zzso showed zzso activity with zzso of zzso zzso and zzso with zzso of zzso zzso against zzso and zzso zzso against zzso cell lines and was characterized as zzso zzso 

The new zzso compound zzso exhibited profound zzso activity and zzso at relatively lower zzso than the zzso 

The observations provide support for the zzso use of the zzso
