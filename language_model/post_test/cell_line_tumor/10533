The type III zzso zzso zzso or zzso is a zzso zzso zzso with emerging roles in regulating zzso zzso signaling and cancer zzso zzso in zzso zzso signaling are common in colon zzso however, the role of zzso has not been zzso Although zzso expression is frequently lost at the message and protein level in human zzso and suppresses cancer progression in these zzso here we demonstrate that, in colon cancer, zzso zzso zzso expression is not significantly altered and zzso expression is more frequently increased at the protein level, suggesting a distinct role for zzso in colon zzso zzso zzso expression in colon cancer model systems enhanced zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso while switching zzso and zzso from zzso to zzso of colon cancer cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, increasing zzso expression increased zzso zzso growth, a resistance to zzso and zzso zzso cell migration and modestly increased zzso in zzso In a zzso manner, zzso zzso zzso expression decreased colon cancer cell zzso These data support a model zzso zzso mediates zzso zzso zzso colon cancer progression and support a zzso role for zzso in regulating cancer zzso
