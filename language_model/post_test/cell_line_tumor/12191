The zzso zzso genes were originally identified as factors inducing head formation in zzso The genes code for zzso that are involved in zzso zzso We speculate that loss of zzso expression plays a role in development or progression of zzso zzso Thus, we evaluated melanoma cell lines and tissue samples of zzso melanoma for loss of zzso especially zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso and zzso were zzso or lost in all cell lines and in most of the tumor samples zzso zzso zzso expression occurred as early as in primary tumors detected by both zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso zzso with stable zzso zzso cell lines revealed that zzso expression increased zzso zzso and decreased cell zzso Further, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso was found in the zzso expressing cell clones supporting a role of zzso in tumor zzso Our studies thus indicate that loss of zzso expression may contribute to melanoma zzso
