zzso changes such as DNA zzso play a key role in the development and progression of multiple zzso Our aim in the present study was to use zzso screening to identify genes targeted for zzso zzso in multiple myeloma and assess their role in the development of resistance to zzso 

Gene expression was examined using zzso zzso reverse zzso and real-time quantitative zzso DNA zzso was examined using zzso zzso zzso sequencing, and zzso zzso in 14 multiple myeloma cell lines, 87 multiple myeloma zzso and 12 control bone zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to assess cell viability after treatment with zzso and/or zzso 

zzso analysis was done to screen for genes zzso by zzso In zzso cells, 128 genes were zzso whereas 83 genes were zzso in zzso zzso zzso of 22 genes with zzso islands in their zzso regions, including zzso was zzso zzso of zzso was associated with its zzso which correlated with resistance to zzso Treating multiple myeloma cells with zzso restored sensitivity to zzso zzso of zzso was also detected in a subset of primary multiple myeloma zzso and the levels of zzso were increased after repeated zzso zzso Gene signature analysis revealed various genes to be zzso induced by treatment with a combination of zzso plus zzso 

Our findings indicate that zzso zzso of zzso including zzso plays a key role in the development of zzso resistance in multiple zzso Moreover, they show the utility of zzso therapy in cases of advanced multiple zzso
