A controversy has arisen over the past several years about the true origin of the human zzso cell zzso Originally described as a human breast cancer cell line, subsequent expression array studies instead suggested a gene expression profile consistent with a melanoma zzso zzso zzso and comparative zzso zzso studies supported the idea that current stocks of both zzso cells and zzso melanoma cells must be identical cell lines, and the conclusion was drawn that both cell lines were in fact zzso melanoma zzso However, an alternate conclusion based on these data is that both cell lines are indeed zzso but are in fact zzso breast cancer zzso There is evidence that many cell lines can display zzso zzso and that assignment to tissue type is zzso made based on expression zzso Evidence from the literature is presented here that is inconsistent with both lines being of zzso melanoma origin, but rather is consistent with both cell lines being of zzso breast cancer zzso
