zzso assembly of zzso zzso zzso zzso is selectively regulated by the small zzso zzso zzso which causes enhanced cell migration and zzso in certain zzso Our zzso structure shows that an zzso zzso binds to a single zzso heavy chain in an zzso zzso zzso in the complex forms a continuous zzso that stretches across the surface of zzso and engages the zzso binding sites of each zzso in the zzso zzso between these sites leads to a very tight association zzso zzso zzso that is unique in the zzso zzso zzso zzso that remove this zzso weaken binding and zzso the effects of zzso on zzso filament assembly and cell spreading in zzso human zzso zzso zzso We propose a model for zzso filament zzso by zzso in which initial binding to the zzso zzso tail zzso unzipping of the coiled zzso and disruption of filament zzso
