zzso was found to improve pancreatic organ function in diseased zzso To study whether pancreatic zzso zzso is zzso by zzso investigations were done in two human zzso pancreatic zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso we monitored zzso effects on zzso zzso pH zzso and on zzso recovery after zzso zzso produced by the removal of zzso zzso zzso Exposure to 1 zzso zzso for 24 zzso and presence of the zzso during the experiment increases the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso recovery and zzso zzso zzso are facilitated after the alkaline zzso These findings are in line with the observed increase in zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso for the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso for the zzso of zzso zzso The reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso would favor zzso recovery after zzso but it does not explain the initial increase in zzso This controversial effect and the requirement for continuous presence of zzso throughout the experiment suggest that zzso zzso may contribute to the effects of zzso on zzso zzso In zzso we show a zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso in the pancreatic cancer cell lines which may help to prevent zzso zzso
