zzso zzso 1 zzso plays an important role in zzso of various zzso including zzso zzso zzso In this study, we used both zzso and zzso to examine the effect of zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso Furthermore, we analyzed both the expression of zzso and its zzso a previously identified target for zzso and also examined its potential association with zzso When using zzso zzso and zzso we found that zzso cells has zzso levels diminished together with the levels of zzso but zzso remains unchanged in cells with zzso zzso This is accompanied by dramatic changes in cell zzso and significant zzso in their zzso We next uncovered that the expression of zzso increased in response to zzso zzso and also to zzso zzso similarly to zzso This was associated with an avid pairing between zzso zzso and zzso zzso we found that zzso paired with zzso binds to an zzso site in the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso did not affect zzso and the changes in cell zzso did not fully replicate that seen with zzso zzso Thus, zzso takes part in a control of architecture and migratory nature of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso is a zzso factor that zzso zzso with which it makes effectively zzso pairs in zzso zzso
