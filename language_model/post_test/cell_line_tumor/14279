Gene regulated in breast cancer 1 zzso is a novel zzso gene shown to play a pivotal role in zzso breast cancer zzso zzso is expressed in the prostate and its putative promoter contains potential zzso zzso zzso response zzso 

We investigated the effects of zzso on zzso expression and its role in zzso prostate cancer zzso 

zzso zzso demonstrated high level zzso expression in benign zzso zzso zzso localized prostate cancer zzso and hormone zzso prostate cancer zzso zzso treatment of zzso prostate cancer cells induced zzso zzso zzso which was blocked by zzso zzso binding to the zzso promoter was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso interference blocked zzso zzso cell zzso 

zzso is expressed in zzso zzso tissue and prostate cancer, is regulated by zzso and suppression of zzso blocks zzso growth suggesting zzso may be critically involved in prostate cancer zzso
