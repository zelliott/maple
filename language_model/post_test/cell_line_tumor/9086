To study the zzso zzso of human zzso zzso by zzso virus 40 large T zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The reconstructed zzso zzso was zzso into primary cultured human zzso with zzso zzso zzso and the positive cells were selected using zzso After expanding culture of these positive cell zzso the expression of zzso was detected by zzso chain reaction zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso zzso After that, these positive cells were infected by virus zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was induced to act by zzso On the 6th and 10th day after zzso zzso acting, the expression of zzso was detected using the same methods as above, and cell zzso was studied using soft zzso zzso zzso mouse study and zzso zzso On 10th day after tamoxifen treatment, cell biological characters were identified with zzso zzso and transmission electron zzso Then these cells were transplanted into zzso animal model to observe their zzso ability in zzso 

The zzso DNA and total zzso were isolated from the positive cells zzso by zzso zzso as zzso and specific 288 zzso zzso was zzso using zzso and zzso zzso The results of zzso confirmed the expression of zzso in cell zzso On the 6th day after tamoxifen treatment in infected cells by zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso there could be detected zzso zzso but on 10th day, there could not be detected zzso expression in zzso These results showed that the excised efficiency of zzso zzso increased along with time zzso and would obtain complete zzso zzso The identification of zzso cell biological characters showed that these cells had normal zzso cell zzso and no zzso in zzso The pigmentation started in 4 weeks and formed black zzso in 3 months after zzso The pathological results showed that there had been significant zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and some hair zzso in transplanted area, which confirmed that zzso had zzso function in zzso 

Human zzso could be zzso by zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso system, which had stable zzso zzso characters and no zzso in zzso moreover, these cells still had zzso function in zzso
