The zzso zzso zzso protects against debilitating effects of the inflammatory response by zzso the zzso zzso factor nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso response zzso protein zzso protein zzso has been suggested to mediate zzso cross talk by functioning either as a scaffold that links zzso and zzso or as a required zzso that competitively binds to one or the other zzso zzso However, here we demonstrate that zzso is recruited to the zzso response element of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso promoters and zzso zzso but not zzso in the zzso breast cancer cell zzso In contrast, zzso displaced zzso and associated zzso from the zzso promoter, demonstrating a zzso role for zzso in zzso inflammatory and steroid zzso Further, zzso interference and zzso studies demonstrated that zzso dosage regulates zzso suppression of zzso and zzso but not zzso gene zzso This work further demonstrates that zzso dosage is a critical regulator of zzso signal integration between the zzso and zzso zzso
