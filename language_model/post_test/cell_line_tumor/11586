zzso zzso is a new zzso of zzso compound that was isolated from the Chinese herb zzso zzso and has been used for treatment of zzso zzso for zzso In our current studies, we have explored the potential zzso effect and molecular mechanisms underlying zzso zzso effects on zzso growth of human zzso cancer cell zzso We found that zzso showed a significant zzso effect on human zzso cancer cell growth and was accompanied with related cell cycle zzso arrest as well as zzso of zzso D1 expression at the zzso level in zzso and zzso zzso Further studies identified that zzso zzso zzso D1 gene zzso via zzso of specific protein 1 zzso zzso Moreover, zzso expression of zzso D1 rendered zzso cells resistant to induction of zzso zzso arrest and zzso of cancer cell zzso growth by zzso zzso Together, our studies show that zzso is an active compound that mediates zzso zzso induction of zzso zzso arrest and zzso of cancer cell zzso growth through zzso zzso D1 axis in zzso cancer zzso Our studies provide a novel insight into understanding the zzso activity of the Chinese herb zzso zzso and its isolate zzso
