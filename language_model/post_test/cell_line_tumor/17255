zzso the zzso compartment in the blast cell population of patients with acute zzso leukemia zzso may yield important insights into the mechanisms of disease zzso Here we present findings with a human zzso cell line zzso initiated from zzso precursor cells and zzso zzso by serial zzso in zzso zzso maintained the characteristics of a human zzso consistently exhibiting a small zzso side population zzso of blast cells with high zzso zzso zzso In the zzso line, an increased expression of the ABC zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was found in the SP zzso The detection of zzso in zzso zzso cells merits further investigation with regard to zzso drug transport in zzso blast zzso In zzso propagation of zzso such as zzso is a model system of maintaining the zzso zzso of zzso disease, especially the unique characteristics of zzso SP zzso
