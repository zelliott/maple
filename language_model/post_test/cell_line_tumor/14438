Among the zzso zzso drugs, zzso derivatives have recently attracted considerable attention due to their strong in zzso and in zzso zzso activity and reduced zzso zzso Some of them, namely zzso zzso zzso 1) and zzso zzso zzso zzso have shown to be highly active against the zzso prostate cancer cell lines zzso and zzso both zzso cell proliferation in a zzso way, and are more active than the reference drug zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In particular, zzso zzso was proved zzso against zzso zzso cells, with activity levels comparable to those induced on the parent zzso zzso cells, ruling out the occurrence of zzso zzso Moreover, it causes early cell damage, slightly affecting the cell cycle, thus suggesting a different mechanism of action from clinically established zzso zzso In fact, the investigated zzso complex alters zzso functions, promoting zzso membrane zzso and zzso release, stimulating zzso generation, and strongly zzso the activity of the zzso zzso which is zzso in prostate cancer and associated with the onset of drug zzso In addition, it zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso reduces the expression of the zzso form of the zzso and it zzso zzso cell zzso Finally, the treatment of zzso prostate zzso nude mice with zzso zzso significantly inhibited tumor growth in zzso causing minimal systemic zzso Altogether, our results confirm that these zzso derivatives have potential for the treatment of prostate zzso
