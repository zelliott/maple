Members of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso are being investigated for the therapy and prevention of zzso because of their zzso effects on zzso zzso Some zzso studies show that patients taking statins show a lower zzso of cancer compared with those taking other cholesterol-lowering zzso In contrast, other studies show that zzso use does not correlate with cancer zzso To address this zzso we investigated the efficacy of different statins on the zzso prostate cancer cell line and the zzso zzso prostate cancer cell zzso zzso used zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibit proliferation of the two prostate cancer cells by inducing a zzso zzso zzso induced the arrest at zzso zzso a concentration easily reached in the serum after oral zzso zzso however, was less effective at zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells and had to be present at 200 times higher zzso to effect a cell cycle zzso Another potential source of zzso is the different levels of the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso noted in prostate zzso particularly because statins have been suggested to act through the induction of zzso zzso All three statins zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso of zzso but this zzso was correlated with a loss of the zzso zzso on zzso of zzso zzso zzso and not dependent on the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso status is unlikely to confound the zzso data on the efficacy of statins in prostate zzso To make definitive conclusions about the efficacy of statins on cancer zzso however, the zzso studies should take into account the type of zzso used and the serum zzso achieved and ensure that the tested zzso zzso the specific type of cancer in zzso at those zzso
