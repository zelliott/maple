The zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso the active form of vitamin zzso are zzso by the nuclear vitamin D zzso zzso In the present study, we characterized zzso expression in lung zzso zzso 

We examined zzso zzso expression using a quantitative real-time zzso zzso in 100 patients who underwent surgery for lung zzso In a subset of these patients zzso we examined zzso protein expression using zzso We also examined the association of zzso protein expression with circulating serum levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso effects and cell cycle arrest of zzso were examined using lung cancer cell lines with high zzso as well as low zzso expression of zzso zzso 

Higher zzso expression zzso with longer survival after adjusting for age, sex, disease stage and tumor grade zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, there was a positive correlation zzso between serum zzso and tumor zzso protein zzso A greater zzso effect of zzso was observed in high compared to low zzso cell zzso these effects corresponded to zzso cell cycle zzso this was associated with a decline in zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 2 zzso zzso zzso and zzso maintenance 2 zzso proteins involved in zzso zzso 

Increased zzso expression in lung zzso is associated with improved zzso This may relate to a lower zzso status and zzso arrest in high zzso zzso
