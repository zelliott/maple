zzso therapy resistance in zzso zzso alpha positive zzso breast zzso remains a major obstacle for maintaining efficacy of targeted zzso We investigated the significance and the mechanisms involved in zzso zzso in a zzso derived panel of zzso breast cancer cells which can zzso in the absence of zzso with different sensitivities to zzso zzso We show that all the resistant cell lines tested zzso zzso as compared to parental zzso cells and its zzso lead to the differential blocking of zzso proliferation in resistant zzso Further investigation of the resistant cell line, zzso suggested zzso zzso of zzso gene was responsible for its zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed markedly higher recruitment of zzso zzso zzso domain zzso of zzso zzso at the zzso promoter of zzso zzso which is responsible for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The level of zzso a factor responsible for the zzso of zzso of zzso zzso II zzso was found to be elevated in all the resistant cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso not only reduced the transcripts and the protein levels of zzso in zzso cells but also selectively inhibited the zzso growth of all the resistant cell zzso This study describes the zzso molecular events involved in the zzso zzso of zzso gene in breast cancer cells zzso zzso and identifies zzso as a potential novel drug target for therapeutic intervention in zzso breast zzso
