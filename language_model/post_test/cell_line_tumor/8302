zzso growth factor zzso zzso signaling plays an important role in a majority of solid tumors, and zzso targeted against zzso has demonstrated promise in slowing growth of these zzso However, many of these drugs either have failed to reproduce promising zzso model results in clinical settings or have been successful in only a zzso of cancer patients due partly to incomplete assessment of zzso status in zzso A zzso zzso diagnostic for the effects of specific zzso therapies may improve zzso Here we report the development of a zzso protein array for quantitative and zzso determination of the activity of zzso directly from cellular zzso In this study, we used zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion proteins immobilized within a zzso zzso as a zzso for zzso zzso zzso activity from the extracts of zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in a mixture containing zzso zzso cell zzso diluted in zzso from a cell line expressing low levels of zzso In addition, the zzso protein array was capable of detecting zzso of zzso activity when incubated with different zzso zzso zzso These findings establish the potential of this zzso zzso zzso array not only to evaluate zzso status in cancer cell zzso but also to screen for the most promising zzso for individual patients and monitor treatment zzso
