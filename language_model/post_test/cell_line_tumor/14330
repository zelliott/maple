The presence of the zzso barrier zzso drug delivery in the development of therapeutic agents for the treatment of zzso zzso zzso The use of local gene transfer in the brain has the potential to overcome this delivery barrier by allowing the expression of therapeutic agents directly at the tumor zzso In this study, we describe the development of a zzso zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso that encodes an zzso soluble zzso termed zzso of vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso is an zzso factor highly zzso in zzso tumor tissue and zzso with disease zzso In subcutaneous models of zzso zzso zzso following zzso gene transfer significantly reduces overall tumor volume and increases median survival time following a single administration of zzso Using zzso brain tumor models of zzso we find that direct zzso administration of the zzso zzso to the tumor site demonstrates zzso efficacy at doses that are not zzso following systemic delivery of the zzso We propose that zzso gene transfer of a potent soluble zzso inhibitor in the zzso represents an effective zzso treatment strategy for zzso
