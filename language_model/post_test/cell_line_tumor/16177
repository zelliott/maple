The objectives of this communication were to zzso pure samples of zzso carbon zzso zzso and to determine their toxicity in tumor cell zzso zzso were dispersed in a concentration of the zzso zzso that was minimally zzso zzso variation in toxicity to zzso was observed but was not significantly different to zzso zzso Additionally, we investigated the increased cell killing of the pancreatic cancer cell line zzso when exposed to zzso zzso zzso electrical fields zzso in the presence of zzso as a potential form of cancer zzso We hypothesized that the unique electronic properties of zzso disrupt cell function, leading to cell death, when cells are exposed to zzso We observed a zzso reduction in cell survival in cells zzso in the presence of zzso compared to zzso zzso This study demonstrates that zzso pulse electrical field applications have enhanced killing effects when cells are previously grown in the presence of zzso suggesting that the electrical properties of zzso play a vital role in this process and is suggestive of a synergistic interaction between these zzso and electrical zzso
