zzso a recently identified zzso zzso has been reported to promote zzso zzso zzso physically interacts with zzso and promotes zzso of zzso independently of zzso Like zzso zzso is thought to participate in an zzso feedback loop that controls zzso zzso We have previously reported that zzso was zzso in human and zzso lung zzso as compared to zzso lung zzso zzso increase could potentially cause degradation of zzso zzso and reduce its tumor suppression function in the lung tumor zzso Since zzso has been reported to be zzso by zzso however, the mechanisms by which a high level of zzso expression is maintained in tumor cells despite low level of zzso zzso protein are zzso In order to evaluate zzso involvement in the zzso of zzso we evaluated zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression with Western zzso analysis and real time zzso after gamma zzso or zzso DNA damage treatment using human cancer cell lines containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso expression was not affected by the presence of zzso zzso in the cancer zzso In contrast, zzso was zzso by zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells and was absent from the zzso and the zzso zzso We conclude that zzso operates in a distinct manner from zzso in response to DNA damage in cancer zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells indicates the existence of additional molecular mechanisms for zzso zzso and suggests that zzso is not the sole target of zzso zzso zzso zzso
