The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso of zzso is the only registered drug for relapsed small cell lung cancer zzso The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso has shown zzso and clinical zzso activities in zzso zzso and solid tumors, including zzso and has recently been approved for the treatment of zzso zzso zzso In this study, we analyzed the zzso effect of zzso combined with zzso or zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or sequential exposure (24 h zzso to either agent resulted in strong synergistic zzso effect in both cell lines, as shown by calculating combination index, and confirmed by growth in soft zzso Combination treatments increased zzso cell cycle arrest paralleled by zzso as measured by zzso peak formation, zzso V zzso DNA zzso and zzso zzso The zzso process was triggered by a zzso mechanism and can be ascribed to the zzso of zzso a reporter of DNA zzso zzso These effects were paralleled by an increase of zzso zzso complexes induced by combination treatment and suggest a zzso by zzso of zzso DNA zzso Finally, zzso injury played a significant functional role in the observed enhanced zzso because zzso of the zzso zzso blocked zzso oxygen species generation, zzso and zzso destruction induced by the zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a synergistic zzso effect between zzso and zzso in zzso Because no well-established treatment is available for zzso zzso patients, our results indicate that this drug combination should be explored zzso
