zzso and zzso are closely linked and interactive with each other, but few studies were given to identify possible links between zzso proteins and zzso zzso zzso Here we investigated the potential relationship of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso protein 1 zzso also known as acute zzso zzso zzso an important zzso zzso zzso The results demonstrated that zzso and zzso proteins directly zzso with each other to a degree, in which zzso zzso domain of zzso was mainly zzso zzso abnormal zzso fusion protein zzso which zzso the zzso 177 zzso acid zzso of the zzso protein in frame to zzso zzso zzso also zzso with zzso protein with greater ability than zzso zzso More zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso and zzso activity of zzso protein with reduced expression of zzso genes such as vascular zzso growth factor, while silence of zzso expression by specific small interfering zzso significantly increased zzso activity of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso inhibited zzso function of zzso Vice versa, zzso increased zzso ability and zzso activity of zzso zzso All these data would shed new insight to understanding zzso and zzso zzso cell differentiation and zzso
