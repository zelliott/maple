Although zzso are emerging that dietary zzso have beneficial effects in treatment of zzso and cardiovascular diseases, the underlying molecular mechanism has not yet been extensively zzso In this report, we showed that zzso one of the major zzso increased expression of genes involved in zzso zzso such as zzso zzso 1, liver form zzso in zzso cells, when zzso by real-time zzso zzso chain reactions as well as Western zzso zzso The increase in zzso of zzso after zzso treatment was not changed in the presence of zzso a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso suggesting that this effect of zzso was zzso zzso Since these genes involved in fatty acid zzso are considered putative downstream target genes of zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso we examined whether expression of zzso was modulated by zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso induced expression of zzso at both zzso and zzso Further, zzso activated zzso activity of zzso when determined by reporter gene analysis, suggesting zzso as a potential zzso for zzso Taken together, this study provides a picture of the regulatory action of zzso as an zzso of zzso in fatty acid zzso and potential use of zzso as zzso zzso
