zzso zzso based on zzso are of great interests for zzso implant drug zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was reported as a potential zzso zzso The objective of the present study is to evaluate the zzso in zzso degradation and drug release of zzso zzso zzso was evaluated using zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and drug release in zzso were investigated by subcutaneous injection of the zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits no significant zzso when its concentration is less than 3 zzso zzso After being zzso zzso zzso maintains its integrity for two weeks and collapses, merging into the zzso in the third zzso It causes moderate inflammatory response but no zzso zzso around the zzso is zzso The zzso presents a three-week sustained release of zzso A with no significant burst release in zzso and produces the effective drug concentration in blood for more than five weeks in zzso performing almost the same zzso to zzso zzso Further modifications of zzso zzso might be necessary to zzso the degradation and to mitigate the fluctuations in blood drug zzso
