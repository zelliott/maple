zzso zzso bond is a common feature in numerous biologically active peptides and proteins and accordingly its replacement by various surrogates presents a potential route to obtain zzso with improved zzso zzso The purpose of the present study was to assess whether an zzso can serve as such a zzso In view of the marked clinical significance of zzso and the brain zzso zzso zzso we choose these peptides as a zzso Three zzso zzso zzso and three zzso zzso zzso were effectively prepared in solution through zzso bond formation between zzso zzso and His or zzso zzso that were positioned in the zzso sequences in place of the native zzso zzso The peptides binding affinities to the zzso and zzso zzso expressed on rat zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso cells, respectively, were zzso The zzso zzso displayed good to moderate affinities to the rat zzso in the zzso range with best results obtained with zzso 2, that is, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dynamics simulations on these peptides suggests on a correlation between the observed binding zzso and the degree of zzso space overlapping with that of zzso The zzso zzso exhibited binding affinities to the zzso in the zzso range with best results obtained with zzso that is, zzso zzso 60 zzso
