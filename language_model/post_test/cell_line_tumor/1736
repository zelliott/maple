To investigate the possible role of zzso in the resistance to platinum based chemotherapy in zzso cell lung cancer zzso explore their potential role and find potential zzso for prediction of the response to zzso 

21 zzso were zzso in zzso Increased zzso expression significantly increased the resistance of zzso cell to zzso whereas reduced zzso decreased the resistance of zzso zzso This finding was further validated in the tissue samples of 58 patients and it was found that zzso expression was significantly increased in platinum based zzso patients zzso zzso 58, p zzso zzso And increased zzso expression was associated with the shorter zzso zzso zzso zzso Among these 58 patients, 32 had the corresponding plasma samples and similar tendencies were detected in zzso zzso Finally, zzso of zzso with zzso increased the expression of zzso and decreased zzso In contrast, zzso decreased the expression of zzso and increased zzso in zzso 

zzso was employed to compare the expression of zzso between zzso and zzso zzso The effect of a differently expressed zzso zzso was examined on the sensitivity of cells to zzso zzso expression in zzso tumor zzso and matched plasma sample was also analyzed by zzso zzso 

Our data suggests that the expression level of zzso in tumor tissue and plasma might be used as a zzso to predict zzso platinum based chemotherapy response and disease free survival in patients with zzso Thus, it may serve as a novel therapeutic target to zzso zzso zzso
