In zzso zzso using a linear zzso the effect of radiation may be reduced during intermittent zzso zzso to recovery from zzso damage in tumor zzso After our previous in zzso study suggesting this phenomenon, we investigated the issue in zzso zzso 

We used zzso and zzso tumors approximately 1 zzso in diameter growing in the hind legs of zzso zzso Three schedules of intermittent radiation were zzso First, 2 zzso of 10 zzso were given at an zzso of zzso zzso to investigate the pattern of recovery from zzso zzso Second, 5 zzso of 4 zzso were given with zzso intervals of zzso zzso zzso Third, 10 zzso of 2 zzso were given with zzso intervals of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were also given without interruption to estimate the zzso zzso zzso were excised 20 h later, and tumor cell survival was determined by an in zzso zzso zzso 

In the zzso experiment, the increase in cell survival with zzso of the zzso was much less than that observed in our previous in zzso zzso In the zzso and zzso experiments, no significant increase in cell survival was observed after the intermittent zzso Moreover, cell survival decreased at most points of the zzso experiments by interruption of radiation in both zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso experiment, cell survival also decreased when the interruption was 3 or 7 zzso in zzso zzso 

The results of the present in zzso studies were different from those of our in zzso studies in which cell survival increased significantly when a few minutes or longer intervals were posed between zzso This suggests that recovery from zzso damage in zzso may be zzso by other phenomena such as zzso that zzso tumor cells to subsequent zzso
