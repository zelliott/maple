zzso cell zzso receptors zzso on zzso cells have been linked to a wide spectrum of health conditions such as chronic infections, zzso diseases, pregnancy zzso zzso and transplant zzso A small subset of zzso memory T cells also expresses zzso In this study, we use modern zzso tools including zzso and multiplex zzso zzso and functional zzso to characterize the zzso T cells in human zzso We find that zzso T cells primarily reside in the zzso T population that is zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso short zzso and limited zzso zzso zzso During zzso zzso in bone zzso transplant recipients, zzso T cells rapidly expanded in real-time but not zzso T cells or zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso donors, as much as 50% of zzso T cells are zzso and most are zzso zzso zzso the zzso T cell subset zzso cancer cells and zzso target cells in a dual zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso confirms the zzso memory status of zzso T cells in contrast to zzso T cells that are more active in energy metabolism and zzso zzso zzso T cells have zzso higher level of expression of zzso than the zzso counterpart and are a previously unknown producer of zzso rather than zzso in multiplex zzso zzso Our data provide fundamental insights into zzso T cells biologically and zzso
