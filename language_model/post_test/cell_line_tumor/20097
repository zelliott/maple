The use of combinations of chemotherapy and natural products has recently emerged as a new method of cancer therapy, relying on the capacity of certain natural compounds to trigger cell death with low doses of zzso agents and few side zzso The current study aims to evaluate the zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso zzso in a panel of cancer cell lines and to identify their underlying zzso zzso alone showed potent zzso activity, but surprisingly, its interaction with zzso was zzso in four out of five cancer cell zzso Neither zzso nor zzso zzso affect the sensitivity of cancer cells to zzso zzso of the DNA damage response machinery zzso showed that both zzso and zzso zzso DNA zzso breaks zzso and evoked zzso zzso formation at doses as low as 1 zzso Cell cycle analysis revealed S phase arrest after zzso or zzso application, whereas zzso with zzso and zzso led to increased arrest of the cell cycle in S phase zzso zzso or the zzso of cells in G zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso with zzso and zzso resulted in zzso of the level of DNA damage induction and repair compared with either agent zzso zzso microscopic examination demonstrated that different zzso of cell death occurred with each zzso zzso alone induced zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso alone or in combination with zzso led to zzso and zzso 

zzso with zzso and zzso resulted in an zzso zzso This antagonism is zzso in part, to the enhanced arrest of tumor cells in both S and G zzso zzso which prevents the cells from entering zzso with damaged DNA and, consequently, prevents cell death from zzso This arrest allows time for the cells to repair DNA damage so that cell cycle zzso cells can eventually resume cell cycle progression and continue their zzso zzso
