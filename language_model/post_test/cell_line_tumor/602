To investigate the effects of zzso in zzso of zzso and growth of liver cancer zzso 

zzso was zzso with zzso and zzso zzso Atomic force zzso zzso was used to observe the changes of the form of the zzso Human zzso vascular zzso cells zzso were zzso for 24 hours, then zzso with zzso + zzso or zzso + zzso for 24 zzso zzso was used to observe the zzso of the zzso Another zzso were zzso for 24 hours and then cultured with zzso (10 zzso 100 zzso + zzso zzso zzso and 500 zzso 100 zzso respectively for 5 zzso Then Western zzso was used to detect the zzso protein of zzso C zzso on zzso zzso cancer cells of the line zzso were injected zzso into the right armpit of 20 zzso nude zzso When the size of transplanted tumor reached about 8 zzso the mice were divided into 2 equal groups: experimental group undergoing injection of zzso into the tumor once a day for 8 days, and control group injected with normal zzso On day 14 the mice were sacrificed with the liver tumors taken out to measure the size and zzso The zzso density zzso of tumor was determined by zzso zzso 

zzso showed that acted with zzso the size of zzso became over 30 zzso zzso with zzso the zzso became larger with obvious zzso However, such changes were obviously milder in those zzso treated with zzso + zzso The zzso zzso level zzso zzso was decreased along with the increase of the concentration of zzso The zzso of liver cancer tissue in the experimental group was zzso zzso zzso significantly lower than that of the control group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The mean weight and volume of tumor of the experimental group were zzso zzso zzso g and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, both significantly lower than those of the control group zzso zzso zzso g and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, both P zzso zzso with a tumor growth zzso rate of zzso 

zzso significantly zzso the zzso and growth of liver cancer cells with the possible mechanism that zzso zzso the zzso zzso
