Green tea zzso has been a focus of recent research, as a zzso fraction from green tea zzso has been suggested to prevent zzso zzso skin zzso Recently, it was demonstrated that zzso reduced the risk for skin cancer in a zzso zzso zzso This was accompanied by a reduction in zzso DNA zzso These effects appeared to be zzso via zzso zzso which was previously shown to induce DNA zzso zzso we studied whether zzso induction of zzso and DNA repair could also be observed in human zzso zzso cells and normal human zzso were exposed to zzso 5 h before and after zzso zzso zzso was reduced in zzso cells treated with zzso zzso induced the zzso of zzso in zzso The reduction in zzso cell death by zzso was almost completely reversed upon addition of an zzso indicating that the reduction of zzso cell death by zzso is zzso via zzso The ability of zzso to reduce DNA damage and zzso cells was confirmed in zzso living skin zzso zzso Hence the previously reported zzso effects of zzso appear to be zzso in human cells via zzso most likely through induction of DNA zzso
