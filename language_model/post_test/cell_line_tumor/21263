Cancer stem cells zzso are found in multiple tumor zzso While the presence of surface markers selectively expressed on zzso are used to isolate these cells, no marker or pattern of makers are known to zzso identify zzso in many tumor zzso In such cases exploitation of stem cell characteristics can be used to identify zzso and one such characteristic is the capacity to zzso zzso such as zzso zzso Cell that exclude this dye are referred to as side population zzso zzso These cells share characteristics of zzso specifically, they are enriched for tumor initiating capacity, they express zzso zzso and they are resistant to zzso zzso zzso exclusion is a valuable technique as it identifies a unique population of cells with zzso zzso
