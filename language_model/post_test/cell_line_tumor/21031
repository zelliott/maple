zzso receptors zzso many functions in both peripheral and central nervous zzso Some of these processes depend on increases in protein zzso which may be achieved by zzso of zzso target of zzso zzso a zzso that regulates protein translation zzso Here, we examined the regulation of zzso signaling pathways by zzso receptors in zzso human zzso cells, and in human embryonic kidney zzso cell lines zzso with individual zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells, the zzso analog zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso a downstream target of zzso The sensitivity of the response to zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that it was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was blocked by the zzso inhibitor zzso but was independent of zzso zzso zzso The response was significantly reduced by the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso which also inhibited zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells expressing zzso zzso but was ineffective in zzso zzso zzso cells, although zzso activated zzso in both zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in zzso regulation by zzso zzso but was not activated by zzso in any of the cell lines zzso The protein zzso C inhibitor zzso I reduced zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, and in zzso cells expressing zzso zzso but not in zzso cells expressing zzso zzso The results demonstrate that multiple zzso zzso zzso regulate zzso and that both zzso and zzso mechanisms may mediate the response in a cell zzso zzso
