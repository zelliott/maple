zzso cell lung cancer zzso is a highly zzso cancer with limited treatment options, thus requiring development of novel targeted zzso Our group previously identified zzso cell zzso zzso zzso expression as a member of a zzso zzso expression signature for zzso zzso However, there is little information on the zzso function of zzso in lung cancer zzso This study investigates the functional and zzso role of zzso in zzso 

Cox zzso hazards zzso analysis was done on four independent published zzso expression zzso of primary zzso zzso expression was suppressed by zzso zzso zzso zzso in human zzso cell zzso zzso were assessed by examining in zzso migration and invasion, in zzso zzso in mice, and zzso potential using an zzso zzso rat model of lung zzso 

zzso is an independent zzso marker in zzso zzso patients, with zzso strongly associated with worse zzso zzso zzso significantly decreased cell zzso and zzso in lung cancer cells and reduced tumor formation and growth in zzso zzso with zzso zzso were deficient in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies showed that zzso suppression in highly zzso lung cancer cells significantly decreases spread to distant zzso including bone and zzso 

zzso is a novel zzso gene in zzso and its zzso may effectively suppress zzso tumor growth and zzso zzso zzso of zzso may be a novel therapy for zzso
