We previously identified that the zzso zzso promoter of the novel zzso zzso (also known as zzso is frequently zzso and silenced in zzso cancer zzso However, the function of zzso was zzso In this report we demonstrate that zzso is involved in the regulation of key cell cycle and cell zzso networks in human zzso surface zzso cells, and may play a role in promoting zzso in zzso cancer zzso 

We applied zzso DNA zzso on whole zzso promoter zzso zzso and zzso zzso to examine zzso status of zzso in multiple zzso cancer cell lines, as well as in normal zzso and zzso tumor zzso zzso profiling was used to investigate the effects of zzso suppression in zzso cancer zzso We zzso zzso zzso in normal zzso surface zzso cells and performed cellular zzso migration and zzso zzso to validate and explore the profiling zzso 

We demonstrate that zzso is zzso in multiple zzso cancer cell zzso Loss of zzso results in decreased cell proliferation and colony zzso In addition, zzso of the zzso transcript results in zzso and less persistent migration in wound healing zzso due to a loss of cellular zzso Using an ex zzso zzso zzso zzso we also reveal a role for zzso in the attachment of zzso cancer cells to zzso zzso indicating a potential function of zzso expression in zzso of zzso cancer cells to sites within the zzso zzso 

Our findings further support zzso as frequently zzso in zzso cancer and reveal a novel function for zzso zzso expression in regulating cell zzso zzso and zzso and loss of expression may contribute to the zzso potential of zzso cancer zzso
