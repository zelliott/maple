zzso zzso zzso is one of the most common zzso originating in the zzso and zzso is an essential aspect of zzso chemotherapy zzso zzso has been implicated in zzso resistance zzso of many types of human zzso However, the effect and mechanism of zzso in zzso of human zzso is not fully zzso In this report, we silenced zzso in human zzso zzso cells, and explored the role of zzso in zzso zzso The results showed an increased zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso depletion in zzso zzso zzso zzso We also found a decreased zzso zzso and protein expression of zzso resistance gene zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso repair zzso gene 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso The increased expression of zzso and decreased expression of zzso and zzso suggested that the key cellular signaling pathways were triggered by zzso zzso We concluded that zzso zzso would contribute to establish a potent target point for zzso zzso
