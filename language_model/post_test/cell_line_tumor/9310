zzso cancer remains a leading cause of death in women and development of new therapies is zzso Second zzso derived zzso of zzso zzso has been described to sensitize for zzso We have explored the zzso activity of a small zzso mimic of zzso on zzso cancer cell lines zzso cells and its zzso derivatives zzso and zzso cancer cell lines and in primary zzso cancer zzso 

The effects of a small zzso mimic of zzso on zzso cancer cell lines and primary zzso cancer cells were determined by cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

This compound added alone zzso only a weak zzso zzso however, it strongly zzso with tumor necrosis zzso zzso inducing zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso in inducing zzso of zzso cancer zzso 

These observations suggest that small zzso mimic of zzso could be useful for the development of experimental strategies aiming to treat zzso zzso Interestingly, in addition to its well known zzso effects, zzso zzso a significant increase of zzso zzso
