zzso zzso the most abundant zzso zzso in green tea, showed zzso and zzso zzso zzso was reported to bind to the zzso domain of heat shock protein 90 zzso The purpose of this study is to investigate zzso as a novel zzso inhibitor to impair zzso zzso complex for simultaneous zzso of zzso proteins in pancreatic cancer zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso exhibited zzso activity against pancreatic cancer cell line Mia zzso in zzso with zzso below 50 zzso zzso increased zzso activity up to zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso Western zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso induced zzso of zzso zzso client proteins by approximately zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed that zzso decreased the association of zzso zzso and zzso with zzso by more than zzso while it had little effect on the zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed direct binding between zzso and the zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that the binding of zzso to zzso zzso the association of zzso with its zzso thereby inducing degradation of zzso client zzso resulting zzso effects in pancreatic cancer zzso
