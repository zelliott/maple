zzso is a poor zzso factor in breast cancer and, thus, presents a significant clinical zzso The mechanisms of zzso involve multiple complex biological zzso This study aims to identify common zzso factors to zzso in breast cancer by comparing protein expression profiles of zzso zzso breast cancer cells and cells resistant to two different commonly used zzso drugs zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso binding cassette zzso zzso zzso in breast zzso has previously been found to correlate with poor prognosis in zzso and, zzso we confirmed zzso of zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso Using two-dimensional gel zzso and zzso zzso mass zzso we identified 20 proteins zzso expressed between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed altered expression in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso of a number of these changes was confirmed by Western zzso Our findings provide further insights into the complex mechanisms of zzso as well as representing an attractive starting point for the identification of potential protein zzso to predict response to chemotherapy in breast cancer in zzso
