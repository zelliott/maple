zzso cell death zzso is important in tissue zzso zzso of zzso include zzso zzso DNA fragmentation and an overall reduction in cell zzso Whether this zzso volume decrease zzso is a mere response to initiators of zzso or whether it is functionally significant is not zzso In this study, we sought to answer this question using human zzso zzso cells as a model zzso In zzso high grade zzso demonstrate an increased percentage of zzso cells as well as zzso of death zzso zzso By zzso monitoring cell volume, we show that the induction of zzso via zzso of either the intrinsic or zzso pathways with zzso or zzso respectively, resulted in a rapid zzso in zzso human zzso zzso This decrease in cell volume could be prevented by zzso the zzso of zzso through zzso Such suppression of zzso also reduced the zzso of zzso 3, 8 and 9 and suppressed DNA zzso zzso experimental zzso that reduce the cell volume to zzso of the original volume for periods of at least 3 hours were sufficient to initiate zzso even in the absence of death zzso zzso this data suggests that cell zzso is both necessary and sufficient for the induction of zzso
