By virtue of its high affinity for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been used for the therapy of tumors of zzso origin for more than 25 zzso Although not yet universally adopted, zzso targeted zzso remains a highly promising means of management of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the mode of zzso of zzso into zzso cells and of factors that influence the activity of the zzso mechanism has indicated a variety of means of increasing the effectiveness of this type of zzso Studies in model systems revealed that zzso of zzso to high specific activity reduced the amount of cold competitor, thereby increasing tumor dose and minimizing zzso zzso Increased zzso to targeted tumors might also be achieved by the use of the zzso zzso zzso rather than zzso as zzso Recently it has been demonstrated that potent zzso bystander effects were induced by zzso zzso and zzso Discovery of the structure of bystander factors could increase the therapeutic ratio achievable by zzso targeted zzso zzso combined with zzso produced zzso zzso in zzso and tumor growth delay in zzso The enhanced zzso effect was consistent with a failure to repair DNA zzso zzso findings suggest that further enhancement of efficacy might be achieved by triple combination therapy with drugs that disrupt alternative zzso pathways and zzso not only with zzso abut also with zzso With these zzso it is expected that advances will be made toward the zzso of zzso therapy of zzso zzso
