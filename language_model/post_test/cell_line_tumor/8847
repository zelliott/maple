zzso is one of the most zzso brain tumors with a poor zzso In this study, we examined the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso to zzso therapy in zzso and in zzso The cell viability of zzso on zzso and zzso zzso cells was determined by the zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso activity were investigated in Brain zzso bearing rat model of zzso zzso by zzso administration of zzso zzso We found that the average diameter of each zzso is around 150 zzso with 32 molecules of zzso on zzso In zzso zzso of zzso against zzso and zzso cells was higher than that of free zzso and further the modification of zzso enhanced the zzso of the zzso zzso as a result of the increased cellular zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso In comparison with free zzso zzso zzso could significantly decrease tumor volume and accumulate in brain zzso which resulted in zzso the survival of zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso had a potential of therapeutic effect to zzso both in zzso and in zzso and might be a potential candidate for targeted therapy of zzso and worthy of further zzso
