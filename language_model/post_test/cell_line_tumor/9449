Although human zzso zzso DNA is detected in the majority of cervical zzso and their precursors zzso zzso zzso zzso the persistence or progression of cervical zzso could be associated with quantitative and functional zzso of zzso cells zzso As zzso abnormalities have been associated with a decreased expression of zzso inflammatory protein zzso zzso in cervical zzso we tested the effect of zzso zzso on the migration of zzso in a zzso zzso formed in zzso By using a zzso chamber zzso we first showed that the migratory capacity of zzso generated in zzso is significantly increased in the presence of zzso compared to control zzso We next demonstrated that zzso is able to increase the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cultures of zzso zzso This property to stimulate zzso migration was not altered after inclusion of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the function of DC to exert zzso effects and to present zzso was not altered in the presence of zzso
