Here, we investigated the zzso relationship of major green tea zzso and their corresponding zzso on zzso binding and zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed the zzso binding to the human zzso zzso cells by surface zzso resonance analysis, but their zzso forms did zzso zzso activities of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were higher than those of zzso zzso zzso and zzso These patterns were also observed in their zzso effects on zzso zzso Previously, we have reported that biological activities of zzso are zzso through the binding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression caused a reduction of both activities of zzso zzso These results suggest that both the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso pattern contribute to the exertion of biological activities of tea zzso and their zzso
