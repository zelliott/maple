zzso has been used as medicinal herb for many years in both China and zzso In particular, Chinese zzso has been commonly used to treat disorders of zzso zzso in Chinese traditional medicine zzso Chinese zzso zzso extract zzso previously reported to have zzso activity in breast cancer cells with low potency zzso in a range of zzso zzso However, treatment of zzso ethanol extract in zzso markedly suppressed the development of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso activity of Chinese zzso especially in a form of ethanol zzso needs to be confirmed further at cellular zzso 

zzso part of Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso dry powder is extracted with zzso ethanol and the chemical components were characterized with zzso finger print as well as mass zzso zzso of the zzso zzso ethanol extract zzso was analyzed with zzso zzso on zzso negative zzso and zzso positive zzso human breast cancer cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso were used to verify whether the cell death induced by zzso is zzso in zzso Cell cycle status of zzso treated cells were analyzed with flow zzso 

Our results showed that zzso caused cell death in a zzso and zzso fashion in both zzso positive and negative breast cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso evidence all indicated the cell death is not in an zzso zzso Furthermore, low zzso of zzso caused cell cycle arrest at zzso zzso 

These data suggest that Chinese zzso zzso ethanol extract may effectively inhibit the proliferation of breast cancer cells through mechanisms of both zzso and cell cycle zzso The cellular effects of zzso are zzso and zzso independent on breast cancer zzso
