zzso invasion is the outcome of a complex interplay between cancer cells and the zzso environment and requires the zzso of a dense, zzso zzso of collagen type I zzso zzso We use a zzso zzso and zzso complementary model to study cancer invasion through native collagen type I zzso Cell zzso is preserved during the zzso allowing real-time monitoring of zzso changes in cell structure and zzso zzso Combination of these models with computerized zzso permits the calculation of highly zzso and zzso zzso These zzso are versatile in the use of fluorescent zzso and have a flexible kinetic zzso Once the optimal experimental conditions are zzso determined, the collagen type I invasion zzso can be used for zzso validation of zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso and monitoring of the zzso and zzso invasion model can be achieved in 8 h (over 3 zzso and in 14 h (over 5 zzso zzso
