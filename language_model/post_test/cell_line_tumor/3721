Based on the complex crystal structure of human zzso zzso and its zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso (named zzso was designed using zzso design zzso Dealing with molecular zzso and molecular dynamics methods, the interaction between zzso and zzso was zzso The theoretical studies showed that zzso possessed very high affinity to zzso and offered a practical means of imposing long-term blockade of zzso activity in zzso This effect was examined due to growth arrest and zzso induced by zzso in zzso cell line zzso cells in a zzso zzso The findings demonstrate that zzso could also act as an excellent zzso candidate for the induction of growth arrest and zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso cell line, which was induced by the zzso zzso zzso to undergo zzso and growth arrest, could be used as a subtle model system to test zzso zzso
