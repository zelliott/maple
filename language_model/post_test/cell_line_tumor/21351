To examine the molecular mechanisms underlying breast cancer zzso in liver and search for potential markers of zzso progression in zzso we analyzed zzso zzso developed from the highly zzso zzso 435 cell line through in zzso zzso selection in the zzso zzso Comparative zzso analysis using two-dimensional zzso zzso revealed that 74 protein spots were zzso more than doubled in liver zzso cells compared to parental zzso From 22 proteins identified by zzso belonging to intermediate zzso zzso transport and zzso zzso we generated a zzso interaction network containing zzso zzso 12 of which zzso zzso 75 was connected with four other zzso zzso zzso 27, zzso B and zzso delta zzso After functional zzso we found that pathways including zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso were zzso in liver zzso cells, but not in lung zzso zzso In conclusion, we suggest that zzso 75 is involved in cell zzso zzso and stress response in zzso cells by recruiting signals in which the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso might be the most significant biological process zzso increased in liver zzso
