The effects of zzso on the expression of zzso and zzso protein in in zzso cultured human lens zzso cells zzso and cell cycle were investigated in order to provide the theoretical basis for the development of new zzso drugs for clinical prevention and treatment of zzso The cultured zzso of second and third passages were collected and treated with zzso The zzso were transferred into zzso culture plates and divided into 6 groups, and each group was set to have 8 duplicate zzso In the negative control group, the zzso were given culture medium only, and in the blank control group, only culture medium was zzso In the four zzso groups, different zzso zzso 40, 60 and 80 zzso of zzso were zzso After treatment for 24, 48 and 72 zzso the zzso zzso values in each well were determined by zzso zzso The cell cycles of all groups were detected by using flow zzso zzso fluorescent quantitative zzso chain reaction zzso and Western zzso were used to detect the zzso and protein expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso could inhibit proliferation of zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso could block the conversion of zzso from zzso phase to S phase, resulting in the increase of cells in zzso phase and the decrease of the cells in S zzso zzso indicated that zzso could zzso the expression of zzso zzso but zzso the expression of zzso zzso suggesting it could induce zzso of zzso Western zzso demonstrated that zzso could suppress the expression of zzso zzso but promote the expression of zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso could inhibit proliferation of zzso probably not only by blocking the progression of cell cycle, but also by promoting the induction of zzso
