zzso is a zzso zzso zzso inhibitor with high affinity for reduced folate carrier 1 zzso and zzso zzso zzso resulting in extensive zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso is approved in the US for the treatment of relapsed or zzso peripheral zzso zzso and is being investigated in various zzso Here, we evaluated molecular zzso of sensitivity to zzso and explored combinations with a variety of zzso zzso 

zzso effects of zzso were evaluated in 15 zzso cell lines using the zzso zzso Gene expression was evaluated using zzso 

zzso and zzso had a similar pattern of zzso zzso being more zzso zzso zzso the effects of platinum drugs, zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso correlated with high zzso expression of zzso zzso resistance to zzso was associated with decreased zzso zzso whereas zzso resistance correlated with increased zzso zzso suggesting different mechanisms of acquired zzso 

zzso was more potent than zzso in a panel of solid zzso zzso Our findings support the further clinical development of zzso in combination with certain zzso and targeted therapies, and suggest that zzso zzso and zzso may be potential zzso of zzso
