The membrane of the zzso zzso zzso of a cell forms contacts directly with zzso zzso the contact is referred to as the zzso zzso membrane or the zzso Here we found that the zzso regulates cellular survival via an zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso in that the zzso zzso the zzso stress sensor zzso to facilitate zzso signaling for zzso zzso is found in this study to be enriched at the zzso in zzso zzso We found that zzso is stabilized at the zzso by zzso when cells are under zzso zzso zzso stabilize zzso and thus allow for zzso correct zzso to zzso into the long-lasting, activated zzso The zzso at the zzso also responds to zzso oxygen species derived from zzso zzso the zzso interface serves as an important zzso entity in the regulation of cellular survival by enhancing the zzso signaling between zzso zzso and zzso
