As a zzso regulator, the zzso zzso zzso regulates the expression of many genes that are essential for male sexual zzso including the development of both normal prostate and prostate zzso The zzso acts by binding to regulatory DNA sequences found on the promoters of regulated zzso The study of zzso activity on such responsive promoters is greatly facilitated by the use of the reporter gene zzso which provides a quantitative and zzso method for studying the activity of such zzso Among the several reporter genes that can be used, the genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been used most widely and successfully by researchers interested in zzso zzso Such studies have led to the identification and characterization of DNA regulatory elements zzso zzso activity on responsive promoters and to an improved understanding of how zzso regulates the zzso zzso Described in this chapter is a method by which to generate and zzso Luc and zzso reporter gene plasmids driven by the promoter of a novel zzso zzso zzso
