zzso is an aggressive zzso tumor that accounts for zzso of childhood cancer zzso zzso despite the availability of comprehensive zzso data on DNA copy number changes in zzso relatively little is known about the genes driving zzso zzso In this study, high resolution array comparative zzso zzso zzso was performed on 188 primary zzso tumors and 33 zzso cell lines to search for previously zzso zzso DNA copy number gains and zzso A new zzso zzso zzso zzso deletion zzso was detected in seven zzso Further analysis of available array zzso zzso revealed 13 additional similar zzso zzso zzso The majority of all detected zzso deletions was found in high risk zzso deleted tumors without zzso amplification zzso exact test p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso resolution zzso zzso zzso custom zzso covering the zzso on zzso for 11 samples, zzso of nine zzso was observed within a zzso region, of which eight were found in a zzso copy number variable region, whereas the remaining two zzso were zzso zzso zzso The commonly deleted region contains one zzso zzso four transcribed ultra zzso region elements zzso and 130 protein coding genes including at least two bona fide tumor zzso zzso zzso (or zzso and zzso This finding further contributes to the zzso of the zzso profile of aggressive zzso offers perspectives for the identification of genes contributing to the disease zzso and may be relevant in the light of assessment of response to new molecular zzso
