Human zzso 2 zzso an zzso zzso is widely expressed in zzso zzso and displays a potent killing activity in response to the zzso of a wide range of zzso and the stimulation of various zzso zzso zzso factor zzso has been reported to be involved in innate immunity responses, such as zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The role of zzso in the zzso regulation of zzso however, is zzso Here, we show that zzso not only activated zzso promoter activity, but also increased the zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the activated zzso promoter activity was attenuated by the zzso zzso zzso input and the loss of the zzso binding site zzso zzso core zzso in the zzso zzso The interaction between the zzso and zzso protein was further confirmed by zzso mobility shift zzso Thus, our data indicate that zzso may play an important role in regulating zzso expression in zzso zzso
