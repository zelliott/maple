zzso gene zzso and subsequent zzso activity define the transformation of many solid zzso including zzso cell zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso one of the zzso zzso was frequently zzso in zzso cell lines and primary zzso zzso protein was expressed in the zzso convoluted zzso of the human zzso the presumed origin of clear cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Compared to paired adjacent zzso zzso both zzso zzso and protein expression were significantly zzso in zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso was zzso in zzso of the samples and the loss of zzso occurred at the early stage of zzso zzso specific zzso showed that zzso promoter was zzso in two zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso alone or in combination with zzso of zzso dramatically induced zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso sequencing zzso confirmed that dense zzso existed in zzso zzso In paired zzso samples, zzso zzso was observed in 12 out of 44 patients zzso Moreover, we zzso the loss of zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cell zzso the zzso was observed in 27 out of 44 patients zzso Finally, restoration of zzso expression suppressed the colony formation of zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso inhibited zzso cell zzso migration and enhanced zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso acts as a zzso zzso in zzso and is zzso in zzso Loss of zzso and DNA zzso contribute to the zzso of zzso in zzso cell zzso
