The zzso raft membrane has been shown to be the site of zzso C virus zzso zzso zzso The mechanism of formation of the replication complex is not zzso We show here that the formation of the zzso zzso replication complex on zzso raft zzso zzso requires interactions among the zzso zzso zzso proteins and may be initiated by the precursor of zzso which has the intrinsic property of zzso to zzso raft zzso In zzso cell lines containing an zzso zzso zzso most of the other zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso were also localized to the zzso zzso However, when individually zzso only zzso was associated exclusively with zzso zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso were localized to zzso membrane and zzso zzso zzso zzso was localized to both zzso and zzso membrane zzso Furthermore, we show that a cellular zzso membrane transport protein named zzso (the human zzso of the zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso which binds to both zzso and zzso plays a critical role in the formation of zzso replication zzso The zzso protein is partially associated with the zzso membrane zzso The expression of zzso zzso and small interfering zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells resulted in the relocation of zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso the amounts of both zzso zzso and proteins in the cells were reduced, indicating that zzso is critical for the formation of zzso replication complex and zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso interactions among the various zzso zzso proteins and zzso are important for the formation of zzso replication zzso
