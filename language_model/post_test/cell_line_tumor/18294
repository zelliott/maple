zzso human zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso produces a 150 zzso zzso However, we have detected zzso zzso predominantly as 39 and 50 zzso zzso and 75 and 110 zzso zzso fragments in a panel of zzso cancer cell lines and zzso zzso zzso This suggests that in zzso cells, zzso zzso protein is normally zzso at a number of specific sites, some of which are in the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein is known to be zzso by the zzso In contrast, the zzso of zzso zzso is independent of the zzso as treatment with the zzso zzso zzso did not inhibit zzso zzso treatment decreased the amount of 39 zzso zzso zzso fragments in zzso zzso cell lines suggesting a decrease in zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso may, therefore, not accurately reflect the role of zzso zzso
