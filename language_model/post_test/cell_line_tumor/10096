We recently identified the zzso protein zzso as a factor required for an activated zzso zzso to induce zzso or zzso in primary human zzso In human zzso containing an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso which seems to be a critical step in melanoma zzso Restoration of zzso function by the addition of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso human melanoma cell lines, and zzso administered zzso markedly suppresses the growth of zzso primary tumors in zzso zzso Here we further evaluate the role of zzso in the treatment of zzso melanoma and other zzso We find that in human zzso melanoma samples zzso is zzso silenced and at an even higher frequency than that found in primary zzso Using a zzso experimental zzso zzso we show that systemic administration of zzso markedly suppresses the growth of zzso disease and zzso zzso An analysis of the zzso panel of human cancer cell lines reveals that in addition to melanoma, zzso zzso zzso in several other cancer types, in particular zzso cancer cell zzso In general, zzso zzso zzso in human cancer cell lines that have an zzso zzso in zzso or zzso and that are sensitive to chemical zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso administered zzso blocks the growth of zzso tumors containing an zzso zzso or zzso zzso in mouse zzso The results presented here, in conjunction with those from previous studies, justify the further development of zzso as an zzso zzso
