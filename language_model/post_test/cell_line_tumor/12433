Previously, we had described a zzso like promoter that regulates expression of the zzso gene in many cell zzso This promoter was found to be regulated by zzso and zzso However, at that time we could find little evidence supporting a significant role for zzso in zzso zzso Interestingly, despite its first description some 12 years ago, a full length zzso clone has only recently been zzso Previous zzso studies, including our own, employed a version of zzso that was significantly zzso zzso In addition, several shorter zzso zzso exist that result from internally initiated translation zzso To complicate matters further, all zzso zzso can be modified by zzso Due to this newly emerging information few reports exist that systematically explore these various zzso zzso zzso or zzso and how they affect activity of specific zzso zzso We therefore undertook such a study to re-evaluate regulation of zzso by these various zzso zzso Using human and insect cells we found that the newly isolated full length version of zzso was only a weak to moderate zzso of zzso However, to our surprise, the more commonly used zzso truncated version of zzso was up to five times more zzso We also found that zzso preventing zzso of the shorter zzso zzso were sufficient to convert them into potent zzso of zzso In contrast to other studies, however, we found that zzso of full length zzso had little effect on its zzso zzso These results provide new insights into the complexity of zzso zzso zzso which appears to be highly dependent on the zzso bound, zzso status and the promoter zzso
