Previous studies show zzso effects of green tea in chemically induced zzso tumors or human tumor zzso but not in spontaneous tumor models that are more representative of human breast zzso The zzso mouse model is particularly suited for breast cancer prevention studies because it produces spontaneous zzso zzso and a predictable time course for zzso zzso through a zzso progression similar to that occurring in zzso We therefore used this model to test the zzso effects of green zzso Administration of zzso zzso E zzso zzso (a standardized preparation of green tea zzso in drinking water delayed tumor onset and suppressed tumor growth by zzso compared to tap zzso animals, with no adverse side zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso showed that green tea slowed the progression of zzso zzso to advanced zzso zzso zzso and suppressed tumor zzso Green tea inhibited the proliferation of zzso zzso cells and tumors and, overall, disrupted zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses also demonstrated that green tea inhibited zzso through a decrease in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression and a decrease in zzso zzso zzso Our data strongly support the potential use of green tea as a breast cancer zzso zzso
