The zzso 1 zzso immune reaction is most important in zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in inducing zzso T zzso zzso zzso In this study, we analyzed whether zzso cells zzso from patients with zzso zzso zzso can be zzso with the zzso gene and/or zzso zzso zzso and we examined whether zzso using these genetically engineered DC can induce stronger therapeutic zzso zzso The results showed that DC zzso with zzso can expressed zzso and zzso by reverse zzso chain reaction and zzso zzso Compared with those before zzso the expressions of membrane molecules were increased zzso zzso T cells generated by DC zzso with zzso recognized zzso zzso cell lines zzso Most importantly, The zzso activity of zzso against zzso with DC expressing zzso was significantly zzso by zzso with the zzso zzso Administration with such vaccine also significantly increased the production of zzso and zzso These results indicate that a vaccination therapy using DC zzso with the zzso gene and zzso genes is effective strategy for zzso in terms of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso T cells, and may be useful in the clinical application of a cancer vaccine zzso
