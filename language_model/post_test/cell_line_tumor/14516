zzso zzso are zzso expressed small zzso zzso that regulate approximately one-third of human genes at zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso were implicated in many cellular processes and participated in the progress of various tumors including zzso zzso zzso Among all zzso the zzso family is well recognized to play pivotal roles in zzso by functioning as potential growth zzso In the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of zzso family, particularly the zzso in the molecular zzso of zzso By use of zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was found to inhibit the proliferation of zzso cell line via negative and positive regulations of zzso and zzso , zzso The expression of zzso was noted to be markedly lowered in the zzso zzso and zzso cells, yet higher in the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso cell line was significantly inhibited after the zzso of zzso zzso while zzso inhibitor zzso exerted an opposite zzso zzso the zzso and protein levels of zzso were found significantly decreased in zzso cells after zzso of zzso zzso but obviously increased in zzso cells after zzso of zzso zzso As revealed by zzso a significant zzso of zzso was revealed after the zzso study using zzso zzso we suggest that zzso may act as a tumor zzso gene that zzso zzso cell proliferation by zzso the zzso zzso and zzso the tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso
