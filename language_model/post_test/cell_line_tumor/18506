The zzso zzso zzso zzso factor is an important regulator of tumor response to zzso that include increased zzso zzso zzso and resistance to zzso zzso activity is regulated by the availability of the zzso zzso the levels of which increase under hypoxic zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso is an inhibitor of zzso and zzso zzso levels and thus zzso zzso We report that zzso given to mice suppresses zzso levels in zzso human colon cancer zzso and zzso the expression of zzso target genes including vascular zzso growth factor and the zzso zzso zzso shows zzso activity against established zzso zzso human tumor zzso with cures of zzso small cell lung cancer and log cell kills up to zzso for other tumors including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso breast, zzso zzso and zzso pancreatic zzso Large zzso zzso zzso prostate tumors showed zzso regression, which was greater than for smaller zzso The zzso response to zzso was positively correlated with tumor zzso levels zzso zzso zzso and was accompanied by massive zzso The results show that zzso is an inhibitor of zzso and zzso zzso factor activity in human tumor zzso and has marked zzso activity against even large tumor zzso which zzso positively with zzso zzso
