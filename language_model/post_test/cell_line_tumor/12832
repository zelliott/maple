zzso growth factor zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso is a zzso coupled zzso with unknown zzso and cellular zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso is associated with poor zzso We investigated the expression patterns and functional significance of zzso in zzso using zzso western zzso reverse zzso zzso and small interfering zzso zzso in proliferation and invasion zzso zzso is zzso expressed in primary human zzso zzso and cell zzso zzso down zzso has no impact on cellular zzso but decreases cellular invasion by greater than zzso zzso is a potential zzso of cellular invasion in zzso Given the poor survival associated with high levels of zzso expression in zzso patients, our results provide impetus to explore zzso as a potential therapeutic zzso
