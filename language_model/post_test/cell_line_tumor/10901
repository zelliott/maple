zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso have been tested clinically as hypoxic cell zzso mainly outside zzso To determine if these zzso deserve clinical investigation in Japan, we reevaluated the zzso effects of these compounds in zzso and in zzso in comparison with a fluorinated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a known and established zzso but is not suitable for clinical studies because of the high cost of zzso In zzso the zzso effects of the three compounds on zzso zzso cell zzso line in zzso zzso tumor cells were examined at zzso and 1 zzso under zzso or hypoxic conditions, using a colony zzso In zzso zzso tumors grown zzso in the hind legs of zzso mice were zzso with or without prior zzso administration of 100, 200 or 400 zzso of the zzso zzso tumor growth delay was zzso In zzso no zzso effect was observed under zzso conditions at 1 zzso Under hypoxic conditions, the zzso enhancement ratio zzso determined at zzso cell survival level for zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso and zzso respectively, at 1 zzso and zzso zzso and zzso respectively, at zzso zzso In zzso all three compounds had significant zzso zzso their effects appeared to decrease in the order of zzso zzso and zzso It was suggested that zzso may be more suitable for clinical trials than zzso
