We found that zzso a potent zzso zzso zzso zzso markedly induced the formation of zzso zzso compartments in zzso zzso By zzso zzso zzso of live cells zzso fluorescent zzso zzso and other marker zzso it was shown that the zzso zzso in zzso cells were derived from zzso early zzso but not from late zzso recycling zzso zzso or the zzso zzso The formation of zzso zzso was very dynamic and required zzso zzso zzso were also formed by the treatment of cells with zzso zzso which zzso class III zzso rather than class I zzso Furthermore, the loss of zzso correlated with the zzso of zzso zzso in cells zzso fluorescent zzso zzso and a tandem zzso zzso These results suggest that the lowering of zzso as a result of class III zzso zzso may be an important cue for the zzso change of zzso early zzso from zzso to zzso zzso
