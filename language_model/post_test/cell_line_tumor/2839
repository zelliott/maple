zzso is a chief zzso of zzso cancer, which plays an important role in the biological behavior of zzso zzso Its zzso is an important factor of poor zzso The objective of this study was to investigate the treatment effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso cancer zzso cell zzso 

The zzso expression on zzso cell zzso was determined by zzso and then the aim was to zzso zzso into zzso cells and zzso the cellular growth zzso by zzso to observe the cellular zzso changes under transmission electron microscope zzso and to zzso the cellular zzso rate, zzso zzso and protein expression by flow zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso 

zzso protein was positively expressed on zzso cell zzso zzso showed that when the concentration of zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell growth zzso rates were zzso and zzso zzso After zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso cell zzso was obviously damaged, the cellular zzso rate was zzso and the zzso zzso and protein expression were zzso and zzso respectively, compared with those of the normal control zzso 

zzso zzso zzso can obviously suppress its zzso and protein expression in zzso cells, cause cellular zzso and inhibit cell zzso It may have an important role in the gene therapy of zzso zzso
