Conventional cancer treatments often have little impact on the course of advanced pancreatic zzso Although cancer gene therapy with zzso is a promising zzso approach, the primary zzso is poorly expressed in pancreatic zzso which might compromise efficacy and thus targeting to other receptors could be zzso zzso stealth delivery, combination with standard chemotherapy or zzso of host zzso immune response might improve efficacy zzso In this work, zzso zzso were studied for zzso of cell lines and clinical normal and tumor tissue zzso The respective zzso viruses were tested for zzso activity in zzso and in zzso Survival was studied in a zzso zzso zzso cancer model, with or without concurrent zzso while zzso implants were zzso for extended zzso virus zzso zzso mice and Syrian zzso were used to study the effect of zzso zzso delivery on zzso immune responses and subsequent in zzso gene zzso zzso modifications selectively enhanced gene transfer to zzso pancreatic cancer cell lines and clinical zzso The respective zzso viruses resulted in increased cell killing in zzso which translated into a survival benefit in zzso Early zzso zzso responses and formation of zzso zzso zzso was partially avoided with zzso zzso The implant also zzso the virus from pre-existing zzso zzso while increasing the zzso gene delivery ratio zzso In conclusion, zzso modified zzso would be useful for testing in pancreatic cancer zzso zzso implants might increase the safety and efficacy of the zzso
