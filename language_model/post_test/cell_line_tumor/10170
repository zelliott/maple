To understand the role of zzso zzso in the zzso of normal cellular prion protein zzso in zzso cells, zzso cells were depleted of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso via the zzso zzso zzso in the absence of zzso and the zzso zzso in the presence of zzso were measured in both control and zzso zzso zzso of zzso had almost no effect on the zzso of zzso either in the presence or absence of zzso in contrast to the marked reduction observed in zzso zzso By contrast, the zzso of zzso was inhibited by the zzso drugs zzso and zzso and by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both in the presence and absence of zzso The zzso zzso was found to zzso with cargo that traffic in the zzso zzso and in large zzso in cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso These results show that zzso is zzso in a zzso zzso that is associated with zzso
