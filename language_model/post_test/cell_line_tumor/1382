zzso zzso growth factor zzso is a major regulator in retinal and zzso zzso which are common causes of zzso in all age zzso Recently zzso treatment using zzso zzso has zzso improved the visual outcome in patients with zzso zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso as an zzso zzso could inhibit differentiation of zzso cells without affection to cellular zzso which would be zzso via blockade of zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso The zzso cells expressed zzso as well as zzso which is a zzso zzso associated with differentiation of zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells was activated with zzso zzso Interestingly even in the concentration of no cellular death, zzso significantly attenuated the zzso formation of differentiated zzso cells, which was accompanied by zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibited differentiation of zzso cells by blockade of zzso 1/2 zzso zzso based on that the differentiated zzso cells are mostly zzso our results suggest that zzso therapies would affect to the maintenance or function of zzso in mature zzso
