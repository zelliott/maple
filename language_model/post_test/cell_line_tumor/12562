zzso levels of zzso are associated with increased risk of cardiovascular disease, whereas low zzso can lead to a bleeding zzso We investigated whether zzso zzso known to act as zzso regulators of gene zzso regulate zzso zzso Using zzso of a library of 470 zzso human zzso precursor molecules in zzso zzso cells and quantitative zzso of zzso production, we identified 23 zzso with zzso (up to zzso zzso and 4 with zzso effects (up to zzso zzso on zzso zzso Among the zzso zzso we investigated the mechanism of action of 3 zzso family members and zzso zzso of zzso members led to decreased zzso levels of all zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso transcripts in zzso zzso zzso reporter gene zzso demonstrated that this was independent of zzso zzso region zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso specifically lowered zzso zzso zzso levels, and this effect was dependent on a target site in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This study adds to the known mechanisms that control zzso production, points toward a potential cause of variable circulating zzso levels, and demonstrates that a screening approach can identify zzso that regulate clinically important zzso
