zzso zzso zzso 4 was found to be expressed by many different types of human zzso and its expression has been correlated with tumor zzso poor prognosis and resistance to zzso However the effect of zzso on the zzso zzso cells remains zzso the present study explored the effects of zzso zzso on proliferation and invasion of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Two zzso sequence targeting zzso gene were constructed and then were zzso into zzso and zzso cells by zzso Changes of zzso zzso and protein were analyzed by zzso and Western zzso Effect of zzso zzso on zzso and zzso cells proliferation was determined by zzso zzso invasion zzso was used to evaluate the invasion and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso growth was assessed by subcutaneous zzso of cells into zzso nude zzso zzso and Western zzso demonstrate that the expression level of zzso gene were obviously decreased in zzso and zzso cells zzso with zzso targeting zzso expression zzso The average amount of cells zzso with zzso zzso penetrating zzso was significantly decreased ( zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells inhibited tumor growth in a zzso model compared with blank and negative control groups zzso zzso zzso silenced by zzso could suppress the zzso invasion and zzso of zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso in zzso and in zzso The results provide a theoretical and experimental basis for the gene therapy of zzso using zzso technology based on zzso target zzso
