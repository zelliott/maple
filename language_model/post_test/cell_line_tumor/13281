The zzso gene is an important member of the zzso zzso zzso As a newly identified zzso the expression of zzso has been shown to be significantly increased in prostate cancer, breast cancer, zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso however, a role for zzso in the occurrence of zzso has not yet been zzso In this study, we found that the zzso gene is highly expressed in zzso human zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we demonstrated that the zzso of zzso expression in zzso human zzso cells resulted in zzso and a cell cycle arrest in the zzso zzso In addition, we found that zzso of the zzso gene altered the zzso membrane potential and promoted the release of zzso from the zzso Furthermore, the reduced expression of zzso altered the zzso and zzso protein levels and led to the zzso of zzso 9 and zzso These results indicate that the zzso induced in zzso human zzso cells by the zzso of the zzso gene is related to the zzso zzso
