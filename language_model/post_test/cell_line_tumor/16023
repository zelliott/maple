The current treatment strategies, chemotherapy and radiation therapy being used for the management of cancer are deficient in targeted approach leading to treatment related zzso and zzso zzso fusion toxins exhibit remarkable tumor specificity thus emerging as an alternative therapy for the treatment of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a fusion toxin designed to target the head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso The aim of this study was to zzso zzso and evaluate the zzso and specificity of zzso fusion toxin against the zzso zzso The zzso zzso fusion toxin was characterized by zzso and western zzso zzso of zzso fusion toxins was monitored by zzso zzso and circular zzso zzso The activity of zzso fusion toxin was demonstrated on various zzso cell lines by cell viability zzso cell proliferation zzso protein synthesis zzso zzso zzso and cell cycle zzso The fusion toxin zzso demonstrated remarkably high degree of zzso specific to the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso fusion toxin was zzso to 5 zzso in all the three zzso cell zzso The percentage zzso cells in zzso treated zzso cells are zzso compared to zzso in zzso To further demonstrate the specific toxicity of zzso fusion toxin towards the zzso cells we constructed, characterized and evaluated the efficacy of zzso zzso The zzso protein coding for only a zzso of diphtheria toxin without its native zzso binding domain failed to exhibit any zzso on all the cell lines used in this study thus establishing the importance of a zzso in achieving targeted zzso To evaluate the zzso ability of zzso zzso an additional construct zzso was constructed, characterized and evaluated for its zzso zzso The fusion toxin zzso deficient of the zzso domain of diphtheria toxin showed no zzso on all the cell lines clearly indicating the inability of zzso zzso to zzso zzso domain of the toxin into the zzso
