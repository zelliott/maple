zzso zzso is one of the most common zzso in the female zzso zzso usually treated by surgery and zzso zzso is used when zzso zzso is associated with widespread zzso or when the tumor zzso after radiation zzso In the present study, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso reduces cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell death in zzso zzso cell lines, which is not due to its action through the most known targets like zzso nor through zzso as demonstrated in this zzso Interestingly, zzso reduces zzso zzso activity either at zzso level or zzso by zzso or zzso We observed that zzso was able to inhibit the zzso zzso zzso activity which zzso with a decrease of the zzso levels of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso We evaluated the nature of the interaction between zzso and zzso by the dose effect method and identified a synergistic effect zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso zzso zzso delivery in zzso treated cells leads to a strongly increased sensitivity to zzso zzso cell zzso zzso our results suggest that the combination of zzso and zzso could be considered a promising treatment for zzso zzso after failure of surgery and zzso
