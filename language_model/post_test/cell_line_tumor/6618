zzso and zzso zzso cells are shown to express and zzso various zzso and zzso some of which are believed to play an important role in normal and abnormal zzso in an zzso zzso To explore the possibility of a zzso network participating in the zzso of anemic disorders, we evaluated the ability of inflammatory zzso to induce zzso expression using zzso zzso zzso 

zzso human leukemia cell line zzso was used as a model of zzso zzso unit zzso zzso The expression of zzso of 8 zzso was examined using zzso before and after zzso zzso and zzso zzso For zzso the promoter activity was analyzed by zzso zzso and zzso was confirmed by zzso The expression of zzso the specific zzso for zzso was analyzed by zzso and flow zzso 

zzso zzso cells zzso expressed transcripts for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and induced its protein zzso zzso zzso revealed that these zzso could zzso promoter activity of the zzso zzso possibly through the zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected and its zzso expression was zzso 

These data suggest that inflammatory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which may function in an zzso zzso Furthermore, the existence of zzso zzso suggests the involvement in zzso signaling of a zzso internal zzso zzso These mechanisms may play a role in zzso of anemic disorders, such as secondary anemia and bone zzso failure zzso
