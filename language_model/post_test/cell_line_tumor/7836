We previously demonstrated the gene expression of two growth hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso in prostate cancer zzso patient zzso and human zzso cell zzso In that initial study, we characterized zzso cell zzso binding characteristics to zzso and its zzso of relevant signal zzso zzso We now show that zzso binding to zzso and zzso zzso expression in the cell lines studied are zzso zzso In the zzso zzso cells, the zzso specific and stable zzso zzso zzso caused a zzso and zzso zzso stimulation of zzso specific binding to cells cultured in zzso medium zzso however, when zzso cells were grown in chemically defined zzso full zzso long-term zzso zzso was zzso This effect of zzso on the zzso response was zzso by the zzso zzso contained in zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso and zzso all caused stimulation of zzso zzso Furthermore, we also observed zzso and zzso zzso and zzso regulation of zzso zzso expression in all three cell zzso In zzso cells, zzso caused stimulation of both zzso zzso and of its zzso zzso zzso zzso however, zzso zzso and zzso all zzso zzso zzso more zzso than they did zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso but almost not zzso while in contrast, in zzso zzso cells, zzso caused a clear reduction in zzso and less so in zzso The differential regulation of zzso zzso gene expression in human zzso cell lines and of zzso functional capacity zzso zzso by hormones and growth factors relevant to disease zzso suggests that zzso may prove to be an additional therapeutic target to slow zzso progression of human prostate zzso
