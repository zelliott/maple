Because of its ability to mimic a low energy status of the cell, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was proposed as an zzso agent switching off major zzso processes associated with the zzso zzso zzso production, DNA zzso cell zzso cell migration, zzso Key to the zzso action of zzso zzso is its conversion to zzso an zzso zzso that at high zzso activates the zzso protein zzso zzso Here, in an attempt to increase the efficacy of zzso zzso we zzso cancer cells with methotrexate, an zzso blocking the metabolism of zzso zzso enhanced the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and led to a decrease in the levels of zzso which functions as an zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso markedly zzso zzso for zzso by zzso zzso and zzso the zzso effects of zzso zzso on zzso zzso As zzso zzso zzso effects already at zzso of compounds that were only marginally effective when used alone, our findings on the cooperation between zzso and zzso zzso provide new opportunities both for the application of classic zzso zzso such as methotrexate, and for the exploitation of the zzso machinery as a target for cancer zzso
