We obtained a global view of gene expression in both cell lines and pediatric acute zzso leukemia zzso samples that harbor one of several selected zzso zzso When the cell lines were studied alone, we found that these zzso abnormalities were associated with the zzso variation in zzso programs across the set of cell lines zzso When cell lines and clinical samples were studied together, we found that each zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso was associated with a characteristic gene expression signature that was shared by both cell lines and clinical zzso However, zzso was associated with a much more zzso pattern of expression than were zzso and zzso zzso This observation has important implications for the study of zzso zzso In addition, we systematically identified genes whose expression was associated with zzso zzso or zzso abnormalities in both clinical samples and cell zzso Although some of these genes have previously been zzso many have not previously been reported to be associated with one of these zzso zzso zzso we found that the zzso zzso zzso is consistently highly expressed in zzso ALL compared with zzso or zzso
