zzso cancer is a zzso disease with high zzso despite progress in surgical and zzso treatments in recent zzso The field is hampered by a lack of good zzso and zzso zzso zzso to be used during follow-up of zzso 

The circulating level of type IV collagen was measured by zzso in zzso cancer patients and zzso The expression pattern of type IV collagen in normal zzso zzso cancer tissue and in zzso cancer cell lines was studied by zzso and Western zzso zzso 

Patients with zzso cancer have significantly increased circulating levels of type IV zzso In zzso cancer tissue high levels of type IV collagen expression was found in close proximity to cancer cells in the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso cancer cells were found to produce and zzso type IV collagen in zzso which in part can explain the high type IV collagen expression observed in zzso cancer zzso and the increased circulating levels in zzso cancer zzso Of clinical importance, our results show that the circulating level of type IV collagen after surgery is strongly related to prognosis in patients treated for zzso cancer by zzso with zzso zzso zzso high levels of circulating type IV collagen after surgery indicates a quick zzso in disease and poor zzso 

Our results most zzso show that zzso related substances can be evaluated as potential cancer zzso and thereby underline the importance of the zzso zzso also in this zzso
