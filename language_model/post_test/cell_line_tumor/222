zzso zzso zzso zzso are emerging as an exciting new class of potential zzso agents for the treatment of solid and zzso zzso However, the best characterized zzso function concerns the control of gene expression via the regulation of zzso zzso or zzso To understand the zzso effects of zzso zzso on gene regulation, we performed serial gene expression analyses from 0 to 48 h after treating zzso a zzso highly zzso tumor cell line, with zzso a zzso zzso zzso analysis of large-scale molecular changes induced by zzso resulted in the identification of zzso zzso genes that were continuously zzso or zzso during the 48 h study zzso When the zzso zzso genes were mapped to known biological zzso zzso suppression emerged as the function most zzso by zzso In addition comprehensive negative zzso regulation by zzso was dissected using gene expression data and validated by Western zzso zzso We suggest the zzso zzso genes as a characteristic molecular signature for zzso and propose concurrent zzso suppression of major components of zzso regulatory circuit as potent zzso mechanism of zzso zzso elements identified during this study also provide the possibility of novel therapeutic interventions in tumor zzso
