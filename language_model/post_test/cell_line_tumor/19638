zzso cells, selected specifically for invasive characteristics from zzso mouse melanoma cells, displayed greater ability to zzso to lungs and produced larger colonies than the parent cells, when injected zzso When the two cell lines were compared for surface zzso zzso by flow zzso using zzso zzso were found to express significantly higher zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by treatment of the cells with zzso or zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso and invasion zzso Further, zzso of zzso on the molecules like zzso zzso (one of the major zzso caused zzso reduction in their adherence to zzso components especially collagen IV and zzso and zzso towards zzso and zzso The zzso also decreased zzso by approximately 50% to zzso but surprisingly was enhanced towards zzso by approximately zzso The cells on which the expression of these zzso was inhibited failed to exhibit the characteristic spontaneous zzso and zzso properties of zzso zzso In none of the cases, however, the zzso of zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso of surface zzso was found to be accompanied by even higher zzso and adherence to the zzso These results strongly support an important role of cell surface zzso zzso especially the zzso zzso in the processes that influence invasion and zzso
