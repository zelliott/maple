Cancer cells zzso metabolize zzso through zzso zzso This phenomenon, known as the Warburg effect, is an anomalous characteristic of zzso metabolism in cancer zzso zzso inflammation is a key promoting factor of zzso It remains, however, largely unexplored whether and how zzso inflammation regulates zzso metabolism in cancer zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso promote zzso in breast cancer cells, and that the zzso zzso functions as an important zzso in this zzso We further show that zzso acts to zzso zzso 2 zzso through two distinct zzso First, zzso promotes zzso zzso by zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso a zzso zzso for zzso Second, via targeting zzso (a zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso a negative regulator of zzso thus resulting in zzso of zzso expression at the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso also appears to operate in other types of cancer cells zzso We suggest that the zzso axis may represent a common mechanism linking inflammation to the altered metabolism in cancer zzso
