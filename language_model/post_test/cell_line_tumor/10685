zzso impacts the zzso of several genes involved in biological behavior of human zzso including zzso zzso zzso We found zzso is highly expressed in zzso of surgically zzso zzso specimens by zzso which correlated with advanced zzso staging zzso zzso zzso vascular invasion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and shortened overall survival zzso zzso zzso In zzso study, knocking down of zzso expression in zzso cells recovered zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of beta zzso into the zzso decreased zzso D1 activity and suppressed the zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, suppression of zzso led to zzso of zzso transition zzso molecules such as zzso Twist and zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso contributes to the zzso progression of zzso
