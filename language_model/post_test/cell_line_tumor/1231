The zzso class II zzso zzso zzso linked with zzso was expressed in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso and zzso injection zzso active and adoptive transfer zzso experimental zzso zzso zzso in Lewis zzso Spinal zzso of animals with zzso showed significant increase of zzso zzso at maximum of disease after injection of zzso but not of zzso or zzso zzso The data demonstrate a possible therapeutic effect on zzso by provision of zzso zzso zzso and zzso signals by genetically engineered zzso presenting cells zzso and suggest induction of zzso zzso as important mechanism of zzso
