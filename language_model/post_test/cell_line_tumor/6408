zzso zzso are one of the most devastating and incurable zzso zzso excessive zzso by zzso cells is the major reason for their uncontrolled growth and resistance toward conventional therapies resulting in high zzso zzso targeting zzso should be a logical strategy to prevent or control zzso cell zzso Earlier studies have shown that zzso Acid zzso a zzso zzso is effective against zzso and other cancer zzso however, its efficacy against zzso remains zzso In the present study, we examined the zzso efficacy of zzso using human zzso vein zzso cells zzso and human brain zzso zzso cells zzso Our results showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth and zzso zzso cell death by zzso zzso (3 and 9) and modulating the expression of zzso regulators zzso zzso and zzso Further, zzso showed a zzso zzso of zzso migration, invasion and zzso tube formation, and disintegrated zzso zzso zzso zzso also inhibited the zzso growth and zzso tube formation by zzso and zzso Next, we analyzed the zzso potential of zzso media collected from human zzso zzso and zzso cells treated with either zzso zzso zzso media, zzso or zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso media, zzso zzso from zzso cells significantly enhanced the zzso tube formation in both zzso and zzso while zzso tube formation in both zzso cell lines was greatly compromised in the presence of zzso zzso with these results, zzso expression was lesser in zzso compared to zzso and indeed zzso strongly inhibited zzso level (both cellular and zzso in zzso zzso zzso also showed zzso zzso efficacy in zzso plug zzso and inhibited the zzso cells potential to attract zzso Overall, the present study clearly showed the strong zzso potential of zzso and suggests its usefulness against zzso zzso
