zzso is found in extracts of the root of Angelica zzso used in Korea and China as a traditional medicine to treat zzso headache and zzso As zzso can inhibit the effects of sex hormones, it may increase the zzso of zzso zzso zzso this study investigated the effects of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in human zzso 

zzso of human zzso and a zzso cell line zzso zzso were zzso zzso and protein levels were measured by quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction and Western zzso zzso zzso and zzso were prepared by cloning and zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was determined by transient zzso zzso 

In human primary zzso zzso markedly induced the expression of zzso both at the zzso level zzso zzso and the protein level zzso zzso but did not affect expression of human zzso X zzso zzso In reporter zzso zzso activated zzso promoter in a zzso manner zzso zzso 5 zzso and this zzso was enhanced by zzso with zzso Further reporter zzso demonstrated that the zzso binding element in the zzso promoter was required for the zzso zzso of zzso by zzso 

zzso induced expression and activity of zzso in human zzso This induction was achieved by the zzso of zzso and not by increased expression of zzso zzso zzso is likely to increase the expression of all zzso target genes (such as zzso and induce a wide range of zzso zzso
