The inability to successfully treat women with zzso cancer is due in large part to the advanced stage of disease at diagnosis, the development of platinum resistance, and the lack of sensitive methods to monitor tumor progression and response to zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso is expressed on the zzso of zzso cancer zzso We investigated zzso expression as a marker of zzso zzso and tumor response to zzso zzso 

zzso or zzso zzso obtained from women diagnosed with stage I, stage II, or stage zzso zzso cancer were evaluated by zzso The effects of zzso on zzso zzso expression were determined in cultured cells by Western zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso and zzso were used in a mouse model of zzso cancer zzso zzso to identify zzso as a viable imaging zzso 

zzso expression correlated with tumor zzso All specimens from stage I patients were negative, whereas zzso of stage II patients and zzso of stage zzso patients were zzso Although most women with advanced stage disease expressed zzso the zzso of expression was reduced among women who received zzso chemotherapy, suggesting a role for chemotherapy in regulating zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells in culture with zzso resulted in a transient decrease in zzso expression 4 h after treatment that returned to baseline within zzso zzso In zzso imaging of zzso also demonstrated an acute decrease in expression 4 h after zzso administration that recovered within 48 h in mice harboring zzso zzso zzso zzso expression reflected the effect of zzso treatment on tumor zzso Specifically, zzso treatment of mice with zzso tumors showed reduced zzso zzso which correlated with reduced tumor zzso mice with zzso tumors retained elevated zzso expression and tumor burden after zzso 

zzso relevant zzso imaging zzso identify zzso expression as an indicator of zzso cancer zzso zzso and therapeutic response to zzso zzso These observations support testing the utility of zzso imaging zzso to monitor treatment response in zzso cancer patients, thus providing the potential to improve management of women with this zzso
