Recent results from clinical trials with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have shown encouraging response zzso however, the duration of response has been zzso To identify zzso of acquired resistance to zzso and strategies to overcome the resistance, we isolated zzso drug-resistant clones from the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso melanoma cell zzso These clones also showed reduced sensitivity to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso characterization of these clones identified an zzso deletion in zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso with and without zzso in the zzso background and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with short hairpin zzso partially restored zzso sensitivity in zzso zzso zzso whereas expression of zzso or zzso in the zzso parental cells decreased sensitivity to zzso Similarly, expression of zzso but not zzso decreased sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso The combination of zzso and zzso effectively inhibited cell growth, decreased zzso zzso decreased zzso D1 zzso and increased zzso protein in the resistant zzso Moreover, the combination of zzso or zzso with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso enhanced cell growth zzso and decreased zzso zzso protein zzso in these zzso Our results show that zzso and/or zzso zzso contribute to zzso inhibitor resistance in zzso and the combination of zzso and zzso overcomes this zzso In addition, these resistant clones respond to the combination of zzso with zzso or zzso Clinical trials are ongoing or planned to test these zzso
