Human zzso zzso in breast zzso zzso is a nuclear protein that, in response to DNA damage, competitively zzso the zzso zzso zzso a regulator of zzso zzso functions in response to zzso zzso zzso depletion in human cells increases zzso activity, resulting in the zzso of zzso and protection from zzso However, the mechanisms regulating this process have not yet been zzso Here, we report that, in human cell lines, DNA damage triggered the zzso of zzso on zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso bound to and inhibited zzso resulting in the zzso of the zzso complex and stimulating zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso Indeed, zzso zzso which was shown in zzso experiments to be dependent on zzso and zzso zzso was defective in cells expressing the zzso zzso This study describes the first zzso modification of zzso and provides new zzso insight linking zzso to the zzso zzso axis triggered by DNA zzso
