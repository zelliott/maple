The zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso have been described in several types of zzso However, their effects on human lung cancer cells and the mechanisms are zzso In addition, the interaction between zzso and other zzso remains zzso The interplay between zzso and zzso has been zzso However, although zzso is a well-known regulatory zzso the mechanisms through which it regulates zzso in lung cancer cells are zzso These issues are critical for the application of zzso in lung cancer zzso In this study, we used zzso a cell line derived from a human lung zzso to characterize the zzso and zzso effects of zzso on lung cancer, and the interplay between zzso and zzso Because zzso of full-length zzso zzso led to cell death, we generated zzso cells zzso expressing a zzso zzso zzso which is composed of the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso fused in tandem to the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso By comparing with zzso cells zzso expressing its zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso stimulation triggered the zzso zzso signaling via zzso zzso By using zzso cells expressing zzso we report that the zzso chain of zzso zzso possesses an intrinsic ability to trigger zzso in human lung cancer zzso Although it did not suppress cell zzso zzso signaling via zzso zzso induced cell cycle arrest, zzso of zzso DNA zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso However, the zzso inhibitor zzso did not prevent zzso In addition, the extent of induced zzso correlate with the expression levels of the zzso zzso and the levels of zzso zzso Lastly, we demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso via zzso of zzso These data indicate the potential of zzso alone or in combination with zzso in the treatment of human lung zzso
