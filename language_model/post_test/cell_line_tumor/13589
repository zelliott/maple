The objective of this study was to examine the expression levels of zzso zzso factor zzso and class III zzso zzso in zzso cancer and to determine if there is a correlation between their expression and resistance to chemotherapy in zzso zzso The protein expression of zzso and zzso in zzso cancer was detected by Western zzso zzso zzso expression was inhibited by small interfering zzso acid zzso in human zzso cancer cell zzso The levels of zzso and zzso protein expression were detected by zzso The relationship between zzso and zzso expression and chemotherapy resistance, zzso zzso and prognosis of zzso cancer was then zzso The present study found that zzso was more highly expressed in the zzso zzso zzso cell line compared to the zzso zzso cancer cell line, zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso was more highly expressed in zzso cells compared to zzso cells zzso zzso zzso After zzso zzso zzso zzso expression increased in zzso zzso zzso expression was significantly higher in the zzso group compared to the zzso group zzso % zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso However, zzso expression was significantly lower in the zzso group compared to the zzso group zzso % zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso was more highly expressed in zzso cases than zzso cases zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated that both zzso and zzso expression were unrelated to tumor zzso zzso type, and clinical stage (all P zzso zzso According to the Cox zzso model, negative zzso and positive zzso protein expression was detected as independent zzso factors zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein may be potential zzso for zzso and prognosis in zzso zzso
