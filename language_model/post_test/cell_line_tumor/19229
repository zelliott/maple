We previously showed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can protect prostate cancer cells from zzso induced by zzso drugs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 25, zzso To further explore the mechanisms of zzso resistance to zzso drugs in prostate cancer cells, we employed a zzso zzso screening to identify cellular proteins that were associated with zzso and we found the ABC zzso zzso as one of the potential interacting partners of zzso We also showed that the expression level of zzso and zzso was zzso in zzso and zzso prostate cancer cell zzso zzso was zzso with zzso on the plasma membrane and induced zzso of zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in the drug-resistant prostate cancer cells abolished zzso formation of zzso zzso and zzso the resistant cells to zzso drugs suggesting that zzso zzso induced by zzso was essential for its zzso This is further zzso by our finding that the plasma membrane zzso and drug-resistant activity of zzso were compromised by zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso may protect prostate cancer cells from zzso at least in part, through regulation of zzso drug zzso zzso These findings may provide a potential therapeutic approach by zzso zzso signaling to reverse zzso zzso zzso
