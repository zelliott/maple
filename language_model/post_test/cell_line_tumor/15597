Previously, we showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the growth of acute zzso leukemia and zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso cell zzso cells with zzso of about zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a zzso or a zzso phase arrest in these zzso When we examined the effects of this drug on zzso cells, zzso decreased the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso A and zzso B1 zzso zzso and zzso proteins were increased by zzso In addition, zzso markedly enhanced the binding of zzso with zzso and the binding of zzso with zzso Furthermore, the activities of zzso and zzso zzso were reduced in association with zzso of zzso zzso zzso also induced the zzso in several zzso cell zzso zzso zzso process of zzso cells was associated with the changes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins as well as zzso zzso potential zzso zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate for the first time that zzso zzso the growth of zzso cell zzso cells via cell cycle arrest or zzso
