The efficacy of zzso therapy zzso depends upon the delivery of both zzso drug and zzso In this study, we hypothesized that local vascular zzso is a zzso of tumor response to zzso zzso zzso and its basement membrane zzso were studied as a function of supplementation with basement membrane zzso zzso at the time of tumor cell zzso zzso on vascular composition with consequences to tumor zzso zzso zzso and zzso response were zzso zzso tumors developed more zzso zzso composed of smaller and more zzso spaced blood vessels than their zzso counterparts, but these changes did not affect tumor zzso or zzso direct zzso However, zzso vascular damage increased in zzso tumors, following an affinity of the zzso zzso for zzso vascular basement membrane coupled with increased collagen content in these zzso The more highly zzso tumors showed more vascular congestion and zzso after zzso along with a higher probability of zzso outcome that was collagen zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso effects on collagen were evidenced by a decrease in its association with zzso Together, our findings show that zzso zzso to collagen increases vascular damage and improves treatment efficacy in tumors with greater collagen zzso The vascular basement membrane is thus identified to be a zzso of therapeutic outcome in zzso of zzso
