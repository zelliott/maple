In this study, zzso extracts from 18 seaweed zzso were assessed for zzso activity against zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Only one of these, zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the brown algae, exhibited promising zzso zzso zzso zzso of the active zzso zzso zzso soluble fraction obtained from the zzso extract of zzso zzso resulted in the isolation of several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso and zzso zzso zzso 2 and 4 were determined to protect zzso zzso cells against the zzso effects of zzso with zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso a well characterized zzso agent, was used as a positive control, and exhibited an zzso value of zzso zzso It has been suggested that the zzso derived from marine brown algae might prove useful sources in the development of novel zzso zzso
