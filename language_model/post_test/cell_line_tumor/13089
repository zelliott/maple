The Ras association domain family zzso encodes for distinct tumor zzso and several members are frequently silenced in human zzso In our study, we analyzed the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso island promoters in zzso tumors was zzso zzso was zzso in zzso of zzso cancer cell lines and in zzso of primary zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly increased in primary zzso zzso compared to normal zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso p zzso zzso Patients which were older than 60 years were significantly zzso for zzso in their primary zzso tumors compared to those younger than 40 years zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso correlated with its reduced expression and treatment with a DNA zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso reduced colony formation of zzso cancer zzso zzso our data show that zzso interacts with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cancer cell zzso zzso of the zzso interaction domain of zzso reduced zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso 

These results suggest that zzso encodes a novel zzso zzso candidate tumor zzso gene in zzso zzso
