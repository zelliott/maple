The zzso are a class of zzso zzso I zzso that offer certain advantages over the zzso including the greater zzso of the compounds themselves, as well as the greater zzso of their zzso zzso zzso To investigate the possible biological roles of the zzso and zzso zzso present on the aromatic rings of the previously zzso zzso zzso I zzso a series of compounds lacking these zzso was zzso and tested for both zzso in cancer cell cultures and for zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that the aromatic zzso make a small, but consistently zzso contribution to the biological zzso zzso models derived for the binding of the zzso zzso in zzso complex with DNA and zzso I indicate that the zzso on the zzso nitrogen project out of the major groove, and the zzso group is directed out of the minor groove, where it is involved in a hydrogen bonding interaction with the side chain zzso group of zzso The DNA zzso patterns observed in the presence of zzso I and various zzso were similar, although significant differences were zzso There were also variations in the DNA zzso pattern seen with zzso vs the zzso which indicates that these two classes of zzso I zzso are likely to target the cancer cell zzso differently, resulting in different zzso of zzso zzso The most zzso of the presently zzso zzso has a zzso group on the zzso zzso
