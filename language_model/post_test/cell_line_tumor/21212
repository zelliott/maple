zzso is an imprinted gene which is zzso in zzso zzso zzso However, the mechanism of zzso regulation remains to be zzso In this work the zzso factors zzso and zzso were demonstrated to bind directly to the promoter of zzso and thereby regulate its zzso The expression profile of zzso zzso also suggested zzso were involved in zzso zzso Further functional analysis showed that zzso was involved in the repression of zzso induced by serum deprivation and zzso zzso These findings link cancer zzso and zzso by showing that zzso acts directly upstream of an zzso imprinted zzso zzso
