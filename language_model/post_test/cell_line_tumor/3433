zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso family and a potent zzso of zzso TRAIL has been shown to effectively limit tumor growth in zzso without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso often zzso the zzso activities of zzso family members including zzso However, little is known about the zzso To explore the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells were zzso with zzso and then exposed to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in all these cell zzso zzso cells were selected and further characterized for zzso action in zzso zzso Western zzso analyses revealed that zzso dramatically increased the protein levels of zzso regulatory factor zzso but not TRAIL receptors zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso To zzso the functional role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso was first zzso by using an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso minimally increased zzso cell death, but significantly enhanced zzso cell death induced by TRAIL when infected cells were treated with zzso In further experiments using an zzso zzso a specific repression of zzso expression abolished zzso activity of zzso for zzso zzso zzso our data indicate that zzso enhances zzso zzso through zzso
