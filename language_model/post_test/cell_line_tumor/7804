The zzso virus zzso zzso protein is an essential replication protein acting at viral replication zzso as a viral DNA zzso zzso factor, whereas the zzso protein is a zzso zzso protein that also acts at replication zzso and is most abundantly expressed during viral productive zzso Here we document that the zzso protein evidently enhances viral zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso demonstrated the zzso promoter to harbor two zzso zzso sites zzso zzso zzso binding of the zzso protein to zzso elements and physical interaction between zzso and zzso proteins are prerequisite for the zzso protein zzso of the zzso gene zzso A zzso zzso zzso which is defective in zzso could still interact and enhance zzso zzso zzso although zzso protein zzso zzso zzso protein zzso it turned out that zzso of the protein by the zzso is zzso to the enhancement of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso protein zzso zzso expression in zzso cells harboring the zzso zzso but lacking zzso and zzso zzso demonstrating functions as a zzso regulator in the context of viral zzso zzso the zzso protein is a zzso protein that cannot only act as a DNA zzso zzso factor but also enhances zzso promoter zzso as a zzso for the zzso zzso regulating the expression level of viral zzso zzso zzso
