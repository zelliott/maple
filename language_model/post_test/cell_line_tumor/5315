zzso zzso V regions undergo zzso zzso zzso zzso diversification in sequence to produce either zzso or zzso zzso in the related pathways of zzso zzso and gene zzso In chicken zzso B cells, gene conversion normally zzso producing zzso zzso by adjacent zzso regions, but impairment of gene conversion switches zzso to a zzso zzso We recently showed that the zzso zzso functions in zzso to promote diversification, and that zzso phase of cell cycle is the critical window for zzso zzso By zzso imaging of stable zzso fluorescent protein zzso we now demonstrate that zzso fluorescent protein can zzso zzso to the nucleus in zzso phase, but zzso zzso zzso later in cell zzso By imaging of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, in which zzso zzso operator tags the rearranged zzso zzso we show that both the repair zzso zzso and the zzso factor zzso zzso to zzso and that zzso zzso occur predominately in zzso phase, when they reflect repair of zzso zzso We find no evidence of induction of zzso the zzso zzso zzso that is a marker of zzso breaks, and zzso gene conversion may therefore proceed by a zzso involving zzso repair at DNA nicks rather than zzso zzso These results lead to a model in which zzso gene conversion zzso and is completed or nearly completed in zzso zzso AID zzso zzso and restriction of zzso to zzso phase would contribute to protecting the zzso from zzso attack by AID when DNA replication occurs in S zzso
