C1 zzso the recognition motif of the second zzso zzso and of the zzso zzso are classified as typical zzso or zzso (not zzso The C1 domain of zzso a zzso zzso exchange factor, plays a critical role in regulation of zzso activity through stabilization of the zzso zzso domain, which is responsible for exchange activity of zzso Although the C1 domain of zzso is classified as zzso it retains a binding pocket geometry zzso to that of the typical C1 zzso of zzso This study zzso the basis for its failure to bind zzso Substituting zzso zzso into the zzso domain of zzso we identified five crucial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso along the rim of the binding zzso that weaken binding potency in a cumulative zzso zzso replacing these incompatible zzso in the zzso C1 domain with the corresponding zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso high potency for zzso zzso zzso Computer modeling predicts that these unique zzso in zzso increase the zzso of the rim of the binding pocket, zzso membrane association and thereby preventing formation of the zzso zzso binding zzso The initial design of zzso to exploit these zzso unique zzso showed enhanced selectivity for C1 zzso incorporating these zzso suggesting a strategy for the development of zzso targeting zzso
