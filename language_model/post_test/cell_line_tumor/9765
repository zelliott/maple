There is accumulating evidence that the patterns of altered expression of zzso zzso correlate with distinct types of zzso zzso There is also emerging evidence for such zzso expression in multiple myeloma zzso but the identity of the zzso that are zzso expressed in this disease has not been zzso In the current study, we examined the zzso zzso in zzso positive zzso cell lines and zzso positive primary zzso cells, using zzso analysis and quantitative real-time zzso The expression levels in these cells were compared with the expression levels in zzso positive plasma cells isolated from bone zzso of healthy zzso Our data demonstrate that multiple new zzso are commonly zzso and zzso including a new zzso zzso zzso composed of two zzso that were significantly zzso in zzso The organization and the sequences of the new zzso cluster are highly zzso among zzso Given that zzso of zzso cluster has not been identified in other zzso zzso examined to date, our findings suggest that zzso cluster is part of the unique zzso signature in zzso
