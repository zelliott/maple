zzso a natural zzso is a zzso which is known to be zzso but lacking in mechanical zzso In this work, to further enhance the mechanical property and zzso of zzso we combined it with both zzso zzso a natural zzso found in bone, and zzso The composite scaffold of zzso zzso was zzso by zzso The zzso scaffold showed enhanced zzso degradation, mechanical integrity, zzso and protein zzso zzso and cell zzso studies performed using zzso cells, advocate its better performance in zzso To improve the cell seeding efficiency, we coated the scaffold surface with zzso which enhanced the initial cell zzso The cumulative results suggest this novel zzso scaffold to be a suitable candidate for bone tissue zzso
