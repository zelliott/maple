zzso has been implicated in the invasive zzso of various zzso However, its role in zzso cancer remains to be zzso including its upstream regulatory zzso In the present study, we examined the differential expression of zzso in 10 normal zzso zzso and 17 paired primary and corresponding zzso zzso cancer zzso by zzso zzso It was found that zzso expression was remarkably increased in both primary and zzso zzso cancer zzso relative to normal zzso zzso zzso study revealed that zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso cells lead to reduced cell migration and invasion, and growth zzso without significantly affecting cell zzso zzso regulatory study further confirmed the negative regulatory effects of zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso Taken together, our data suggested that zzso may be involved in the aggressive behavior of zzso cancer, and differential expression profiles of zzso zzso may contribute to the zzso of zzso zzso which contributes to the zzso migratory and viability properties of zzso cancer zzso
