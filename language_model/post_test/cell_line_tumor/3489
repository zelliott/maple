Cell proliferation is regulated by zzso which zzso expression of genes involved in entry into zzso zzso of zzso from binding partners, zzso zzso is critical for zzso zzso However zzso zzso zzso activates zzso and zzso zzso Previously, the zzso zzso protein was found to bind to zzso and inhibit zzso zzso zzso 

zzso deletion zzso were zzso for: in zzso binding to zzso zzso of zzso promoter zzso and effects on cell zzso Two zzso species with specific binding to zzso and zzso were analyzed for their effects on zzso binding and cell zzso 

The zzso 72 zzso acids of zzso were involved in zzso zzso zzso of promoter zzso by zzso and reversal of zzso growth zzso The zzso species disrupted zzso interaction and affected cell zzso 

zzso interaction has a role in the control of cell zzso
