It is hypothesized that zzso drugs regulate breast cancer resistance protein zzso zzso zzso we examined the effects of zzso and zzso on zzso expression in zzso zzso For evaluation of zzso zzso zzso relative quantitative zzso and comparative C1 method was zzso zzso protein expression was measured flow zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a zzso and a zzso effect on decreasing the zzso level of zzso gene in comparison with control in zzso and zzso breast cancer cell lines, whereas no changes were noted in the presence of zzso The level of zzso zzso expressed as a ratio of the corresponding control, was decreased in zzso zzso zzso These results could be of great importance when combination therapy protocols with zzso agents and zzso regimens are considered in breast cancer zzso
