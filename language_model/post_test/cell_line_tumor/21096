The zzso protein of Japanese encephalitis virus zzso contains a single potential zzso zzso site, zzso which is highly zzso among zzso strains and closely related zzso To investigate the role of this site in zzso replication and zzso we manipulated the zzso zzso by using infectious zzso zzso to generate three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso substituting for zzso and/or zzso and one zzso with silent point zzso introduced into the zzso sequences corresponding to all three zzso in the zzso zzso An analysis of these zzso in the presence or absence of zzso confirmed the addition of zzso to this potential zzso zzso The loss of zzso N zzso without significantly altering the zzso levels of viral zzso and zzso led to an approximately zzso reduction in the production of zzso zzso which had protein compositions and zzso nearly identical to those of zzso zzso this reduction occurred at the stage of virus release, rather than zzso This release zzso was correlated with zzso zzso and an zzso delay in viral zzso A more conservative zzso zzso had the same effect as zzso One of the four zzso zzso zzso showed an additional zzso in virus growth in zzso zzso cells but not human zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso This cell type dependence was attributed to abnormal zzso zzso of zzso In mice, the elimination of zzso N zzso resulted in a drastic decrease in zzso after peripheral zzso Overall, our findings indicate that this highly zzso zzso motif in zzso is crucial for multiple stages of zzso zzso zzso zzso virus release, and zzso
