zzso shedding affects migration and occurs in development and cancer zzso By examining the in zzso biological function of the zzso zzso domain zzso independently of the shedding process itself, we identified a novel function for zzso in zzso extension zzso movements in zzso zzso zzso with zzso movements during zzso zzso zzso did not alter cell zzso or zzso to zzso zzso Instead, zzso defects were rescued by a zzso zzso zzso domain, the polarity protein zzso zzso zzso or zzso active zzso indicating that zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso We found that the zzso interacts with zzso and, more importantly, that the zzso domain alters this association as well as the zzso status of zzso This suggests that zzso movements require a dynamic regulation of zzso zzso Our results show that zzso play a dual role in zzso zzso a previously identified adhesive activity and an zzso function that requires zzso and zzso thereby directly connecting zzso with zzso Our results also suggest that increased zzso zzso often observed in cancer zzso can regulate migration and invasion by modulating polarity protein zzso
