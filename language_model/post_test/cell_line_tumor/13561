zzso therapies have been used to combat many tumor zzso however, few have effectively improved the overall survival in women with zzso zzso cancer, begging for a better understanding of this deadly disease and identification of essential drivers of zzso that can be targeted zzso zzso we used a zzso screening approach to help identify molecular vulnerabilities that may represent key points of therapeutic zzso We employed an unbiased zzso zzso screen using a zzso zzso library targeting over 6,000 zzso genes and studied their effects on growth and/or survival of zzso zzso cancer zzso cell zzso The top 300 zzso affecting the viability of zzso cells were zzso across additional zzso cell lines and zzso human immortalized zzso zzso cell zzso zzso gene candidates were found to exhibit effects in all zzso cell lines zzso zzso validation of these hits refined the list to four high quality candidates zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies show that zzso of three genes leads to increased zzso while zzso zzso appears to alter cell growth through zzso cell cycle zzso Furthermore, two independent gene expression studies show that zzso zzso and zzso were significantly zzso zzso in zzso zzso Overall, our functional zzso results integrated with the zzso data provide an important unbiased avenue towards the identification of prospective therapeutic targets for drug discovery, which is an urgent and zzso clinical need for zzso zzso
