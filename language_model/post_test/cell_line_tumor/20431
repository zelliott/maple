With scanning electron zzso analysis, we investigated the role of zzso topography on cellular activities; zzso cell zzso and spreading by zzso zzso cells zzso lung zzso cell line zzso for zzso h on three sets of zzso zzso zzso zzso silicon zzso and silicon zzso zzso zzso along with zzso glass zzso We found that cells on zzso zzso developed a longer shape than those on zzso zzso In addition, we studied how cell zzso influence the zzso yield on the three sets of zzso This research showed that the zzso zzso were directing the zzso yield on zzso zzso This finding implies the possibility of using zzso topography features to control the zzso formation including extension and migration from the zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we further demonstrated a substantially higher yield zzso zzso zzso than the zzso glass wafers zzso zzso zzso in the range of zzso zzso
