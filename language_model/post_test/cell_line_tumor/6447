Human zzso generate structural variation and zzso diversity through ongoing zzso and zzso zzso zzso Cell culture zzso zzso have provided great insight into the zzso impact of zzso in particular, zzso and zzso zzso however, no such zzso exists for the youngest active human zzso zzso zzso Here we report the development of an zzso cell culture zzso zzso We marked several zzso with either zzso or zzso zzso indicator zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso proteins supplemented in trans in multiple cell lines, including zzso zzso cells where zzso zzso is equal to that of an engineered zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso times the frequency of a marked zzso in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, our data suggest a variable requirement for zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso engineered zzso insertions display all the hallmarks of zzso zzso and some contain zzso and 3' zzso which are common for zzso zzso Of particular interest is the fact that four out of five insertions recovered from one zzso are zzso with the zzso end of these insertions beginning within 5 zzso of the zzso promoter zzso start zzso This zzso demonstrates that zzso elements are indeed mobilized in trans by zzso Previously intractable questions regarding zzso biology can now be zzso
