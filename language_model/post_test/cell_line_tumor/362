Platinum zzso complexes are thought to function as zzso for zzso zzso zzso We studied two pairs of zzso complexes to explore whether there were differences in their zzso activities, their abilities to cause acquired resistance and their gene expression profiles in the resistant zzso zzso methods were used to evaluate the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a panel of 14 human cancer cell zzso zzso and zzso showed significant similar zzso of zzso whereas zzso and zzso did zzso zzso required more than 24 h to reach full zzso whereas the other three Pt complexes achieved zzso activity in less than 24 zzso The zzso cervical cell line was made zzso to zzso resistant to the four Pt complexes by weekly exposure to the respective zzso zzso zzso levels increased in all resistant lines except for the zzso resistant zzso The zzso zzso of various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were all unchanged in the resistant lines relative to the native zzso zzso resistance protein 2 expression was detected in the zzso and zzso cell lines but not in the native zzso The zzso of zzso genes in the zzso lines resistant to either zzso or zzso was studied by zzso methods and compared with the native zzso zzso changes in gene zzso were very different between the zzso and zzso cell zzso Thus, zzso complexes seem to have biological actions that distinguish them from their zzso counterparts, even when they show zzso
