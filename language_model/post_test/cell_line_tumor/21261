Growth zzso hormone zzso can stimulate not only growth hormone zzso zzso by anterior zzso zzso but also proliferation of many cancer cell lines in zzso and in zzso tumor models in zzso Several zzso of zzso have been shown to inhibit several cancer zzso but the role of zzso zzso in the regulation of neuroendocrine zzso cell proliferation and tumor progression remains zzso The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence of zzso zzso zzso zzso on proliferation and zzso zzso by human neuroendocrine lung zzso cell zzso zzso using cell culture zzso The in zzso effect of zzso on the proliferation of zzso cells was assessed by the measurement of zzso incorporation by zzso zzso The presence of zzso and membrane zzso receptors on the surface of zzso cells were zzso by zzso using specific zzso zzso zzso directed to the zzso zzso zzso zzso to the cell cultures zzso was assessed by zzso zzso zzso cell membrane zzso receptors and zzso zzso zzso were clearly confined on the surface of nearly all cancer zzso zzso at the concentration of zzso significantly inhibited growth of zzso cells, compared with zzso zzso In zzso cells, the zzso zzso effect was associated with a zzso reduction of zzso zzso In conclusion, our findings demonstrate the strong evidence for the zzso action of zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso In addition the suppression of zzso zzso by zzso cells might zzso at least in part, to the zzso action of zzso zzso
