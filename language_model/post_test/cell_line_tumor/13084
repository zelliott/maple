zzso zzso in zzso zzso is a zzso group of zzso reflecting the proliferation of zzso cells within the ducts of the breast without invasion through the basement zzso Numerous studies analyzing the molecular profiles of zzso using zzso unbiased and candidate gene approaches have been conducted with the aim of identifying clinically useful markers that would predict the risk of progression to zzso zzso of these investigations defined the zzso of zzso at the molecular level, but a gene signature zzso of invasive progression has not been zzso Major diagnostic criteria that differentiate zzso from invasive cancer are the presence of intact basement membrane and zzso cell zzso Based on this, zzso of normal zzso cell differentiation has been proposed to explain progression to zzso Comprehensive molecular studies analyzing large zzso of zzso with long-term clinical follow-up are necessary to resolve the many remaining zzso
