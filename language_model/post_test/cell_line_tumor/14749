Research is to identify the zzso secondary zzso produced by zzso zzso zzso 901 isolated from marine zzso and to assess their zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso 901 was isolated from marine zzso obtained from the East Sea of zzso An zzso zzso extract of zzso 901 exhibited potent zzso activity towards five cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the internal transcribed zzso zzso region in this strain allowed us to identify zzso 901 as a strain of zzso zzso The zzso compounds from zzso zzso zzso 901 were zzso by zzso zzso liquid zzso and identified as zzso zzso through zzso analyses including extensive zzso zzso and mass zzso The zzso zzso were found to induce zzso in zzso cells based on cell zzso DNA fragmentation observed by zzso gel zzso zzso zzso using a flow zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso family proteins zzso zzso and zzso using Western zzso zzso Further study using an in zzso zzso model showed zzso effects of zzso zzso on zzso zzso 

A new zzso zzso zzso zzso along with previously described zzso zzso and zzso zzso was separated from zzso zzso zzso 901 and found to have direct zzso and zzso effects towards zzso colon cancer cell zzso 

These results suggest that the zzso zzso produced from zzso zzso zzso zzso could be candidates for the development of zzso zzso zzso Also, this study indicates that marine natural products as potential source of zzso
