zzso zzso play fundamental roles in many biological zzso Members of the zzso zzso zzso family have been shown to take part in processes crucial in disease zzso The current study used the zzso Human zzso zzso to zzso zzso and tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso production in the zzso and media of 14 cancer cell lines and 1 normal cell zzso The overall patterns were very similar in terms of which zzso and zzso were zzso in the media versus associated with the cells in the individual zzso However, more zzso was found in the media (in both amount and zzso zzso was produced in all cell zzso zzso activity zzso with three different zzso resonance energy transfer zzso zzso were then used to determine whether protein production correlated with function for the zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso activity was observed for both cell lines with a general zzso zzso zzso zzso consistent with protein production zzso However, although both cell lines promoted the zzso of a more selective zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was confirmed only in the zzso cell zzso The use of zzso to confirm zzso activities pointed to the strengths and weaknesses of in zzso zzso zzso zzso
