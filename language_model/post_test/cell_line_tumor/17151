zzso zzso is involved in the reductive zzso of zzso zzso that can modify cellular zzso To analyze the mechanism of zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso we cloned the zzso gene and adjacent regulatory region and compared it to the human zzso The mouse zzso exhibits zzso specificity similar to that of the human zzso but with a zzso higher zzso zzso In contrast to the mouse zzso the human zzso zzso gene has two alternatively spliced zzso A zzso of 57 zzso is sufficient for zzso of human promoter activity and consists of two zzso The 3' element binds zzso factors of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso analysis reveal that zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso binds to the zzso element and drives zzso expression of both mouse and human zzso zzso zzso zzso thus becomes the fourth zzso gene regulated by zzso The human, but not the zzso promoter also binds zzso zzso protein zzso which competes with zzso for the same binding zzso zzso of the human promoter into zzso mouse zzso cells zzso a zzso increase in promoter activity and a zzso band appears on gel shifts performed with the zzso probe from the human zzso zzso zzso zzso is attenuated in similar zzso studies of the mouse zzso zzso of the zzso site in the human promoter zzso zzso binding and significantly reduces zzso zzso suggesting that zzso mediates zzso expression in response to antioxidants in the zzso This subtle difference in the human promoter suggests a further evolution of the promoter toward responsiveness to zzso stress and/or zzso
