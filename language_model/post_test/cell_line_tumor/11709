Loss of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso growth factor 2 gene zzso is a common zzso zzso in many human zzso zzso zzso is regulated by zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso control region that is located between zzso and zzso on human zzso zzso In the present study, combined expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso driven by zzso zzso promoter complex was investigated and their effects on the tumor growth were assessed in zzso and in zzso When infected with zzso the cancer cell lines with the zzso such as zzso and zzso cells, had the expression of the zzso zzso whereas three cancer cell lines with the maintenance of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had weak expression of zzso Furthermore, the expressed zzso significantly decreased cell viability and induced cell zzso only in zzso and zzso cells in zzso and effectively suppressed tumor development in zzso and zzso zzso in nude zzso It is concluded that this gene therapy zzso is effective in the suppression of the growth of human colon cancer cells in zzso and in zzso and that cancer gene therapy based on loss of zzso zzso may prove to be a novel therapeutic zzso
