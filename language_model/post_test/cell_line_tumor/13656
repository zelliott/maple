DNA is a frequent target of zzso damage, and DNA damage removal is therefore a crucial process in prevention of or recovery from degenerative zzso DNA repair is an essential system for maintaining the inherited zzso sequence of zzso DNA over zzso zzso engage in efficient DNA repair mechanisms, the activity of which can vary depending on the type of zzso and the zzso zzso Base zzso repair zzso and zzso zzso repair zzso are the major repair pathways addressed in this zzso zzso is the principal mechanism for repair of DNA zzso zzso while zzso is the mechanism for repair of a variety of zzso zzso such as those caused by zzso zzso Recent studies suggest that zzso plays a cooperative role in removal of zzso zzso Little is known about the roles of DNA damage sensors and repair factors in terminally zzso zzso cells such as zzso which are vulnerable to zzso damage from zzso oxygen species generated by zzso or zzso zzso We used the human zzso MSN cell model to investigate whether terminally differentiated zzso cells respond to zzso cause in the DNA zzso such as zzso zzso and the major DNA zzso zzso zzso and thereby clarify the role of zzso zzso We observed differences in DNA damage removal depending on the challenge insult and the differentiation zzso zzso MSN cells, compared with zzso cells, showed greater sensitivity to zzso and decreased DNA damage over zzso In contrast, zzso cells displayed zzso induced by zzso insult and tended to accumulate DNA damage and zzso zzso over zzso Our findings suggest the participation of zzso zzso and zzso proteins in the removal of zzso and zzso indicating a dynamic role in overall response to zzso
