The zzso C virus zzso core protein is involved in viral zzso such as zzso stress induction and zzso metabolism zzso and is primarily located in the zzso and zzso zzso in association with zzso droplets as well as in the zzso To clarify the impact of the core protein on zzso we analyzed the expression pattern of zzso proteins in core zzso cells by two-dimensional zzso gel zzso Several proteins related to the zzso respiratory chain or protein zzso were identified by mass zzso Among the identified proteins with consistently different expressions, zzso a zzso protein zzso was zzso not only in zzso cells but also in zzso zzso cells and zzso of zzso transgenic zzso The stability of zzso was increased through interaction with the core zzso Further analysis demonstrated that interaction of zzso with zzso zzso zzso of zzso c zzso zzso was disturbed by the core zzso resulting in a significant decrease in zzso zzso 

The zzso core protein affects the zzso levels of a subset of zzso proteins including zzso which may lead to an impaired function of the zzso respiratory chain with the overproduction of zzso zzso
