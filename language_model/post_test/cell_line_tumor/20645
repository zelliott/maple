zzso peptides are zzso zzso capable of zzso killing a wide spectrum of cancer cells relative to zzso zzso Their primary mode of action is an interaction with the cell membrane and subsequent zzso of zzso zzso however, the exact mechanism responsible for this mode of action remains zzso Using zzso potential analyses we demonstrate the interaction of a small zzso zzso with membrane model systems and cancer zzso zzso interactions have a pivotal role in the cell killing process, and in contrast to the zzso peptides action cell death occurs without achieving full zzso of the membrane zzso
