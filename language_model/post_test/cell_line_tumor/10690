zzso zzso zzso is a zzso cancer characterized by rapid progression as well as resistance to conventional zzso It has been shown that zzso play critical roles in zzso of zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso and is frequently zzso in zzso In the present study, we investigated whether restoration of zzso in zzso cells could render cells sensitive to zzso agents zzso zzso or zzso zzso Our data showed that zzso of zzso in zzso cells induced by zzso expressing zzso could render cell sensitive to zzso or zzso Analysis of cell cycle distribution showed that the zzso effect of zzso is associated with increase of cell number in the zzso zzso Moreover, treatment with zzso and zzso or VCR resulted in high zzso of zzso cells in zzso zzso We further demonstrated that zzso of zzso could zzso the sensitivity of the zzso cells to zzso drugs through zzso zzso related genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso and cell cycle related gene zzso zzso Taken together, our findings demonstrated that combination of zzso with zzso agents inhibited zzso cell growth by inducing zzso arrest and that this arrest is zzso at least in part, with reduced expression of zzso related genes and zzso zzso
