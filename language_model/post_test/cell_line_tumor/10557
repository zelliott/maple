zzso zzso zzso zzso induce growth arrest and zzso in cancer zzso In addition to their intrinsic zzso properties, zzso zzso cellular responses to zzso radiation zzso We examined the molecular zzso associated with the zzso effects of zzso in human lung cancer zzso 

Lung cancer cells were zzso with the appropriate zzso of zzso zzso acid or zzso zzso After 2 hours, cells were zzso with various doses of zzso and then we performed zzso zzso zzso zzso cell sorting analysis, zzso zzso and Western zzso to detect cell viability or zzso and changes of specific proteins expression zzso 

In this study, we showed that zzso (including zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso and zzso zzso trigger cell death in human zzso cell lung cancer zzso Cell viability and zzso survival were markedly decreased in cultures zzso with zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso at zzso 382 was significantly increased, and zzso expression simultaneously zzso in zzso zzso zzso by zzso was inhibited on zzso with small interfering zzso against zzso and zzso zzso supporting the involvement of zzso and zzso in this zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso and zzso cell death zzso by zzso and zzso were suppressed in cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso displaying loss of zzso at zzso 382 and zzso activity, zzso 

Our results collectively demonstrate that the degree of zzso by zzso is influenced by zzso zzso zzso zzso
