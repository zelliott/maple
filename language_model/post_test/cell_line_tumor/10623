zzso in zzso DNA zzso might contribute to expression of the tumor zzso such as zzso potential, as well as to aging zzso and to clinical zzso of zzso diseases by induction of zzso zzso defects and the zzso overproduction of zzso oxygen species zzso To test whether zzso zzso mediate zzso pathways in highly zzso human tumor cells, we used human breast zzso zzso cells, which simultaneously expressed a highly zzso potential, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Since zzso respiratory function is controlled by both zzso and nuclear DNA, it is possible that nuclear DNA zzso contribute to the zzso zzso defects and the highly zzso potential found in zzso zzso To examine this possibility, we carried out zzso replacement of zzso cells by normal human zzso For the complete zzso replacement, first we isolated zzso zzso zzso cells, and then introduced normal human zzso into the zzso zzso cells, and isolated zzso cells zzso carrying nuclear DNA from zzso cells and zzso from a normal zzso The normal zzso transfer simultaneously induced restoration of zzso respiratory function and suppression of the highly zzso potential expressed in zzso cells, but did not suppress zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso zzso defects observed in zzso cells are caused by zzso in zzso but not in nuclear DNA, and are responsible for expression of the high zzso potential without using zzso zzso Thus, human tumor cells possess an zzso zzso zzso that is required for expression of the highly zzso potential in the absence of zzso zzso
