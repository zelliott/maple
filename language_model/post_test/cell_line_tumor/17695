zzso is characterized by high zzso and a high propensity for zzso through zzso This study was to examine whether there is evidence for zzso mimicry in zzso and to illustrate mechanism of tumor blood vessels formation in zzso 

zzso cell lines zzso were tested for their ability to form zzso networks in three-dimensional culture containing type I zzso The structures of the zzso networks were observed with phase contrast microscope and transmission electron microscope zzso zzso studies using zzso and zzso zzso stain and zzso zzso stain to show zzso channels in human zzso were also zzso 

Observation with light microscope and zzso showed that highly aggressive zzso cell lines zzso formed networks containing channels when grown in three-dimensional culture containing type I zzso in the absence of zzso cells or zzso zzso observation using HE stain and zzso zzso stain showed that tumor zzso channels were also detected in zzso in zzso by comparison, all vascular areas in the zzso of zzso or outside zzso were zzso 

These observations strongly suggest that aggressive zzso cells may generate vascular channels that facilitate tumor zzso independent of tumor zzso and have the ability of zzso zzso
