zzso zzso is the main zzso zzso found in zzso with potent zzso zzso The zzso property of zzso has been demonstrated in both in zzso cell culture and in zzso animal model, while the molecular mechanisms remain to be further zzso In the present study, we evaluated the involvement of nuclear zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso activity of zzso by examining the zzso effect of zzso on tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso in human cancer zzso zzso with zzso greatly zzso various human cancer cells to zzso zzso Such zzso is closely associated with the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso Our study revealed a new mechanism that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso the recruitment of the zzso zzso zzso complex to zzso zzso which then blocked the subsequent signaling events including zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation, zzso nuclear zzso DNA binding and zzso Moreover, zzso also markedly enhanced and sustained zzso zzso zzso A specific zzso inhibitor zzso as well as zzso of zzso forms of zzso and zzso abolished the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso It is thus believed that suppressed zzso zzso and sustained zzso zzso contribute to the zzso effect of zzso to zzso cell death in human cancer zzso
