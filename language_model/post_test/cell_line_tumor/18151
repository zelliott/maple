zzso is thought to be a regulator of organ development and a downstream target of the zzso signaling zzso however, little is known about the role of zzso in the development of pancreatic zzso most of which harbor a zzso gene zzso zzso we examined whether the presence of zzso zzso with the zzso behavior of pancreatic cancer zzso zzso pancreatic cancer cells that zzso zzso zzso showed a flattened and scattered zzso accompanied by a change in zzso of zzso and zzso from membrane to zzso Cell proliferation rate, cell migration, and zzso cell growth were enhanced in zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells into the zzso of nude mice resulted in a significant increase in liver zzso and zzso zzso compared with injection of control zzso zzso analysis revealed a significant induction of Twist 1 expression in cells that express zzso When zzso was zzso in pancreatic cancer cells following zzso with an zzso small interfering zzso Twist 1 was zzso zzso of human pancreatic zzso tissue revealed that zzso was frequently expressed in cancer cells, and that increased expression of zzso significantly correlated with higher tumor grade, vascular invasion, and Twist 1 zzso These data indicate that zzso plays a crucial role in pancreatic cancer development by inducing changes consistent with zzso to zzso transition through enhanced expression of Twist zzso
