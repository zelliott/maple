zzso are involved in the formation of zzso and zzso maintenance of zzso zzso and cellular zzso Recent studies suggest that drugs affecting zzso activity in the brain can induce zzso zzso For instance, we have demonstrated in acute rat brain slices a molecular chain of events connecting zzso D1 zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso However, the molecular and cellular effects of zzso zzso by means of the zzso of zzso receptors were zzso Here we used zzso cells, which express zzso functional D1 zzso to demonstrate that levels of zzso zzso at zzso zzso or 214 are increased by a zzso zzso subsequent to D1 zzso zzso Using selective pharmacological tools, we showed that enhanced zzso calcium lead to zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso by zzso zzso of zzso to zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by its zzso at zzso zzso Interestingly, while the zzso of protein zzso A zzso led directly to the zzso of zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso was independent of zzso In addition, zzso of zzso or zzso prevented the decrease in cell viability induced by D1 zzso stimulation whereas zzso zzso had no zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso of zzso and zzso following D1 zzso stimulation could have profound influence on both the zzso zzso constituent zzso and cell survival in zzso zzso
