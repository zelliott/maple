zzso breast cancer zzso is the most lethal form of locally advanced breast zzso We found zzso and consistent zzso of two genes in zzso of zzso tumors when compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and loss of zzso induced zzso protein 3 zzso Further work revealed that zzso is a transforming zzso for human zzso zzso zzso zzso Despite the aggressiveness of the zzso zzso it does not zzso reach that of the true zzso zzso We have demonstrated that zzso has tumor growth and zzso zzso functions in zzso We proposed that zzso and zzso cooperate in the development of zzso 

Using an zzso approach, we blocked zzso expression in zzso zzso Cellular proliferation and growth were determined using the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth in a soft zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso was measured in zzso medium by zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells increased zzso zzso levels and resulted in an increase in cellular zzso zzso growth and zzso levels in the zzso zzso zzso restoration of zzso expression in the highly zzso zzso cell line zzso was able to decrease the expression of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells and in the zzso cell line zzso This provides further evidence that these two genes act in concert to give rise to the highly aggressive zzso zzso We propose a model of this interaction as a starting point for further zzso
