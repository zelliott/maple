zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes regulate zzso and play critical roles in a variety of differentiation zzso The core zzso zzso is a tumor zzso that is zzso in a highly aggressive childhood cancer of unknown cellular origin, termed zzso zzso tumor zzso The highly zzso zzso of this tumor suggests that the zzso of zzso zzso specific differentiation programs of the zzso parental zzso Based on the hypothesis that these programs might be zzso upon zzso zzso in zzso we show that some zzso cell lines can differentiate toward the zzso zzso We further show that the knock down of the zzso zzso abrogates zzso differentiation of zzso zzso zzso and of human zzso stem zzso Finally, we provide evidence that zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso regulators to activate the expression of zzso zzso These data indicate that not only the zzso zzso of the zzso complex, but also zzso is required for zzso zzso They further show that zzso cell lines harbor an zzso differentiation potential and that the tumor zzso role of the zzso zzso may rely on its ability to regulate the balance between cell proliferation and zzso
