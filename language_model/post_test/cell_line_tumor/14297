zzso is an active zzso agent with zzso zzso zzso is rapidly zzso zzso as well as zzso by zzso zzso to zzso zzso a compound with little zzso zzso However, plasma zzso are maintained for a prolonged period zzso zzso at levels known to cause growth zzso This is the first study that investigates the zzso potential of zzso in zzso 

zzso and zzso human cancer cells, were treated with different zzso zzso zzso zzso during 24 h before radiation treatment zzso The schedule dependency of the zzso effect was studied by varying the zzso between zzso and radiation zzso In addition, the cell cycle effect of zzso was investigated with flow zzso and the induction of zzso under zzso conditions was determined by zzso V zzso and zzso 3 zzso 

zzso caused a clear zzso zzso effect in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso enhancement factor zzso increased with an increasing concentration of zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso after treatment with 10, 25 and 50 zzso zzso respectively, in zzso cells and zzso zzso and zzso after treatment with 25, 50 and 100 zzso respectively, in zzso zzso zzso decreased with an increasing zzso of zzso h between zzso treatment and zzso Under zzso conditions, the combination zzso and radiation resulted in an increased induction of zzso In addition, the cell cycle effect of zzso an arrest at the early S phase, is comparable with the cell cycle effect of zzso 

zzso the main zzso of zzso causes a zzso and zzso dependent zzso effect in zzso Since the zzso is present in plasma for a long period zzso zzso after treatment with zzso it might be partly responsible for the interaction between zzso and zzso This observation might have important consequences for the optimal schedules of the combination zzso and radiation zzso
