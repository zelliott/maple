To observe the effects of ethanol extract of zzso zzso zzso on the zzso pH value of human gastric cancer zzso zzso 

After zzso zzso cells with ethanol extract of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell viability was evaluated by zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pH value of zzso cells was measured in the zzso by using the zzso fluorescent probe zzso zzso The zzso pH value of culture medium was measured by a zzso zzso Check zzso pH zzso zzso concentration zzso of ethanol extract culture to zzso cells was decided by the zzso method and expressions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso were examined by the method of zzso zzso chain reaction after 72 h of drug zzso 

Ethanol extract of zzso zzso zzso at different zzso significantly inhibited the proliferation of zzso cells, lowered the zzso pH values and heightened the zzso pH zzso The zzso of 72 h culture was zzso and it inhibited the expressions of zzso and zzso zzso 

Ethanol extract of zzso zzso zzso can lower down the zzso pH value of zzso zzso The mechanism may be related to zzso the expressions of zzso and zzso zzso
