The zzso zzso point zzso in zzso is associated with a proportion of zzso zzso In normal zzso cells, zzso signals only when associated with a growth factor zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso We sought to identify the molecular requirements for zzso of zzso by introducing a point zzso in the zzso domain zzso required for zzso zzso Whereas zzso cells are readily transformed by zzso to zzso independence, we found that the addition of the zzso domain zzso blocked transformation and the induction of zzso oxygen zzso Further, while cells expressing zzso had zzso zzso of zzso cells expressing zzso did not, suggesting that signaling is defective at a very zzso zzso In addition, expression of the zzso and zzso zzso by zzso was found to be zzso domain zzso An zzso zzso active zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells was sufficient to induce zzso and zzso Finally, the zzso domain in zzso was also required for abnormal zzso in zzso primary zzso fetal liver zzso Overall, our results suggest that zzso zzso of zzso requires an intact zzso domain for a transforming zzso and is necessary for zzso of the major target of zzso zzso
