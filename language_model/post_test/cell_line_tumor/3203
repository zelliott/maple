The rates of emergence of zzso and zzso zzso from an zzso zzso zzso mouse leukemia cell line were determined by fluctuation zzso The results show that the wild type cells throw off the zzso zzso at about zzso per cell per generation and the zzso zzso at zzso per cell per zzso The reason for this tenfold difference in the rates for the two symmetrical zzso is not zzso The fluctuation analyses also indicate that the zzso exist in the wild type population prior to exposure to the selective zzso
