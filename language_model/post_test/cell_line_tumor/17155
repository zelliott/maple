To persist in zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso must replicate and efficiently segregate to progeny zzso zzso persistence in zzso cells requires zzso nuclear zzso 1 zzso in trans and zzso zzso terminal repeat zzso zzso The zzso C zzso binds zzso DNA, and zzso mediates zzso DNA replication in transient zzso zzso also concentrates at sites of zzso zzso DNA zzso along zzso zzso consistent with a zzso role to efficiently segregate zzso to progeny zzso zzso zzso acids 5 to 22 constitute a zzso association region zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We now investigate zzso zzso 5 to 22 with scanning zzso zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso zzso and zzso eliminated zzso association, DNA zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso retained the ability to associate with zzso but was partially deficient in DNA replication and zzso zzso These results provide genetic support for a key role of the zzso N zzso in zzso association, zzso DNA zzso and zzso zzso
