To explore whether the zzso construction of short hairpin in zzso could make human zzso cell line zzso produce zzso interference zzso duplexes and reverse the expression of the zzso zzso 

Three zzso zzso fragments zzso were constructed according to zzso zzso sequence and were cloned to the zzso zzso After these zzso were zzso directly to the zzso cell by zzso 2000 with enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso zzso the zzso gene silence effects were detected by the changing levels of zzso and zzso zzso including real-time zzso zzso Northern zzso and Western zzso zzso For assessing zzso resistance against zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell proliferation zzso were performed by cell counting zzso and zzso was zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso were constructed zzso The gene silence became the strongest after 48 hour zzso from Northern zzso Western zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso expression reduced to zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso showed that the zzso cell could increase the sensitivity of zzso and zzso Based on the value of zzso zzso cells increased sensitivity to drugs zzso The sequence specific zzso could inhibit zzso zzso and zzso expression of the zzso cell zzso And it may reverse zzso resistance zzso which may provide promising therapeutic zzso in the treatment of human zzso
