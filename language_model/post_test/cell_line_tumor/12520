In some cancer cell lines, the gene zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso is zzso and enhances cancer zzso zzso levels of zzso A and zzso were assessed in zzso and normal brain zzso in this study, and the effect of zzso A and zzso treatment on the proliferation of zzso human zzso cells in zzso was also zzso High levels of zzso A were observed in zzso compared with normal brain zzso In contrast, zzso levels were similar between the two zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso A (3 - 30 zzso produced a zzso increase in DNA synthesis of zzso cells compared with zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso A increased the zzso index of zzso cells compared with zzso zzso A also induced zzso of zzso in a zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso blocked these zzso zzso zzso The zzso between zzso A and zzso may play a role in the development of zzso
