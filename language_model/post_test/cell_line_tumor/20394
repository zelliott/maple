Although recent advances in breast cancer treatment regimes have improved patient zzso resistance to breast cancer therapies, such as zzso is still a major clinical zzso In the current study, we have investigated the role of zzso human zzso zzso in resistance to zzso radiation zzso zzso Cell viability and total cell number zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso promoted cell regrowth in the zzso zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso cell line, zzso following treatment with zzso In addition, zzso zzso enhanced zzso and zzso cell zzso survival following radiation zzso The enhanced zzso survival afforded by zzso zzso was zzso by zzso and zzso zzso Investigation into the DNA repair capacity demonstrated that zzso zzso reduced zzso DNA damage in zzso and zzso zzso zzso antagonism of zzso increased zzso sensitivity to zzso in cell viability and total cell number zzso reduced zzso survival and enhanced the induction of DNA zzso Thus, zzso zzso reduced sensitivity to treatment with zzso in zzso and zzso zzso cell lines in zzso while functional antagonism of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso antagonism of zzso used in conjunction with zzso may therefore enhance treatment efficacy and improve the prognosis of patients with breast and zzso zzso
