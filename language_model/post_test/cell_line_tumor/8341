Maintenance of zzso integrity is essential for zzso and survival as impaired DNA damage response zzso may zzso to grave zzso such as neurodegenerative and zzso zzso cancer and premature zzso zzso accurate assessment of DNA damage caused by environmental or zzso zzso insults is critical for contemporary zzso The available physical, flow zzso and sophisticated scanning approaches to DNA damage zzso each have some drawbacks such as insufficient sensitivity, limitation to analysis of cells in suspension, or high costs and demand for trained zzso Here we present an option how to transform a regular zzso microscope and personal computer with common software into a functional alternative to zzso screening zzso In two detailed protocols we introduce a new zzso procedure allowing for very sensitive, zzso rapid and simple zzso image analysis in thousands of adherent cells per zzso Sensitive DNA breakage zzso through analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso assessed by a new zzso zzso approach illustrate the advantages and zzso of this zzso Our present data on assessment of low radiation doses, repair zzso spontaneous DNA damage in cancer cells, as well as zzso and replication zzso zzso events and their dependence on upstream factors within the zzso machinery document the versatility of the zzso We believe this affordable approach may facilitate zzso insights into the role of zzso DNA damage in human diseases, and generally promote both basic and zzso research in many areas of zzso where suitable zzso markers are zzso
