To take advantage of the small interfering zzso acid zzso targeting the human zzso of liver zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to inhibit the function of zzso and to demonstrate whether the growth of zzso is influenced by zzso targeting zzso and zzso zzso through zzso expression of zzso 

This study was conducted in the Key Laboratory of zzso Biology for zzso zzso Ministry of Education, Institute for zzso zzso zzso Medical University, China, between January 2005 and May zzso We zzso zzso zzso zzso which targeted the complementary zzso acid zzso of zzso and the unrelated control zzso zzso into human zzso liver zzso cell line zzso zzso Then, the proliferation of zzso cells, after being treated with zzso and zzso zzso was zzso The growth of the zzso tumor was observed after being treated with zzso and zzso zzso in nude zzso 

We successfully constructed expressing zzso zzso and zzso The zzso inhibited the expression of zzso in zzso cells zzso The zzso targeting zzso and zzso zzso inhibited obviously the growth of zzso cells in zzso zzso targeting zzso and zzso zzso significantly inhibited the growth of zzso tumor in 5 nude zzso zzso zzso inhibited apparently the autonomous growth of zzso zzso 

Our results demonstrated that zzso zzso inhibited the autonomous growth of zzso cells obviously, moreover, zzso maintained the autonomous growth of zzso cells in zzso through an zzso zzso
