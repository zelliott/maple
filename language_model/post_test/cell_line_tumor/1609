zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso most common in East Asia and zzso zzso expression of zzso a negative regulator of the zzso inhibitor zzso is correlated with reduced zzso expression and associated with advanced tumor stage and poor prognosis in several human zzso In this study, we examined the functional relationship between zzso and zzso protein expression in zzso zzso analysis showed an inverse association between zzso and zzso in zzso tissue samples, and zzso of zzso correlated with poor survival in patients with zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to interact directly in zzso cells, with zzso zzso zzso degradation in a zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in a remarkable increase in zzso levels and zzso of cell zzso indicating that zzso targets zzso for degradation, thereby controlling its zzso zzso depletion also enhanced the zzso effects of zzso in zzso zzso Together, our findings suggest that zzso zzso plays an important role in the zzso of zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso therefore represents a novel diagnostic marker and therapeutic target in patients with zzso
