The zzso zzso factor is involved in the development and cell fate zzso Although zzso of zzso has been described in human prostate cancer zzso the zzso value of zzso and its exact role in zzso progression remain zzso 

Three tissue zzso were constructed from zzso Chinese zzso patients who underwent zzso zzso zzso was used to detect the expression of zzso zzso aberrations of zzso growth factor zzso and zzso were detected by zzso in zzso zzso The effect of zzso on proliferation was evaluated by zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell migration and invasion were evaluated by zzso and zzso zzso The distribution of zzso phase was analyzed by flow zzso zzso zzso and western zzso were used to study transcript and protein zzso 

Using tissue zzso we found that zzso was zzso in zzso zzso Chinese zzso patients by zzso zzso zzso was significantly associated with high zzso scores zzso and the presence of distant zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso was significantly correlated with high zzso labeling index zzso and tended to associate with amplification of zzso zzso in our zzso zzso zzso was correlated with zzso mortality of zzso patients by zzso analysis zzso zzso Cox zzso analysis indicated that zzso was an zzso independent zzso factor in Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced proliferation of zzso cells and zzso zzso of zzso significantly decreased zzso cell migration and invasion, suggesting a role of zzso in cancer zzso Additionally, flow zzso DNA analysis revealed that zzso zzso leads to significant zzso of cells in the S phase and marked decrease of cells in the zzso zzso Further in zzso study revealed that zzso zzso could inhibit zzso zzso growth zzso zzso transition zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso could promote the zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

Our results define an important role for zzso in the progression of zzso by orchestrating zzso and may serve as a zzso marker for zzso zzso
