In this study, 19 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso previously discovered as novel zzso agents, were evaluated for their potential to reverse zzso resistance zzso in a cancer cell line zzso zzso zzso Seven compounds fully reversed resistance to zzso zzso at 4 zzso a zzso enhancement compared to the first generation zzso zzso (4 zzso The mechanism of action of zzso and zzso was also zzso since the most active compounds zzso 4, and 7) significantly increased zzso drug zzso due, in part, to zzso the zzso zzso drug zzso from zzso We conclude that zzso (3 and 4) and zzso zzso 11, and 17) can exhibit zzso behavior by acting as dual zzso of zzso replication and zzso zzso by zzso As such, they may be useful in combination therapy to overcome zzso drug resistance for AIDS zzso
