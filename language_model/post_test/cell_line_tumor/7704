zzso particles presenting zzso regions of chemistry on the zzso versus the side are zzso and are shown to control the particle orientation on the surface of live zzso Controlling the orientation of zzso zzso on cell surfaces is of interest for biomedical applications and drug delivery in particular, since it can be used to promote or resist particle zzso
