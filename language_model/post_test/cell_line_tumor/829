Three canine zzso cell lines were established from spontaneous pelvic and zzso zzso The cell populations cultured exhibited characteristics of zzso and consisted of zzso zzso mostly large zzso or zzso cells, zzso by the presence of numerous zzso zzso and zzso The main zzso features included the presence of abundant rough zzso zzso and numerous zzso zzso deposit zzso and small zzso zzso zzso showed that the cell lines produce high levels of zzso and zzso zzso directly involved in crucial aspects of the zzso zzso zzso with their zzso lineage and zzso zzso all cell lines were zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso while they were negative for zzso zzso zzso Factor VIII, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso No zzso particles or zzso were detected zzso or with zzso although the possibility of viral involvement in zzso cannot be zzso The new cell lines provide excellent in zzso models that may allow further studies on the zzso of canine zzso to be zzso
