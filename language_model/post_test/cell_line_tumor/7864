Gene Set zzso Analysis zzso is a method for zzso gene expression data with a focus on a zzso defined gene zzso The zzso test generally used in zzso for testing the significance of gene set enrichment involves zzso of a zzso zzso and is developed for data from an indirect comparison design, zzso zzso zzso In some studies the samples representing two zzso are zzso zzso samples taken from a patient before and after treatment, or if samples representing two zzso are zzso to the same zzso array zzso comparison zzso In this paper we will focus on data from direct comparison experiments, but the methods can be applied to paired data in zzso For these types of data, a standard zzso test for paired data that randomly zzso samples can be zzso However, if the sample size is very small, which is often the case for a direct comparison design, a zzso test will give very imprecise estimates of the zzso Here we propose using a rotation test rather than a zzso test for zzso of significance in zzso of direct comparison data with a limited number of zzso Our proposed rotation test makes zzso zzso to direct comparison data with few samples, by depending on zzso of the data instead of zzso The rotation test is a zzso of the zzso test, and can in addition be used on indirect comparison data and for testing significance of other types of test statistics outside the zzso zzso
