Two mouse tumor cell lines, zzso A zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were shown to express high levels of complement zzso gene zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso activity of zzso with zzso zzso induced high levels of zzso deposition on in zzso zzso zzso A and zzso zzso To determine the effect of zzso blockade and increased zzso deposition on in zzso tumor growth, zzso A and zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso and injected into zzso and zzso mice, zzso zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso significantly suppressed their zzso when injected zzso zzso with zzso zzso had a modest effect on zzso A zzso tumor zzso Because complement is involved in the induction of an immune response, we investigated the effect of zzso blockade and increased zzso deposition on the zzso of the tumor cells in a vaccination zzso zzso of mice with zzso zzso A cells zzso with zzso zzso protected mice from subsequent zzso In contrast, vaccination with zzso zzso A cells without zzso was not zzso Survival was correlated with a high zzso zzso response and specific zzso zzso These data demonstrate that the functional zzso of zzso on tumor cells affects tumor growth and zzso and that the complement deposition resulting from this zzso can act in concert with zzso zzso mechanisms to elicit potent zzso immunity in zzso
