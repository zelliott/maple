zzso double minute 2 zzso is a cellular zzso which, in conditions of zzso or amplification, is capable of zzso the functions of zzso leading to zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso was previously zzso however, it was necessary to find out if zzso was zzso The aim of this study was to zzso the zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso and to correlate it to zzso of zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso of different zzso zzso zzso were obtained from surgical zzso and cell lineages derived from these zzso were zzso zzso extraction was performed and zzso expression was investigated using reverse zzso chain reaction zzso Cellular expression of zzso and zzso proteins was investigated by zzso zzso 

Increased expression of zzso was found in the majority of cell lines zzso 

Comparing all results, we zzso that zzso of zzso is related to the zzso and/or zzso progression of zzso zzso zzso
