zzso research over the past decade has revealed that the zzso zzso plays a critical role in the development of zzso zzso Whether zzso a zzso zzso can inhibit the growth of zzso cancer was investigated in the present zzso 

The effect of zzso on proliferation of zzso cancer cell lines was examined by zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and protein expression by Western zzso The effect of zzso on the tumor growth in zzso was examined in zzso cancer zzso in a nude mouse zzso 

zzso inhibited zzso induced zzso and suppressed zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins in zzso cancer zzso The suppression of zzso zzso by zzso was caused by sequential zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso nuclear zzso Furthermore, the effect of zzso on zzso activity was found to be zzso In zzso zzso (at 5 and 20 zzso body zzso injected zzso after tumor zzso significantly decreased the volume of zzso cancer zzso The zzso zzso exhibited significant zzso in the expression of proteins involved in tumor cell survival zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proliferation zzso and zzso zzso invasion zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso was found to be zzso in the blood plasma and tumor zzso of treated zzso 

Our studies provide evidence that zzso can suppress the growth of human zzso cancer through zzso of the zzso zzso
