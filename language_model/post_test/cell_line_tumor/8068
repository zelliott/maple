Short interfering zzso zzso have been shown to induce immune stimulation through a number of different receptors in a range of cell zzso In primary cells, both zzso and zzso have been shown to zzso zzso however, despite the identification of a number of zzso zzso zzso zzso the complete and definitive sequence zzso of zzso and zzso are yet to be zzso 

A total of zzso zzso sequences were screened for zzso stimulation in human zzso There was a significant correlation between the U count of the zzso strand and the zzso activity of the zzso Using zzso specifically designed to zzso the effect of base zzso and zzso of the two zzso we found that sequence motifs and the zzso properties of the duplexes appeared to be the major zzso of zzso zzso and that the strength of the zzso interaction between the two strands correlated zzso with zzso zzso 

The data presented zzso a model of zzso zzso by zzso in which the two strands are zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso species activate zzso These findings have relevance to the design of zzso particularly for in zzso or clinical zzso
