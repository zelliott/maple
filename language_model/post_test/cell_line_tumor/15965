Recent efforts have identified the zzso zzso zzso as a potential target for the treatment of inflammatory diseases as well as zzso cell lung zzso Despite the significance of zzso no direct activity probe compatible with cell zzso analysis zzso Instead, proxies for zzso zzso such as zzso zzso which do not distinguish between zzso zzso are often zzso Our laboratory has recently developed a zzso zzso zzso that zzso a significant increase in zzso in response to zzso at a zzso zzso allowing for real-time activity zzso zzso we report the rational design of a zzso zzso using this zzso We have validated the selectivity of this sensor using specific zzso and zzso and show that zzso activity can be monitored in crude zzso from a variety of cell lines, allowing for the potential use of this sensor in both clinical and basic science research zzso
