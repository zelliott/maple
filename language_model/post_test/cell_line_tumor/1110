It has been shown that zzso activity of zzso particles and zzso zzso are changed under the action of zzso of programmed cell zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso of zzso zzso and zzso to a significant stimulation of zzso activity of zzso and to reduction of zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity under study has been shown to be specifically and selectively dependent on zzso of zzso of zzso particles and zzso zzso The characteristics of zzso activity of different zzso of zzso zzso The specificity of a zzso of zzso exported from the cell has been zzso zzso and zzso involvement in the coordinated control of stability of various specific zzso zzso molecules is suggested, and one of the mechanisms of this control might be the export of specific zzso of zzso from the zzso
