zzso is a death zzso zzso protein identified as an zzso zzso of zzso and of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which are two members of the zzso family expressed on zzso zzso Although zzso expression is zzso in multiple pathological zzso little is known about the signaling zzso underlying the zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the mechanism of the zzso activity of zzso and an alternative zzso form lacking the death domain of zzso zzso in T zzso in which zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene are primarily zzso zzso of zzso proteins triggers a typical zzso process zzso by cell shrinkage and surface exposure of zzso and confirmed by zzso zzso zzso zzso is related to the zzso zzso zzso and results in zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso This zzso involves a zzso step evidenced by zzso of Bid and zzso c release, and is modulated by zzso of zzso or zzso The zzso for zzso zzso are not contained within the death domain found in the central part of zzso but rather in both the zzso and zzso regions shared by both zzso zzso The zzso region also zzso in the zzso of both zzso proteins into the nuclear zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso mediate zzso in T zzso via a zzso zzso zzso that likely involves both zzso and nuclear zzso
