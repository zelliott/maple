zzso zzso is a natural compound found in large zzso most notably in grapes and red wine, which has been shown to have zzso zzso and zzso zzso We examined whether zzso has any effect on growth and gene expression in the human zzso cancer zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso cell growth and zzso zzso in zzso human zzso cancer zzso We also investigated the effect of zzso on changes of global gene expression during zzso growth zzso and zzso in zzso cells using a human zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso Out of the zzso genes screened, 118 genes were founded to be affected in their expression levels by more than zzso after zzso treatment with 50 zzso M zzso zzso treatment of zzso cells at the final concentration of 50 zzso M for 6, 12, 24 and 48 h and gene expression patterns were analyzed by zzso zzso of the genes modulated more than zzso at three of the above times points divided the genes into 2 zzso Within these groups, there were specific zzso of genes whose expressions were substantially changed at the specified time zzso One of the most highly zzso genes found in this study was zzso zzso zzso zzso which has recently been shown to be involved in zzso zzso Although the precise roles of genes whose expression levels were found to zzso after zzso treatment remain to be zzso we hope that the new view of gene expression in human zzso cancer cells following zzso exposure, as offered by this study, provides clues for the mechanism of zzso zzso
