The activity and/or the level of the zzso zzso receptors zzso in liver and zzso are regulated by zzso Despite the association between ethanol consumption and breast cancer risk, and the increasing evidence for an involvement of zzso in some zzso there have been no studies on the effect of ethanol or its zzso zzso on zzso in breast zzso Using the zzso breast cancer cell line, we examined the relationship between ethanol and its zzso zzso on zzso and zzso zzso Ethanol (20 zzso reduced the potency of the zzso zzso zzso evident by a rightward shift in the zzso zzso curve, whereas for zzso zzso by zzso ethanol zzso its effects primarily through reducing efficacy as evidenced by a reduction in zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso we showed that zzso and zzso are zzso modulated by ethanol and zzso While zzso is responsible for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso with a concentration that zzso 50% of activity zzso of 111 zzso zzso has no effect on zzso or its zzso zzso Instead, zzso of zzso zzso is zzso directly by zzso The differential effect of ethanol and zzso on zzso and zzso further underscores the differences between these receptors and may indicate the relevance of zzso in the effects of ethanol in the human zzso
