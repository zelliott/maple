zzso or zzso cells lose zzso class I zzso expression during cancer progression as an escape mechanism from immune zzso These defects in zzso may be zzso by zzso or different agents zzso zzso or irreversible due to structural defects zzso zzso The nature of these zzso zzso might determine the success or failure of zzso zzso In this study, we have used an zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso which generates multiple lung and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso after treatment with zzso Four different zzso treatments were carried out after primary tumor zzso to determine their capacity to inhibit spontaneous zzso colonization of the zzso tumor zzso We found that 2 different zzso protocols zzso plus zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso K zzso and 1 zzso zzso plus zzso induced zzso of zzso In contrast, chemotherapy with zzso alone produced only partial reduction in the number of zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso populations showed an zzso in zzso zzso host, which could be reverted by zzso zzso Our results suggest that irreversible or zzso zzso zzso in tumor target cells may determine its progression or zzso independently of the type of zzso zzso
