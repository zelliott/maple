zzso are zzso alcohols zzso through the zzso zzso zzso in animal zzso The zzso is the principal source of zzso in zzso Here we report on the formation of novel zzso zzso formed by the zzso zzso in human zzso The zzso zzso cell line zzso possesses high zzso zzso activity and incubation of zzso cells with zzso acid led to the formation of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso In addition, two zzso unidentified products were detected and these products were collected and analyzed by positive zzso zzso tandem mass zzso These zzso were identified as zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso cells with synthetic zzso zzso also led to the formation of zzso and zzso Several soluble zzso zzso in particular zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found to catalyze the conversion of zzso to zzso zzso cells produced approximately twice as much zzso as zzso zzso upon stimulation with zzso zzso Human zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells selectively formed zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso after stimulation with zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso alone zzso the conversion of zzso acid to zzso zzso and zzso zzso showing that human zzso possesses intrinsic zzso zzso zzso
