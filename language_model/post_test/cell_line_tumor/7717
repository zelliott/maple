It has long been shown that therapeutic ultrasound has the potential to affect cells surfaces and zzso In this study, the effects of ultrasound in near field mode, the zzso drug zzso and their combined application were studied on human zzso cells zzso Four modes of treatment were zzso exposure to zzso field, application of zzso exposure to ultrasound followed by zzso and zzso treatment followed by exposure to near field zzso The value of viability was measured by standard zzso zzso The value of ultrasound intensity was set 1 W zzso zzso and 1 zzso frequency was zzso The real value of acoustic pressure during in zzso experiments was assessed by zzso The results showed that a combined effect of ultrasound and zzso influenced the viability of human zzso cells zzso more than the application of ultrasound or zzso zzso It could be assumed that exposure of cells to zzso field had an immediate effect on the structure of cell surface and consequently on the entry of zzso into the zzso The results of our experiments demonstrated possibility of using therapeutic ultrasound in zzso the zzso treatment of human zzso zzso
