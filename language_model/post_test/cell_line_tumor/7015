Considering the potential role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the involvement of different cell types especially zzso and zzso in those zzso the regulation of zzso biological responses is zzso In this report we provide zzso that zzso a cardiac zzso potentially inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or nerve growth factor zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso inhibited zzso but not zzso zzso genes zzso zzso inhibited the binding of zzso zzso or zzso but not zzso or zzso It decreased almost zzso zzso binding without altering affinity towards zzso receptors and this zzso of zzso binding was observed in isolated zzso The zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso were unable to protect zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso significantly protected zzso zzso of zzso binding thereby restoring zzso zzso zzso zzso altered the membrane fluidity as detected by zzso zzso and a decrease in zzso a zzso binding zzso binding in a zzso zzso Overall, our results suggest that zzso zzso zzso biological responses in diverse cell types by modulating zzso through altering membrane fluidity and zzso The study might help to regulate zzso biological responses involved in zzso zzso and zzso
