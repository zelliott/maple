zzso cancer zzso is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men in the Western zzso When zzso fails to eradicate the primary zzso zzso is generally zzso to all therapeutic zzso zzso acid zzso is a promising zzso agent recently assigned to the class of zzso zzso zzso zzso However molecular mechanisms underlying zzso action in zzso cells are largely unknown and further experimental validation to prove its potential application in clinic practice is zzso 

In our study we show that zzso is a potent zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, both in zzso and in zzso zzso was an early event zzso through the expression of zzso zzso markers within 72 zzso after zzso treatment and it was associated to a reduction in the overall cell zzso When we interrupted zzso treatment we observed the recovery in residual cells of the zzso proliferation rate both in zzso and in a zzso zzso The zzso process was related to zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells and to the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso The use of specific zzso zzso was able to reduce significantly the expression of zzso markers induced by zzso 

Our data indicate that the use of zzso as zzso in zzso has to be considered with extreme caution, since it may induce an zzso zzso In order to counteract the zzso zzso the zzso of zzso may represent a suitable zzso treatment strategy and awaits further experimental zzso
