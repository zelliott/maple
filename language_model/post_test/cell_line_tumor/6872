We analyzed the differential gene expression between zzso of zzso human breast cancer cell line that share an identical genetic background but have different zzso zzso The major zzso complex class II was found zzso in highly zzso cells and correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression observed in poorly zzso is driven by promoters III and IV of zzso zzso zzso both promoters were ineffective in highly zzso zzso The zzso class II and zzso expression was restored in these cells upon stimulation with zzso or by the treatment with a zzso zzso Both treatments induced zzso and zzso binding complexes to promoter IV but only zzso induced the binding of zzso nuclear proteins to an zzso site at the promoter zzso Neither Southern zzso nor zzso sequencing of promoter IV demonstrated strong zzso of this promoter at the zzso elements such as zzso zzso or zzso We suggest that partial or zzso of promoter IV is sufficient to silence the zzso expression in highly zzso cells and that this zzso mechanism is responsible for the lack of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression restored the zzso zzso expression in zzso cells and abrogates spontaneous lung zzso in both zzso and nude mice but also affected the zzso in nude zzso The increase in zzso cell zzso in nude mice bearing zzso correlated with sign of tumor cell zzso and the increase in the number of zzso cells in the zzso suggesting that zzso cells might be responsible for the observed zzso zzso
