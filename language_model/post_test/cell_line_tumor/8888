Our previous study showed that zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso and zzso its zzso zzso is required for zzso to bind and repress zzso zzso However, the mechanism through which zzso of zzso by zzso leads to its zzso remains to be zzso Here, we demonstrate that binding between the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the 7th and 8th zzso zzso of zzso mediates zzso zzso zzso within the 7th and 8th zzso zzso of zzso that block binding to a zzso zzso block zzso zzso and its ability to bind and repress zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is also directly demonstrated in zzso by size exclusion zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso function of zzso by preventing its recruitment to zzso and zzso binding upon zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso treatment, and this effect is dependent on zzso zzso at zzso Thus, zzso can switch the zzso function from checkpoint zzso to zzso regulation by regulating its zzso zzso This zzso of regulation is clinically zzso since treatment of a specific zzso inhibitor in zzso cancer cells zzso zzso zzso and causes its function to zzso from promoting survival to checkpoint zzso
