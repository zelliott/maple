zzso zzso are homogeneous zzso for rapid detection of specific zzso zzso These zzso zzso have been applied in various molecular sensing applications, such as real-time zzso chain reaction and detection of bacterial zzso zzso In this study, we present the design and zzso of zzso zzso for zzso gene expression analysis in living zzso With alternating zzso zzso for zzso the stability and zzso we show that the probe is stable in living cells for over 72 hours zzso and is capable of detecting changes in gene expression induced by external zzso The zzso can be delivered to a large number of cells simultaneously by zzso zzso zzso or to individual cells selectively by zzso zzso We also demonstrate that the probe zzso zzso zzso in living cells through the use of an equilibrium zzso With its effectiveness and performance, the zzso probe represents a broadly zzso approach for large-scale zzso gene expression analysis toward numerous biomedical applications, such as systems biology, cancer, and drug zzso
