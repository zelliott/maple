zzso zzso a naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and causes cell cycle arrest at zzso phase in tumor zzso However, the zzso effect and specific mechanism of zzso in zzso cell lung cancer zzso are still poorly zzso In this study, we determined the zzso effect and potential mechanism of zzso in the zzso cell line, zzso zzso First, we demonstrated that zzso significantly zzso the proliferation of zzso cells in zzso and the growth of zzso zzso in zzso In further studies, zzso triggered zzso in zzso cells with the following zzso zzso zzso cell death zzso zzso zzso zzso loss of plasma membrane zzso zzso loss of zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso of zzso oxygen species zzso and zzso specific zzso of zzso via a small zzso zzso This study also revealed that zzso has a similar effect towards the zzso cancer cell line, zzso and the drug-resistant cell line, zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report to document the induction of zzso by a zzso agent to circumvent cancer drug resistance, thereby providing a new potential choice for clinical cancer therapy, especially drug-resistant cancer zzso
