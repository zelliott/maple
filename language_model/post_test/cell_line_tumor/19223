Nuclear zzso zzso zzso plays a pivotal role in cancer zzso In this study, we developed a decoy zzso zzso acid against zzso zzso site zzso zzso which effectively zzso zzso zzso activity, and tested the effect of combined therapy zzso local zzso of zzso zzso into the liver and zzso injection of zzso on cancer growth and zzso using an zzso zzso model of colon cancer liver zzso For zzso zzso zzso we employed a novel approach using ultrasound exposure with an zzso contrast agent, zzso We examined the influence of zzso zzso transfer on zzso to zzso in cancer cells and the mechanism involved using several in zzso analysis zzso We then studied the in zzso effect of combined zzso zzso transfer and zzso in preventing cancer progression using a zzso model of liver zzso created by zzso injection of a human colon cancer cell line, zzso In zzso experiments, including zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso array analysis, revealed that zzso zzso transfer significantly increased the zzso of cancer cells to zzso and that decreased expression of zzso genes along with increased expression of genes relevant to the zzso may be zzso In zzso experiments showed that local zzso of zzso zzso into the liver followed by portal injection of zzso effectively induced cancer cell zzso in the liver zzso and significantly prolonged animal survival compared to controls, without notable side zzso In conclusion, a combination of local zzso zzso transfer into the liver and zzso injection of zzso may be a safe and effective new therapy for liver zzso
