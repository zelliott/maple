zzso zzso zzso plays a key role to zzso zzso and prevent zzso There are two major elements for the induction of zzso such as zzso zzso far from the promoter site, and zzso zzso near to the promoter zzso In a previous report, we showed that the zzso zzso site is essential for the induction of zzso by zzso zzso zzso In this report, we investigated the influence of zzso on the induction of the zzso reporter gene by zzso and zzso with zzso zzso We confirmed that zzso was transferred from zzso into the nucleus in zzso zzso by zzso zzso but zzso was zzso We constructed a reporter gene containing zzso to compare the induction of the reporter gene without zzso by zzso The results show that induction of the reporter gene with zzso by zzso at 100 zzso is the same level as the induction of the reporter gene without zzso although zzso contains zzso zzso of zzso with the reporter gene did not show any influence of the induction of the reporter gene between the zzso with and without zzso Meanwhile, by zzso of zzso the induction of the reporter gene with zzso was significantly more than the induction of the reporter gene without zzso at 100 zzso zzso This supports that zzso induced zzso through zzso by zzso These results showed that zzso has no relation with the induction by zzso but the zzso site of zzso may function in stimulation by zzso
