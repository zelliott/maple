zzso sense, zzso and respond to stimuli generated by zzso or neural zzso this response involves gap junction zzso zzso zzso vulnerability to injury increased when zzso of zzso and zzso were exposed to zzso zzso However, zzso zzso could limit the extension of a zzso We investigated a possible link between zzso communication and zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein of 21 zzso that is predominantly expressed and zzso by zzso which has zzso zzso activity on zzso growth, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were analyzed in isolated zzso in primary cultures from zzso acute zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells, which were used as a negative zzso Our data indicate that zzso blocking stimulates zzso zzso in zzso cultures and acute zzso zzso Different zzso were used to confirm cell integrity during exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed with different types of zzso zzso the resulting event was dependent on time, the nature of the zzso its putative molecular target of zzso zzso and/or the cell preparation zzso Only zzso induced a fast and persistent increase in zzso zzso in both zzso zzso increased zzso zzso in zzso cultures at 1 zzso but a decrease was observed at 6 zzso or in acute zzso zzso Physiologically, a local zzso closure associated with release of zzso in injury conditions favors the idea of a common mechanism available to limit the extension of zzso and increase the chances of cell zzso
