Previous reports indicated the presence of both zzso and zzso in the nuclear envelope zzso of primary zzso and the zzso neural cell zzso zzso one of the major zzso of this zzso was shown to be tightly associated with a zzso zzso in the inner membrane of the zzso and to zzso zzso zzso zzso was the other major zzso detected in the zzso and, like zzso occurs in both inner and outer zzso A subsequent report indicated the presence of zzso activity in the zzso without zzso as to which of the two zzso express zzso The present study was undertaken to determine the nature and locus of this activity within the zzso of two cell zzso zzso and zzso Western zzso analysis of the separated zzso revealed occurrence of zzso in the inner membrane and zzso in the outer membrane of the zzso Moreover, zzso activity at both sites was shown capable of catalyzing conversion of zzso zzso to zzso
