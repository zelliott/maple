zzso statins have been shown to inhibit growth of pancreatic cancer cells in zzso and in zzso zzso studies also indicate a zzso effect of zzso We have investigated the effect of statins on zzso zzso B zzso We found that zzso decreased zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso also inhibited zzso in combination with zzso and zzso and zzso cells to zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of cell zzso In line with our previous data, it was found that the zzso zzso zzso the effects of statins in zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, experiments employing zzso zzso and zzso supported an involvement of zzso In zzso cells, which expressed zzso in low levels, statins did not reduce zzso levels nor did statins sensitize them to zzso zzso However, zzso inhibited the growth of zzso cells and this correlated to zzso of zzso and zzso zzso As shown zzso these latter effects can be explained by an inhibited protein zzso Our data suggest that statins primarily target a functional zzso signaling in pancreatic cancer zzso By targeting the zzso zzso statins can sensitize pancreatic cancer cells to zzso zzso Our data are also in line with a role for zzso in the zzso effect of statins on pancreatic zzso
