zzso is a major zzso of zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso mediates most of the well-known zzso activities of zzso In this study, we report zzso activities induced by therapeutic application of zzso in restricting tumor growth and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice carrying zzso tumor exhibit no gross zzso in the number of zzso zzso but have exaggerated zzso in the zzso Administration of zzso is able to zzso blood vessels in the tumor in the absence of zzso and retains certain therapeutic efficacy even when applied late during tumor zzso zzso exposure in zzso does not zzso alter the zzso of the zzso Finally, global gene expression analysis of primary tumors reveals zzso molecular patterns and changes, implicating a number of novel genes potentially important for zzso immune responses against the zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
