Bone zzso is one of the most common clinical phenomena of late stage lung zzso A major impediment to understanding the zzso of bone zzso has been the lack of an appropriate animal and cell zzso This study aims to establish human lung zzso cell line with highly bone zzso potency with zzso bone zzso 

The human lung zzso cancer cells zzso were injected into the left cardiac zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso mice were zzso with zzso bone zzso on a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images were acquired on a zzso conventional gamma camera with a zzso pinhole zzso The mice with bone zzso were sacrificed under deep zzso and the zzso were zzso Bone zzso cancer cells in the zzso zzso were subjected for culture and then zzso into the zzso mice through left cardiac zzso The process was repeated for eight cycles to obtain a novel cell zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso was used to compare the gene expression differences in the parental and zzso zzso 

The bone zzso sites were successfully revealed by bone zzso The established bone zzso cell line zzso had a high potential to zzso in bone, including zzso zzso zzso vertebra, zzso zzso zzso zzso and cartilage zzso The expression level of vascular zzso growth factor gene family, zzso and cell zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Gene expression difference was found between parental and zzso zzso cell zzso which indicates zzso has zzso capacity zzso its parental zzso 

zzso is a zzso zzso human lung zzso cell zzso Bone zzso may be used as an accurate, sensitive, zzso tool to detect experimental bone zzso in intact live zzso zzso
