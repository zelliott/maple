zzso cancer is one of the most common zzso worldwide, and liver zzso is a poor zzso factor for all types of zzso zzso including colon zzso We studied zzso zzso zzso zzso therapy for zzso liver cancer in zzso 

We studied whether in zzso infection of a rat colon cancer cell line zzso with an zzso that expresses the zzso zzso induced zzso zzso In zzso to confirm the zzso effect induced by zzso the tumor cells that had been zzso by zzso were implanted into the subcutaneous zzso of zzso rats zzso zzso or zzso was injected into the tumor zzso of the rats zzso zzso Furthermore, immune cells including zzso cells, zzso T cells, and zzso zzso induced by zzso were zzso 

zzso therapy using zzso suppressed the tumor growth strongly or reduced tumor size in the prevention model and treatment zzso zzso cells, zzso T cells, and zzso zzso contributed to this zzso effect in both zzso 

These observations suggest that zzso zzso therapy for zzso colon cancer in the liver and lungs is effective and is zzso by the zzso of both the cellular and zzso immune zzso
