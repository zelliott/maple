PET using zzso zzso allows improved imaging of tumor extent of cerebral zzso in comparison to zzso In experimental brain zzso and zzso an unspecific zzso of zzso has been detected in the area of zzso zzso which is a common cellular reaction in the vicinity of cerebral zzso The aim of this study was to investigate possible zzso zzso in the area of zzso zzso in the vicinity of zzso and zzso rat zzso 

zzso cells were implanted into the zzso nucleus of 33 Fisher zzso zzso Sixteen animals remained zzso and in 17 animals the tumor was zzso by zzso zzso 5-8 days after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso After zzso days of tumor growth the animals were sacrificed following injection of zzso zzso were removed, cut in zzso sections and zzso of zzso distribution were produced and compared with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the tumors and in areas of zzso zzso was evaluated by zzso to brain ratios zzso 

Large zzso were present in all animals showing increased zzso which was similar in zzso and zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A pronounced zzso zzso was noted in the vicinity of all tumors that showed significantly lower zzso than the tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The area of zzso in the tumor was zzso with zzso tumor extent in zzso zzso In 2 rats zzso with 150 zzso however, high zzso zzso was noted in the area of zzso which led to an zzso of the tumor zzso 

zzso zzso in the vicinity of zzso generally leads to only a slight zzso that appears not to affect the correct definition of tumor extent for treatment zzso
