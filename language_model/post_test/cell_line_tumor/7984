The zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is unexpectedly required for proper cell division and faithful zzso segregation during zzso Although it is zzso attractive to assume that zzso zzso zzso may strictly engage cell's energy status, cell grow, and cell division to avoid that energy stresses trigger cell death, the ultimate framework of zzso activity towards zzso and zzso zzso regulation is a question that remains zzso We zzso reveal that the active form of the zzso zzso zzso zzso not its total form zzso associates with several zzso structures including zzso zzso zzso the central zzso zzso and the zzso throughout all of the zzso stages and zzso in human zzso zzso zzso At zzso zzso associates with the two zzso of zzso that begin to zzso from mature zzso The overlapping zzso of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso is also apparent on the zzso near the zzso poles in zzso and in early zzso This Aurora zzso zzso zzso of zzso cannot be detected following zzso separation following zzso zzso Rather, toward the end of zzso and in zzso zzso zzso exhibited a similar but not identical zzso to that occupied by the bona fide zzso passenger proteins zzso and zzso This zzso of zzso at the central zzso and zzso persisted during the zzso process and, at the completion of zzso zzso of zzso as zzso was apparent on either side of the zzso within the zzso zzso zzso An identical zzso geography of zzso was observed in cancer cells lacking the zzso zzso zzso in zzso human zzso cells, and in mouse zzso The active form of zzso bound to the zzso apparatus may physically zzso the zzso state of a cell to the zzso regulation of the zzso and zzso zzso events, thus suggesting a putative zzso zzso zzso In this newly discovered scenario, we suggest a primordial zzso role for the alpha zzso zzso zzso in the zzso evolutionary process as it may zzso at the cell level, an exquisite coordination between sensing of energy resources and the fundamental biological process of zzso zzso
