We investigated the potential of zzso and zzso zzso as zzso zzso for tumor zzso The two zzso had similar distribution patterns in rats bearing zzso zzso with zzso and, on a lesser extent, zzso showing the highest zzso zzso of both zzso in the zzso and zzso ratios of zzso (with the exception of zzso gradually increased for 60 zzso zzso was metabolically stable, whereas a negligible low amount of zzso was observed for zzso Both zzso showed the potential for tumor zzso
