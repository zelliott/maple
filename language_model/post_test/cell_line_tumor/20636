zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso play a role in zzso zzso cell zzso Since zzso receptors are potential targets for various diseases related to zzso cell dysfunction and cancer, the purpose of this study was to investigate the expression and to functionally characterize the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cancer cells zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in an zzso zzso increase zzso effective concentration zzso 40 zzso zzso zzso zzso produced a similar zzso response and zzso was zzso The rank order of tested zzso was zzso zzso This confirms the functional expression of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso cancer cell zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were found, whereas western zzso analysis suggested only the expression of zzso zzso zzso imaging and nuclear zzso was used to zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso indicating a role for zzso zzso in regulating nuclear function, by increasing nuclear zzso zzso These data define the expression profile of zzso receptors on human zzso zzso cancer cells and indicate zzso receptors as being potential targets in new treatment strategies for zzso zzso
