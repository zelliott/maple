zzso attachment on titanium surfaces is necessary to achieve new bone formation and zzso The purpose of this study was to examine zzso attachment on zzso titanium zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso and titanium zzso zzso surfaces were zzso with either a carbon dioxide zzso or an zzso zzso A control group of zzso disks was also zzso zzso cultures were cultivated on the titanium disks and examined with scanning electron zzso 

The findings demonstrated that zzso could be grown on all of the zzso zzso and a spread of cells that demonstrated maturation were observed on the zzso zzso titanium zzso 

The data show that laser zzso of titanium surfaces may promote zzso attachment and further bone zzso
