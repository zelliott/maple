A number of small zzso are involved in cancer cell zzso migration and invasion, acting as molecular switches that cycle between zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso have been established as a major class of negative regulators of zzso zzso zzso To investigate the biological function of zzso zzso toward zzso in cancer cell invasion and zzso we generated a zzso made of the zzso domain of zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso it into human pancreatic cancer cells, zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso of zzso as well as zzso and zzso to a lesser extent, was significantly inhibited in zzso zzso zzso cells compared with that of control cells zzso when assessed by pull-down zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso invasion of zzso zzso zzso was significantly inhibited compared with that of zzso cells in a modified zzso chamber zzso Furthermore, the mice injected zzso with zzso cells that zzso the zzso zzso had a marked reduction in the number and size of zzso zzso in the zzso These data suggest that the zzso action of zzso zzso toward zzso offers a novel approach to the treatment of invasion and zzso of cancer zzso
