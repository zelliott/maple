zzso of zzso transition zzso is essential for the zzso of tumor cells and maintaining their zzso This study aimed to examine whether zzso cells, which are most closely located to tumor cells in zzso play a role in inducing zzso in tumor cells or zzso 

zzso culture medium of bovine zzso zzso cells zzso was applied to tumor cell lines zzso and zzso and zzso cell line zzso zzso conversion, expressions of zzso muscle zzso and zzso zzso fiber formation and cell migration were examined as hallmarks of the induction of zzso in these cell zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso were used to neutralize zzso zzso and zzso zzso and release of zzso proteins in zzso as well as in zzso and human zzso cells were assessed by Western zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso medium of zzso induced zzso in the examined cell zzso All zzso cells from various species and locations expressed zzso and zzso proteins and much lower level of zzso zzso zzso medium from these zzso cells contained zzso and zzso but zzso could not be zzso zzso zzso against each of zzso or zzso did not reverse zzso zzso but simultaneous zzso of both zzso and zzso completely abolished zzso 

zzso cells may play a role in the induction and maintenance of zzso in tumor cells by zzso releasing zzso and zzso 

The present results provide a novel strategy of the zzso of tumor zzso by targeting vascular zzso
