zzso remains one of the most widespread human infectious diseases, and its zzso will largely depend on zzso drug zzso Here, we present a novel approach to the development of the zzso class of zzso by describing the design, zzso and characterization of novel zzso A derivatives consisting of different zzso zzso zzso liked to a zzso zzso scaffold at position zzso By zzso straightforward zzso 19 new, stable, and soluble compounds were created and biologically zzso Most active compounds from the zzso series showed high selectivity for zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso activity improved zzso over zzso zzso potency was equivalent to zzso against the sensitive strain zzso and up to zzso enhanced over zzso against the zzso strain zzso zzso the zzso activity of the compounds was zzso thus zzso the development of zzso zzso zzso
