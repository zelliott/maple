Our previous studies demonstrated that two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso exhibit potent zzso zzso In this study, a series of zzso were zzso and subjected to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso and zzso on the B ring of zzso tended to increase the zzso activity and decrease the zzso zzso Of these, compounds 19 and 24 exhibited the most potent zzso effects on zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso without significant zzso on a human cancer cell line (up to 20 zzso Further studies indicated that compounds 19 and 24 inhibited zzso zzso via prevention of zzso zzso zzso The potent and novel effects of zzso derivatives make them attractive candidates for the development of new zzso zzso
