zzso is a cell cycle regulated zzso zzso that is highly expressed in zzso cell lines and has an established role in cell proliferation and zzso This is the first study to examine the clinical significance of zzso expression in zzso cell lung cancer zzso zzso was zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso Patients with zzso positive tumors had significantly reduced recurrence-free survival than patients with zzso negative zzso Moreover, zzso was more highly expressed in patients with recurrence of disease at distant sites, suggesting that zzso levels may correlate with zzso distant zzso Overall, these findings establish zzso as a potentially valuable novel zzso for zzso lung zzso
