The mechanism by which human zzso zzso stimulates zzso is zzso Because cellular zzso and transformation require zzso zzso by expression of the zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso we examined the role of zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso human zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso zzso cell lines were infected with zzso or zzso with expression zzso zzso zzso immediate early zzso zzso 72 or zzso zzso expression and promoter activity and zzso activity were evaluated using reverse zzso chain reaction, a zzso reporter zzso and a zzso repeat amplification zzso zzso zzso promoter occupancy by the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was assessed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein expression in human primary zzso zzso zzso was determined zzso All statistical tests were zzso 

In zzso and zzso zzso zzso infection induced zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso The zzso promoter activity in zzso and zzso cell lines was statistically significantly enhanced by zzso in a zzso manner zzso zzso activity zzso zzso in control zzso and in zzso infected with zzso at zzso of infection zzso of zzso zzso 6 and zzso respectively, difference zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 178 to zzso mean activity at zzso of 1 and 10 zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso comparing control with zzso cells at all zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso protein also zzso zzso promoter activity in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene was dependent on the presence of zzso sites in the zzso promoter and was accompanied by increases in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and a reduction in zzso binding at the core zzso In specimens of zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins were zzso in zzso cells and their levels paralleled each zzso 

zzso activates zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso These findings begin to reveal a novel mechanism by which zzso infection may be linked to or zzso zzso through zzso zzso
