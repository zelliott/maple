Most patients with zzso zzso melanoma develop resistance to selective zzso zzso zzso The spectrum of clinical genetic resistance mechanisms to zzso zzso and options for salvage therapy are incompletely zzso We performed zzso sequencing on zzso zzso tumors from 45 patients with zzso zzso melanoma who received zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso in known or putative zzso inhibitor resistance genes were observed in 23 of 45 patients zzso Besides previously characterized zzso we discovered a zzso zzso of new zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso inhibitor zzso In three cases, multiple resistance gene zzso were observed within the same tumor zzso Overall, zzso inhibitor therapy leads to diverse clinical genetic resistance mechanisms, mostly involving zzso zzso zzso Novel therapeutic combinations may be needed to achieve durable clinical control of zzso zzso zzso clinical zzso with zzso screens may model subsequent resistance zzso
