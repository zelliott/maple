Three novel structurally related zzso named zzso were isolated from the zzso of the zzso bee zzso zzso Their primary sequences were established as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These zzso exhibited potent zzso activity against both zzso and zzso bacteria, low zzso and mast cell zzso activity, and a potency to kill various cancer cells in zzso The zzso CD zzso were measured in the presence of zzso and sodium zzso zzso solution and indicated a high degree of zzso zzso zzso zzso which was carried out in zzso confirmed a curved zzso zzso with a zzso zzso and convex zzso zzso To understand the role of this bend on biological activity, we studied zzso zzso in which the zzso in the zzso of the zzso was replaced by other zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso The importance of the zzso part of the zzso to the zzso activity was revealed through zzso of five zzso from both the N and C zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in a drop in zzso activity, but zzso of the C zzso had no zzso zzso zzso of zzso and the observed zzso contacts indicated the possible formation of a zzso zzso between hydrogen from the zzso zzso zzso bond and one H of the zzso zzso to the zzso oxygen zzso Such interactions cannot form with zzso zzso
