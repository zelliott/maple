zzso is an organic small zzso that promotes zzso and growth of cultured human cells by binding selectively to zzso zzso on the cell zzso The present study combined chemical, zzso and cell biological experiments, using zzso and its zzso to examine the mechanism by which this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso relevant cell zzso The results suggest that multiple zzso molecules zzso bind to zzso zzso and induce its zzso promoting zzso of zzso zzso zzso on the cell zzso A pilot study showed that zzso improved the viability and attachment of transplanted cells in zzso Further studies of zzso and other small molecules could lead to the design of zzso molecules for use in cell biology and cell zzso
