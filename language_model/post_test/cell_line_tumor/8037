Cell surface proteins have been shown to be effective therapeutic zzso In addition, shed forms of these proteins and zzso proteins can serve as zzso for diseases, including zzso Thus, identification of cell surface and zzso proteins has been a prime area of interest in the zzso zzso Most cell surface and zzso proteins are known to be zzso and therefore, a zzso strategy targeting these proteins was applied to obtain zzso profiles from various zzso cancer cell lines that represent the range of zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso In this study, we oxidized the carbohydrates of zzso proteins and those on the cell surface with zzso and isolated them via zzso zzso to zzso zzso The zzso obtained were identified from zzso peptides and zzso zzso released from the zzso zzso using two-dimensional liquid zzso mass zzso in combination with the gas phase zzso zzso cancer cell lines derived from zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso cancer zzso and zzso were zzso An average of 150 zzso were identified per cell line, of which more than 57% are known cell surface or zzso zzso The usefulness of the approach for identifying zzso cancer associated zzso was validated by the identification of zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 and zzso inhibitor 1) that have been found to be useful markers for zzso zzso In addition to zzso that are commonly expressed by all of the cell lines, we identified others that are only expressed in the more zzso zzso cancer cell lines zzso zzso cell and zzso or by cell lines derived from zzso tumors that are zzso fatal forms of zzso cancer zzso zzso On the basis of the results zzso a set of zzso zzso candidates for zzso cancer is zzso
