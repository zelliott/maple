zzso have been used by mankind as medicine and food for more than 13,000 zzso Marine algae are considered to produce a valuable zzso characterized by a broad spectrum of zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to explore the effect of different zzso extracts of zzso zzso zzso against Dalton's zzso zzso zzso in Swiss male zzso zzso zzso cells were injected zzso 1 zzso cell to the zzso Two days after cells injection the animals were treated with different zzso extracts of zzso zzso at dose of 200 zzso zzso for 14 zzso zzso (20 zzso zzso was used as reference zzso On day 11, cancer cell number, packed cell volume, decrease in zzso weight of the mice, increase in life span and zzso parameters were evaluated and compared with the same parameters in zzso A significant increase in the life span and a decrease in the cancer cell number and zzso weight were noted in the zzso mice after treatment with the zzso The zzso parameters were also zzso by the zzso and zzso extracts in zzso zzso These observations are suggestive of the protective effect of zzso extract of zzso zzso is comparatively better than other two tested extracts against Dalton's zzso zzso zzso
