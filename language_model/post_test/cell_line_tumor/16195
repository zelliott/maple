zzso cells release zzso DNA into the surroundings where the DNA is first zzso to zzso then to zzso zzso and so zzso Given that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is characteristic of bacterial DNA, is also contained in zzso DNA and has been reported to be involved in the zzso of zzso zzso diseases, we investigated whether zzso and zzso affect immune responses to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA to zzso zzso zzso cells, induced no significant zzso production irrespective of treatment with zzso zzso however, zzso zzso but not zzso zzso DNA increased the zzso zzso zzso zzso This increase was not observed with zzso DNA or zzso for zzso zzso or zzso zzso with a zzso showed similar effects to those of zzso zzso zzso DNA, but zzso zzso DNA or zzso did zzso zzso injection of zzso DNA into the mouse zzso induced little swelling of the zzso however, significant swelling was observed when zzso zzso DNA was zzso with zzso zzso These results imply that zzso zzso inflammatory responses are increased by DNA molecules with a zzso such molecules could therefore be considered as zzso factors for zzso zzso zzso
