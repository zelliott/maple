To investigate the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso on regulating the proliferation of human zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso from human zzso blood was added to cultured human zzso zzso zzso zzso cells in zzso for various treatment zzso The expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso involved in proliferation and differentiation of cells was analyzed by Northern zzso and the expression of zzso zzso and zzso proteins was determined by Western zzso 

The results showed that zzso (20 zzso zzso zzso expression of these zzso in zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso increased by zzso zzso zzso and zzso at 2, 6, 12, and 24 zzso zzso The expression of zzso and zzso zzso reached to the maximum which increased by zzso and zzso as compared with the control after 6 h and 24 h incubation with zzso zzso Western zzso zzso also demonstrated that zzso promoted the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the increased rate of those proteins was zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso and zzso at 6, 12, and 24 zzso respectively, as compared with the zzso Both human serum zzso (the same dosage as zzso and zzso zzso zzso failed to stimulate the expression of these zzso but zzso zzso could block the functions of zzso 

The data indicate that zzso can stimulate the expression of some zzso to enhance the proliferation of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
