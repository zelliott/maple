The zzso zzso is zzso expressed in the central nervous system by zzso and zzso controlling zzso survival and zzso In this work, we analyzed the expression and function of the zzso zzso and its zzso zzso by human zzso zzso We show that both molecules are expressed on the tumor cell plasma membrane and that soluble zzso accumulates in the culture zzso indicating that the zzso is zzso zzso We found that zzso is functional, as all the cell lines zzso to immobilized zzso zzso and migrated in response to the soluble form of this zzso In addition, the blockade of zzso zzso function by means of a zzso zzso zzso markedly delayed tumor cell zzso and increased their zzso We also show that zzso expression is zzso modulated by the transforming growth zzso zzso a key regulator of zzso cell zzso Indeed, both the treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso and the zzso of its zzso expression by zzso showed that zzso decreases zzso zzso and protein zzso Overall, our results indicate that zzso expressed zzso zzso regulates zzso invasion likely by promoting tumor cell zzso and that zzso zzso of zzso expression might contribute to zzso cell invasive zzso
