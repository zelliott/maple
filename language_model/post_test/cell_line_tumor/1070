The zzso factor nuclear zzso zzso is activated in response to various stimuli including zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso forms of the zzso inhibitor zzso or by zzso zzso enhances both sensitivity to radiation and zzso zzso Human zzso zzso zzso cells zzso expressing a zzso zzso 1 to 84) of human zzso have been shown to exhibit zzso of both zzso zzso zzso and its zzso The zzso protein also inhibited zzso zzso zzso by preventing the zzso of zzso This resulted in enhancement of cellular zzso and zzso zzso The zzso region of zzso is thus a potential molecular target for disruption of zzso zzso and zzso of tumors to zzso
