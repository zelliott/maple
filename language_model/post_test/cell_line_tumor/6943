zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso plays a vital role in multiple zzso of zzso in gastric cancer zzso To investigate the effect of zzso depletion on zzso and zzso of gastric cancer zzso 

zzso expression was blocked by small zzso zzso The expression levels of zzso zzso zzso B and zzso 3 were detected by Western zzso Then, zzso zzso zzso activity, cell zzso cell cycle phase distribution, zzso zzso structure, and the rate of zzso of the zzso zzso cells were zzso 

zzso gene zzso was associated with increased zzso B zzso increased zzso activity (but not with the expression zzso zzso of gastric cancer cells at zzso improper zzso zzso formation, delayed zzso separation and delayed or arrested zzso Moreover, zzso depletion in gastric cancer cells was associated with decreased zzso attenuated zzso 3 levels and increased zzso 

zzso of zzso expression may lead to decreased zzso or even zzso in gastric cancer cells, indicating that zzso may be a valuable therapeutic target for gastric zzso
