zzso independence and progression to a zzso zzso are hallmarks of therapeutic resistance and mortality in breast cancer zzso zzso has been associated with zzso signaling through the zzso zzso Thus, the development of zzso independence and zzso therapy resistance in breast cancer patients may be driven by zzso zzso Here we report that zzso zzso is indeed correlated with worse prognosis and decreased patient survival irrespective of the status of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in poorly zzso zzso cells led to enhanced tumor growth and zzso that could be reversed by zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells promoted zzso independence in zzso whereas zzso zzso treatment negated the zzso effects of treatment with the zzso zzso zzso on zzso tumor zzso The effects of zzso zzso were correlated with zzso zzso of downstream signaling via zzso and zzso zzso zzso activated protein zzso and with an enhancement of zzso gene zzso Together, these results show that enhanced zzso signaling is sufficient to drive zzso breast zzso to a zzso and zzso zzso zzso via increased zzso zzso Our findings highlight zzso signaling as a rational therapeutic target for the treatment of zzso zzso breast zzso needing improved clinical zzso
