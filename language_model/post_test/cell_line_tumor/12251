We evaluated the changes of zzso induction and cellular zinc distribution in zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was observed in the zzso and zzso of zzso which was observed predominantly in the cells treated with zzso and zinc compared to those with zinc alone, zzso alone or the zzso zzso The cellular zinc level was higher in order of the zzso and zzso cells, the zzso cells, and the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso population increased in zzso cells and zzso and zzso cells, but not in zzso zzso Cellular zzso distribution was analyzed using zzso zzso induced X-ray zzso In zzso sample, X-ray zzso showed good consistency between the enhanced cellular zinc distribution and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso followed by zzso treatment were found accompanying a spatial correlation with the zzso zzso The samples treated with zzso and zinc showed the marked zzso of zinc and zzso zzso zzso zzso sites were clearly visible with a strong spatial correlation followed by zinc zzso These findings suggest that zzso in combination with zinc predominantly zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso In addition, zzso may promote the zzso of zzso zinc from zzso to zzso zzso
