zzso zzso 2 zzso is crucial for embryonic development, affects zzso signaling relevant for immune responses, and is often significantly zzso in solid tumors, but little is known of its role in human lung zzso In this study, we demonstrated the zzso expression of zzso in lung cancer zzso and investigated zzso properties of zzso in human lung cancer cell zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso of tumor cell growth and zzso of cellular zzso via zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso In cell cycle regulation, zzso zzso caused induction of zzso zzso and simultaneously suppressed the expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso this led to the zzso of zzso protein in zzso transition and thereby zzso zzso target gene transcriptions of zzso zzso In addition, we demonstrated that zzso directly regulated zzso expression in a zzso zzso However, zzso was not related to zzso expression and zzso of lung zzso Lastly, we observed that zzso of zzso in zzso lung cancer cells attenuated in zzso zzso properties and in zzso tumor growth of the mouse zzso zzso Taken together, we suggest that the zzso regulation of zzso and its zzso regulation of gene zzso in zzso and cell cycle components play an important role in the development of lung zzso
