zzso cells undergo zzso transition zzso to convert from a benign to a zzso zzso Our recent focus has been signaling pathways that promote zzso in response to zzso We have shown that human pancreatic cancer cells respond to collagen by zzso zzso which promotes tumor growth, invasion, and zzso zzso characterization showed that knocking down zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso zzso and limited tumor growth and invasion in a mouse model for pancreatic zzso The current study was designed to understand the zzso from collagen to zzso zzso zzso of the signal requires two collagen zzso zzso zzso and zzso domain zzso zzso zzso Each zzso zzso signals through separate pathways that zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is downstream of zzso whereas zzso is downstream of zzso zzso Both zzso complexes rely on the zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso but not zzso family zzso zzso is required for the response to collagen zzso
