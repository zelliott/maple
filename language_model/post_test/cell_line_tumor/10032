zzso zzso is a potent zzso zzso that activates natural killer like zzso zzso leading to the production of helper T zzso 1 and zzso zzso that mediate various zzso and zzso zzso Here, we determined whether the administration of zzso mouse zzso zzso can augment the zzso effect of zzso on subcutaneous and zzso tumors in zzso Mice were zzso injected with zzso on days 7, 10 and 13 after tumor zzso with or without zzso injection of zzso on day zzso zzso treatment increased the serum levels of zzso while zzso injection of zzso elevated serum zzso zzso A combination of zzso and zzso zzso inhibited the in zzso tumor growth and improved the survival of zzso mice, as compared to the use of a single zzso zzso on spontaneous zzso models revealed that zzso reduced lung zzso and prolonged survival, as compared to control zzso In addition, the zzso and liver zzso cells from mice treated with zzso showed enhanced zzso activity against zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso treatment expanded the absolute numbers of lung and liver zzso zzso and zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of these zzso This study shows the efficacy of zzso zzso therapy, and provides a cellular mechanism on how it exerts the zzso zzso
