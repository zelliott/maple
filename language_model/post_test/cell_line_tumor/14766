The zzso zzso human zzso zzso type 8 is associated with zzso skin cancer in patients with zzso zzso and evidence for its zzso potential in the general population zzso To date, strategies to suppress zzso zzso zzso infections are zzso zzso regulatory factors zzso and zzso play key roles in the zzso of the innate immune response to viral zzso In this study, we show for the first time that both zzso and zzso regulate zzso of a zzso but with opposing zzso zzso expressed in the zzso layers of human zzso increased zzso late promoter activity via direct binding to viral zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso promoter involved zzso as a downstream zzso In contrast, zzso expressed in all layers of human zzso induced strong zzso suppression in primary zzso zzso suppression prevailed over zzso zzso zzso Unlike the E6 zzso of the zzso high-risk zzso the zzso E6 protein did not bind to zzso and only zzso antagonized its zzso Strong zzso activity was also observed, when zzso were treated with potent zzso zzso zzso or zzso bearing zzso zzso In conclusion, we show that zzso zzso zzso a state of zzso immunity against zzso in primary human zzso Our study suggests that local application of zzso compounds might constitute an attractive novel therapeutic strategy against zzso diseases, particularly in zzso zzso zzso
