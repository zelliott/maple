zzso protein 1 zzso is an important scaffolding protein in the zzso zzso zzso It is also believed to play a role in the mediation of zzso messages from the plasma membrane to the cell zzso Previous studies suggest that the zzso is zzso with the zzso growth factor II zzso zzso zzso thereby contributing to the growth zzso effects of this potent growth zzso The striking zzso of these two genes was found in zzso fetuses as well as in primary human embryonic zzso When six primary zzso zzso were zzso the two genes showed a high degree of zzso in the sense that high expression of zzso II was followed by high expression of zzso and vice zzso However, when the human zzso zzso cell line zzso was zzso a very modest intrinsic expression of zzso II was accompanied by a moderate expression of zzso When zzso zzso II was added, which has previously been shown to induce zzso in this cell line, the zzso expression zzso These data suggest that zzso has a more complex role in the regulation of proliferation as well as programmed cell zzso
