Failure of chemotherapy in breast cancer presents a major problem and is often due to elevated expression of zzso binding cassette zzso zzso such as zzso zzso It has been shown that zzso gene expression is regulated at the zzso level by DNA zzso and zzso zzso However, the modified zzso zzso have not been identified and the role of various zzso zzso zzso zzso is not fully zzso By studying a breast zzso model cell line and its zzso zzso we show that the zzso 3 zzso 9 zzso zzso level is elevated zzso in the promoter and first zzso of the zzso gene in the drug-resistant cell line compared to the zzso cell zzso The zzso level of the other examined zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is zzso or not at all elevated in the zzso zzso although their zzso is generally increased zzso in the drug-resistant zzso zzso of the expression of zzso zzso and zzso by zzso effectively reduces the expression of zzso zzso treatment with a zzso inhibitor zzso inhibitor zzso further increases zzso expression and drug zzso in the drug-resistant zzso Our data suggest that repeated exposure to chemotherapy may result in zzso zzso zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso
