zzso group box 1 zzso has been implicated in a variety of biologically important zzso including transcription, DNA repair, zzso development, and zzso zzso However, the potential role of zzso in tumor biology still remains zzso Our previous study showed that zzso response to zzso zzso zzso in zzso human lung cancer cells could enhance their growth and invasive potential in zzso and in zzso Here we found that zzso zzso stimulation to zzso cells induced the zzso of zzso in a dose dependent zzso We further showed that blockade of zzso zzso using A box zzso and zzso zzso significantly zzso the zzso zzso enhanced progression of zzso zzso Interestingly, we found that zzso alone or acted synergistic with zzso zzso could enhance the progression of zzso zzso zzso we revealed that zzso and zzso were critical for zzso to exert the synergistic zzso We observed a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso and zzso zzso zzso 2 in zzso cells in response to zzso These findings might further our understanding of zzso signaling in tumor biology and be helpful for developing zzso strategy against lung zzso
