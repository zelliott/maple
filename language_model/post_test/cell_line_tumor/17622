A solid phase zzso zzso gas zzso zzso zzso method was developed to assess actual doses of highly zzso organic compounds like zzso oxide zzso in exposed cell zzso Using zzso we set up a method to measure accurately zzso SO zzso as well as to obtain an approximate assessment of zzso zzso The zzso method was developed and validated using two different coating materials, zzso and zzso In zzso systems, zzso was established over 3 orders of magnitude for both zzso but zzso showed higher extraction efficiency and a lower limit of detection zzso zzso zzso vs zzso M for zzso Precision calculated as % zzso was within zzso for all zzso and zzso zzso zzso performed to study SO stability in zzso medium showed a zzso decrease in SO concentration zzso of initial the concentration after 24 zzso mostly due to the spontaneous zzso of SO into zzso zzso which was measured by liquid zzso mass zzso zzso When the zzso cell line zzso was exposed to a nominal concentration of zzso zzso zzso M zzso the actual concentration measured in the zzso was considerably lower and was found to decrease during zzso zzso SO was estimated zzso by difference between the amount measured in the medium without cells and in the zzso of the zzso zzso
