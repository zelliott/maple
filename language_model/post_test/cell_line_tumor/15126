zzso zzso zzso is highly resistant to conventional systemic therapies and prognosis for advanced zzso patients remains zzso Recent studies of the molecular mechanisms responsible for tumor initiation and progression have identified several potential molecular targets in zzso zzso is a zzso inhibitor shown to have survival benefits in advanced zzso It acts by zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso type zzso zzso In zzso experiments zzso had zzso activity in zzso cells and it reduced tumor zzso and increased zzso Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the zzso mechanisms of zzso include its zzso effects on protein zzso unfolded protein response zzso and zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we show that combined treatment with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a marked increase in cell death in zzso and zzso zzso These observations may open the way to potentially interesting treatment combinations that may augment the effect of zzso possibly including drugs that promote zzso zzso Because zzso blocked the cellular defense mechanisms against zzso injury not only in zzso cells but also in zzso cells, we must be careful to avoid severe liver zzso
