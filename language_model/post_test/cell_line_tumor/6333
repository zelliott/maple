One of the major obstacles of the clinical translation of zzso zzso acid zzso peptides has been the zzso zzso zzso In order to facilitate the application of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the clinical setting we investigated in this study the feasibility of using the zzso reaction between zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a simple zzso zzso labeling strategy for development of a PET probe for tumor zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was first zzso with a zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and the resulting zzso zzso was then zzso via zzso intermediate to zzso zzso zzso binding affinities of the peptides were assessed by a zzso zzso zzso binding zzso using zzso as the zzso The tumor targeting efficacy and in zzso profile of zzso were further evaluated in a subcutaneous zzso zzso zzso model by zzso and zzso 

zzso was successfully zzso with good yield within 40 zzso using the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was determined to be 46 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated that zzso showed high tumor zzso fast clearance from the body, and good tumor to normal organ zzso 

zzso zzso has been successfully prepared and labeled with zzso in one single step of zzso The favorable in zzso performance and the short zzso route of zzso warrant further zzso of the probe and the zzso strategy to accelerate the clinical translation of zzso zzso zzso
