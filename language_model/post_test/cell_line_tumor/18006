The zzso zzso X zzso zzso gene family contains nine zzso The zzso proteins are CT zzso zzso and can be expressed in many tumor zzso T cell immune response against zzso protein can be detected in tumor patients and mice expressing any zzso zzso zzso protective zzso might improve the low zzso against these zzso CT zzso zzso we predicted zzso zzso for all nine zzso family members, followed by validation with zzso molecular zzso zzso zzso and binding stability zzso We obtained four highly zzso candidate zzso with the high zzso scores designated zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the nine zzso zzso Each of the four candidates could elicit strong zzso zzso immune responses, but zzso could evoke more zzso gamma zzso T cells and more potent zzso that could lyse more target zzso zzso almost all of the four zzso induced zzso could zzso the mutual targets both in zzso in human zzso and zzso transgenic mice, but zzso showed superiority to other zzso in term of zzso All of these results demonstrate that zzso can induce zzso immunity in a fashion superior to other candidates, and may be the zzso zzso zzso among all zzso zzso Due to its documented responses zzso zzso has potential application in zzso zzso
