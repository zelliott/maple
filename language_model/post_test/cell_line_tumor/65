The zzso of brain zzso is rising and poses a severe clinical problem, as we lack effective therapies and knowledge of mechanisms that control zzso growth in the zzso Here we demonstrate a crucial role for zzso tumor cell zzso zzso in brain zzso growth and recruitment of blood zzso Although zzso is frequently zzso in primary brain tumors and zzso zzso of brain zzso zzso we show that it is the zzso zzso state that is critical for brain zzso zzso zzso but not zzso tumor cell zzso supports efficient brain zzso growth through continuous zzso of vascular zzso growth factor zzso protein under zzso zzso In zzso brain zzso carrying activated zzso zzso expression is controlled at the zzso level and involves zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso In contrast, tumor cells with zzso zzso depend on zzso for zzso zzso resulting in reduced zzso tumor cell zzso and inefficient zzso zzso zzso the zzso critically influences the effects that activated tumor cell zzso exerts on tumor cell zzso Although it strongly promoted zzso growth, the zzso state of the zzso did not influence tumor growth in the zzso fat pad as a primary zzso Thus, we identified a mechanism by which zzso cells thrive in the brain zzso and use the zzso form of an zzso zzso to grow and secure host support for zzso zzso this molecular mechanism could prove valuable for the zzso of brain zzso
