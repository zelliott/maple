For a variety of reasons, including production limitations, potential unanticipated side effects, and an zzso response upon repeated systemic administration, zzso zzso are as yet not ideal gene delivery vehicles, zzso further research into zzso Unlike viral zzso zzso zzso pose minimal health risks, but to meet therapeutic requirements their efficacy needs major zzso This goal may be accomplished by better defining the mechanism of zzso gene delivery and exploiting specific cellular zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso of zzso cells with zzso is almost exclusively zzso by the zzso zzso cell surface zzso More important, we show that in general, zzso receptors can be exploited by zzso to gain access to cells, including zzso primary neural stem cells and suspension cells, thereby leading to productive zzso We propose that zzso receptors serve as zzso receptors for zzso As no natural cellular receptors for zzso have previously been identified, our results are an important step forward in understanding the mechanisms of zzso gene zzso Moreover, the finding that zzso receptors mediate efficient zzso gene delivery zzso the way for the zzso of zzso zzso procedures as well as ex zzso gene therapy protocols using zzso zzso
