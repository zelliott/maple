Growth differentiation zzso zzso a member of the bone zzso protein zzso family and the transforming growth factor zzso zzso has recently been implicated in the biological control of cancer cell zzso It has also been implicated in the development and spread of solid zzso However, the role of zzso in kidney cancer remains to be zzso In the present study, the expression of zzso in normal and zzso human kidney zzso and its molecular and cellular impact on human kidney cancer cells were zzso 

The expression of zzso in human kidney zzso and kidney cancer cell lines zzso and zzso was assessed at both the zzso and protein levels using reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was induced by a zzso zzso expression zzso The effect of zzso expression on cellular functions was examined in kidney cancer cells zzso zzso using a variety of in zzso zzso 

In normal kidney zzso stronger zzso of zzso was seen in zzso zzso zzso cells, both in the zzso and in the zzso In contrast, the zzso of zzso was notably weak or absent in cells of zzso zzso Human kidney cancer cell lines zzso and zzso had lost their zzso zzso zzso of zzso reduced in zzso invasion and cellular growth and migration of kidney cell lines in zzso Using the electric zzso sensing zzso method, it was further revealed that zzso of zzso in these cells markedly reduced cellular migration and zzso 

Human kidney zzso have a reduced or loss of expression of zzso In zzso zzso zzso suppresses the zzso growth and migration of kidney cancer zzso This suggests that zzso is a potential zzso zzso and may have zzso and therapeutic implications in human kidney zzso
