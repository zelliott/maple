zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso of the normal zzso protein contribute to the zzso transformation of diverse zzso cell types, and zzso is zzso and/or zzso in various human tumor zzso zzso of zzso or zzso caused similar zzso yet the effects promoted by zzso expression were consistently and substantially zzso zzso depletion and increased zzso are zzso commonly associated with zzso and zzso zzso It was suggested that the intrinsic zzso zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso and zzso may be responsible for these zzso but direct supporting evidence remains to be zzso zzso from experiments designed to test such hypothesis demonstrate that, as expected, zzso expression in human zzso zzso zzso cells decreased their zzso levels and zzso resistance to zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso Using a combination of zzso zzso zzso methods, in zzso zzso activity zzso and in zzso zzso activity zzso in live cells, this report also demonstrates that the zzso zzso lacks zzso zzso activity, indicating that direct zzso zzso by zzso did not cause the zzso depletion observed in zzso zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that the zzso zzso may regulate the cellular energy levels and subsequent zzso by an zzso zzso zzso possible alternative mechanisms will be essential to devise strategies for the successful treatment of predictably zzso resistant tumors expressing either increased zzso levels or, particularly, the zzso zzso
