zzso cell zzso zzso zzso known to be a zzso zzso of Lutheran zzso zzso is an zzso zzso membrane protein that acts as a zzso zzso zzso The high affinity of zzso for zzso zzso is thought to contribute to the zzso of zzso red blood cells and to various zzso zzso However, the function of zzso in zzso is poorly zzso Based on zzso expression analysis, we found that zzso was one of the target genes of the zzso zzso complex, which acts as a zzso zzso and suppresses zzso zzso gene zzso To zzso the detailed function of zzso in zzso tumors, we established zzso zzso zzso zzso These cells lost the zzso characteristics of parental cells, such as zzso growth, migration, invasion, and zzso Moreover, zzso reporter zzso and zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso complex bound to the zzso promoter and zzso zzso Thus, these data indicate that zzso is a zzso zzso and that zzso is involved in zzso and zzso of zzso through the zzso of zzso zzso
