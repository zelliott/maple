To enhance the zzso delivery potential of zzso DNA using zzso zzso we used zzso zzso zzso and zzso to prepare zzso zzso zzso by emulsion zzso and prepared zzso complexes through the complex zzso of zzso with the zzso The object of our work is to evaluate the characterization and zzso efficiency of zzso The zzso have a zzso potential of zzso zzso at pH zzso and size about 200 zzso zzso analysis suggested that the zzso with positive charges could protect the DNA from zzso degradation and cell viability zzso showed that the zzso exhibit a low zzso to human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and quantitative analysis of zzso in zzso cells by the zzso carrying zzso DNA zzso for enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso was done by digital zzso imaging zzso system and zzso cell sorting zzso zzso results showed highly efficient expression of zzso that remained stable for up to 96 zzso zzso results from zzso showed that zzso were significantly more effective in zzso zzso cells after 72 hours zzso The results of this study suggested that zzso have favorable properties for zzso zzso
