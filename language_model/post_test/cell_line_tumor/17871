In recent years, increasing concern has surrounded the consequences of improper electric and electronic waste zzso zzso In order to mitigate or zzso the potentially severe toxic effects of zzso recycling on the environment, organisms, and humans, many contaminated sites must first be zzso In this study, soil samples were taken from zzso city, one of the largest zzso disposal centers in China, which was involved in recycling for nearly 30 zzso The extracts of the samples were zzso for zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso zzso zzso induction in the rat zzso cell line zzso Some of the target zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso aromatic zzso zzso were zzso analyzed as zzso The zzso relationship and zzso relationship between the chemical zzso of zzso zzso and observed zzso activity were zzso The results showed that soil extracts could induce zzso activity significantly, and the chemically derived zzso zzso zzso zzso were perfectly correlated to zzso zzso zzso zzso R zzso zzso P zzso zzso which indicated that the known zzso zzso could account for the observed zzso Among different contributors, zzso accounted for zzso and zzso contributed zzso of zzso while the contribution of zzso could almost be zzso Under these conditions, a quantitative zzso relationship between zzso and zzso activity could be zzso suggesting that the observed zzso effect was mainly caused by zzso Further source identification by zzso profiles analysis showed that the crude dismantling of electric power devices and open burning of electric wires and printed circuit boards may be the main sources of these zzso zzso This study suggests that the combination of in zzso zzso and chemical analysis is useful to screen, zzso and prioritize zzso zzso in soil from zzso recycling zzso
