We generated novel truncated zzso growth factor I receptors zzso designated as zzso zzso and zzso in order to establish shorter soluble zzso than previously reported zzso without zzso the same zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso but not zzso caused zzso of zzso growth of zzso zzso cancer cells in zzso This zzso effect was reproduced when we used zzso proteins of these zzso suggesting a bystander effect of these shorter truncated zzso zzso in zzso of zzso cells zzso with zzso or zzso was strictly zzso and zzso of these cells in nude mice caused massive zzso exclusively in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso but not zzso were attenuated in zzso or zzso zzso cells, and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso seemed to play at least a partial role in the zzso effect of these novel truncated zzso Since zzso and zzso are smaller in size than previously reported zzso and they retain the same zzso effects, they could be good candidates for clinical application in the zzso
