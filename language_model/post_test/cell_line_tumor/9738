Little is known about the biological functions of zzso tumor zzso Here, we examined the role of zzso in regulating the sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells to different zzso 

An zzso zzso targeted zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso cell surface expression of zzso in zzso cells and the zzso domain zzso of zzso was zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso agents and to zzso of zzso zzso was examined in zzso and zzso cell zzso Cell viability was determined by zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by Western zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso of cell surface zzso decreases zzso zzso by zzso in zzso cells but does not affect zzso zzso We found that the sensitivity to other zzso agents such as zzso zzso and zzso was also increased by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso also significantly zzso in zzso zzso cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso has the opposite zzso zzso sensitivity and zzso zzso are decreased by the zzso expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso selectively zzso the sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso zzso The zzso zzso appears to be sufficient to promote zzso zzso
