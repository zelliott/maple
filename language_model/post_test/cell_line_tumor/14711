The sodium zzso zzso zzso mediates the active zzso zzso in the zzso zzso as well as zzso breast zzso Recently, we reported significant stimulation of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso expression in the zzso positive human breast cancer cell line zzso by zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso which might offer the potential to image and treat breast cancer with zzso In this study, based on its known interaction with the zzso zzso forming a zzso with the zzso zzso we examined the effect of zzso zzso a potent zzso of zzso on zzso zzso expression and therapeutic efficacy of zzso in zzso zzso For this purpose, functional zzso expression in zzso cells was examined by zzso zzso zzso quantitative real-time zzso as well as Western zzso analysis, followed by investigation of zzso zzso in zzso after incubation with zzso zzso 25, 100 zzso in the presence of zzso (1 zzso with or without zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso up to twofold in a zzso manner, while zzso zzso zzso was further zzso up to zzso by additional zzso treatment based on significantly increased zzso zzso and protein zzso This zzso effect of zzso was shown to be dependent on the zzso zzso without involvement of zzso In contrast, treatment with zzso alone had no effect on functional zzso zzso Moreover, selective zzso of zzso was significantly increased from approximately zzso in zzso cells treated with zzso alone to 50% after treatment with zzso in the presence of zzso which was further enhanced to zzso after combined treatment with zzso In conclusion, zzso represents another potent zzso of zzso functional zzso expression resulting in an enhanced selective killing effect of zzso in zzso breast cancer zzso
