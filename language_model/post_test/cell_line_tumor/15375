zzso suppression of multiple zzso is an attractive strategy to treat zzso zzso we present a series of long zzso multiplex small interfering zzso zzso that is suitable for dual genes zzso through a zzso zzso interference process without inducing significant immune zzso A gap feature structurally designed in either of the zzso strands of the zzso was proved to be essential toward zzso target genes and avoiding immune zzso Furthermore, the zzso effect of zzso against zzso and zzso genes was shown to be effective and resulted in zzso of zzso related zzso and, in turn, zzso of zzso cancer cell zzso Our observation suggested that the rationally designed zzso would have great potential for therapeutic zzso zzso
