The aim of the work was the synthesis of gold zzso zzso of different sizes and the zzso of their biological activity in zzso and in zzso 

Water zzso of gold zzso of different sizes have been zzso by Davis method and characterized by zzso zzso and transmission electron zzso zzso The zzso interaction with tumor cells has been zzso by zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity was determined by standard zzso zzso zzso distribution and content in zzso and zzso have been determined via zzso zzso zzso zzso influence has been estimated by zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso in cultured zzso tumor cells and their ability to zzso zzso cell membrane zzso activity value has been revealed in zzso Using in zzso model of zzso zzso it has been shown that zzso possess high affinity to tumor zzso 

Our results indicate the perspectives of use of the zzso zzso water zzso for cancer zzso and zzso It's necessary to take into account a zzso zzso level of zzso
