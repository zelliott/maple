The huge majority of myeloma cell lines express zzso while a substantial subset of them failed to show zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso subset of zzso cell lines had no or only a very mild effect on cellular zzso Surprisingly, however, zzso stimulation enhanced cell death induction by zzso and attenuated the zzso effect of zzso The contrasting regulation of zzso and zzso cell death by zzso could be traced back to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso It appeared that zzso zzso due to its strength, zzso a rather moderate zzso of zzso so that the net effect of zzso zzso zzso in the context of zzso signaling is zzso zzso cell death, however, was antagonized in response to zzso because in this context only the induction of zzso is zzso zzso of zzso in myeloma cells leads to zzso zzso In line with this, we observed cell death induction in zzso zzso zzso Our studies revealed that the zzso zzso system adjusts the responsiveness of the zzso zzso zzso in myeloma cells by multiple mechanisms that generate a highly zzso net effect on myeloma cell zzso
