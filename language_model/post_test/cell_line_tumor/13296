zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso promoters of a number of zzso zzso including zzso and zzso by forming complexes with DNA zzso and zzso resulting in the induction of zzso zzso zzso expression has been demonstrated in various types of zzso Previous reports indicate that zzso expression is regulated by zzso zzso We investigated zzso expression using zzso zzso in 231 zzso cancer and 40 zzso zzso analyzed the relationship between zzso expression and zzso findings and the association between zzso and zzso zzso To better understand the biological function of zzso in zzso cancer, zzso of zzso expression was performed using zzso zzso High zzso expression was observed in 152 of 231 zzso zzso cancer patients, and was detected in 35 of 40 zzso specimens samples zzso zzso zzso was detected in the nucleus of cancer cells, while it was not detected in zzso normal zzso High zzso expression was significantly observed in right compared with left zzso cancer zzso Moreover, high zzso expression tended to be associated with depth of invasion zzso zzso expression was significantly associated with zzso expression ( zzso zzso of zzso expression suppressed cellular growth in colon cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso In conclusion, we demonstrated that zzso expression was zzso in approximately two-thirds of zzso cancer specimens and was particularly expressed in right compared with left zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso expression induced growth zzso in colon cancer cell zzso zzso may be involved in cellular proliferation and molecular zzso of zzso cancer in the right zzso
