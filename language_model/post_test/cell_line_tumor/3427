A zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso linked with zzso zzso was zzso Its properties and zzso activity in human zzso zzso resistant cells zzso were investigated in zzso The results showed that the zzso was strongly stable both in zzso zzso zzso (PBS) and in culture zzso The zzso concentration of the zzso was higher than that of the AS zzso by zzso zzso The zzso showed potent zzso zzso to the growth of zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells to zzso was also investigated in zzso When the cells were first exposed to the zzso zzso zzso and then exposed to zzso for 24 zzso the zzso value of zzso decreased from zzso to zzso zzso In contrast, when treated with the mixture of the same concentration of the AS zzso with equivalent zzso the zzso value of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration was detected in zzso treatment with the zzso in zzso by zzso The results showed that the zzso zzso concentration was zzso increased in zzso cells treated with the zzso compared to treatment with zzso zzso In contrast, zzso increasing was observed when treated with the AS zzso Western zzso analysis showed a significantly decrease in the amount of zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso is effective in reversing zzso zzso Certainly, further studies are conducting to explore the zzso effect of the zzso in zzso
