zzso or zzso is a zzso inducing gene over expressed in human prostate zzso To study its zzso significance, an archival set of prostate zzso was zzso zzso zzso of both nuclear and zzso zzso expression in zzso cells were significantly higher than those in normal and zzso zzso and the increased zzso was significantly associated with a reduced patient survival zzso To test the therapeutic potential of targeting zzso a clone zzso of cells was established by interfering zzso expression in highly zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in cancer cells significantly inhibited their proliferation and zzso in zzso When zzso cells were zzso implanted into the prostate zzso of zzso zzso mice produced primary zzso with an average size of zzso zzso and no zzso was produced in any of the 13 zzso Whereas in the control group, all 14 mice produced primary zzso with an average size of zzso zzso and zzso zzso produced zzso When zzso zzso all 5 mice zzso with control cells developed zzso from day 4, with an average size of zzso zzso at 5 weeks after the zzso whereas zzso cells produced no zzso in any of the 5 animals at any zzso indicating the suppression occurred at the initiation zzso Our results suggest that zzso may be used as a potential zzso marker to predict patient outcome and the increased zzso expression is a possible target to inhibit the zzso progression of prostate cancer zzso
