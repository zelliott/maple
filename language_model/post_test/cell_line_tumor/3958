Advanced prostate zzso initially sensitive to zzso deprivation therapy, frequently progress to the zzso prostate cancer zzso zzso through mechanisms not yet fully zzso In this study we investigated zzso involvement in the establishment of zzso to hormone zzso Two human prostate cancer cell lines were used, the parental zzso and the resistant zzso the latter generated after continuous exposure to 20 zzso of zzso the active zzso of zzso We observed a significant decrease in zzso content and a lower expression of 8 zzso gene transcripts involved in respiratory chain complexes in both cell zzso We also found that zzso zzso modulated zzso protein zzso expression in zzso and zzso zzso These data seem to indicate that the zzso zzso in our experimental model was due, at least in part, to zzso in zzso dynamics and to a breakdown in the zzso zzso zzso
