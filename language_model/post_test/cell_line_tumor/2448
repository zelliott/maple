The majority of human cancer deaths are caused by zzso The zzso dissemination is initiated by the breakdown of zzso cell zzso During this phenomenon, referred to as zzso to zzso transition zzso cells change their genetic and zzso program leading to zzso and functional zzso The challenge of understanding this dynamic process resides in unraveling regulatory networks involving master zzso factors zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso Here we investigated zzso regulated by zzso and their potential role in the regulatory networks underlying zzso zzso 

By a large-scale analysis on zzso zzso we highlighted zzso and its molecular link with zzso and the zzso family, key regulators of zzso zzso During zzso zzso in zzso breast cancer cells, zzso and zzso family members were zzso in a timely correlated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso forming a double negative zzso feedback zzso We integrated this novel zzso with the known zzso feedback zzso to construct an a zzso zzso core zzso Dynamic simulations revealed stable zzso and zzso states, and underscored the crucial role of the zzso feedback loop in state transitions underlying zzso zzso 

By combining zzso biology and experimental approaches, we propose a novel zzso core network zzso two fundamental negative feedback zzso zzso and zzso zzso our analysis implies that this novel zzso core network could function as a switch controlling zzso cell plasticity during differentiation and cancer zzso
