We have investigated the possibility that zzso titanium dioxide zzso could inhibit the growth of zzso zzso We studied the zzso effects of zzso excited with ultraviolet A zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso zzso electron zzso demonstrated that zzso cells take up zzso by zzso and vital zzso revealed that zzso alone has no effect on zzso cell zzso However, if zzso was combined with UVA zzso the proliferation rate was decreased significantly compared to controls ( zzso zzso suggested that zzso induction of zzso cell zzso is associated with changes in the expression of genes zzso zzso family zzso We then investigated the in zzso zzso effects of combined zzso plus UVA treatment of established zzso zzso zzso plus UVA led to pronounced areas of zzso elevated zzso of zzso delayed tumor growth, and increased survival compared with the zzso control group ( zzso zzso survival analysis showed that median survival duration was prolonged ( zzso These findings suggest that zzso based zzso therapy has potential in the treatment of zzso
