To evaluate the potential of zzso imaging zzso for monitoring zzso tumor response in a zzso model of Ewing zzso after administration of zzso in different zzso 

Ewing zzso implanted zzso into the left thigh of non-obese zzso combined zzso zzso mice were evaluated with a zzso T MR unit by using a specific mouse whole body zzso zzso zzso fast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso examinations were performed at zzso 24 hours and 72 hours after zzso injection of zzso in 2 different zzso The apparent diffusion zzso zzso in the viable parts of the tumor was automatically calculated from zzso imaging zzso These findings were correlated with zzso results at each time zzso zzso zzso were performed by summing up the regions of interest in consecutive zzso 

zzso and zzso images before administration of zzso showed viable tumor tissue with small zzso zzso At 24 hours after zzso injection, a significantly higher increase in zzso in the viable parts of the tumor could be observed in tumors of mice that had been injected with the higher dose of zzso compared with mice injected with the lower dose zzso whereas no significant zzso differences between the 2 different doses could be zzso zzso hours after injection of zzso the zzso values in the viable parts of the tumor of mice treated with the high dose of zzso further increased and the tumor volume in the high-dose group was now significantly lower than in the zzso zzso 

Compared with zzso zzso zzso of the viable tumor parts could be used to discriminate between the effects of 2 different zzso at an earlier time point than zzso zzso in an animal model in zzso This method could be especially useful for monitoring drug effects in phase zzso clinical zzso
