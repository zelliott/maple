The zzso of three zzso from the roots of zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as 36 zzso zzso zzso zzso derivatives against zzso human lung zzso cells was zzso Ten zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (25) and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (39), exhibited zzso activity, and zzso zzso was found to be the most potent zzso zzso Their zzso values against zzso cells ranged from zzso to zzso zzso In the occurrence of zzso effects of zzso zzso replacement by an zzso group at both zzso and zzso resulted in the enhancement of activity of the parent zzso compared to that from having zzso groups at this position, and the presence of a zzso group at the zzso position was required for the zzso zzso These zzso zzso derivatives inhibit cell growth through zzso zzso
