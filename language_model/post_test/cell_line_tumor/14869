zzso and zzso breast zzso are comprised of zzso populations of zzso cells involving various degrees of maturation and zzso While cultured cell lines have been derived from both normal and zzso zzso it remains unclear whether they retain a similar cellular zzso as to that found within breast zzso 

We used 12 reduction zzso zzso 15 primary breast cancer zzso and 20 human breast zzso cell lines (16 cancer lines, 4 normal zzso to perform flow zzso for zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression as well as zzso and in zzso tumor zzso formation studies to extensively analyze the molecular and cellular characteristics of breast zzso cell zzso 

Human breast zzso contain four distinguishable zzso differentiation states zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso that differ on the basis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso human breast cancer zzso also contain these four cellular states, but in altered proportions compared to normal zzso In contrast, cultured cancer cell lines are enriched for rare zzso and zzso zzso which are normally present in small numbers within human zzso Similarly, cultured normal human zzso zzso cell lines were enriched for rare zzso and zzso zzso that represent a minor fraction of cells within reduction zzso zzso Although normal human zzso zzso cell lines exhibited features of zzso zzso cells they were unable to differentiate into mature zzso breast zzso zzso 

As a group breast cancer cell lines represent the zzso of human breast tumors, but individually they exhibit increased zzso profiles that fall short of truly representing the zzso zzso of individual breast zzso Additionally, normal human zzso zzso cell lines fail to retain much of the cellular diversity found in human breast zzso and are enriched for differentiation states that are a minority in breast zzso although they do exhibit features of zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that collections of cell lines representing multiple cell types can be used to model the cellular zzso of zzso
