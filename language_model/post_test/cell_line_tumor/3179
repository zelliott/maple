The zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso regulates survival and chemotherapy resistance of zzso cells, and its deregulation in zzso zzso tumors predicts an adverse clinical zzso Here, we show that zzso of zzso signaling in human zzso cells zzso nuclear zzso of zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso and zzso to zzso zzso To specifically address whether zzso contributes to zzso regulation, we introduced a zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso exerted a significant zzso effect and prevented the zzso of zzso and zzso at zzso the loss of zzso membrane potential as well as the release of zzso c during zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso by zzso short hairpin zzso technology accelerated zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso to the zzso agents zzso and zzso whereas the zzso of zzso diminished zzso zzso to these zzso These results suggest that repression of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to cell death induced by zzso agents, which supports the central role of zzso signaling in drug resistance of human zzso
