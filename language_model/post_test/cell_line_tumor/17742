zzso phase II trials with zzso zzso zzso consisting of a zzso zzso linked to the zzso drug zzso have shown a zzso overall response rate in relapsed acute zzso leukemia zzso However, no clear correlation was observed between zzso expression on zzso blasts and response to GO zzso We analyzed the zzso specificity of zzso cell death and the effect of GO on zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso induced by clinically relevant GO zzso is partially zzso zzso and that efficient zzso GO zzso can occur via zzso In agreement with these results, we observed zzso death of human zzso acute zzso leukemia cells both in zzso and in zzso in an zzso mouse zzso Finally, sensitivity to zzso cell death was at least partially determined by the zzso status of zzso cells, with cells in activated zzso of the cell cycle being most effective in both zzso GO zzso renewed expression of zzso zzso and zzso GO zzso via zzso In conclusion, these data provide zzso insight into the efficacy of GO in zzso as well as in zzso zzso with zzso capacity, and provide a rationale for the use of GO in the treatment of zzso with zzso zzso
