zzso plays a vital role in inducing and maintaining a zzso inflammatory zzso and is reported to be a critical zzso of the zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso through zzso family zzso We investigated the effect of the zzso inhibitor zzso on lung tumors induced by an zzso zzso zzso 

Three zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso established from zzso harboring an zzso zzso deletion zzso were zzso Growth zzso was measured using an zzso zzso zzso of zzso were also evaluated in the zzso model and in the zzso transgenic mice zzso zzso expressions were assessed by zzso and zzso Group differences were compared using zzso zzso To evaluate the efficacy of zzso on survival, zzso or vehicle was administered orally from 7 weeks of age of the transgenic zzso zzso survival zzso were calculated using the zzso zzso 

The sensitivities of resistant and parent cells to zzso were similar in zzso zzso (30 or 50 zzso per zzso reduced zzso and revealed significant tumor zzso in a mouse zzso zzso zzso the transgenic mice were treated with zzso (30 zzso or vehicle zzso The numbers of lung tumors zzso axis exceeding zzso in the zzso group and control group were zzso and zzso ( zzso zzso zzso treatment suppressed zzso zzso zzso and zzso The median survival time in the zzso group zzso zzso was significantly greater than that in the control group (106 zzso zzso test, zzso 

zzso may be effective against lung tumors driven by an zzso zzso zzso
