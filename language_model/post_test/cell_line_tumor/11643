The third member of transforming zzso zzso protein zzso family, zzso has been shown to be an important player in the regulation of zzso dynamics during zzso and found to be zzso in a variety of human zzso Our previous studies have suggested that zzso may be involved in cervical cancer progression and zzso and its zzso can induce zzso transition zzso by zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso signal zzso zzso However, the upstream mechanisms of zzso zzso and its zzso importance in human cervical cancer remain zzso zzso growth factor zzso has been shown to be a potent zzso of zzso in cervical cancer and associated with tumor invasion and zzso In this study, we found that zzso is zzso in cervical cancer and can be induced upon zzso zzso The induction of zzso by zzso is dependent on the zzso zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso depletion of zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso a key player in zzso zzso is found to be correlated with the expression of zzso in cervical zzso zzso our study highlights a novel function for zzso in zzso zzso process and suggests that targeting of zzso may be an attractive strategy to treat cervical zzso driven by zzso signaling zzso
