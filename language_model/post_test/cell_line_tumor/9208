To investigate the effects of repeating zzso degrees C freeze zzso on human zzso melanoma cell line zzso 

zzso cells were frozen by repeating zzso degrees C freeze zzso with various zzso and zzso Then the inhibit rate of cells was examined by zzso zzso The cell viability was measured by zzso formation zzso We also used the HE zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso to investigate the zzso changes of the zzso 

The growth of zzso cells was inhibited by repeating zzso degrees C freeze zzso in zzso and zzso manners zzso zzso zzso Different zzso including necrosis and zzso of the cells could be observed after zzso degrees C freeze zzso by the zzso 

Repeating zzso degrees C freeze zzso can not only kill cells directly and induce considerable cells to zzso but also inhibit the growth of the zzso The kill and wound ratio of the cells disposal with different times and zzso present zzso And the distinction when treated with different zzso during the same time is much more significant than different times with the same frequency, which guide clinical workers to choose repeating zzso with short term method instead of single zzso with long term in zzso melanoma zzso
