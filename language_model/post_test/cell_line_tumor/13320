zzso zzso is an important signaling zzso zzso quite divergent specific biological zzso Even though recent studies suggest a potential role of zzso in cancer progress, its real impact in zzso efficacy remains zzso In the present study, we investigated the effect of zzso on the zzso of zzso in various cancer cell types and found that zzso had no effect on zzso zzso in zzso zzso breast, and cervical zzso or in zzso In contrast, zzso has divergent effects on lung cancer zzso it can protect against zzso cell death in zzso lung cancer zzso cells, but not in highly zzso zzso zzso Both zzso zzso by zzso peak, zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso features induced by zzso in zzso cells were reduced by zzso In addition, zzso attenuated zzso zzso DNA damage zzso by zzso formation and the comet zzso and zzso II zzso after zzso treatment, and zzso zzso was diminished by the zzso inhibitor zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso and zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso diminished the zzso effect of zzso in zzso cells, whereas zzso zzso receptors zzso did not abrogate the action of zzso In zzso zzso fails to alter the zzso efficacy of zzso in most cancer cell types, except in zzso cells, in which zzso mediates the cell protection afforded by zzso via zzso of zzso oxygen species production, DNA damage, zzso zzso and zzso zzso
