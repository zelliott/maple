In this work we present a unified method to study the mechanical properties of cells using the atomic force zzso Stress relaxation and creep compliance zzso permitted us to zzso the relaxation times, the Young zzso and the zzso of breast cancer cells zzso The results show that the mechanical zzso of zzso cells responds to a zzso model of similar elasticity but differing zzso Treatment of zzso cells with an zzso agent results in an overall decrease in both cell elasticity and zzso however to a different extent for each zzso The layer that zzso the smaller decrease zzso is assigned to the cell zzso while the layer that experiences the larger decrease zzso is attributed to the cell zzso The combination of the method presented in this work, together with the approach based on stress relaxation zzso zzso et al 2010 zzso zzso 43 zzso constitutes a unique zzso experimental framework to study cell zzso This methodology can also be extended to study the mechanical properties of zzso in zzso
