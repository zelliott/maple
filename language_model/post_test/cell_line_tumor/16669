To achieve zzso and zzso zzso must assemble into distinct structures at different stages of cell zzso zzso to segregate the zzso before zzso and zzso to keep sister zzso apart and guide the zzso zzso after zzso This zzso regulation is believed to involve zzso zzso which is zzso in a zzso way after zzso We found that zzso zzso caused premature assembly of zzso in cells still in zzso breaking the zzso regulation of zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso plays a key role in organizing the zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso regulates zzso through zzso of a single site, zzso near the zzso of zzso We also found that zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso This creates a potential negative feedback loop controlling zzso zzso It also made the extent of zzso zzso during zzso arrest dependent on the mechanism of the arresting zzso zzso we could not detect a zzso regulatory role for zzso sites on zzso We suggest that zzso is regulated by zzso rather than zzso as previously proposed, because its activity must be zzso regulated both zzso and zzso and zzso activity is too zzso for this zzso
