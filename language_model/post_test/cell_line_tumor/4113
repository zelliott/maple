zzso zzso deposition of human zzso zzso zzso zzso in pancreatic zzso cells is implicated in the zzso of type II zzso A growing number of studies suggest that small zzso zzso are zzso via their interaction with the plasma zzso which leads to membrane zzso or zzso A recent study using imaging total internal zzso correlation zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso induced the formation of cellular plasma membrane zzso containing dense zzso in addition to the zzso of membrane zzso However, the spatial organization of zzso and their zzso evolution were only partially characterized due to limitations in the conventional analysis and interpretation of imaging zzso zzso Here, we apply a previously developed zzso analysis procedure to zzso data to resolve zzso zzso spatial organization and zzso zzso Our analysis enables the zzso of the zzso evolution of multiple zzso species in the zzso zzso cell zzso lending support to the carpet model for the association mode of zzso zzso with the plasma zzso The presented zzso analysis procedure provides an automated and general approach to unbiased zzso interpretation of imaging zzso data, with broad zzso to resolving the zzso zzso organization of biological membrane zzso
