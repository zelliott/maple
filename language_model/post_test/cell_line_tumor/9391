To study the expression of zzso zzso go-go zzso zzso channel in zzso cancer and the zzso between their expression and zzso zzso 

The expression levels of zzso protein were determined in 76 cancer zzso with paired zzso matched zzso as well as 9 zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso expression was detected in 13 zzso cancer zzso with paired zzso matched zzso and 4 zzso zzso zzso as well as two zzso cancer cell lines zzso and zzso by reverse zzso zzso 

The frequency of positive expression of zzso protein was zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso zzso in zzso cancer zzso zzso level of zzso protein was dependent on the tumor size, zzso zzso zzso other organ zzso and zzso stage zzso zzso zzso while not dependent on age, sex, site and degree of zzso zzso protein and zzso were negative in normal zzso zzso and absolutely negative in zzso zzso except that one case was positively stained for zzso zzso 

zzso protein and zzso are zzso expressed in zzso cancer and occasionally expressed in zzso zzso The high frequency of expression of zzso in tumors and the restriction of normal expression to the brain suggest the potential of this protein for zzso zzso and therapeutic zzso
