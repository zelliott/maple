zzso is a naturally occurring small zzso recently identified to be toxic selectively to cancer cells in zzso and in zzso This compound was found to elevate cellular levels of zzso oxygen species zzso selectively in cancer cell zzso The synthesis of 80 zzso zzso has revealed structural modifications that zzso zzso and zzso key zzso effects on cells, including zzso of zzso cancer cell death, and selectivity for cancer cells over zzso cell zzso zzso relationships suggest that the zzso of the zzso zzso is critical for the observed effects on zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso lacking a zzso zzso zzso can elevate zzso to levels observed with zzso but show markedly reduced cell death, suggesting that zzso mechanisms, including cellular zzso events, may also contribute to zzso induction of zzso In particular, we have identified irreversible protein zzso as a process associated with cellular zzso We propose a mechanism of action for zzso that may be relevant to other small molecules having two sites of zzso one with greater and the other with lesser zzso
