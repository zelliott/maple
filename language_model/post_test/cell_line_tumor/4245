New zzso zzso zzso zzso compounds of general formula zzso (where L are zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso have been prepared to study their zzso zzso All the isolated complexes have been fully characterized by zzso and zzso zzso The structure of zzso zzso has been determined by X-ray zzso The in zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso and their zzso derivatives zzso zzso and zzso zzso assessed in zzso cell lines has shown that the free zzso are more active than the zzso products, with zzso being the most potent zzso Furthermore, the binding interaction of both zzso and zzso with calf zzso DNA zzso has been investigated using a variety of zzso and kinetic zzso The zzso free zzso zzso into DNA at low zzso content, whereas zzso forms with DNA a zzso partially zzso complex, in which the zzso constant is nearly three orders of magnitude lower than that of zzso This finding demonstrates that the zzso binding noticeably zzso the zzso a feature presumably related to the higher zzso activity of zzso relative to that of zzso
