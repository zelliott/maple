zzso of human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso occurs in a large percentage of breast zzso zzso zzso targeting zzso are vastly used for both diagnostic and therapeutic zzso However, identifying a new molecular probe against zzso with improved diagnostic and therapeutic features is of great zzso In this report, we have applied the cell systematic evolution of zzso by exponential enrichment zzso strategy for 16 selection rounds to generate an enriched pool of zzso that specifically recognize the zzso positive cell zzso During the Cell zzso zzso a human zzso breast cancer cell line and a human zzso negative breast cancer cell line were zzso Our results reveal that zzso chain reaction zzso amplification of random DNA libraries and the selected zzso DNA pool in different Cell zzso rounds are different from what we expect from zzso amplification of zzso zzso Our results also confirmed previous studies describing positive zzso status of zzso and the absence of the zzso expression in the zzso We also developed a new method, Cell zzso zzso to monitor the enrichment of zzso in a given round of Cell zzso This method would also be useful in other experiments using live cell zzso zzso zzso on adherent zzso
