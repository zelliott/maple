zzso are involved in many aspects of tumor zzso including cell survival and zzso escape from immune zzso cell zzso and migration, zzso and invasion of the zzso zzso Several zzso zzso zzso have been cloned and shown to be zzso in zzso yet, despite the great potential for development of novel zzso we still know little about the regulation of their zzso zzso zzso such as zzso M are potent zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso M is expressed in normal and zzso human zzso cells, but not in many cancer cell zzso Here, we examined the effects of zzso M expression on zzso properties of human breast zzso zzso zzso zzso M was found to significantly reduce in zzso cell zzso migration, zzso invasion, and zzso to zzso zzso Reduction of cell proliferation and zzso to an zzso cell zzso were both independent of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso In contrast, cell migration and zzso invasion seemed to rely on zzso zzso zzso as both zzso zzso M and zzso were able to block these zzso This study provides the first evidence that zzso M may play important roles in safeguarding against human breast zzso
