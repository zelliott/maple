The zzso zzso regulatory factor 1 zzso binds to the main zzso zzso zzso zzso and to the zzso hormone zzso zzso We have recently identified zzso in zzso that decrease zzso zzso zzso by increasing zzso zzso production in the zzso zzso zzso 

We compared relevant parameters of zzso zzso in a patient with a previously zzso zzso in zzso and in control zzso We expressed the zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso and in cultured cells to study its effects on zzso transport and zzso zzso zzso 

We identified in a patient with inappropriate zzso zzso zzso a previously unidentified zzso zzso located in the zzso domain of zzso report the consequences of this zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso did not modify zzso production in the zzso zzso zzso synthesis and zzso activity were not altered by zzso zzso in zzso cells in zzso In contrast to zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso and in human cells failed to increase zzso zzso zzso down experiments showed that zzso zzso did not interact with zzso which robustly zzso with wild type zzso and previously identified zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso zzso was unable to increase cell surface expression of zzso 

Our results indicate that the zzso domain is critical for zzso interaction in humans and for the control of zzso expression at the plasma zzso Thus we have identified a new mechanism of zzso zzso loss and shown that different zzso in zzso can alter zzso zzso zzso via distinct zzso
