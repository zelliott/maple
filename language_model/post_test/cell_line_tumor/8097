An all solid state zzso zzso zzso has been developed to study the zzso process of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso the zzso involved in the synthesis of zzso oxide generated under zzso zzso At first, an all solid state zzso zzso was zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso film containing zzso zzso zzso was then immobilized on the zzso zzso The zzso formation was detected by monitoring pH change due to interaction between zzso labeled secondary zzso and zzso Experimental parameters such as the amount of zzso zzso immobilized on the zzso surface and pH responses due to the zzso reaction were studied in zzso The zzso plot of the zzso potential zzso zzso zzso concentration exhibited a linear relationship in the range of zzso zzso The zzso sensitivity of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso The detection limit of zzso was determined to be zzso zzso based on zzso zzso zzso confidence level, zzso zzso The reliability of the zzso was examined with rat brain zzso as well as zzso cells, and the results shown were good, zzso a promising approach for a novel zzso zzso platform with potential applications to clinical zzso
