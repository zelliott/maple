Three zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso acid and zzso acid, at 2 or 4 zzso were used to study their zzso potential in human liver cancer zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso The effects of these compounds upon the level and/or expression of zzso factor zzso basic zzso growth factor zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso oxygen species zzso zzso oxide zzso and cell invasion and migration were zzso zzso showed that these zzso acids at 4 zzso significantly suppressed zzso expression in three cell lines zzso zzso zzso and these compounds at test doses failed to affect zzso expression zzso zzso zzso Three zzso acids zzso decreased production and expression of zzso and zzso retained zzso level, lowered zzso and NO levels, and declined cell invasion and migration in test cell lines zzso zzso zzso These compounds also zzso reduced zzso production and expression in zzso and zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso but these agents only at 4 zzso significantly suppressed zzso production and expression in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that these zzso acids are potent zzso agents to zzso invasion and migration in liver cancer zzso
