To investigate acquired zzso zzso resistance in cancer cells, we established five zzso zzso cell lines from zzso human zzso zzso cells by means of long-term zzso cultures and limiting dilution zzso The established zzso zzso showed apparent resistance to zzso DNA fragmentation but not to zzso growth zzso None of the five zzso zzso showed apparent resistance to other zzso drugs such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso flow zzso analysis revealed no apparent differential expression of 17 molecules that were previously reported to regulate zzso or drug resistance, between the five zzso zzso and the parent zzso zzso analysis revealed common changes in zzso 4 and 18 in the five zzso zzso but not in the zzso parent zzso These results indicate that zzso growth suppression is regulated by different mechanisms from those involved in zzso zzso It was concluded that these established zzso zzso can be useful models in studies related to the prevention or treatment of zzso zzso after zzso zzso
