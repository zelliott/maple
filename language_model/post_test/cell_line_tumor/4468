Despite encouraging results with the zzso inhibitor zzso in the treatment of zzso zzso emergence of resistance can limit its zzso hence calling for novel strategies to overcome zzso We previously showed that zzso human leukemia cell lines expressed significantly lower levels of zzso at the expense of zzso zzso which zzso point zzso in zzso 2 of the zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso Here we investigated whether zzso of zzso by exposure to zzso restores sensitivity to zzso in myeloma and leukemia cell lines with acquired resistance to zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso parental cells and zzso lines with acquired resistance to zzso were exposed to zzso for zzso h where after the effects on zzso zzso expression and activity were measured, next to sensitivity zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso selective inhibitor zzso zzso At last, zzso zzso experiments of zzso and zzso were performed to identify the contribution of these zzso to sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso significance of the differences were determined using the zzso U zzso 

zzso exposure markedly increased zzso zzso zzso to a significantly higher level in zzso cells (up to zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso than in parental zzso These increases were paralleled by elevated zzso protein levels and zzso activity, as well as zzso zzso Moreover, zzso exposure reinforced zzso of zzso tumor cells to zzso and zzso but most prominently to zzso zzso as confirmed by cell growth zzso studies, zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso This zzso was zzso by zzso zzso of zzso but not by zzso zzso prior to pulse exposure to zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso expression is a major zzso in acquisition of zzso and enhancement of its zzso assembly after induction by zzso zzso restoration of sensitivity in zzso leukemia cells towards zzso and next generation zzso zzso zzso
