zzso imaging would be desirable for cancer zzso since it can potentially resolve relevant zzso target structures in zzso We therefore zzso an alpha v zzso targeted zzso and zzso zzso zzso with different alpha v zzso expression levels using both zzso and zzso optical imaging zzso 

An alpha v zzso zzso zzso was zzso with a zzso dye zzso zzso zzso of the optical zzso was tested on zzso melanoma zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells and their zzso zzso All optical imaging studies were performed using two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso technology and three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso 

In zzso the zzso zzso showed a clear binding affinity to alpha v zzso zzso and zzso cells while alpha v zzso zzso cells and zzso with the free zzso zzso revealed little to no zzso In zzso zzso zzso were clearly zzso by zzso and zzso up to 24 h post zzso zzso allowed zzso of the zzso distribution in deeper tissue sections showing an average zzso concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso Cy zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cy zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Cy zzso zzso in the target tissue 60 zzso after zzso zzso Competition with the free zzso zzso resulted in a reduction in the zzso concentration in zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso combined with novel zzso optical imaging methods allows zzso imaging of zzso alpha v zzso expression and may thus be a promising strategy for sensitive evaluation of zzso target zzso
