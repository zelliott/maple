The cellular response to zzso stress is multifaceted in zzso Following DNA damage, the tumor zzso gene zzso activates and plays critical roles in cell cycle arrest, zzso of DNA repair and in the event of zzso damage, induction of zzso The breakdown of zzso causes the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso of the mechanism for the zzso zzso will be crucial in applying the strategy for cancer zzso However, the mechanism of zzso zzso remains largely zzso Here, we carried out zzso followed by zzso parallel DNA sequencing zzso zzso to uncover mechanisms of zzso Using zzso we identified zzso as a novel zzso zzso We determined putative zzso sites that are important for zzso regulation in response to DNA damage in the promoter region of zzso zzso of zzso suppressed zzso zzso We also observed that zzso c release and the zzso of zzso by zzso were suppressed by depletion of zzso We further observed that zzso zzso in the nucleus in response to DNA zzso We identified the nuclear zzso signal of zzso and, importantly, the nuclear zzso of zzso significantly induced zzso after zzso zzso zzso we conclude that a novel zzso gene zzso is accumulated in the nucleus and zzso zzso in response to DNA zzso
