The purpose of this study was to determine whether zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stabilized zzso mixed zzso zzso size, approximately 15 zzso a novel zzso actively targeted drug delivery platform for breast cancer, accumulate in human zzso breast cancer zzso Using zzso zzso quantum dots zzso we found that zzso zzso accumulated significantly faster and in greater quantity in zzso cells than did zzso zzso alone ( zzso This process was zzso in part, by zzso receptors because excess human zzso but not zzso or zzso significantly attenuated this response ( zzso Taken together, these data indicate that zzso are actively targeted to human breast cancer cells through zzso zzso We suggest that zzso could be used as an actively targeted zzso drug delivery platform for breast cancer cells zzso zzso zzso
