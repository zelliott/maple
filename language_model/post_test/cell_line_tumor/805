zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso of zzso Here we studied the effects of free and zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso on the growth of human zzso and mouse Lewis zzso lung zzso zzso Both free and zzso zzso inhibited zzso growth in a zzso and zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso led to DNA fragmentation and a zzso decrease in zzso of zzso zzso experiments revealed a high capacity for selective zzso zzso in excess of zzso zzso zzso of scavenger zzso class B, type I zzso the prime zzso zzso selective zzso zzso in zzso cells resulted in significantly increased selective zzso zzso a finding associated with complete cellular growth zzso The present in zzso findings were verified in an in zzso model: tumor zzso in zzso was performed with either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso After tumor zzso the animals received six consecutive intravenous injections of zzso This experimental setup resulted in significantly reduced tumor burden in animals that were zzso with zzso zzso cells but not in animals zzso with zzso or zzso zzso Based on our in zzso and in zzso findings, we propose that zzso could provide a novel route for zzso drug delivery of zzso zzso
