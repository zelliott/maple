Gene therapy has emerged as a promising strategy for treatment of various zzso However, widespread zzso is hampered by difficulties in assessing the success of zzso in the target tissue and the longevity of gene zzso Thus, there is increasing interest in the development of zzso in zzso reporter techniques to zzso gene zzso We recently demonstrated the ability to detect zzso activity in zzso zzso human prostate tumor zzso in mice in zzso using zzso zzso We now extend the studies to human zzso breast cancer cells growing as zzso in nude zzso Moreover, by using two zzso resolved reporters zzso and an zzso two tumors could be interrogated simultaneously revealing zzso zzso activity in a zzso zzso tumor versus no activity in a zzso zzso Most significantly, zzso activity observed by zzso zzso corresponded to differential activity in zzso zzso
