zzso the gap between functional zzso and traditional molecular cell biology is a challenge of the next zzso Here, we are aiming to find routines for targeted zzso of protein zzso in response to zzso based on complex cellular zzso A zzso was established adapting zzso treatment, processing the sample, generating zzso zzso zzso and analyzing the sample applying zzso zzso zzso to verify protein zzso on a zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso eight targets were zzso mostly with two zzso zzso Although transcript and protein zzso zzso the zzso on the protein level was less zzso A zzso analysis of the zzso zzso indicated a delayed kinetic of protein versus transcript zzso Further, the analysis of the functional response on the example of zzso a zzso zzso essential to generate precursors for cholesterol zzso confirmed that strong zzso on the transcript level accompanied by moderate reduction of protein is sufficient to generate a zzso significant zzso Fifty percent protein zzso resulted in a zzso induction of zzso zzso and therefore cholesterol zzso in human liver zzso The established routines pave the way for the development of targeted protein zzso zzso suitable for target and zzso zzso
