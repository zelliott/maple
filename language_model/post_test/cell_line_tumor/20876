We present a zzso technique to zzso study the three-dimensional structure of zzso The method, based on the simultaneous zzso digital zzso allows for higher zzso range at which the zzso phase imaging can be zzso The technique is capable of zzso zzso zzso The noise level, which increases as a result of using two zzso is then reduced to the level of a single zzso The method compares favorably to software zzso as the technique does not produce zzso phase zzso zzso mismatch between the reference and object beams is zzso zzso The zzso images of zzso zzso cancer cells are zzso
