The purpose of this study was to achieve improved zzso delivery and zzso of zzso chemotherapy using zzso drug zzso 

zzso display technology was used to isolate a zzso zzso zzso that binds to a zzso zzso in zzso zzso This zzso was used to target zzso to zzso tumors, achieving zzso and enhanced zzso of zzso 

zzso imaging studies showed that zzso zzso selectively targeted zzso tumors and showed zzso zzso zzso zzso greater zzso compared with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso greater than zzso alone zzso zzso zzso zzso studies showed zzso increase in zzso levels within zzso tumors in zzso groups as compared with either zzso or zzso at 72 zzso Both Lewis lung zzso and zzso lung zzso zzso models showed significant tumor growth delay for zzso as compared with zzso zzso saline zzso zzso treatment induced a significantly greater loss in zzso in zzso tumors compared with zzso tumors, zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso was found to bind specifically to the zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso tumors, enhance zzso of zzso and significantly increase tumor growth delay as compared with controls in mouse models of lung zzso Here we show that targeting zzso to zzso zzso results in increased zzso drug delivery and enhanced biological efficacy in the treatment of zzso
