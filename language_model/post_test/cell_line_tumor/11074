To determine if A1 zzso receptors mediate breast zzso we evaluated A1 zzso expression in human tumor cell lines and human primary breast tumor zzso using both quantitative zzso and Western zzso zzso A1 zzso zzso expression is zzso in all breast tumor cell lines examined zzso compared to normal zzso zzso zzso lines zzso as determined by quantitative zzso zzso Western zzso analysis indicates that protein expression of A1 zzso zzso is higher in 15 zzso of 24 human primary breast tumor zzso than in matched normal breast zzso To explore its cellular function, the A1 zzso zzso was depleted by small interfering zzso zzso in zzso human breast tumor zzso zzso of A1 receptors in zzso breast tumor cells attenuated both cell growth and cell proliferation as measured by cell number counts and zzso zzso zzso Cell cycle analysis indicated that depletion of A1 receptors by zzso zzso zzso checkpoint, leading to marked zzso of cells in zzso phase, in agreement with the zzso effect on cell zzso Further supporting this finding, synchronization studies of zzso cells in various cell cycle zzso suggest that A1 zzso expression is suppressed in zzso cells and depletion of A1 zzso expression by zzso produced differential expression of several key cell cycle regulators, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso with zzso reduction of zzso and zzso E zzso In addition to the impact on cell cycle zzso depletion of A1 receptors by zzso results in substantial cell death and zzso as determined by zzso analysis and zzso V zzso zzso Together these findings suggest that the A1 zzso zzso may contribute to tumor cell growth and survival in breast tumor zzso
