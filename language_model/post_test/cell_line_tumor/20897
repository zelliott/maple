zzso studies suggest that zzso may play vital roles in zzso and stem cell zzso We have mapped the global gene targets of zzso using zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso and identified more than 2000 zzso zzso genes in the human acute zzso zzso cell line, zzso Analysis of zzso sites reveals that genes involved in cell death, cancer, DNA zzso and cell cycle were highly enriched zzso zzso zzso These genes include 38 important zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction has shown that expression levels of these genes changed significantly after zzso zzso which zzso led to cell zzso zzso zzso revealed that reduction of zzso expression in zzso and other leukemia cell lines dramatically increased zzso zzso zzso and DNA fragmentation zzso zzso zzso showed decreased numbers of zzso cells and increased numbers of zzso and zzso cells indicating reduced DNA zzso consistent with results from cell proliferation zzso In addition, zzso cells that express low levels of zzso have significantly decreased zzso in zzso zzso Our studies provide a foundation in the development of leukemia stem zzso therapy by targeting zzso
