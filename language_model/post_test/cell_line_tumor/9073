The zzso are a family of membrane proteins possessing a zzso and zzso zzso One of their main functions is shedding of membrane zzso The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that zzso (also known as tumor necrosis zzso converting zzso is involved in breast cancer zzso zzso of zzso in zzso breast cancer cells increased in zzso invasion and zzso whereas zzso of zzso expression in zzso cells decreased invasion and zzso At both zzso and protein levels, zzso expression was significantly zzso in breast cancer compared with normal breast zzso Using Western zzso zzso protein in breast cancer was shown to exist in two forms zzso with approximate molecular masses of 100 and 120 zzso Based on their known molecular mass, these bands were taken to represent the active and precursor forms of zzso zzso The proportion of active to total zzso increased progressively from normal breast tissue to primary breast cancer to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In primary zzso the active form was expressed more frequently in zzso compared with zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, in primary zzso both forms of zzso correlated significantly zzso correlation zzso with levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso form: r zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso 83 and active form: r zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso form: r zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso 73 and active form: r zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results support the hypothesis that zzso is involved in breast cancer zzso
