zzso is a large zzso type I zzso that is zzso in pancreatic cancer zzso and has been shown to be associated with its progression and zzso However, the exact cellular and molecular zzso through which zzso promotes zzso of PC cells has been sparsely zzso Here we showed that the zzso zzso domain of zzso which is similar to the zzso present in the zzso or zzso (an zzso zzso zzso contributes to the zzso interaction property of zzso By this interaction, zzso promotes breaching of basement membrane zzso integrity, and spreading of cancer zzso These observations are zzso with the data from our study using an engineered zzso protein without the zzso domain, which was zzso expressed in the zzso PC cells, lacking zzso zzso and zzso zzso The in zzso studies demonstrated an enhanced zzso of zzso cells expressing zzso zzso compared with zzso cells zzso zzso or cells expressing zzso without the zzso domain zzso zzso However, the absence of zzso has no significant role on cell growth and zzso zzso In the in zzso studies, all the mice zzso implanted with zzso cells developed zzso to the liver as compared with zzso or the zzso group, zzso supporting our in zzso zzso Additionally, a reduced binding zzso of zzso cells to the zzso coated plates compared with zzso cells indicated a possible interaction between the zzso domain and zzso a zzso zzso Furthermore, in PC tissue samples, zzso zzso with the zzso present in the zzso Altogether, our findings demonstrate that the zzso domain significantly contributes to the zzso zzso of PC zzso This may be partly due to the interaction between the zzso domain and zzso
