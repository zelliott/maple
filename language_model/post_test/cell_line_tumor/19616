Previous uranium mining in the zzso region in Germany enhanced environmental distribution of heavy metals and zzso zzso effects may now lead to contamination of locally produced zzso zzso of zzso origin are probably zzso via their irradiating components zzso or by interacting directly with cellular zzso To assess possible zzso we investigated the zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso in human colon tumor cells zzso clone zzso zzso cells zzso and zzso primary colon zzso These are target cells of oral exposure to environmentally contaminated foods and represent different cellular stages during zzso zzso zzso cells were incubated with zzso Cell survival, zzso cellular zzso zzso levels, zzso and DNA repair capacity zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso damage combination of comet zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso inhibited growth of zzso clone zzso cells zzso zzso 72 zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso 24 zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso but did not inhibit the repair of DNA damage caused by hydrogen zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was also zzso in zzso cells and primary colon cells, where it additionally increased migration of zzso into the comet zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso increased zzso aberrations in zzso 5, 12, and 17, which harbor the zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso It may be concluded that uranium compounds could increase zzso zzso exposure in humans if they reach the food chain in sufficient zzso
