In this study we compared the role of zzso in the regulation of growth and zzso in normal human prostate zzso cells zzso and prostate tumor cell lines zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso cells were resistant whereas the zzso cell line was highly sensitive to zzso induced growth arrest and zzso The resistance of zzso and zzso cells was zzso via an zzso survival zzso as treatment of resistant cells with zzso was accompanied by zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso did not induce zzso of zzso in the sensitive zzso zzso The sensitivity of zzso cells involved a zzso zzso cascade as zzso F reversed the sensitivity of zzso cells and induced resistance to zzso The differences in zzso to zzso induced zzso of zzso and certain prostate tumor cells offer intriguing possibilities for the treatment of prostate cancer without affecting the normal prostate zzso
