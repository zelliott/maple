To establish the method of isolation and culture of human zzso zzso and the zzso of their stem cells, followed by the process of obtaining tumor zzso zzso characterizing this zzso zzso 

Through the processing of zzso samples zzso the following strategy of action was zzso zzso establish primary culture of zzso zzso isolation and culture of tumor zzso zzso purify cells that initiate tumors zzso by magnetic separation system zzso zzso obtain tumor zzso zzso study the expression of the markers zzso zzso and zzso 

The study successfully described the process of isolation and culture of zzso zzso which consist of a number of zzso cells zzso characterized as zzso which are able to initiate tumor zzso 

These findings may contribute to a better understanding of the process of zzso
