Previous efforts to develop drugs that directly inhibit the activity of zzso zzso the most commonly zzso human zzso have not been zzso Cancer cells driven by zzso zzso require expression of the zzso zzso zzso for their viability and zzso identifying zzso as a zzso therapeutic zzso However, specific strategies for interfering with the critical functions of zzso are not yet zzso Here, using a mass zzso screen for zzso protein interaction partners, we report that the zzso zzso complex binds to and zzso zzso in human cancer zzso zzso zzso of zzso using structurally divergent small molecules currently in clinical development, induced zzso degradation of zzso in human cancer cells of various tissue origin in zzso and in zzso and triggered zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells in an zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibitor treatment impaired sphere formation and viability of primary human colon zzso cells harboring zzso zzso These findings provide zzso insight into the activity of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cancer cells, indicate that the enhanced requirement for zzso can be exploited to target zzso zzso tumors, and identify zzso depletion through zzso zzso as a zzso therapeutic strategy with immediate zzso zzso
