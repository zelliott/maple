The zzso zzso zzso zzso shows potent and selective zzso and zzso zzso However, the mechanism by which it is initially transported into cells to induce zzso is zzso zzso the current investigation examined the cellular zzso of zzso relative to two structurally related zzso namely the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso In marked contrast to the cellular zzso of zzso and zzso which were linear as a function of zzso zzso zzso was zzso using zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Together with the fact that zzso zzso was zzso and significantly zzso zzso zzso decreased by competing zzso zzso these observations indicated a zzso transport mechanism consistent with zzso zzso Other zzso zzso that shared the saturated zzso structural zzso with zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso illustrating its importance for zzso zzso Nevertheless, zzso zzso most markedly decreased zzso zzso demonstrating that the putative zzso shows high selectivity for zzso Interestingly, in contrast to zzso zzso of its zzso complex zzso was not zzso as a function of concentration and was much greater than the zzso alone, indicating an alternate mode of zzso Studies examining the tissue distribution of zzso injected zzso into a mouse tumor model demonstrated the zzso label was primarily identified in the zzso zzso zzso these findings examining the mechanism of zzso zzso and its distribution and zzso have clinical implications for its zzso and zzso in zzso
