zzso has been shown to be an important therapeutic alternative to surgery in the treatment of zzso zzso zzso Here, the influence of zzso on zzso was examined in zzso using the human zzso cell line zzso a drug-resistant zzso cell line originating from zzso cells zzso as well as two control cell lines, the zzso cell line zzso and a zzso tumor cell line zzso zzso were treated with either exposure to different freezing temperatures zzso from zzso to zzso degrees C for 20 zzso exposure to zzso zzso of zzso chemotherapy drugs or a combination of zzso and zzso Cell viability and zzso under each condition were zzso We found that the combined treatment resulted in increases in both cell death and zzso compared to either treatment zzso The increased level of zzso observed in zzso cells after zzso was inhibited in the presence of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso expression was increased zzso to zzso in cells exposed to the combination treatment compared with cells treated by freezing or drugs zzso In contrast, zzso levels remained zzso Although zzso cells originated from the zzso cell line, they were more sensitive to the freezing procedure than the parental cell zzso The level of zzso expression in zzso cells was also higher than that observed in the parental cell zzso In addition, we found that zzso cells had lower levels of zzso zzso than the parental zzso cells, in both zzso and treated zzso In conclusion, our data show that in zzso cells, zzso induced by zzso can be zzso enhanced using zzso zzso
