Changes in DNA zzso of tumor zzso can occur early in zzso and are potentially important early indicators of zzso The objective of this study was to assess the zzso of 25 tumor zzso genes in zzso cancer using a zzso zzso multiplex zzso probe amplification zzso zzso zzso analyses in zzso cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso primary zzso tumor specimens zzso zzso 31) supported the panel of genes selected being altered in zzso zzso The process of zzso was zzso for its application in body zzso using two independent training and validation sets of urinary specimens zzso zzso zzso including patients with zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso and controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were the most frequently zzso genes in zzso tumors, with zzso zzso being significantly associated with tumor stage zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified as zzso tumor zzso In addition, zzso zzso and zzso were the most frequently zzso genes in urinary zzso zzso operating characteristic curve analyses revealed significant diagnostic zzso in both urinary sets for zzso zzso and zzso The novelty of this report relates to applying zzso a zzso zzso technique, for tumor zzso in zzso cancer and body zzso zzso profiles of tumor zzso genes were clinically relevant for zzso zzso of zzso tumors and offered a zzso diagnostic strategy for the clinical management of patients affected with zzso zzso
