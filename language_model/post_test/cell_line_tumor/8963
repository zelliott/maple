zzso cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death zzso Cancer zzso side population zzso cells may be important factors that hinder efficacy of zzso and zzso approaches in gastric zzso zzso is an zzso agent that has been used in many zzso however, no reports to date have determined the effects of zzso in gastric zzso In our study, SP and main population zzso cells were isolated from 4 gastric cancer cell lines in different stages of differentiation by flow zzso zzso and confirmed by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and Western zzso zzso decreased the zzso increased zzso and induced zzso damage in the SP cells isolated from 1 cell type zzso but not zzso cells, through increased zzso and decreased zzso and zzso protein zzso This protein expression pattern induced the zzso of zzso and zzso The effects of zzso on zzso SP cells were blocked by treating cells with vitamin D zzso zzso zzso or zzso (an inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso targets zzso SP cells through a zzso zzso zzso However, further studies are needed to zzso the signal zzso between zzso and the zzso zzso zzso
