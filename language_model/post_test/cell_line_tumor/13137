zzso zzso infection is the main risk factor for zzso zzso zzso and gastric cancer zzso IM is a zzso zzso induced by the zzso factor zzso where the gastric zzso is converted to an zzso zzso We previously demonstrated that key elements of the bone zzso protein zzso zzso zzso with zzso in IM and zzso zzso expression in gastric cell zzso These zzso together with the hypothesis that zzso could be zzso by zzso led us to test whether zzso zzso through zzso zzso and zzso could participate in a molecular network critical for the development of zzso zzso cells with and without zzso zzso were zzso with zzso zzso or zzso to assess the expression of zzso zzso members as well as zzso and zzso by zzso and western zzso Proximity zzso zzso zzso was also performed to evaluate zzso proteins zzso zzso and western zzso were performed in gastric samples from mice infected with zzso zzso to measure zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression in zzso Increased expression and activity of the zzso zzso accompanied by zzso zzso and zzso zzso were observed in zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso or zzso These effects were impaired by zzso of the zzso zzso Finally, infected mice present zzso zzso zzso focal zzso expression and decreased zzso These results provide a novel link between zzso zzso infection and the zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso and zzso genes that might be relevant for gastric zzso
