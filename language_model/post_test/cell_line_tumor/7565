The zzso of most solid tumors is remarkably reduced in individuals with Down zzso Using mouse models of Down syndrome, we have previously shown that this decrease in tumor zzso is due, in part, to suppression of tumor zzso as a consequence of attenuated zzso signaling in zzso zzso Our prior studies zzso zzso tumors in a transgenic mouse model with three copies of the Down syndrome critical zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso contributes to broad cancer protection by suppressing tumor zzso through zzso the zzso zzso in the vascular zzso However, it still remains to be confirmed whether a single extra copy of zzso is also sufficient to suppress tumor zzso in slow growing spontaneous tumors that more accurately zzso molecular features of human zzso In this study, utilizing zzso mice, an zzso and zzso model of human lung zzso on a zzso transgenic mouse background, we show that a single extra transgenic copy of zzso provides a survival advantage in these mice developing spontaneous lung tumors driven by zzso zzso without affecting either initiation or progression of spontaneous lung zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso zzso significantly reduces zzso density in lung tumors and thus limits the growth of lung tumors through decreased proliferation and increased zzso of lung tumor zzso These data provide evidence that a single extra copy of zzso is sufficient to suppress tumor zzso during spontaneous lung zzso and further support our hypothesis that suppression of tumor zzso by an additional copy of zzso contributes to the reduced cancer zzso in individuals with Down syndrome and the zzso zzso in the tumor zzso is a potential target for cancer zzso
