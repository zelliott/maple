The trafficking protein particle complex 4 zzso is implicated in zzso zzso but its association with disease has rarely been zzso We explored its potential interaction with zzso part of the zzso complex in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pathway, by a zzso zzso screen and confirmed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Further investigation found that when zzso was zzso activated zzso specifically decreased in the nucleus, which was accompanied with cell growth suppression and zzso in zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso of zzso promoted cell viability and caused activated zzso to increase overall, but especially in the zzso zzso was expressed more highly in the nucleus of zzso cells than in normal zzso zzso or zzso which corresponded with nuclear zzso of zzso We demonstrate here that zzso may regulate cell proliferation and zzso in zzso by interaction with zzso and subsequently zzso zzso as well as modulating the zzso location of zzso to activate the relevant signaling zzso
