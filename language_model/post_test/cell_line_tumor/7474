We report a zzso zzso scattering zzso cellular imaging technique to detect and zzso breast cancer zzso markers expressed on cell zzso This technique involves the synthesis of zzso zzso tags consisting of zzso hollow gold zzso zzso zzso with specific zzso Hollow gold zzso zzso enhance zzso signal intensity of individual particles by zzso surface electromagnetic fields through zzso in the hollow particle zzso This capacity to enhance imaging at the level of single molecules permits the use of zzso to detect specific biological markers expressed in living cancer zzso In addition, zzso zzso greatly enhances the stability of zzso Here we applied a zzso imaging technique using zzso in the multiplex imaging of three breast cancer cell zzso zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso growth zzso zzso receptors were assessed in the zzso zzso and zzso human breast cancer cell zzso zzso imaging technology described here can be used to test the zzso of a cancer cell and zzso proteins expressed on the cell surface zzso Based on results, this technique may enable an earlier diagnosis of breast cancer than is currently possible and offer guidance in zzso
