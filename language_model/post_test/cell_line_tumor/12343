The zzso and zzso effect of wheat leaf zzso was tested in zzso on the human zzso cell line and in zzso on zzso nude mice bearing human melanoma zzso The zzso activity of this plant zzso was negligible in comparison with bovine seminal zzso In the experiments in zzso a significant decrease of the tumor size, however, was observed in the mice treated with wheat leaf zzso (27 zzso compared with the control zzso A and zzso zzso In nude mice injected zzso with wheat leaf zzso the tumor size decreased from zzso in the control mice to zzso in treated zzso In the mice treated with zzso zzso wheat leaf zzso the tumor reduction was observed from 100 to zzso whereas in counterparts treated with zzso zzso bovine seminal zzso the tumor zzso was reduced from 100 to zzso Certain zzso and zzso activity of wheat leaf zzso and bovine seminal zzso also appeared, but was lower in comparison with the effect of zzso Mutual zzso zzso between wheat leaf zzso zzso on one side and animal zzso zzso seminal zzso zzso A, human zzso and zzso on the other side proved a certain structural similarity between animal and plant zzso zzso of wheat leaf zzso was weaker in comparison with bovine seminal zzso zzso of zzso zzso against zzso in bovine seminal zzso Interestingly, zzso effect of wheat leaf zzso tested on mixed zzso zzso human zzso reached the same level as that of bovine seminal zzso The zzso against wheat leaf zzso produced in the injected mice did not zzso the biological effect of this plant zzso in zzso This is probably the first paper in which plant zzso was used as zzso and zzso drug against animal and human normal and tumor cells and zzso in comparison with animal zzso
