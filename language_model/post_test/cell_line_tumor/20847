zzso zzso a zzso isolated from the roots of zzso plants, has potential zzso activity against several tumor zzso We have examined the effects of zzso on cellular zzso ex zzso as well as its binding with zzso zzso and zzso in zzso Cell viability experiments using human zzso lung zzso zzso cells zzso indicated that the zzso 50 value for zzso is zzso zzso zzso studies using an zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a significant zzso of the zzso zzso network in a dose dependent zzso In zzso zzso of zzso zzso into zzso is inhibited by zzso with an zzso 50 value of 38 zzso zzso zzso Its binding to zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in a time and concentration dependent zzso zzso of zzso to zzso is slow, taking 60 zzso for zzso at 25 degrees zzso The association reaction zzso is zzso in nature, and the association rate zzso for fast and slow zzso are zzso zzso 36 M zzso s zzso and zzso zzso 11 M zzso s zzso at 25 degrees C zzso The zzso of zzso binding to zzso is zzso zzso with a zzso constant of zzso zzso zzso zzso at 25 degrees zzso zzso competes for the zzso binding site with a K i of zzso zzso as determined from a modified Dixon zzso Based on these data we conclude that zzso recognizes the zzso binding site to zzso Further study is necessary to locate the zzso point of attachment of the inhibitor to the zzso binding site of zzso
