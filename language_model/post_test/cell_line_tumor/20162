Parkinson's disease is characterized by zzso zzso and is associated with zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso to toxins which induce Parkinson's like syndromes in animal models is then of particular zzso For example, zzso zzso zzso and its active zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been shown to induce zzso cell death in zzso and in zzso Exposure of animals to these compounds induce a range of responses characteristics of Parkinson's disease, including zzso cell death, and zzso zzso Species zzso zzso Here we test the hypothesis that cellular zzso dysfunction caused by these compounds zzso with induction of cell death in differentiated zzso zzso zzso zzso At increasing doses, zzso induced significant cell death accompanied with zzso 3 zzso At these zzso zzso had an immediate zzso of zzso zzso oxygen consumption rate zzso zzso with a decrease of zzso zzso and reserve capacity, as well as a stimulation of zzso zzso exhibited a different behavior with less pronounced cell death at doses that nearly eliminated zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso unlike zzso zzso zzso reserve zzso The effects of zzso on zzso function was markedly less than the effects of zzso or zzso at zzso doses, suggesting a mechanism largely independent of zzso zzso These studies suggest that these zzso zzso induce cell death through distinct mechanisms and differential effects on cellular zzso
