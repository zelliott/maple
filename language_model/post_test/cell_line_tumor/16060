Using a liver zzso model we investigated whether zzso enhances the zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

First, the viability of zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso atmosphere was assessed by zzso zzso zzso Second, we randomly assigned 20 rabbits bearing zzso liver zzso to 4 groups: Group 1 zzso plus zzso Group 2 zzso zzso Group 3 zzso only) and Group 4 zzso zzso was orally administered for 5 zzso The zzso effects were assessed by the zzso proliferation rate using zzso and by zzso analysis of the area of zzso zzso Analysis of zzso and zzso honestly significant difference test were used for statistical zzso 

The viability of cells grown under hypoxic and normal conditions was not significantly different, nor was there a difference among the four zzso The zzso size increased by zzso in Group 1, zzso in Group 2, zzso in Group 3 and zzso in Group 4; the difference between Group 1 and the other three groups was zzso The area of zzso vessels in specimens was zzso in Group 1, zzso in Group 2, zzso in Group 3 and zzso in Group 4; the difference between Group 1 and the other groups was statistically zzso as was the difference between Groups 3 and zzso 

zzso used in combination with zzso enhanced zzso effects in rabbits bearing zzso liver zzso
