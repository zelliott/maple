The zzso zzso zzso which are expressed in zzso cells under zzso conditions, are strongly expressed in human prostate cancer zzso zzso Their role in the tumor cells and in tumor progression is largely zzso We established a prostate cancer zzso cell line zzso zzso expressing zzso and zzso simultaneously under zzso control, to study the role of zzso on tumor growth and zzso of immune cells in subcutaneous zzso in male zzso zzso zzso zzso of distant zzso was studied after zzso injection of the tumor cells in male zzso zzso zzso zzso cells grown in zzso and subcutaneous zzso in mice not treated with zzso expressed high levels of zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso treatment suppressed zzso zzso zzso expression did not significantly alter growth rate and invasion of the subcutaneous tumors into surrounding zzso However, zzso expression caused increased zzso of immune cells, especially zzso In zzso injected mice sporadic tumor settlement was observed in muscle and zzso zzso zzso of tumor cells and zzso were observed in the lung of zzso (9 out of zzso of mice not treated with zzso and in zzso (5 out of zzso of mice treated with zzso Our data demonstrate for the first time that zzso expression in zzso cancer cells causes enhanced zzso of immune cells, especially zzso and stimulates settlement of the cancer cells in the zzso
