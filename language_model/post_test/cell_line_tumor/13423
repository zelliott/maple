Evidence exists that exposure of zzso cells to zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso can cause effects similar to those resulting from direct radiation zzso This study attempts to validate the zzso model, relating absorbed dose to the zzso and processing of cell death signals by zzso cells, in zzso in zzso human prostate cancer cell zzso 

The recipient cell survival was measured after exposure of cells to zzso derived from donor zzso a) exposed to radiation doses from 2 zzso to 8 zzso and b) of zzso varying from 2 zzso zzso to 6 zzso zzso zzso with 2 zzso 

Exposure to zzso zzso with doses between zzso zzso resulted in a significant zzso zzso decrease in zzso survival of zzso recipient cells compared to the control zzso However, dose dependency above 2 zzso was not observed, indicating that any dose threshold was below 2 zzso A significant zzso zzso decrease in survival was found in recipient cells exposed to the zzso derived from different zzso of donor cells exposed to 2 zzso compared to the control zzso The recipient cell survival following exposure to zzso derived from 2 zzso zzso cells was significantly higher zzso zzso compared to the rest of donor cell zzso indicating that the toxicity of zzso depends on the cellular concentration of donor zzso zzso zzso data fitting provided reasonable agreement with the zzso model for the induction of cell killing through zzso zzso 

For the given cell line and given experimental conditions, significant decreases in cell survival were observed in zzso cells exposed to zzso derived from donor cells of various zzso and zzso with different zzso
