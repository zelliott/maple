In this study, a mechanism in which zzso zzso zzso is permanently removed, induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso for 1 zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso zzso at 40 zzso was zzso One zzso cell line zzso zzso and two zzso cell lines zzso zzso were zzso The effects of different zzso on zzso were investigated using the colony zzso zzso zzso was used to measure zzso oxide zzso zzso levels, and zzso analysis to compare gene expression in primed and zzso zzso The data show how permanent removal of zzso previously found to be induced by zzso zzso zzso can also be induced by addition of zzso oxide zzso zzso combined with either zzso zzso or exposure to prolonged cycling zzso followed by zzso a treatment not involving zzso The removal of zzso appears not to involve DNA damage induced during zzso zzso as it was also induced by zzso zzso of zzso medium without cells zzso The permanent removal of zzso in zzso cells was reversed by treatment with zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso inhibitor zzso Furthermore, zzso could also induce zzso in an zzso cell zzso The data suggest that zzso zzso for 1 zzso but not 15 zzso activates zzso and also that sustained zzso zzso is necessary for the permanent removal of zzso by zzso zzso The data indicate that zzso oxide production is involved in the regulatory processes determining cellular responses to zzso zzso
