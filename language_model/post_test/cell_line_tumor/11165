A small library of structurally diverse zzso has been zzso by reacting zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso by zzso 120 zzso zzso All the zzso zzso were zzso for their in zzso zzso activities against a panel of five human cancer cell lines including zzso zzso zzso Colo zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso having zzso was found to be the most active amongst all the zzso zzso against all the five cancer cell lines, most prominent being against zzso cell line with an zzso value of 4 zzso Surprisingly, compound zzso having zzso was found to be devoid of any zzso Our finding suggests that these chemical entities could further serve as interesting template for the design of potential zzso zzso
