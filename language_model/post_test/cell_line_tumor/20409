zzso zzso zzso zzso engineered zzso occupy an increasing niche in cancer zzso In this context, zzso zzso signaling is sufficient to elicit zzso and zzso production while the additional provision of zzso signal 2 promotes zzso proliferation and zzso zzso zzso This zzso of signaling opens the possibility that complementary zzso could be used to focus zzso zzso within the tumor zzso 

Here, we have tested this principle by zzso an zzso and zzso zzso that signal using zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was achieved using the zzso zzso zzso containing an intervening zzso zzso zzso 

We found that zzso zzso kill zzso tumor cells efficiently and zzso in a manner that requires zzso of zzso and zzso by target zzso zzso however, zzso production was modest when compared to control zzso zzso in which signaling is delivered by a fused zzso zzso 

These findings demonstrate the principle that dual targeting may be achieved using genetically targeted zzso and pave the way for testing of this strategy in zzso
