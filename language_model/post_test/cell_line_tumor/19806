In DNA zzso an exciting new zzso technique with potential applications in clinical medicine, expression zzso DNA containing zzso sequences cloned under zzso promoter control are delivered by techniques that lead in zzso to zzso expression in zzso zzso DNA vaccination efficiently zzso both zzso and cellular immune zzso We developed a novel expression system for DNA vaccines in which a fusion protein with a small, zzso viral zzso sequence zzso zzso is translated in frame with zzso zzso zzso The J domain stable bind to zzso zzso zzso stress protein zzso and triggers zzso zzso of zzso zzso The system supports enhanced expression of zzso zzso of zzso zzso in length in zzso zzso A unique advantage of the system is that even unstable or toxic proteins (or protein zzso can be zzso We describe the design of DNA vaccines expressing zzso with a stress zzso domain and characterize the zzso of the zzso produced by this expression zzso
