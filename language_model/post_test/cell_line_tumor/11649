zzso zzso 1 zzso is activated by binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso via its zzso zzso Here, we provide evidence that zzso in the zzso domain of zzso is not directly involved in this binding but is crucial for zzso zzso zzso zzso reduces the binding affinity of zzso for the zzso and zzso zzso and zzso activity of zzso Thus, this zzso abrogates the ability of zzso to induce changes in cell zzso and zzso and to promote zzso transformation of prostate zzso zzso We also show that growth of the prostate cancer cell line zzso is inhibited by the treatment of a zzso zzso zzso 19 zzso acids centered on zzso but not by the zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso and that this growth zzso is correlated with reduced zzso activity of zzso Together, these findings demonstrate a significant role of zzso in zzso zzso and provide evidence for a novel mechanism of the zzso interaction of zzso with zzso and zzso
