The zzso induced zzso effect of zzso zzso was studied in mice bearing zzso solid zzso 

In order to determine the optimum timing of ultrasound exposure after administration of zzso the zzso zzso in zzso skin, muscle and tumor were estimated by measuring the zzso intensity of tissue zzso with a zzso zzso based on the standard zzso A three-dimensional optical imaging system zzso zzso was used further to characterize the distribution of zzso in zzso zzso The zzso effects were estimated by measuring tumor size after zzso zzso 

Similar zzso trends of zzso in mice were observed either by zzso zzso or by zzso zzso The results also demonstrated that zzso has a preferential zzso in tumors, but low zzso and rapid clearance in normal zzso The results of zzso effects revealed that at an ultrasound intensity of zzso and a zzso dose of zzso a significant synergistic effect of ultrasound combined with zzso was observed, reducing the tumor volume zzso 

zzso is a potential zzso for zzso imaging as well as for zzso therapy for zzso The zzso effect of ultrasound could be enhanced in the presence of zzso which might be involved in a zzso zzso
