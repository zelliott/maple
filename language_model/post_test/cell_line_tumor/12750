To identify the zzso indigenous zzso zzso strains that specifically targets human cancer cells in zzso Tamil zzso South zzso 

zzso inclusion proteins from the 82 zzso indigenous zzso of zzso zzso were zzso for their zzso against two human cancer cell lines, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso human colon cancer zzso zzso inclusion protein from one of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be highly zzso to zzso zzso and moderately toxic to zzso but nontoxic to normal zzso This strain did not show any zzso activity against the zzso and zzso larvae tested, as well as it was zzso on human zzso The zzso analysis showed that the putative 180 zzso zzso protein from the isolate zzso zzso zzso zzso with the reference zzso of zzso zzso 

Our observations imply that zzso zzso zzso is different from the already reported zzso producers, as it is showing variation in the target zzso 

zzso these proteins can pave the way to alleviate problems associated with zzso transformation and cancer zzso
