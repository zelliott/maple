To investigate the effect of zzso zzso on DNA damage and expression of genes involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso group B, C, zzso zzso zzso and zzso repair zzso 1 zzso in lung cancer zzso zzso 

Cell survival was measured using zzso zzso viability zzso Single cell gel zzso was applied to determine the DNA damage and zzso The level of gene expression was measured by reverse zzso chain zzso 

The cell survival decreased from zzso to zzso after 24 h treatment with zzso of varying concentration ranging zzso zzso The cell survival decreased to zzso and zzso respectively after 12 h and 24 h treatment with 10 zzso zzso with DNA damage gradually zzso At 12 h after 24 h treatment, the cell survival further decreased to zzso and DNA damage became most zzso At 24 h after 24 h treatment, cell survival recovered to zzso and damaged DNA was repaired zzso zzso and zzso gene expression increased to zzso and zzso respectively compared with zzso level at 24 h treatment or 12 h after 24 h treatment with 10 zzso zzso zzso However, zzso and zzso gene expression was inhibited in 24 h treatment period, then recovered gradually after zzso 

zzso could lead to DNA damage and expression level change of genes involved in zzso zzso repair in lung cancer zzso zzso
