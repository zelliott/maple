The present work describes the preparation of a novel series of compounds based on the structure of zzso zzso a natural zzso zzso with known zzso and zzso activities against a variety of cancer cell zzso A focused library of 17 zzso zzso displaying the zzso motif were prepared, and their zzso zzso While the zzso bearing zzso and/or zzso groups on the aromatic zzso usually were at least three times less potent than the lead compound zzso zzso and zzso zzso 10 and 11 exhibited levels of zzso similar to zzso zzso against most cancer cell lines zzso One could suggest that the electronic effect of the zzso group activates the zzso zzso site via reduction of the electron density of the zzso zzso oxygen zzso These results provide new information on the structure activity relationship of these zzso zzso zzso thereby further focusing the design of novel zzso
