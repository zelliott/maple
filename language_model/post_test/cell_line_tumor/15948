zzso is a zzso zzso frequently zzso in human zzso Here we show that zzso is zzso both in zzso and in zzso by zzso zzso thus linking this zzso to one of the most frequently activated zzso in human zzso Ras regulation of zzso occurs with a delayed kinetic and requires at least two Ras downstream zzso A screen of human zzso zzso and zzso lung zzso for the expression of zzso reveals that it is zzso mainly in zzso zzso zzso the most aggressive form of zzso cancer, whereas in lung its zzso appears to be zzso correlated with tumor zzso We also show that a zzso directed against zzso slows down tumor growth in zzso zzso a search for zzso zzso by zzso shows an enrichment for zzso zzso cell cycle checkpoints regulators, suggesting an important role for zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso
