Although a number of studies have been conducted to address the relation between a gene deletion zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and breast cancer, no zzso conclusion has been reached and no clear risk pattern has yet to emerge for zzso We first conducted zzso studies that included 1920 subjects using a zzso method allowing the definition of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The results show that zzso zzso an increased risk for breast cancer development compared with that in zzso individuals zzso and zzso which was subsequently confirmed by a zzso of all of the 41 relevant studies zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso is also a risk zzso compared with zzso Furthermore, we identified a functional zzso in the zzso promoter region associated with breast zzso The zzso zzso zzso DNA binding to the zzso zzso factor, resulting in reduced promoter activity and zzso zzso However, this zzso zzso is associated with reduced breast cancer zzso It seems that approximately zzso expression from one zzso of zzso could suffice for protection against breast zzso zzso activity and zzso of zzso are both zzso These results indicate a zzso association of zzso with breast cancer, which challenges the linear zzso effect of zzso that was previously zzso We recommend that a more complicated role for zzso should be considered in breast cancer risk zzso
