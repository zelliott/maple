The role of tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso in zzso zzso of acute leukemia is zzso We demonstrated in our previous study that the zzso of zzso promoted zzso cell invasion in zzso We investigated in the present study whether zzso would have the same effect in zzso A zzso zzso carrying human zzso zzso was constructed and zzso into zzso zzso Three zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso that highly expressed zzso were selected to establish nude mouse models of acute zzso Times of zzso onset in mice of S1, zzso and zzso groups were all earlier than that of the zzso group, whereas the survival times of S1, zzso and zzso groups were all shorter than that of the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso results demonstrated severe zzso zzso in numerous zzso in each zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso showed that several zzso expressed the zzso fusion zzso Moreover, the numbers of zzso infiltrated by zzso cells in S1, zzso and zzso groups were more than those in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression enhanced zzso cell invasion in nude mice and resulted in more severe leukemia zzso This phenomenon suggests that targeted therapy with zzso for acute leukemia should be performed with zzso
