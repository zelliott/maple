This study aimed to investigate the zzso and therapy of zzso resistant model of minimal residual leukemia in zzso The zzso resistant model of minimal residual leukemia was established by using zzso cell line expressing enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso and zzso zzso The results showed that zzso were zzso in the abdominal cavities of zzso mice, the zzso of leukemia was zzso Any of these mice with leukemia could not obtain zzso zzso The model of leukemia was sensitive to zzso zzso and the time of survival was related to the dose of Cy zzso The zzso of cells zzso in mice correlated zzso with the dose of zzso So this model was ideal for research on minimal residual zzso The distribution of residual leukemia cells in complete zzso was not uniform in different zzso including liver, zzso zzso and bone zzso zzso residual leukemia cells could be found by fluorescent zzso in freezing tissue zzso It is concluded that the zzso resistant model of minimal residual leukemia expressing zzso can be established by using zzso cell line and zzso zzso The minimal residual leukemia cells can be observed by zzso zzso in complete zzso zzso
