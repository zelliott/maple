A recent body of evidence indicates an active role for zzso zzso in the progression of zzso Within this conceptual zzso genes belonging to the growing but still poorly characterized class of tumor zzso zzso genes zzso seem to play a crucial role in the regulation of the zzso between zzso and zzso cells by controlling zzso growth in zzso without affecting any zzso zzso in zzso Here, we have functionally characterized the human zzso zzso which encodes the first human member of the widespread zzso family of zzso zzso and was recently found to be zzso at the transcript level in several primary zzso tumors or cell lines and in melanoma cell zzso Although we could not detect any activity for zzso in several functional in zzso zzso a remarkable control of zzso zzso could be detected in zzso Moreover, the control of zzso zzso zzso by this unique tumor zzso gene occurs through modification of the cellular zzso and the induction of zzso cells of the zzso zzso Taken together, the data presented in this work strongly indicate zzso as a previously unexplored member of the growing family of zzso zzso
