The first step in zzso zzso zzso occurs in the nucleus and is zzso by the zzso complex containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso zzso associates with independently transcribed zzso and, in combination with zzso processing, zzso zzso in downstream zzso We suggest that, after zzso zzso a zzso mechanism acts on nascent long precursor zzso zzso zzso zzso degrades the zzso zzso zzso transcripts inducing its release from the zzso While involved in primary transcript zzso this zzso effect does not restrict clustered zzso zzso which, in the majority of cases, is separated by short zzso We also show that transcripts originating from a zzso promoter are retained on the zzso template and are more efficiently processed than those produced from zzso or zzso Pol zzso zzso These data imply that zzso between zzso and processing promotes efficient expression of independently transcribed zzso
