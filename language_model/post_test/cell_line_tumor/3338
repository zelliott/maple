To clarify effective zzso regimens against cancer, we examined the effects of zzso on zzso induced by zzso treatment using cultured human cancer cells (in zzso and transplanted tumor in mice (in zzso Human tongue cell zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso gene zzso zzso showed zzso compared with the cells with zzso control gene zzso zzso When those cultured cells were zzso with zzso zzso zzso was enhanced by zzso in zzso zzso cells but not in zzso zzso zzso In zzso mice, the zzso treatment to tumors enhanced growth delay induced by zzso in zzso tumors transplanted with zzso zzso cells, but not in zzso tumors transplanted with zzso zzso zzso When transplanted tumors were treated with zzso alone, the cells positive for active zzso 85 zzso zzso and zzso were observed by zzso zzso in zzso tumors but not in zzso zzso When the tumors were treated with zzso combined with zzso positive cells were observed not only in zzso tumors but also in zzso zzso These results showed that the zzso growth zzso of the tumors is zzso zzso and that the enhanced growth delay by zzso may be due to the increased zzso zzso might be available for cancer chemotherapy in patients with zzso zzso
