A common zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso is associated with risk for cardiovascular disease, zzso arthritis, and other zzso Here we used the zzso zzso zzso method to study zzso zzso expression under in zzso conditions in zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso the ratio of zzso to zzso after zzso zzso using an zzso against zzso active zzso zzso zzso There was no zzso difference in zzso activity during zzso conditions, zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso However, after stimulation of zzso expression by zzso differentiation or incubation with zzso the zzso containing the zzso was associated with higher zzso activity compared with the zzso zzso zzso shift zzso demonstrated increased binding of nuclear proteins to the zzso after zzso zzso In conclusion, the common zzso zzso promoter zzso appears to be functional only during specific environmental conditions involving zzso
