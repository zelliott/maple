zzso of mice with a zzso zzso zzso termed zzso zzso zzso acids zzso zzso in the C zzso of zzso zzso resulted in the generation of an zzso mouse zzso zzso The zzso recognized by zzso zzso which has been confirmed to be located in the zzso sequence by zzso analysis, is frequently zzso on the cell surface of human and mouse tumors, but not on zzso cells and normal zzso and membrane zzso might thus serve as a zzso target zzso As shown for human tumors, zzso is associated with zzso zzso in the plasma membrane of mouse zzso zzso we show that the zzso zzso can selectively induce zzso cellular zzso zzso of membrane zzso mouse tumor cells by zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso killing could be further enhanced by zzso the zzso cells with zzso and zzso Three consecutive injections of the zzso zzso into mice bearing zzso tumors significantly inhibited tumor growth and enhanced the overall zzso These effects were associated with zzso of zzso cells, zzso and zzso The zzso specificity of the zzso response was confirmed by preventing the zzso response in zzso mice by zzso the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso and by blocking the binding of zzso zzso to zzso tumor cells using either zzso zzso or the zzso zzso domain of zzso
