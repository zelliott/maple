Recent studies underline the important role of zzso zzso in the development of lung zzso The main regulators of zzso zzso are the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here the role of core proteins of zzso zzso machinery in the response of human zzso and small cell lung zzso cell lines to treatment with zzso radiation was zzso We found that zzso and zzso were expressed at higher levels in zzso but not in sensitive cell zzso However, zzso of either zzso or zzso had no effect on the sensitivity of cells to zzso zzso of components of the zzso zzso complex zzso and Tudor zzso zzso also did not sensitize cells to the same zzso Thus, zzso of zzso zzso machinery is not sufficient to increase the zzso of lung tumors and other strategies are required to combat lung zzso
