The cellular prion protein zzso is essential for the zzso and transmission of prion zzso zzso is bound to the plasma membrane via a zzso anchor, although a zzso soluble form has also been zzso Previously we reported that zzso is subject to zzso shedding from the membrane by zinc zzso with a similar zzso profile to those involved in shedding the zzso precursor zzso Here we have used zzso zzso and zzso zzso interfering zzso zzso experiments in cells to identify the zzso (a zzso and zzso involved in the zzso shedding of zzso These experiments revealed that zzso and zzso but not zzso are involved in the shedding of zzso and that zzso exerts its effect on zzso shedding via zzso Using dominant negative, zzso inactive zzso we show that the zzso activity of zzso is required for its effect on zzso Mass zzso analysis revealed that zzso but not zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso three zzso away from the site of zzso anchor zzso The shedding of another membrane zzso the zzso precursor protein zzso zzso by zzso is also zzso via zzso Furthermore, we show that pharmacological zzso of zzso shedding or zzso of both zzso and zzso shedding by zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells does not alter the formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso these data indicate that although zzso can be shed through the action of zzso family members, zzso of zzso or zzso zzso shedding does not regulate prion zzso
