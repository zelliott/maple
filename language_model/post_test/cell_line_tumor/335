zzso zzso zzso immunity requires the zzso of zzso T cells and the trafficking of activated T cells to tumor zzso These processes involve the zzso of zzso from the blood and zzso and their zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is an important zzso in these zzso It directs zzso zzso to peripheral zzso zzso where they become activated and it zzso zzso zzso to inflammatory zzso such as zzso zzso with advanced cancer are immune suppressed due to zzso zzso cells zzso a population of immature zzso cells that accumulate to high levels in response to zzso and zzso zzso We now demonstrate that the reduction in T cell levels of zzso that is commonly seen in individuals with cancer zzso zzso with zzso zzso Three lines of evidence demonstrate that zzso directly zzso zzso on zzso T zzso 1) zzso T cells zzso with zzso zzso have reduced zzso 2) T cells in zzso aged mice with elevated levels of zzso have reduced zzso and 3) zzso zzso T cells of zzso mice treated with zzso zzso zzso to elevate zzso have reduced levels of zzso zzso are likely to zzso zzso through their plasma membrane expression of zzso (a zzso and zzso domain 17), an zzso that zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels on zzso T cells, decreasing their ability to home to sites where they would be zzso This is another mechanism by which zzso inhibit zzso zzso
