The aims of this work were to investigate the zzso effect of zzso gene transfer on human zzso zzso zzso and to assess the potential of zzso zzso for zzso gene zzso 

We developed a zzso zzso zzso carrying the human zzso gene and evaluated the effects of zzso zzso gene transfer on zzso cell lines in zzso and on zzso in zzso 

Relative to zzso zzso zzso gene transfer in zzso resulted in zzso to zzso greater zzso expression levels in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and inhibited the growth of zzso zzso and zzso cells more zzso reducing relative growth rates to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity zzso suggested that the zzso effects of zzso gene transfer on zzso cell lines could be attributed to zzso arrest and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso was 11 to 14 times higher than zzso in zzso and zzso mice and lasted for 21 zzso Compared with zzso treatment, zzso treatment significantly increased survival and achieved zzso rates of zzso and zzso zzso 

Our data indicate that zzso gene transfer exerts zzso effects on zzso cells in zzso and leads to a profound zzso effect in zzso zzso is more efficient than corresponding conventional plasmids due to its capability of zzso long-lasting high levels of zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso gene transfer is a promising novel approach in the treatment of zzso
