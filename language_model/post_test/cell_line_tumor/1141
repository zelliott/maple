Agents that inhibit zzso function hold significant promise in cancer zzso Here we present zzso a representative of the first class of designed zzso zzso By specifically and zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso exhibits wide-ranging zzso activities that occur at similar doses in all tested tumor zzso zzso cells are zzso to zzso more resistant to these zzso Its zzso zzso results in multiple zzso effects, such as degradation of zzso proteins involved in cell growth, survival, and specific zzso zzso of cancer cell growth, delay of cell cycle zzso induction of zzso and functional changes, and zzso In zzso with its higher affinity for tumor zzso in zzso zzso accumulates in tumors while being rapidly cleared from normal zzso zzso achieved in zzso in tumors lead to zzso zzso activity at zzso zzso
