Numerous zzso studies documented that obesity is a risk factor for breast cancer development in zzso zzso zzso the key player in the regulation of energy balance and body weight control also acts as a growth factor on certain zzso in both normal and disease zzso In this study, we analyzed the role of zzso and the molecular zzso underlying its action in breast cancer cells that express both short and long zzso of zzso zzso zzso increased zzso cell population in the zzso of the cell cycle along with a robust increase in zzso D1 zzso Also, zzso induced zzso proliferation of zzso cells as blocking zzso zzso with a specific zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso Using deletion zzso of zzso D1 promoter and zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso induced increase in zzso D1 promoter activity is zzso through binding of activated zzso at the zzso binding sites and changes in zzso zzso and zzso We also show specific involvement of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso complex in zzso regulation of zzso D1 zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso abolished the zzso induced increase in zzso D1 expression and zzso cell zzso zzso recruitment of both zzso and zzso was dependent on zzso zzso as zzso treatment inhibited zzso recruitment of these zzso to zzso D1 zzso Our data suggest that zzso D1 may be a target gene for zzso zzso growth stimulation of breast cancer cells and molecular mechanisms involve activated zzso recruitment of distinct zzso zzso
