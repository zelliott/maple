The biomedical need for streamlined approaches to monitor zzso dynamics is growing zzso This study examined the ability of a zzso zzso strategy zzso three functionally distinct zzso zzso to clarify uncertainties about how cancer affects the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a wide range of samples at the tissue and cellular levels zzso samples from 9 zzso of zzso we obtained consistent evidence that the zzso zzso zzso a major but variable expansion in zzso Three factors having a strong influence on the zzso zzso were identified zzso type, growth rate, culture zzso and the functionally enigmatic zzso zzso was linked zzso to zzso aspects of zzso These findings justify pursuit of the zzso as a medical target in cancer, validate zzso profiling as a streamlined yet powerful measure of zzso zzso and suggest that zzso sets based on distinct zzso could have broader biomedical zzso
