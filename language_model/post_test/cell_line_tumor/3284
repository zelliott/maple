zzso zzso nuclear factor zzso belongs to a complex zzso factor network that is crucial for the function of zzso and pancreatic zzso In these cells, it activates the expression of a very large number of zzso including genes involved in the transport and metabolism of zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso gene correlate with zzso zzso diabetes of the young 1), a form of type II diabetes characterized by an impaired zzso insulin zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is located in the zzso domain of this nuclear zzso We show here that the zzso zzso failed to affect zzso zzso on zzso promoters in zzso zzso zzso in pancreatic zzso lines, this zzso resulted in strong zzso of zzso zzso activity on the promoters of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with this zzso factor playing a key role in zzso zzso We show as well that the zzso zzso creates a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso site, and that zzso zzso results in a decreased zzso activity of the zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso mimicking zzso reduced zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our results may account for the zzso zzso of diabetes in human carriers of this zzso In addition, they suggest that introduction of a zzso site in the zzso domain may represent a new mechanism by which a zzso zzso leads to loss of zzso zzso
