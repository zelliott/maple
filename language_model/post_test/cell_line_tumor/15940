zzso zzso are a large family of naturally occurring zzso exhibiting remarkable zzso zzso The first generation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits comparable activity as that of natural products and presents much higher selectivity between cancer and normal zzso In this work, we report the design, zzso and evaluation of a new series of compound 1 zzso in which a variety of zzso fragments were embedded in the left hydrocarbon chain zzso zzso 7 bearing a zzso zzso was identified to exhibit more potent zzso activity and zzso target cancer cells over normal cells and thus represents a new lead for further zzso
