A successful gene delivery system requires efficiency and stability during zzso zzso studies are imperative for zzso containing zzso products such as plasmids and targeting zzso zzso zzso are novel zzso zzso for specific gene delivery to the lung zzso zzso In this study, the storage stability of zzso zzso at zzso 5 and 24 zzso was zzso zzso zzso potential and zzso efficiency of these zzso in storage were also zzso zzso studies showed that zzso zzso were stable after 1 month when stored at zzso zzso and retained their initial size, zzso potential and zzso zzso However, their stability was not desirable at 5 and 24 zzso Based on these results, it can be concluded that zzso zzso can be a promising candidate for gene delivery to lung zzso cells with good storage stability at zzso zzso during 1 zzso
