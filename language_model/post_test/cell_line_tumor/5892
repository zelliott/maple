This study was performed to assess the biological significance of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was evaluated by quantitative zzso zzso in the following groups: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso The effects of zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso cluster scaffold zzso zzso expressions and zzso binding to zzso 3' zzso were examined in Swan 71 and zzso cell zzso zzso reaction zzso zzso zzso and electron zzso zzso zzso 3) were conducted to verify zzso of zzso zzso expression was increased in zzso and zzso cases and was decreased with birth weight and zzso zzso In both cell lines, zzso was induced by zzso whereas zzso expression was zzso The zzso zzso confirmed zzso binding to zzso zzso 3' zzso zzso interference zzso of zzso expression in Swan 71, but not in zzso cells resulted in zzso and zzso iron zzso and a fourfold decrease of zzso invasion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was decreased in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso were more frequent in the zzso bed of zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso than in control cases zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a novel pathological feature of zzso and zzso The findings zzso suggest that zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso iron metabolism is associated with defective zzso
