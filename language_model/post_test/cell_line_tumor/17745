Human tumor cell lines are powerful tools for investigating basic and applied aspects of cell zzso zzso cell lines have been instrumental in the zzso and molecular analysis of recurring zzso zzso notably zzso and zzso thus illuminating the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting the zzso gene at zzso have come to represent a paradigm in acute zzso These zzso result in the zzso joining of the zzso gene with a partner gene to generate unique fusion proteins of zzso novel zzso More than 30 partner genes that participate with zzso in the more than 60 known zzso zzso have been zzso Cell lines provide territory to both explore the detailed structures of zzso zzso and investigate the zzso activities of zzso fusion zzso We review here the leukemia cell lines that have been described to carry zzso zzso and zzso fusion zzso Except for the zzso each of the following relatively frequent zzso zzso is represented by one or more cell zzso 16 cell lines with zzso two cell lines with zzso seven cell lines with zzso and eight cell lines with zzso For each of three rare zzso one cell line has been reported: zzso zzso and zzso Of these 36 cell lines with zzso zzso 17 have been made available to us; we confirmed the occurrence of the zzso reported in these cell lines at the zzso and/or gene zzso A second type of zzso gene zzso is the partial tandem zzso zzso which occurs in acute zzso leukemia zzso We found four zzso cell lines with an zzso zzso one acute zzso zzso cell line was reported to show a partial zzso zzso Finally, a third zzso involves zzso amplification of the zzso zzso gene leading to multiple copies of the gene and zzso increased zzso Three cell lines carrying such zzso zzso have been zzso The availability of these cell lines as model systems provides the opportunity to explore the altered expression or functions of zzso genes and their partners in zzso
