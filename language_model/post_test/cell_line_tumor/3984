Emerging zzso suggest that chronic inflammation is one of the major causes of zzso The role of inflammation in regulation of breast cancer progression is not well zzso Recently zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein has been identified that regulates zzso and zzso zzso Role of zzso in the context of inflammation and cancer progression has not been zzso In the current report, we studied the role of zzso in the regulation of cross talk between cell death and inflammation in breast cancer zzso The expression of zzso was significantly lower on in zzso zzso zzso positive breast cancer cells than zzso negative zzso Similarly, it was significantly down regulated in tumor tissue as compared to the normal zzso The zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso decreases the cell proliferation and increases the cell death by zzso of zzso zzso positively regulates zzso zzso factor, which is essential for zzso induced cell zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso production which further zzso zzso induced cell death by zzso of death zzso zzso through zzso zzso expression decreases the colony forming units and migration ability of zzso zzso Thus, our finding suggests that zzso acts as a tumor zzso which is down regulated during zzso providing survival advantage to tumor zzso
