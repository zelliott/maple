To examine the usefulness of zzso zzso in the treatment of zzso the effect of zzso on the growth of zzso zzso cells was zzso Daily zzso zzso injection of mouse zzso zzso (2 zzso suppressed the growth of zzso zzso cells transplanted zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso This zzso suppression was not affected by simultaneous treatment with zzso zzso serum, which zzso natural killer zzso zzso However, zzso failed to suppress the growth of zzso zzso cells transplanted into zzso mice devoid of T zzso or zzso mice deficient in functional zzso zzso zzso zzso also failed to suppress the growth of zzso zzso cells in zzso although expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso was detected by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso zzso showed zzso against zzso zzso cells in a zzso manner in zzso In addition, treatment of zzso mice with zzso enhanced the zzso activity of zzso T zzso against zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso the growth of zzso zzso cells in zzso by enhancing the zzso activity of zzso T zzso through the zzso zzso
