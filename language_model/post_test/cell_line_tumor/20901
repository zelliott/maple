The natural product zzso has been reported to have zzso activity in zzso cell lines, but the exact mechanism is zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been shown to participate in the zzso of various zzso compounds derived from the diet as well as zzso zzso zzso and zzso have also been proposed as targets for cancer chemotherapy for their differential and selective zzso in zzso zzso In this study, we aimed to identify a possible mechanism of action for the zzso effect of zzso which can be attributed to zzso zzso zzso 

The study focuses on the zzso action of zzso on the human breast zzso cell line zzso and on a cell line derived from normal zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso its effect on the cell cycle of the zzso cell lines, and its metabolism by zzso family zzso were zzso 

zzso showed a zzso zzso effect of cell growth on zzso cells with a zzso median zzso concentration zzso whereas the zzso of this compound in zzso cells was considerably zzso The zzso effect, as measured by zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso was attributed mainly to zzso expression in zzso cells but not in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso family zzso were shown to zzso zzso in zzso to the zzso zzso and two other unidentified zzso zzso of zzso was also detected in zzso cell cultures, whereas metabolism by zzso cells was zzso zzso was further shown to arrest the cell cycle of the zzso cell line zzso in zzso phase, whereas no effect was observed in zzso cells, which do not express zzso zzso The effect of zzso on the zzso cell cycle could be reversed by zzso of the zzso inhibitor zzso 

The zzso zzso is selectively activated in breast cancer cells, but not in normal breast cells, due to zzso family zzso This provides a basis for selectivity which is desired against breast zzso zzso In this sense, zzso is shown by this study to be a very promising zzso candidate that should be examined further in an in zzso zzso
