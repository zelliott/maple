zzso zzso and zzso zzso are two zzso used in African traditional zzso In the present study, their extracts were evaluated for their steroid activities in zzso or zzso cell lines using as zzso zzso zzso activity and cell zzso Treatment of human breast cancer zzso cells with 15 or 30 zzso of zzso zzso or zzso extracts in the absence of zzso zzso significantly increased the zzso activity of an zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso in the same range as zzso Similar data were obtained in zzso cell line zzso All the effects were prevented by the pure zzso zzso zzso zzso In the absence of steroid addition, the two extracts induced cell proliferation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell lines by approximately zzso of the zzso zzso Combination treatments with zzso showed no competitive or additive effects in the two latter cell zzso Interestingly, the extracts had no zzso response in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells, suggesting that zzso effects are zzso specific and extracts are not toxic at used zzso zzso provided evidence that zzso zzso or zzso extracts induce zzso effects in zzso cell lines, which could be responsible of the effects observed in zzso
