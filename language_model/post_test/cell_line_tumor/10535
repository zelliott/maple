We have evaluated and provided evidence that the zzso zzso 3 gene zzso which encodes a large protein that forms a calcium channel, is important for the growth, zzso and migration of breast cancer zzso A putative binding site for zzso zzso exists in the zzso of zzso and a genetic zzso zzso zzso is present in this binding zzso We confirmed that zzso regulates the expression of a reporter gene driven by the zzso zzso and that the regulation was affected by the zzso zzso A zzso model based on base pairing and the secondary structure of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed that zzso had a higher binding affinity for the A zzso than for the G zzso The zzso zzso was zzso in zzso breast cancer cases and zzso healthy Chinese zzso The results showed that compared with the AA zzso G was a risk zzso for breast cancer development and was also associated with breast cancer zzso and poor zzso Thus, zzso is a unique zzso that resides in a zzso regulatory loop that affects breast cancer risk, zzso and zzso
