The purpose of this study was to explore the characteristics and functions of zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso therapy and drug resistance of chronic zzso leukemia zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were evaluated by real-time quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction, and correlations between their expression levels and zzso zzso markers were zzso zzso zzso samples were treated in zzso with zzso to investigate the role of zzso zzso and zzso in the response to zzso drugs which act through zzso of the zzso zzso We found that a low expression level of zzso was associated with some markers of poor zzso However, the level of zzso or zzso was not different in patients with zzso with zzso clinical features and zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso after zzso treatment in primary zzso cells, but there was no significant difference for zzso and zzso zzso of zzso occurred only in zzso cells with functional zzso zzso cells with zzso abnormalities were deficient in the zzso of zzso by zzso These results suggest that a lack of zzso induction may contribute to the development of resistance to zzso agents in zzso
