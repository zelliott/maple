zzso zzso regulates a wide range of neural functions, many of which require zzso of zzso zzso alpha zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, very few neural gene targets of zzso have been identified, and these cannot easily explain the myriad effects of zzso zzso regulates most of the same neural functions as zzso and zzso zzso throughout the brain contain zzso zzso we examined whether zzso directly regulates expression of zzso acid zzso 2 zzso the zzso primarily responsible for zzso synthesis for synaptic zzso Using dual zzso zzso we found that zzso but not other zzso steroids, zzso the activity of a zzso zzso rat zzso promoter reporter zzso zzso required either zzso or zzso and zzso did not repress zzso zzso zzso zzso studies identified three zzso response elements zzso with zzso zzso An zzso at zzso upstream of the zzso zzso start site was essential for zzso in both zzso breast cancer cells and zzso neural cells, but an zzso at zzso enhanced zzso only in neural zzso A third zzso at zzso was inactive in neural cells but exerted potent zzso repression in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in mouse zzso zzso cells confirmed that zzso induced zzso binding to a DNA zzso containing sequences corresponding to the zzso and zzso zzso of the rat zzso Based on these data, we propose that direct zzso regulation of zzso may explain, at least in part, the ability of zzso to impact such a diverse array of neural zzso
