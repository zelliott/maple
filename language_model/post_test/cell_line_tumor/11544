The mechanisms by which zzso nuclear factor zzso factor 2 zzso and zzso zzso protein 1 zzso signaling promote cellular proliferation and zzso are poorly zzso Using an integrated zzso and zzso targeted zzso fate association zzso study, we found that zzso regulates zzso and zzso to direct carbon flux toward the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso acid zzso cycle, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling in cancer cells attenuated zzso and zzso zzso leading to enhanced expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso decreased the expression of zzso genes and dramatically impaired zzso production, zzso zzso and in zzso tumor growth in zzso Loss of zzso decreased the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in increased expression of zzso and zzso and not only zzso zzso expression and activity but functioning as a regulatory feedback loop that zzso zzso zzso In primary tumor samples, the expression of zzso and zzso was zzso correlated with zzso gene zzso and increased expression of zzso genes was associated with poor zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso regulation of the zzso via zzso and zzso represents a novel link between zzso regulation, zzso zzso and zzso zzso in cancer zzso
