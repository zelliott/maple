A simple method to zzso circular zzso in zzso zzso is zzso A coating of liquid zzso is applied on the walls of zzso zzso zzso using standard zzso by introducing a zzso air stream inside the zzso filled zzso Surface tension of the liquid zzso forces the coating to take a circular zzso which is preserved by baking the device to cure the coated zzso zzso ranging from a few zzso to a few hundreds of zzso were zzso The method was verified to work on zzso networks as well as in straight zzso Different coating conditions were systematically zzso Design zzso are reported for one to choose appropriate coating conditions for obtaining a desired zzso A comparison between the performance of square and circular zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso cancer cell line) is zzso
