zzso zzso zzso zzso is an inhibitor of zzso zzso which has zzso zzso However, little is known about the zzso effect of zzso on cancer zzso We investigated the zzso effects of zzso on zzso lung cancer cells in relation to zzso oxygen species zzso and zzso zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso zzso inhibited the growth of zzso cells with an zzso of approximately 20 zzso at 72 zzso DNA flow zzso analysis indicated that zzso significantly induced the zzso phase arrest of the cell cycle in zzso zzso This agent also induced zzso cell death, as demonstrated by zzso zzso zzso cells and the loss of zzso membrane potential zzso zzso In addition, the administration of zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso cell zzso All the tested zzso zzso especially zzso significantly prevented zzso induced by zzso With respect to zzso and zzso levels, zzso increased zzso levels including zzso in zzso cells and induced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso markedly reduced zzso levels in zzso zzso zzso zzso also prevented zzso cell death and zzso depletion induced by zzso This is the first report to show that zzso zzso the growth of zzso cells via zzso phase arrest, and zzso and zzso zzso
