A zzso method for detecting the attachment of human cancer cells to a zzso surface for rapid screening for biological activity is zzso in which attachment of a cell results in highly localized increase of the resonant reflected wavelength of a zzso crystal zzso zzso filter incorporated into a standard zzso zzso An imaging detection instrument is used to determine the spatial distribution of attached cells by mapping the shift in reflected resonant wavelength as a function of zzso The method enables monitoring of cancer cell attachment, cell zzso and cell detachment that is induced by exposure of the cells to drug zzso We demonstrate the efficacy of this method as an early screening technique for the rapid zzso of the rate of cancer cell proliferation on the sensor surface, and subsequently as a means for zzso cell detachment resulting from zzso that is induced by exposure of the cells to zzso zzso
