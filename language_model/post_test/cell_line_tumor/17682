This study was conducted to determine whether zzso cells zzso zzso with a tumor cell zzso can effectively zzso against tumor cells and to establish which zzso are zzso 

Each zzso mouse received two subcutaneous zzso zzso 14 and 7) with either zzso tumor zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso mice were also used in zzso A tumor challenge was given at day zzso zzso were zzso for zzso zzso 

All zzso mice zzso zzso zzso and all mice injected with tumor zzso zzso zzso 9) developed zzso Six of nine mice zzso with zzso alone and zzso mice treated with zzso zzso developed a zzso zzso from both the zzso and zzso groups produced zzso levels of zzso while those from mice zzso with either zzso or zzso zzso produced high levels of zzso Four of five zzso zzso mice developed tumors after zzso with zzso zzso None of four zzso zzso mice developed a tumor after zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice developed tumor after zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso Three of four zzso zzso mice developed tumors after zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso can initiate an effective zzso immune zzso The presence of zzso in the host is essential for zzso zzso In contrast, tumor protection is observed if zzso is present in either the host or the zzso
