zzso zzso is a highly zzso zzso zzso arising with multiple zzso of the zzso zzso cannabinoids have been shown to inhibit proliferation of a wide spectrum of tumor zzso We studied the effects of cannabinoids on human zzso zzso cell proliferation in zzso To do so, we first investigated the presence of the zzso receptors zzso and zzso zzso in the human zzso zzso cell line zzso by zzso and, zzso the effects of the mixed zzso zzso zzso zzso on cell proliferation in zzso zzso showed zzso effects on zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso suggested that zzso treatment induced zzso of both zzso and zzso as well as increased zzso of the stress zzso zzso and zzso along with transient zzso of zzso To better characterize the involvement of each single CB zzso in zzso cell death, we incubated zzso zzso cells with different selective zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso and zzso zzso None of the zzso was able to induce zzso cell zzso Moreover, we zzso zzso zzso cells with zzso and either the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso or a combination of both zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to significantly increase survival of zzso zzso cells treated with zzso In view of the zzso effects of cannabinoids on zzso cells, one could envision the zzso system as a potential target for pharmacological treatment of zzso zzso
