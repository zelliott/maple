A number of studies performed in our laboratory and elsewhere, showed that zzso is able to prevent zzso and to impair tumor growth and zzso In order to provide additional information on the zzso effects of zzso on zzso cells, the present study was performed to test the in zzso influence of the compound on the growth and zzso of zzso and zzso human colon cancer cell zzso The results confirmed that zzso has a zzso dose dependent, zzso effect on cell proliferation in both zzso In addition, for the first time, relatively high zzso of this compound were found to be able to substantially zzso zzso zzso These preliminary results further support the potential role of zzso in zzso of human colon tumor cells and provide the rational basis for novel strategies in cancer zzso
