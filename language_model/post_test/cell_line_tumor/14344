zzso zzso of zzso zzso originating within the 236 zzso upstream region of the zzso gene were identified in human primary zzso and zzso zzso One zzso type of upstream zzso zzso which originated in the zzso zzso region zzso to the zzso zzso was present in human primary zzso whereas 11 other zzso were identified in zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso region possessed promoter activity and a prominent zzso I hypersensitive site was formed in the region approximately 2 zzso zzso to the zzso zzso promoter in human fetal liver, but not in zzso zzso The promoter activity in the zzso zzso region resided in a zzso in zzso zzso A zzso I hypersensitive site was formed at the zzso zzso promoter in zzso cells, but not in human fetal zzso We discussed these results in the context of zzso zzso and zzso opening in the zzso gene zzso
