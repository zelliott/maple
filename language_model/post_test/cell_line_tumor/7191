In order to identify tumor zzso genes silenced by zzso zzso in prostate zzso zzso we determined zzso expression changes after pharmacological reversal of zzso zzso zzso repression in three zzso cell lines using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene was detected in the cell line zzso zzso encodes a zzso inhibitor of cell cycle zzso zzso zzso was used to isolate different cell types present in diseased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed zzso zzso of zzso in all 41 primary zzso samples zzso which was accompanied by a decrease or loss of zzso protein zzso In contrast, normal prostate zzso and benign prostate zzso cells showed high levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also displayed decreased levels of zzso expression in zzso cells, which are known to contain shortened zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso compromised a DNA zzso zzso arrest in the zzso cell line zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso expression in zzso suggests that it significantly contributes to the formation of zzso potentially by allowing the escape from a DNA zzso arrest zzso by zzso zzso
