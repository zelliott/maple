Many tumors develop intrinsic and/or acquired resistance to zzso The purpose of the present study was to examine the influence of acute zzso folate depletion prior to zzso treatment on the development of intrinsic zzso zzso Lung and zzso cancer cells were zzso in medium acutely depleted of folate and subsequently treated with zzso The zzso level for zzso cell zzso cell zzso and global DNA zzso were zzso Gene expression profiling was performed using the zzso Cancer zzso zzso Acute zzso folate depletion resulted in the development of intrinsic zzso zzso zzso zzso in medium acutely depleted of folate had a survival advantage compared to control cells when exposed to zzso and zzso supplementation did not reverse the intrinsic zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed some novel genes associated with the development of intrinsic zzso zzso Our report is the first to demonstrate that acute zzso folate depletion results in intrinsic zzso zzso If these results are confirmed by in zzso human studies, it would suggest that the folate status of the recipient of zzso might have an impact on response to that zzso zzso
