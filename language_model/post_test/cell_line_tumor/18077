To investigate the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso on the zzso zzso of gastric zzso 

Human gastric cancer cells of the lie zzso and zzso cells of the line zzso were zzso zzso was used to detect the expression of zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso The proliferation of zzso cells was detected by zzso zzso In zzso cell zzso zzso zzso cells were cultured with zzso zzso zzso cells in zzso plate and then divided into 3 groups: zzso group, added with zzso zzso blocking group, in which the zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso zzso for 2 h and then zzso was added, and control group added with only culture zzso zzso was used to calculate the number of gastric cancer cells zzso with zzso zzso In the zzso cell migration test zzso cells were put in the upper chamber of a zzso chamber so as to cover the zzso zzso This zzso chamber was put into a culture plate, zzso cells, divided into 3 groups as mentioned above were put into the upper chamber, 24 h later HE zzso and zzso were performed to calculate the number of the zzso cells that penetrated the zzso zzso zzso female nude mice underwent zzso injection of zzso cells, and then with PBS or zzso small molecular specific zzso one day after the cancer cell injection once a day for 2 zzso Then the mice were killed to observe the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was highly expressed in the zzso cells but only very weekly expressed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was seen in the zzso cells but in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso cells significantly zzso zzso zzso In zzso cell zzso test, the number of the zzso cells zzso with zzso cells after zzso stimulation was zzso zzso zzso significantly higher than that of the control group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The number of zzso zzso cells in the zzso group was zzso zzso zzso significantly higher than hat of the control group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and the number of zzso zzso cells in the zzso blocking group was zzso zzso zzso significantly lower than that of the zzso group zzso zzso zzso The survival time of the mice injected with both zzso cells and zzso was zzso zzso zzso days, significantly longer than that of the control group zzso zzso zzso days, P zzso zzso The tumor number of the zzso group was zzso zzso zzso significantly lower than that of the control group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso and its zzso zzso play an important role in the development of zzso zzso from gastric zzso zzso with the zzso biological axis may become a potential strategy in the prevention and treatment of zzso zzso from gastric zzso
