The initiation of zzso zzso zzso stress has been suggested to play potential roles in zzso However, many obstacles remain as to whether zzso stress plays a role in zzso or zzso This study sought to identify the signals that can serve as zzso zzso in cells in response to zzso zzso zzso (an zzso zzso inhibited cell proliferation with zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells, zzso It induced zzso arrest of the cell cycle in both cell zzso The zzso mechanism of zzso was investigated in zzso zzso zzso induced a rapid decline of zzso D1 and zzso A expression and an early increase of zzso protein zzso 78 and growth arrest and DNA zzso zzso factor zzso 153 zzso zzso A was the most sensitive regulator to zzso degradation zzso The association of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 was also increased by zzso The zzso of zzso expression by zzso of zzso zzso did not modify zzso zzso arrest and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso expression by the zzso zzso technique moderately increased zzso zzso but not the zzso effect by zzso B zzso We suggest that zzso zzso zzso arrest through zzso of zzso and zzso in which zzso A is more susceptible to zzso zzso degradation mechanism in zzso zzso The increased association of zzso with zzso zzso may also contribute to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso play a minor role in zzso zzso effect, although zzso moderately zzso zzso in zzso zzso These data provide evidence that zzso regulators are susceptible factors in zzso zzso zzso responsive to zzso zzso
