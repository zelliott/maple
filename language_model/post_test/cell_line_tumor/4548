We have found that zzso zzso has a functional cryptic site opposing cell zzso to zzso zzso zzso a synthetic zzso zzso derived from the 14th zzso type zzso zzso zzso termed zzso zzso zzso cell zzso to the zzso without binding to zzso zzso This zzso activity of zzso zzso depends on its zzso zzso acid sequence zzso A zzso membrane protein zzso has been detected as a specific binding protein of zzso zzso Here we showed that zzso activity of zzso zzso was zzso upon the presence of zzso on cell zzso Furthermore, we found that there exists a zzso analogous to the zzso in the 10th zzso repeat of the zzso zzso and that a zzso zzso containing this analogous zzso termed zzso zzso inhibited cell zzso to the zzso zzso zzso appeared to share zzso with zzso zzso in expressing the zzso zzso As a zzso consequence of decreased zzso peptides zzso and zzso accelerated the zzso zzso of normal zzso by zzso zzso expression through blocking the zzso signaling zzso Thus, the zzso sequences of the zzso zzso may be involved in cell regulation by modulating zzso cell zzso to the zzso in which zzso probably serves as a membrane zzso
