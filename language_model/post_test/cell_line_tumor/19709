zzso membrane zzso zzso is highly expressed by both normal and zzso prostate zzso cells and by the zzso of many tumor zzso however, it is not expressed by normal zzso cells or other normal zzso zzso therefore, represents an attractive candidate for selectively targeted therapies for prostate and/or other solid zzso As an alternative approach to zzso zzso therapies, small peptides that bind selectively to zzso cells can be used to deliver zzso drugs, protein zzso and viruses selectively to zzso sites while minimizing systemic toxicity to normal zzso Small peptides are relatively inexpensive to produce, not zzso and easily coupled to zzso zzso In the present study, a random zzso library consisting of linear 12 zzso acid peptides was used to identify peptides that bound selectively to zzso From a series of zzso zzso one with the sequence zzso was used to show binding of soluble zzso to zzso A zzso version of this zzso showed markedly enhanced binding to soluble zzso and an zzso of zzso zzso for zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso labeled zzso zzso bound selectively to zzso prostate cancer cells in zzso with no significant binding to zzso zzso zzso modeling of the zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso in close vicinity can efficiently coordinate a zzso zzso and hold the zzso in a favorable zzso for binding and subsequent zzso These zzso zzso therefore, represent putative zzso targeting agents that are currently being evaluated for selective binding in zzso
