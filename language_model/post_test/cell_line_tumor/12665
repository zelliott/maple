zzso zzso has been found to be zzso in a variety of human zzso including zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated zzso expression status in a large cohort of zzso tumors with the focus on biological influence of zzso related on zzso tumor zzso and zzso 

zzso expression was determined by zzso zzso zzso northern zzso and zzso zzso tissue array zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cancer cells zzso and zzso were achieved through zzso zzso and confirmed by zzso western zzso and zzso The effects of zzso zzso expression on tumor zzso and zzso growth were zzso in zzso mouse zzso The in zzso cell zzso migration and invasion zzso were performed to investigate the potential mechanisms involved in zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso was frequently zzso in zzso zzso Higher zzso levels significantly correlated with clinical late stages zzso and cancer zzso zzso was produced by engineered zzso cells at levels comparable to that of zzso cells, an zzso zzso cell line with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not change cell growth rates in zzso however it significantly promoted zzso tumor zzso growth in zzso mice, which was associated with increased tumor zzso and decreased tumor cell zzso In zzso zzso zzso promoted cell zzso migration, and invasion of both human zzso zzso cells zzso and/or zzso cancer zzso 

Our data indicate zzso plays a critical role in both zzso tumor zzso and zzso Thus zzso may represent a clinically effective new target for therapy of zzso zzso
