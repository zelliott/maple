zzso suppresses zzso as well as in zzso cell zzso invasion and zzso independent growth, in a variety of cancer zzso Eight human zzso of zzso have been identified that share zzso identity with the zzso zzso Here, we examine the potential of its zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to inhibit in zzso zzso of zzso in two highly zzso human cell lines, zzso and zzso The zzso cells were zzso with zzso expression zzso containing the genes zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso chamber zzso and soft zzso colonization zzso zzso suppressed zzso by zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso cells, respectively and inhibited zzso independent growth in soft zzso by zzso and zzso zzso None of the zzso zzso were capable of suppressing zzso in zzso cells, but in zzso cells, zzso inhibited zzso by zzso upon zzso When zzso independent growth was zzso zzso zzso and zzso suppressed growth from zzso to zzso in both cell zzso Given their ability to suppress zzso independent growth, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso may have some capacity to suppress zzso zzso suppression appears to be cell context dependent, but sequence disparities between zzso and the other family members may reveal regions critical for this zzso zzso Similarly, sequence differences between zzso and its zzso may be important for zzso independent growth zzso
