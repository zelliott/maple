The effect of zzso on the zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso cholesterol zzso zzso and zzso X zzso zzso in zzso cells was examined to establish whether zzso affects zzso acid synthesis and if so, to determine a possible molecular zzso 

zzso cells were cultured in zzso zzso modified Eagle medium for 18 h before drug zzso Total zzso was extracted at set times and zzso levels were zzso by reverse zzso time zzso chain zzso zzso at zzso 1, 5, and 10 zzso increased the zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso similarly increased with increasing doses of zzso zzso of zzso (4 zzso with zzso (5 zzso reversed the zzso effects of zzso on the zzso levels of these zzso indicating that the zzso effects of zzso were related to its zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso increased the zzso levels of zzso in zzso cells, suggesting that increased conversion of cholesterol to zzso acids may be the mechanism for its potent zzso zzso cholesterol-lowering zzso
