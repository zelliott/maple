The zzso protein zzso is a tumor zzso and key regulator of the cell zzso We have previously shown that zzso interacts with zzso zzso zzso zzso that can regulate zzso zzso levels in the zzso Here, we investigated zzso binding to another zzso zzso in the zzso cycle, zzso zzso zzso that zzso the second zzso zzso to yield zzso zzso We found that zzso but not zzso or zzso interacts with zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso to zzso is dependent on the zzso status of zzso since only zzso zzso interacts with zzso zzso also binds to the zzso pocket proteins zzso and zzso in zzso and in zzso Although zzso did not affect the ability of zzso to regulate zzso transcription, we found that zzso zzso and zzso zzso stimulate zzso activity in zzso Finally, zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso a cell cycle arrest induced by zzso These results suggest that zzso may act in zzso as a downstream zzso of zzso to regulate nuclear levels of zzso and zzso zzso
