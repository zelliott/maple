zzso control analysis of tumor zzso has indicated that zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso exert the main flux control zzso To understand why they are the main controlling steps, the zzso and zzso zzso and the contents of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were analyzed in rat zzso zzso and zzso human zzso zzso An improved protocol to determine the kinetic parameters of zzso was developed with zzso as zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed two components at low- and zzso zzso in both tumor zzso At low zzso and 37 degrees C, the zzso was 55 zzso 20 and zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 3 zzso for zzso and zzso cells, zzso zzso activity was partially inhibited by zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso At zzso zzso zzso and zzso were the zzso active zzso in zzso cells and zzso cells, zzso zzso activity in zzso cells was much lower zzso zzso zzso than that in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso but both zzso were strongly inhibited by zzso zzso was the zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The much lower zzso zzso and zzso efficiency zzso values in comparison to those of zzso zzso suggested the zzso exerts higher control on the zzso flux than zzso in cancer zzso Thus, zzso seems a more adequate therapeutic zzso
