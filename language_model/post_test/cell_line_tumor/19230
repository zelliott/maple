The role of the zzso zzso transition zzso in zzso and necrosis is zzso Here we show that the zzso regulates the release of zzso c for zzso during zzso zzso zzso stress by zzso the zzso junction zzso zzso cells, zzso colon cancer cells, and zzso zzso zzso cells were treated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso which led to zzso zzso zzso release of the profusion zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso which controls zzso integrity, and zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso blocked zzso and zzso c release after zzso treatment but did not prevent the zzso showing that zzso was essential for the release of zzso c by zzso In isolated zzso zzso led to zzso and zzso c release independently of zzso zzso channel and the outer zzso indicating that the zzso is an inner membrane zzso zzso the zzso was regulated by the electron transport chain but not zzso zzso oxygen species, since zzso cell death was not blocked by antioxidants and did not occur in cells lacking zzso zzso Our results show that the zzso regulates zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso stress and that zzso electron transport is indispensable for this zzso
