zzso zzso dual sensors for simultaneous determination of free and total prostate specific zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso (AP) and a mixture solution of zzso zzso and silver zzso were used as the zzso label and zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso specific for free and total zzso respectively, were immobilized on different zzso zzso zzso carbon electrodes, zzso gold zzso and zzso carbon zzso modified with zzso order to be able to select one of the surfaces as the most adequate one to develop the dual zzso zzso carbon zzso modified with zzso were the zzso with the best zzso characteristics and lead to the most zzso zzso so they were selected for the development of the dual zzso On zzso electrodes, zzso zzso was immobilized on one working zzso and zzso zzso was immobilized on the other one by deposition of a drop of solution of each zzso and left overnight at 4 degrees zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used as detection zzso giving rise, to our knowledge, to the first simultaneous zzso zzso for free and total zzso The zzso dual sensor was used to monitor zzso production from three different cultures of human zzso prostate tumor zzso
