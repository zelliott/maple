zzso is an zzso filter zzso zzso zzso zzso consisting of zzso and zzso zzso We tested the suitability of this zzso to provide sustained zzso zzso delivery for cancer zzso zzso is liquid at or below room temperature, and is easily zzso through narrow gauge needles, but zzso a zzso zzso transition into a zzso depot at body zzso We demonstrated that zzso releases zzso over 72 to 96 hours in zzso without loss of zzso zzso studies after zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso in mice demonstrated an early burst of zzso release, followed by more sustained release zzso over 96 hours zzso 48 zzso Less than zzso of the injected dose was zzso in blood or zzso during the first 48 zzso A single zzso dose of zzso zzso to 4 million international units zzso zzso split into 4 zzso zzso was administered to mice bearing subcutaneous zzso zzso cell zzso Only the highest dose of zzso tested zzso zzso resulted in significant zzso on day 3 after zzso Weekly treatment of zzso A zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso (2 zzso induced a significant reduction in tumor growth and improved zzso Reduction in tumor growth at implants remote from treated zzso was also observed, suggesting systemic zzso of zzso zzso These findings establish that zzso injection of zzso is an effective delivery system for cancer zzso while decreasing zzso zzso This zzso delivery system is likely to be broadly zzso for sustained delivery of other zzso and zzso
