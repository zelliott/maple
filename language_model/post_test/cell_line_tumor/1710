zzso zzso zzso proteins restrict the entry processes of several zzso zzso including the zzso West Nile virus and dengue virus zzso zzso zzso cells directly or via zzso enhancement zzso in zzso cells, a process thought to contribute to severe disease in a secondary zzso Here we investigated whether zzso zzso infection zzso zzso restriction or whether zzso proteins can be protective in a secondary zzso We observed that zzso proteins restricted zzso and direct infection with comparable efficiencies in a zzso leukemia cell zzso Our data suggest that zzso proteins can contribute to control of secondary zzso zzso
