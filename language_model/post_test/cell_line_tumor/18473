Cellular zzso is a zzso process characterized by an irreversible cell cycle exit, a unique zzso and expression of zzso zzso zzso We report here a role for zzso in induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso in zzso zzso The increased activity of zzso further reduces zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso The repression of the activity of the zzso zzso by zzso is required for expression of the zzso zzso zzso regulation of zzso activity is necessary for zzso zzso accompanying zzso zzso in response to expression of zzso activated zzso or continuous zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso expression and blocks zzso zzso These results point to a unique, zzso role for zzso in regulation of zzso activity in zzso illuminating the mechanisms underlying induction of zzso and the zzso shape zzso
