A variety of zzso derivatives including three zzso zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso (4 and 5) and a zzso zzso zzso were evaluated for their zzso as well as tumor cells growth zzso activities in zzso The zzso derivatives 1, 2, 3 and 6 significantly and zzso inhibited the production of inflammatory zzso such as zzso oxide zzso and zzso zzso necrosis factor zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso activated zzso zzso zzso without displaying zzso The zzso mechanism is found through reducing zzso protein zzso In addition, the derivatives 1-3 significantly arrest zzso zzso cells in zzso stage, whereas compounds 4-6 blocked the same in the zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso derivatives 3 and 6 showed dramatically reduction in the ratio of zzso to zzso production from zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, the novel compounds exhibited interesting zzso activities against a panel of cell lines, particularly, 20 zzso of compound 3 showed 50% zzso effect on human zzso cell line, but has no effect on normal human peripheral blood zzso zzso In conclusion, compound 3 showed interesting zzso and tumor cells growth zzso zzso
