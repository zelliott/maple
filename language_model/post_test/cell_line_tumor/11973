Previous studies have demonstrated local functions for zzso in the developing and mature zzso of zzso To examine whether these signaling molecules are present and also potentially active in the human zzso we characterized zzso the expression and cellular zzso of the known zzso and their receptors during prenatal zzso development as well as in the adult human zzso zzso obtained revealed the presence of nerve growth factor zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso and 4, as well as zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso and zzso during zzso zzso These proteins were also zzso in the adult human zzso and their local expression could be confirmed largely by zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso cells were found to represent the zzso zzso expression sites within both fetal and adult human zzso zzso zzso performed with a mouse tumor zzso cell line revealed that zzso exposure increases cellular steroid production, indicating a role in differentiation zzso These findings support zzso zzso characteristics of zzso cells, provide additional evidence for potential roles of zzso during zzso zzso and in the mature zzso and demonstrate for the first time a zzso functional activity in zzso zzso
