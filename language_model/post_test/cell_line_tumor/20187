To investigate the changes of drug sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso tumor cells to zzso agents and its possible zzso 

zzso in a dose of 100 zzso was used to induce zzso in a breast cancer cell line zzso zzso The zzso cells zzso were sorted by flow zzso The zzso changes and proliferation of zzso cells were compared with that of zzso zzso The cell growth zzso was assessed by zzso zzso The cells were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Those cells were labeled with zzso zzso and analyzed by flow zzso zzso was knocked down in zzso cells using zzso and their growth zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso to evaluate the reversing effect of zzso on drug zzso 

The zzso zzso cells grew in zzso continuously and maintained constant DNA zzso They had a larger cell size, and grew more slowly than zzso zzso The zzso of zzso cells were significantly higher than that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (all P zzso zzso The zzso of zzso in zzso cells was zzso zzso zzso significantly lower than the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso and that of zzso cells after zzso down by zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly higher than the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso cells zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso of zzso cells after zzso down by zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly decreased and lower than that before zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our results indicate that zzso tumor cells induced by zzso poison zzso are more resistant to most of zzso zzso zzso of zzso increases the sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso The high expression of zzso may be one of the drug resistance mechanisms of zzso tumor zzso The zzso tumor cells are relatively sensitive to zzso suggesting that zzso might be an effective candidate drug for treatment of zzso zzso zzso
