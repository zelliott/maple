A simple and sensitive zzso method was developed to simultaneously determine zzso and its major zzso zzso in culture media and cell zzso zzso zzso was used as internal standard zzso zzso were zzso with zzso zzso zzso hydrogen zzso buffer containing 10 zzso sodium zzso with the pH adjusted to zzso using zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso by a zzso zzso zzso column zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with detection at zzso and zzso zzso of 380 and 540 zzso zzso The average extraction efficiencies were zzso for zzso in culture media and zzso for zzso in cell zzso and zzso for zzso in culture media and zzso for zzso in cell zzso zzso and zzso precision and accuracy varied from zzso to zzso The limit of zzso zzso and accuracy zzso was zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso and zzso zzso for zzso in culture media and cell zzso zzso This method was successfully applied to zzso the cellular zzso and metabolism of zzso and zzso in zzso a rat zzso cell zzso
