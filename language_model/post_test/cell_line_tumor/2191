The revival of interest in cancer cell metabolism in recent years has prompted the need for quantitative zzso platforms for studying zzso from in zzso zzso We implemented a quantitative polar zzso profiling platform using selected reaction monitoring with a zzso zzso hybrid triple zzso mass zzso that covers all major zzso zzso The platform uses zzso interaction liquid zzso with zzso zzso switching to analyze 258 zzso zzso zzso zzso from a single zzso liquid zzso zzso acquisition with a zzso dwell time and a zzso duty cycle zzso Previous platforms use more than one experiment to profile this number of zzso from different zzso zzso The platform is compatible with polar zzso from any biological source, including fresh zzso cancer cells, bodily zzso and zzso zzso tumor zzso Relative zzso can be achieved without using internal standards, and integrated peak areas based on total zzso current can be used for statistical analyses and zzso analyses across biological sample zzso The procedure takes zzso h from zzso extraction to peak integration for a data set containing 15 total samples zzso h for a single zzso
