The role of zzso in tumor growth and zzso is well zzso Identification of a small zzso that blocks tumor zzso and is safe and affordable has been a challenge in drug zzso In this study, we showed that zzso acid zzso an active component from an Ayurvedic medicinal plant zzso zzso could strongly inhibit tumor zzso zzso suppressed tumor growth in the human prostate tumor zzso mice treated daily (10 zzso zzso after solid tumors reached approximately 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso on tumor growth was well correlated with suppression of zzso When examined for the molecular zzso we found that zzso significantly inhibited blood vessel formation in the zzso plug zzso in mice and effectively suppressed vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso in rat zzso ring zzso ex zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibited zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and the formation of zzso structures from primary cultured human zzso vascular zzso cells in a zzso zzso Western zzso analysis and in zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso suppressed zzso zzso of zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso with zzso of zzso zzso Specifically, zzso suppressed the downstream protein zzso of zzso including zzso family zzso focal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso target of zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso human prostate tumor growth through zzso of zzso induced by zzso signaling zzso
