zzso acid zzso a zzso of marine zzso has been found to enhance the activity of several zzso drugs through an zzso zzso To examine the relation between zzso by zzso and tumor cells zzso status, we used two breast cancer cell zzso zzso in which zzso increases sensitivity to zzso and zzso which does not respond to zzso Under these conditions, zzso oxygen species zzso level increased on zzso treatment only in zzso This was zzso with a decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, a crucial zzso for protection against hydrogen and zzso zzso while major zzso zzso activities increased in both cell lines in response to zzso zzso activity was accompanied by an zzso of zzso the zzso zzso and resulted from a decreased amount of zzso zzso In rat zzso tumors, when a zzso dietary supplementation led to an increased tumor sensitivity to zzso zzso activity was similarly zzso Furthermore, vitamin E abolished both zzso effects on chemotherapy efficacy enhancement and on zzso zzso Thus, loss of zzso response to an zzso stress in transformed cells may account for the ability of zzso targets such as zzso to enhance tumor sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso
