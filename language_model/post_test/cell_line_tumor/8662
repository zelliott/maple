zzso cell zzso zzso remains incurable due to its inevitable pattern of zzso after treatment with current existing zzso However, the promise of a cure for zzso lies in the burgeoning area of novel zzso In this study, we zzso the therapeutic effect and mechanism of zzso a novel zzso second-generation zzso zzso in zzso zzso We found that zzso induced growth zzso and zzso in both established zzso cell lines and freshly isolated primary zzso cells in a zzso zzso In contrast, zzso was less toxic to normal peripheral blood zzso cells from healthy zzso The zzso zzso of zzso cells was zzso by the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso inhibited the growth and survival signaling pathways zzso and zzso Interestingly, we discovered that expression of zzso zzso zzso is required for the zzso activity of zzso in zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice, intravenous administration of 5 zzso zzso on days 1 and 2 for 5 weeks zzso tumor growth and significantly prolonged zzso Our zzso data show that zzso is a promising, potentially less toxic treatment for zzso Furthermore, an intact zzso especially zzso appears to be necessary for its zzso activity, suggesting that zzso could serve as a zzso for identifying patients who will benefit from zzso
