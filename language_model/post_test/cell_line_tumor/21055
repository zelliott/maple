Recently, much attention has been paid to zzso peptides zzso as an zzso tool for presentation through the major zzso complex class I zzso zzso However, escape of zzso from the zzso is inefficient and therefore a bottleneck for zzso zzso Previously, we showed the importance of zzso control of zzso zzso peptides on the zzso surface for regulating cellular zzso as well as zzso trafficking, especially zzso zzso In this study, we hypothesized that efficient zzso presentation could be achieved by controlled zzso trafficking of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso was shown to be by zzso in zzso zzso However, zzso laser scanning zzso zzso revealed that zzso are able to release significantly more zzso to the zzso than are zzso zzso zzso of the zzso delivered by zzso was shown to be zzso which is consistent with selective zzso presentation by zzso via zzso According to zzso analysis, zzso can induce significantly higher zzso presentation at lower doses than either soluble zzso zzso or zzso in zzso or zzso zzso Moreover, zzso showed an efficient zzso effect in zzso zzso zzso is a promising new carrier for zzso zzso zzso
