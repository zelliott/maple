zzso virus zzso is present in zzso zzso zzso cells in a zzso form, showing a highly restricted pattern of gene expression with few tumor cells undergoing viral zzso zzso zzso cell lines can be induced to enter the viral zzso cycle and initiate replication by stimulating surface zzso zzso During this process many zzso genes are expressed that have the potential to influence host gene zzso We aimed to identify host genes that are regulated by zzso in zzso cells and those that are regulated following zzso of surface zzso 

The zzso expressed genes in zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso cells were detected by zzso 

A total of 91 human genes were zzso expressed between zzso and zzso cells and 198 were zzso expressed when cells were zzso to enter zzso zzso The differential expression of one zzso zzso was correlated with disrupted zzso zzso 

zzso zzso most of the genes regulated by surface zzso zzso in the early stages of zzso cycle zzso These include genes involved in cell survival, signal zzso zzso control and the immune response that may mediate zzso transformation of zzso and others such as zzso that may affect virus zzso
