Multiple effects usually occur in the cell cycle, during and after the exposure to a drug, while treated cells flowing through the cycle encounter zzso S and zzso zzso We developed a simulation tool connecting the microscopic level of the cellular response in zzso S and zzso with the experimental data of growth zzso and flow zzso We found that zzso not zzso of zzso and zzso effects can be in keeping with the zzso This zzso of interpretation can be strongly reduced by considering together data with different methods, zzso reaching a reconstruction of the underlying cell cycle zzso Here, we propose an experimental plan including a time course of DNA flow zzso and absolute cell count zzso with several drug zzso and a limited number of flow zzso zzso and zzso zzso coupled with computer zzso We showed its use in the attempt to define the complete time course of the effects of zzso on three cancer cell zzso After drug treatment, each subset of cells experienced blocks and zzso in all zzso of the cell cycle, but the dynamics was different, the differences being strongly zzso Our approach allows a better appreciation of the complexity of the cell cycle phenomena associated with drug zzso It is expected that such level of understanding of the zzso and zzso of the zzso and zzso effects of a drug might support rational therapeutic zzso
