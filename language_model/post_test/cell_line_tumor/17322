We have performed comparative zzso zzso on 12 zzso germ cell tumor zzso cell lines and one zzso surgical zzso to identify and characterize zzso gains and losses of zzso in these zzso All specimens demonstrated overrepresentation of zzso Other significant zzso gains, apart from zzso included the X zzso and zzso arms zzso and zzso zzso losses were observed for zzso 4 and 18 and zzso arms zzso zzso and zzso zzso differences were observed between an zzso zzso component of a mixed zzso zzso and its zzso zzso line, zzso including losses of zzso approximately zzso and zzso approximately zzso Five lines also demonstrated gain of zzso and additional zzso approximately zzso zzso Similarly, two lines demonstrated gain of zzso and additional zzso approximately zzso zzso The data supports the consistent gain of zzso in adult zzso cell lines and additional regional amplification of zzso in some zzso This regional amplification has been observed in both primary tumor specimens and zzso cell lines and may support a hypothesis that at least two different regions of zzso one zzso and one zzso harbor genes important for the zzso of zzso germ cell zzso
