zzso zzso and zzso zzso are sequence zzso that act as zzso proteins downstream of zzso or zzso zzso zzso Originally identified in chronic zzso leukemia cells as a highly zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso was suspected to play a role in zzso However, zzso zzso knockout cells were found to have enhanced zzso signaling and proliferation due to growth factors, suggesting negative regulatory capabilities for zzso The role of zzso and zzso in zzso thus is zzso The data in this report show that both the zzso and the zzso zzso proteins are zzso expressed in the zzso leukemia cell line, zzso and that expression of both proteins is induced by the zzso differentiation causing agents, zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso D3 zzso zzso expression of either protein enhances zzso or zzso growth arrest, zzso and zzso cell cycle arrest and results in increased zzso zzso zzso and zzso are similarly effective in these zzso The data provide evidence that zzso and zzso proteins have a similar role in regulating cell proliferation and differentiation and are positive regulators of the zzso signaling zzso in this zzso
