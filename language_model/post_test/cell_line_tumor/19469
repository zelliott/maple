zzso zzso and genetic evidence suggests that the formation of zzso zzso deposits in the brain is an important and, probably, seminal step in the development of Alzheimer's disease zzso Recent studies support the hypothesis that zzso soluble zzso are the zzso species that prompt the zzso zzso zzso zzso could, therefore, provide a novel approach to treating the underlying cause of zzso Here, we designed potential zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso acid sequences zzso from part of the binding region responsible for zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso added at their zzso and zzso ends to aid zzso Two such peptides zzso named zzso and zzso named zzso were effective zzso of zzso zzso formation, but only one of these peptides zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, this same zzso zzso was the only effective inhibitor of zzso toxicity toward human zzso zzso zzso Our data support the idea that zzso zzso are responsible for the zzso effects of zzso and identify a potential zzso inhibitor for further development as a novel therapy for zzso
