It is well documented that tumor zzso zzso zzso tumor cell invasion and zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso cell zzso and zzso protein in the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso Although several molecules have been identified as candidate zzso zzso targets, the zzso zzso zzso remains zzso Although zzso does not directly inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, we have shown evidence that zzso may block the zzso zzso zzso by cell zzso zzso In the current study, zzso significantly inhibited the zzso zzso detachment of zzso zzso This zzso effect was associated with increased and sustained levels of mature focal zzso contacts zzso We noted that zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso zzso related zzso and zzso induced rapid zzso of zzso and zzso The zzso effects on zzso zzso and zzso required the interaction between zzso and zzso Further zzso and zzso analyses revealed that zzso specifically bound to zzso with a deduced zzso of zzso zzso and inhibited the zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, substitution of zzso zzso site zzso in the zzso site loop zzso with zzso not only abolished the binding to zzso but also diminished the zzso effects on zzso zzso and cell zzso These data show an important role of zzso zzso in regulating the zzso cell zzso Together, our data led to a new hypothesis that zzso may stabilize mature zzso by zzso localized zzso complex before zzso zzso
