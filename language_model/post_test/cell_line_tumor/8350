We zzso three types of magnetic iron oxide zzso zzso which were zzso acid zzso coated zzso zzso zzso zzso negative zzso zzso zzso coated zzso zzso zzso zzso positive zzso and magnetic zzso zzso formed by electronic zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso positive zzso zzso The interactions of these zzso with zzso zzso Carcinoma Cell zzso were zzso The results showed that cellular zzso of zzso were on the dependence of incubation time, zzso concentration and zzso properties such as surface charge, size, zzso The cellular zzso was enhanced with the increase of incubation time and zzso zzso Although all zzso could enter to cells, we observed apparent differences in the magnitude of zzso zzso The cellular zzso of zzso by zzso cells was the highest and that of zzso was the lowest among the three types of zzso The same conclusions were drawn via the reduction of water zzso relaxation times zzso resulting from the different iron load of labeled cells using a zzso clinical MR zzso The finding of this study will have implications in the chemical design of zzso for biomedical zzso
