zzso neuroendocrine tumors zzso although rare, often zzso such that surgery, the only potentially zzso therapy, is not zzso There is no effective systemic therapy for patients with advanced zzso zzso new strategies are zzso Toward that end, we investigated the potential benefit of dual therapeutic targeting of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso target of zzso zzso zzso using a zzso mouse model of zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso respectively, were used to treat zzso transgenic mice bearing advanced zzso zzso zzso growth and survival were zzso and tumors were surveyed for potential zzso of response to the zzso 

zzso zzso was notably zzso zzso survival zzso with tumor stasis zzso zzso However, the tumors developed resistance, as evidenced by eventual zzso to progressive tumor zzso zzso zzso slowed tumor growth and zzso a marginal survival zzso In zzso there was an unprecedented survival benefit in the face of this aggressive zzso cancer and, in contrast to either zzso the development of zzso resistance was not zzso Additionally, the zzso protein zzso was implicated as a zzso of sensitivity and beneficial responses to the dual targeted zzso 

zzso trials in a mouse model of zzso zzso suggest that combined targeting of the zzso and zzso signaling pathways could have potential clinical benefit in treating zzso These results have encouraged development of an ongoing phase II clinical trial aimed to evaluate the efficacy of this treatment regimen in human neuroendocrine zzso
