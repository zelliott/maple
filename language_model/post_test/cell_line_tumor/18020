Nuclear zzso zzso is a family of zzso proteins that are important regulators involved in immune and inflammatory responses, as well as in cell survival and zzso In the nervous system zzso is activated under zzso and pathological conditions including learning and memory mechanisms and neurodegenerative zzso zzso is activated in zzso in response to zzso zzso and zzso stress and there is a body of evidence to suggest that zzso zzso zzso by the main zzso zzso zzso In the present study, 3 zzso acid zzso an irreversible inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso complex zzso has been employed to provide an experimental model of zzso disease zzso Specifically, we described zzso zzso of zzso and of zzso and zzso genes in zzso treated zzso To aim to better understand the relationship between these identified zzso genes and zzso dysfunction, we investigated in zzso human zzso cells following zzso treatment, whether zzso nuclear zzso and zzso might be involved in the mechanisms by which zzso leads to zzso zzso of zzso zzso These results are relevant to more precisely define the role of zzso in zzso cells and better understand its putative involvement in zzso
