We investigated the clinical significance of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso and basic zzso growth factor zzso during zzso in zzso lung zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso The high expression levels of molecules involved in the zzso signaling zzso were associated with a decreased survival zzso Of the total number of cases, zzso were positive for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso density zzso as determined by zzso zzso and zzso was higher in zzso samples with high zzso and zzso zzso and the patients with high zzso had poor survival zzso In addition, the expression of zzso correlated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso ( zzso zzso zzso and knocking down zzso both suppressed zzso zzso and reduced the expression of zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso cells, demonstrating that zzso zzso was associated with zzso and zzso expression in the two human lung zzso cell zzso zzso zzso may be a critical molecular target for powerful intervention in zzso zzso zzso
