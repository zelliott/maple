zzso zzso a highly abused zzso zzso has surged in popularity worldwide in the last zzso zzso MA exposure has been shown to affect the alternative zzso zzso expression of large zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It remains unclear whether MA affects BK channel zzso The present study investigated the effects of MA on BK channels in zzso mouse zzso zzso hybrid cells using zzso and zzso patch clamp zzso In zzso recordings, the zzso zzso outward currents were inhibited by MA with an zzso of zzso but not affected by zzso zzso It implies that zzso is not involved in the effects of MA on zzso outward zzso In zzso patches, MA significantly decreased BK channel zzso Moreover, MA significantly decreased the BK channel opener zzso zzso zzso outward currents and BK channel zzso Finally, the effect of MA on membrane potential was examined by zzso zzso MA caused membrane zzso and application of zzso returned the zzso potential to resting zzso These findings suggest that MA might act as an inhibitor of BK channels, and thereby increase the zzso zzso and enhance neurotransmitter zzso
