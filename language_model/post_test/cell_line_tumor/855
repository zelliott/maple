zzso of gene regulatory sequences using zzso zzso has advanced considerably but lacks experimental zzso Here, we report whether zzso factor binding sites predicted by dot plotting or zzso zzso analysis could be validated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enhances zzso without zzso and hence may contribute to altered tumor zzso Because the full spectrum of zzso genes directly regulated by zzso is not known, we chose zzso as a model zzso factor to determine whether it binds target zzso genes that have zzso zzso zzso binding sites or E boxes zzso zzso zzso E boxes in zzso zzso and zzso occur in zzso to zzso islands with high zzso sequence identity zzso zzso analysis revealed another region in zzso that zzso to a zzso region with a zzso E zzso zzso bound all these zzso regions well in the human zzso B zzso We also determined whether zzso could bind zzso zzso E boxes found in the remaining human zzso zzso zzso bound zzso but it did not significantly bind zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso was not zzso Both zzso and zzso do not have zzso E boxes but are induced and bound by zzso through regions with zzso E zzso Our results indicate that zzso binds well to zzso zzso E boxes, but not zzso E zzso However, the binding of zzso to zzso zzso regions with zzso E boxes reveals a limitation of zzso zzso In aggregate, these observations indicate that zzso is an important regulator of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso plays a key role in a switch to zzso metabolism during cell proliferation or zzso
