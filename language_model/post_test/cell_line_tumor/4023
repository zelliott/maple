zzso a zzso zzso zzso is frequently zzso with zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso is zzso by zzso to generate a soluble zzso fragment, termed zzso which is elevated in the urine or serum of cancer zzso In this study, we explored the functional role of zzso in the progression of skin zzso cell zzso zzso We found that full-length zzso expression was decreased and zzso increased in human clinical tumor samples as well as in ultraviolet zzso zzso in zzso Interestingly, zzso associated with members of the human zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso growth zzso zzso family of receptors in human and zzso mouse zzso Moreover, in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso activated downstream zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso target of zzso zzso signaling and enhanced tumor growth, zzso and invasion, the latter via zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso To this end, zzso zzso or zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso effects, including zzso migration and zzso Taken together, our data suggest that zzso contributes to skin zzso via association with the zzso of receptors and subsequent zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso thereby implicating zzso as a putative therapeutic target in zzso zzso
