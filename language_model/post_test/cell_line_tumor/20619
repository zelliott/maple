The zzso protein plays a central role in the prevention of zzso Cellular zzso such as DNA damage and zzso zzso zzso trigger induction of zzso that zzso cellular proliferation and allows cells to be zzso If cellular damage is beyond the capability of the repair mechanisms, zzso zzso zzso or cell cycle arrest, preventing damaged cells from becoming zzso However, emerging evidence suggests that the function of zzso needs to be considered as zzso Here, we report that the expression profile of zzso can be shifted toward zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is known for its strong association with gastric cancer and gastric zzso zzso tissue zzso We found that interaction of zzso zzso with gastric zzso cells, zzso via the zzso zzso island, zzso zzso truncated zzso and zzso zzso in human zzso zzso of an zzso zzso zzso zzso was also found in zzso zzso Mongolian zzso The zzso zzso inhibit zzso and zzso activities, induce zzso and increase survival of infected zzso zzso of zzso in response to zzso zzso infection, is regulated by zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso Together, these results provide unique insights into the regulation of zzso protein and may contribute to the understanding of zzso associated with zzso zzso
