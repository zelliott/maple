A novel single step zzso approach to screen a library of zzso therapy zzso compounds was zzso zzso high content analysis zzso technologies several robust cellular parameters were identified, which can be used to determine the zzso effects of zzso compounds which have been developed as potential zzso agents directed against zzso zzso To demonstrate the proof of principle of this approach a small detailed study on five zzso based compounds was performed utilizing two relevant zzso cancer cell lines zzso and zzso The measurable zzso from these early studies were then evaluated by performing a pilot screen using a set of 22 zzso These data were evaluated and validated by performing comparative studies using a traditional zzso zzso zzso The studies demonstrated that the zzso zzso offers significant advantages over and above the currently used methods zzso related to the zzso presence of the compounds by analysis of their integrated intensity and area within the zzso A high correlation was found between the high content screening zzso and zzso zzso However, the zzso approach provides additional information that allows a better understanding of the behavior of these compounds when interacting at the cellular zzso This is the first step towards an automated zzso screening of zzso drug candidates and the beginnings of an integrated and comprehensive quantitative structure action relationship zzso study for zzso zzso
