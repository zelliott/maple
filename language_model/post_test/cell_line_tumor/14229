Both zzso oxide zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso mediate tumor vascular zzso Because these molecules regulate one zzso zzso we hypothesized that NO zzso zzso zzso produces effects comparable to those of zzso therapy on human pancreatic cancer zzso 

zzso human pancreatic cancer cells were zzso implanted in nude zzso On day 6, mice were zzso to receive zzso PBS zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso by zzso injection, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the drinking water, or zzso both zzso and zzso Mice were killed on day zzso 

zzso and zzso as single agents inhibited tumor growth by approximately 50% to zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso Furthermore, combined therapy inhibited mean tumor growth by zzso zzso zzso zzso Combined zzso of zzso and zzso also decreased mean vessel counts by zzso zzso zzso zzso and vessel area by zzso versus controls zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso where vessel diameter was similar to control, zzso decreased mean vessel diameter by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also led to a zzso zzso zzso zzso decrease in tumor zzso of the zzso marker zzso zzso versus controls whereas zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso The combination of zzso decreased zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Although zzso can mediate zzso activity, the combination of zzso and zzso zzso significantly increased the zzso effect over single agent zzso The addition of zzso zzso led to an even further zzso of tumor vessel zzso and vascular zzso compared with zzso zzso suggesting that NO and zzso have distinct but complementary effects on the tumor zzso
