Earlier we have shown that the zzso growth factor zzso was unable to retain its zzso zzso signal after the assembly of zzso zzso zzso However, the nature of the protein zzso zzso zzso or its identity is not zzso In this report, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso the activity of zzso like protein zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso induced zzso is prominent only in intact zzso zzso The zzso activity is not inhibited if the zzso treatment precedes zzso inhibitor zzso The zzso zzso have exhibited higher zzso activity after zzso treatment of zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso activity of zzso zzso from the zzso cells expressing the zzso message of zzso has not increased despite zzso treatment, confirming the role of zzso in the zzso of zzso The studies presented here will be useful in understanding the process of signal zzso by the assembly of zzso
