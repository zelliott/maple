Using human acute zzso zzso zzso cells and human primary zzso this study examined the ability of zzso acid zzso to zzso the activity of the zzso zzso cascade and its downstream zzso zzso zzso zzso We established that AA inhibited zzso zzso activity with an zzso of 20 zzso in zzso cells and 12 zzso in zzso and this was due to reduced expression of zzso zzso and reduced level of zzso zzso Further zzso analysis revealed that AA zzso with the zzso function of the zzso zzso zzso by reducing zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso on zzso zzso The importance of AA metabolism via the zzso and zzso pathways was investigated using zzso zzso but not zzso acid, prevented the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and thereby zzso zzso activity in zzso cells and zzso This is the first study to demonstrate that AA zzso the zzso pathway, and this function is zzso by zzso produced zzso of zzso We now have evidence demonstrating that the AA zzso zzso zzso and zzso were highly zzso towards the zzso pathway, while zzso zzso had no zzso Together, these results indicate that the fatty acid AA has the potential to zzso the zzso activity of zzso and may form the basis of novel zzso zzso
