zzso is a common characteristic of solid zzso Recent studies confirmed that zzso zzso 4 zzso plays a significant role in cancer invasion and zzso In this study, the correlation between the expression of zzso and the change of the protein level of zzso zzso alpha zzso was zzso 

We examined 84 human pancreatic cancer zzso for expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells were exposed to zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso or treated with zzso zzso protein was analyzed by flow zzso and zzso Growth studies were conducted on cells with the zzso zzso isolated from stable zzso cell zzso Finally, zzso protein was detected by zzso in zzso zzso 

There was a positive correlation between zzso and zzso protein in pancreatic cancer zzso zzso stress induced zzso zzso and protein expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso showed zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso growth decreased in response to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment could effectively curb tumor growth in zzso 

These results suggest that zzso expression in pancreatic cancer cells is zzso via zzso in response to hypoxic stress and underscore the crucial role of zzso zzso in tumor zzso
