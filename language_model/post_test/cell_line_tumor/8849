zzso translation initiation factor 3 is composed of 13 zzso zzso through zzso and plays an essential role in zzso During zzso several zzso rapidly zzso protein synthesis by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In this study, we found that the zzso of zzso by zzso in zzso cells zzso the zzso of zzso G of the zzso complex zzso The zzso site zzso was identified, and we found that the zzso zzso was zzso to the nucleus, zzso zzso and that it also showed a strong zzso zzso These data demonstrate the important roles of zzso in the translation initiation machinery and in DNA degradation during zzso
