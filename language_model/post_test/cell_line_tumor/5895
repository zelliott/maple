To determine whether canine tumor cell lines express functional tissue factor and shed tissue zzso zzso 

Cell lines derived from tumors of the canine zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso lung zzso prostate zzso zzso bone zzso zzso and zzso and soft tissue zzso from normal canine zzso zzso zzso and from a zzso human zzso tumor zzso 

zzso factor zzso and zzso expression were evaluated in cells by use of zzso zzso in a reverse zzso zzso zzso and a rabbit zzso zzso tissue factor zzso in flow zzso and zzso microscopic zzso zzso zzso factor zzso activity on cell surfaces, in whole cell zzso and in zzso zzso was measured by use of an activated factor zzso zzso zzso 

zzso tissue factor zzso was identified in all canine tumor zzso All canine tumor cells expressed zzso tissue zzso however, the zzso and zzso zzso cells lacked surface tissue factor expression and zzso The highest tissue factor expression and activity were observed in canine zzso tumor cells and pulmonary zzso cells zzso These 3 tumors also shed tissue zzso zzso into tissue culture zzso 

zzso factor was zzso highly expressed in canine tumor cell lines, particularly those derived from zzso zzso Because zzso tissue factor can promote tumor growth and zzso in human patients, high tissue factor expression could affect the in zzso biological behavior of these tumors in zzso
