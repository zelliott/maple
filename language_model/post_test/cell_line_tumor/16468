zzso factor family zzso peptides promote wound healing in the zzso Recent evidence has suggested that zzso may be a pancreatic zzso an unusual role for zzso zzso We sought to clarify human pancreatic zzso and zzso expression and performed in zzso experiments to see how pancreatic cell lines respond to zzso in zzso 

zzso of normal and diseased zzso zzso zzso pancreatic zzso zzso neuroendocrine tumors, and pancreatic zzso zzso zzso were studied by zzso and in zzso zzso zzso cell lines were challenged with zzso and zzso in wound and migration zzso 

In normal zzso zzso of insulin or zzso with zzso was zzso All zzso zzso zzso were seen in zzso zzso zzso expressed all zzso zzso zzso zzso ducts were zzso free; zzso was strongest in pancreatic zzso zzso and chronic zzso but was reduced in zzso zzso induced zzso migration and accelerated wound closure in zzso and zzso Double zzso for insulin or zzso and zzso zzso only very rare zzso zzso zzso zzso ducts showed some zzso zzso 

No correlation between zzso or insulin and zzso was seen without zzso zzso zzso may assist pancreatic tumor cell movement, but zzso may not be a pancreatic zzso
