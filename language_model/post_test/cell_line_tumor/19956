zzso approach using zzso zzso may be one of the strategies for the management of the skin zzso Here we report that in zzso treatment of human zzso zzso zzso cells with zzso a naturally occurring zzso zzso decreased cell viability zzso P zzso zzso and induced cell death zzso P zzso zzso in a dose zzso zzso and time zzso zzso manner, which was associated with an increase in zzso zzso zzso phase of the cell cycle is known to be controlled by zzso dependent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our western zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso cell cycle arrest was zzso through the increased expression of zzso proteins zzso and zzso a simultaneous decrease in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and E and enhanced binding of zzso In additional studies, treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso for 72 h resulted in a significant zzso increase in zzso zzso P zzso zzso than zzso control zzso which was associated with an increased expression of zzso protein zzso decreased expression of zzso proteins zzso and zzso disruption of zzso membrane potential, and zzso of zzso 9, 3 and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with the zzso inhibitor zzso significantly blocked the zzso zzso in zzso cells confirmed that zzso zzso is zzso through zzso of zzso zzso zzso Together, this study for the first time identified zzso as a zzso agent against human zzso zzso zzso cells in zzso further in zzso studies are required to determine whether zzso could be an effective zzso agent for the management of zzso skin zzso
