zzso is reportedly responsible for zzso of zzso regulatory T cells zzso in zzso Thus, we treated mouse zzso zzso zzso with zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso The treatment delayed tumor growth, but unexpectedly increased the proportion of zzso in zzso In zzso zzso enhanced while zzso zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso To enhance the zzso effects, zzso was administered with zzso which was reported to eliminate zzso zzso This combination resulted in long term zzso survival of up to zzso of mice, and the zzso mice were more resistant to zzso with zzso To examine the zzso of tumor zzso immune cells, zzso bearing mice were treated with zzso and a lower dose of zzso This treatment markedly inhibited tumor growth, and was accompanied by massive zzso of zzso T zzso Furthermore, this combination markedly decreased the number of zzso zzso cells, and increased their expression levels of zzso II and zzso In a spontaneous zzso lung zzso model with zzso of primary zzso this combination therapy markedly increased the survival of mice, indicating it was effective in reducing lethal zzso zzso Taken together, our data show that zzso zzso and zzso represents an effective zzso zzso
