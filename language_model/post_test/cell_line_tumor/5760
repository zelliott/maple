The zzso receptors zzso play important roles in zzso which is always fostered by persistent zzso B virus zzso zzso Recent studies have linked zzso zzso to viral zzso or zzso zzso could lead to cell cycle progression or zzso of zzso while zzso had opposite zzso Here we proposed that zzso affected zzso expression in viral zzso which might be triggered by zzso The protein expression of zzso in zzso cells was much stronger than that in zzso cells, which was not consistent with its zzso expression in these zzso zzso zzso was predicted to be a regulator of zzso by targeting its 3' untranslated region zzso The enhanced green zzso protein zzso reporter experiment confirmed the direct interaction of zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso protein level was zzso correlated with the zzso zzso Taken together, our studies supported that zzso infection might zzso zzso expression and zzso was a direct target of zzso zzso in zzso levels between zzso and zzso cells resulted in the difference in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in viral zzso zzso by zzso
