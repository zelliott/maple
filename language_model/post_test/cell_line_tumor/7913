zzso zzso is a zzso belonging to the zzso zzso zzso It is zzso by zzso cells, strongly acts on T cells, and also stimulates innate immune zzso In most studies, the effects of zzso on T cells were zzso however, not much is known about possible effects of zzso on other cell zzso zzso signals via the common zzso zzso zzso chain zzso and the zzso chain zzso Given the importance of zzso in regulating liver responses such as the acute phase response or liver zzso we investigated whether zzso could also have a function in liver zzso We find that zzso stimulates zzso cells and zzso by inducing a sustained signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Whereas the zzso zzso responses to zzso zzso and zzso zzso are not zzso we observe an zzso zzso zzso response leading to the induction of zzso proteins such as zzso zzso zzso response factor zzso zzso zzso resistance A and zzso binding protein zzso 

Our study provides evidence for a function of zzso in zzso cells and zzso and shows that zzso responses are not restricted to the classical immune zzso Our results suggest that zzso exerts zzso functions in liver cells and that it can contribute to the zzso response in these zzso
