The zzso of DNA inside zzso meant for gene delivery applications is a challenging process where several parameters need to be modulated in order to design zzso with specific tailored zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate and improve the zzso parameters of zzso DNA zzso loaded in zzso zzso using zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso efficiency were analyzed as a function of zzso degree of zzso and zzso zzso The manipulation of these parameters influenced not only the particle size but also the zzso and release of zzso zzso the zzso efficiency of the zzso systems was also enhanced with the zzso of the particle zzso Overall, the differently formulated zzso systems possess singular properties that can be employed according to the desired gene delivery zzso
