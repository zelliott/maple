To develop a therapy for drug-resistant zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso we zzso T zzso with zzso zzso zzso consisting of an zzso zzso variable domain zzso with most ALL zzso the hinge and zzso zzso of zzso and the signaling domain of zzso We compared the zzso activity zzso by a novel zzso zzso containing the signaling domain of zzso zzso a crucial zzso for zzso zzso zzso to that of a zzso lacking zzso zzso zzso zzso produced efficient and durable zzso expression in human T zzso zzso expressing zzso receptors exerted powerful and specific zzso against ALL cells, which was superior to that of zzso with receptors lacking zzso zzso zzso were remarkably effective in zzso with bone zzso zzso cells, and against zzso cells from patients with drug-resistant zzso as few as zzso zzso T cells eliminated most ALL cells within 5 zzso These cells also expanded and produced zzso in response to ALL cells at much higher rates than those of zzso expressing equivalent receptors lacking zzso We conclude that zzso zzso receptors containing zzso are a powerful new tool for zzso therapy of zzso ALL and other zzso zzso zzso
