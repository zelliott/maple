zzso have been hypothesized to act as remote sensors of the cell environment, but many details of the sensor function remain zzso We investigated the distribution of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso density on zzso and on the zzso cell membrane of zzso human zzso zzso cells using a zzso enabled imaging zzso We targeted cell surface zzso with 40 zzso diameter zzso zzso zzso using a high affinity zzso labeling strategy and determined relative zzso binding affinities zzso resolved through zzso zzso zzso zzso interactions between the labels generated a zzso density zzso spectral response that facilitated a spatial mapping of the zzso density distribution on zzso length scales in an optical microscope in zzso The measured zzso values were significantly higher on zzso than on the cellular surface, which is indicative of an enrichment of zzso on zzso A detailed characterization of the spatial distribution of the zzso zzso through scanning electron zzso zzso confirmed the findings of the zzso zzso zzso studies and provided additional structural zzso The zzso exhibited a preferential association with the sides of the zzso We zzso the zzso spectral response of the zzso zzso through correlation of optical zzso and zzso The experimental dependence of the measured zzso resonance wavelength zzso of the interacting zzso on zzso was well described by the fit zzso zzso zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso The performed correlated zzso studies pave the way toward quantitative zzso studies of zzso and other important cell surface receptors in an optical zzso
