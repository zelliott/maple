zzso is widespread in solid tumors as a consequence of poorly structured zzso zzso zzso measurement of low oxygen levels in a range of adult tumor types has correlated tumor zzso with advanced stage, poor response to chemotherapy and zzso and poor zzso Little is known about the importance of zzso in pediatric zzso therefore, we evaluated the effects of zzso on the response of the zzso cell lines zzso and zzso to the clinically relevant drugs, zzso zzso and zzso Short periods of zzso zzso zzso of up to 16 hours had no effect on drug-induced zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso of 1 to 7 days leads to reduction in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells, and this was reflected in increased zzso survival under these zzso Neither short-term nor prolonged zzso had any effect on the zzso response to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha was stabilized in these cell lines within 2 hours of zzso but was no longer zzso beyond 48 hours of zzso zzso of zzso zzso IX showed zzso to be zzso zzso zzso of zzso by short hairpin zzso interference and the zzso zzso reduced zzso drug zzso These results suggest that prolonged zzso leads to resistance to clinically relevant drugs in zzso and that therapies aimed at zzso zzso function may be useful in overcoming drug resistance in this zzso
