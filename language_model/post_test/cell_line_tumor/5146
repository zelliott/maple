ON zzso is a novel targeted zzso agent under clinical investigation in Phase I and II zzso The purpose of this research was to evaluate the zzso profile of ON zzso across several species, and to evaluate the effects of protein binding and duration of exposure on its in zzso zzso zzso 

Data were collated from several zzso zzso where the plasma disposition and tissue distribution of ON zzso were assessed after administration zzso zzso zzso or zzso to several species zzso zzso and zzso Plasma protein binding was assessed using zzso zzso activity of ON zzso was determined in zzso cells, and activity was correlated to zzso drug concentration and the duration of zzso 

ON zzso exhibits extensive plasma protein binding and the compound displays rapid elimination from the circulation in all three animal species zzso range zzso zzso zzso distribution studies in mice revealed highest drug zzso in the liver, followed by the zzso ON zzso is not extensively zzso in zzso and urinary zzso is zzso at higher zzso ON zzso zzso in zzso cells was adversely affected by protein binding in the incubation zzso Drug zzso was greatly enhanced upon extending the duration of exposure at reduced drug zzso 

Due to the short zzso and rapid clearance of the drug, administration of ON zzso by continuous IV infusion is a likely treatment option for cancer zzso
