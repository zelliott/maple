The evaluation of new drug treatments and combination treatments for zzso and other zzso requires a robust means to interrogate wide dose ranges and varying times of drug exposure without zzso of the cells zzso To this end, we developed a zzso zzso colony formation zzso that makes use of zzso technology, a new cell colony counter for gels and soft zzso We used zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell lines and zzso zzso zzso and zzso colon zzso cell zzso zzso were grown in a two-tiered zzso that had zzso zzso on the bottom and zzso zzso on zzso We then studied the effects of zzso zzso and zzso over a zzso dose range and over multiple days of drug zzso Using zzso we zzso the area under the curve zzso of colony volumes as the sum of colony volumes zzso in each plate to calculate zzso zzso zzso colonies were recognized by zzso scanning at zzso days, while it took zzso days to detect zzso zzso The growth rate of zzso and zzso cells was zzso with 100 colonies counted in 5-6 zzso zzso cells grew more slowly, with 100 colonies counted in zzso zzso Reliable log dose versus zzso zzso were observed for all drugs zzso In conclusion, the zzso method that we describe is more quantitative than traditional colony zzso and allows precise study of drug effects with respect to both dose and time of exposure using fewer culture zzso
