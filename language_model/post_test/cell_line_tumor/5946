zzso of new bone formation is frequently seen in the bone zzso from prostate zzso However, whether osteogenesis is necessary for prostate tumor growth in bone is zzso Recently, 2 zzso zzso and zzso were generated from prostate cancer bone zzso When implanted zzso in severe combined zzso zzso mice, zzso induced strong zzso bone formation while zzso did zzso To identify the factors that are involved in bone formation, we compared the expression of zzso factors zzso from zzso and zzso by zzso zzso We found that the zzso zzso zzso expressed higher levels of bone zzso protein zzso and several zzso including zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso We showed that zzso zzso from zzso contributed to about a third of the zzso differentiation seen in zzso zzso The zzso media from zzso induced a higher level of zzso zzso which was significantly reduced by treatment with zzso zzso zzso or the small zzso zzso zzso 1 inhibitor zzso zzso did not elicit an zzso effect on zzso which expressed low to zzso levels of zzso zzso Treatment of zzso mice bearing zzso tumors with zzso significantly reduced tumor zzso Thus, these studies support a role of zzso osteogenesis in the progression of prostate cancer in zzso
