zzso is a natural plant zzso previously shown to induce zzso arrest in zzso human colon cancer cells as well as zzso human gastric cancer cells, suggesting its use as a possible cancer zzso zzso Changes in cell and nuclear size often correlate with the functionality of zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso cell and nuclear enlargement of zzso zzso zzso clearly induced the formation of giant nuclear shapes in zzso as demonstrated by zzso microscopic observation and quantitative determination of nuclear zzso Cell and nuclear size were further assessed by flow zzso analysis of light scattering and zzso pulse zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso values zzso referring to cell and nuclear size, zzso significantly increased after zzso zzso the mean values of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso cells were zzso and zzso respectively, whereas those of control cells were zzso and zzso zzso Our approach may provide insights into the mechanism behind zzso cell and nuclear enlargement as well as functional studies on zzso zzso
