DNA zzso molecules are promising zzso zzso zzso aromatic molecules such as zzso zzso into zzso DNA and affect major zzso zzso In the present study, we have characterized two molecules with the same chemical backbone but different side zzso namely zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at the 8th and 4th position, zzso Although both zzso and zzso show similar zzso properties with high DNA zzso here we show that they differ in their biological zzso We find that zzso is many fold more potent than zzso and is zzso against different zzso cell zzso zzso value of zzso zzso was estimated between zzso zzso among the zzso cells zzso while it was more than 200 zzso when zzso was zzso Cell cycle analysis shows an increase in zzso phase, without any particular cell cycle zzso zzso V zzso in conjunction with comet zzso and DNA fragmentation suggest that zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso Thus the observed low zzso value of zzso makes it a promising cancer zzso zzso
