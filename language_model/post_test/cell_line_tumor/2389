In this study, we describe the zzso activity of zzso one of the new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso of zzso a natural occurring product from zzso zzso It could zzso inhibit cell growth when tested on 19 cancer cell zzso To investigate its zzso two cell lines zzso and zzso sensitive to zzso were zzso Based on flow zzso it was found to induce zzso zzso Moreover, it could cause zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso On the other hand, zzso activated zzso assembly checkpoint zzso zzso zzso of zzso one of the zzso was gradually increased, reaching a peak after 16 - 20 zzso and then gradually zzso Instead, zzso increased the zzso population, which suggested a cell death zzso Actually, expression of zzso family proteins and zzso of zzso were zzso of zzso zzso with these results, cells with DNA fragmentation and zzso cells were increased zzso after zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso has promising zzso effects via zzso zzso
