zzso stress is associated with the pathology of acute and chronic neurodegenerative zzso We have cloned a human zzso zzso construct and zzso this protein in cultured human zzso cells to assess whether zzso ameliorates the cellular response to experimental zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso with a blank zzso zzso responded to zzso injury with a significant decrease in cellular zzso at 5 and 24 h after zzso This was coupled with increases in the zzso zzso and the transition metals iron zzso copper zzso and zinc zzso within the cell body, as monitored simultaneously using X-ray zzso zzso zzso zzso cell viability decreased over the same time period with a approximately 4 to zzso increase in cell death zzso approximately zzso matched by an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso at a zzso increase after 24 zzso and zzso of zzso along zzso zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso loss and except for significant decreases in the sulfur zzso chlorine zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso maintained cellular zzso zzso after zzso zzso This resulted in increased cell zzso significantly diminished zzso zzso and maintenance of the zzso zzso structure and zzso zzso These data indicate that bolstering the cellular content of zzso zzso zzso cell dysfunction promoted by zzso insult through multiple protective actions zzso zzso maintenance of cellular zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso a reduction in cellular zzso of Fe, zzso and zzso at the expense of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso an enhancement of cell viability through zzso necrosis and zzso
