zzso DNA zzso has been implicated as a key survival mechanism in cancer, zzso promoter zzso zzso genes essential for many cellular processes including zzso Limited data is available on the zzso profile of zzso genes in prostate cancer zzso The aim of this study was to profile zzso of zzso genes in zzso using zzso high performance liquid zzso zzso 

Based on an in zzso selection process, 13 genes were screened for zzso in zzso cell lines using zzso zzso zzso specific zzso was employed to determine zzso levels in prostate tissue specimens zzso representing zzso zzso benign zzso high-grade zzso zzso zzso and benign zzso zzso Gene expression was measured by zzso in cell lines and tissue zzso 

The promoters of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso appeared fully or partially zzso in a number of zzso cell zzso This is the first report of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis in prostate zzso identified 5 genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which were frequently zzso in tumors but were zzso in zzso of benign zzso Furthermore, zzso of tumors were zzso in at least one of the zzso zzso In the case of all zzso except zzso promoter zzso was associated with concurrent zzso of gene zzso 

Future examination of this zzso zzso zzso zzso in a larger cohort of patients is justified to further evaluate its value as a diagnostic and zzso zzso
