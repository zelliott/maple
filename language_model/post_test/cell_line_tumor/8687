The clinical outcome of BC patients receiving the same treatment is known to vary considerably and thus, there is a compelling need to identify novel zzso that can select the patients that would benefit most from a given therapy and can predict the clinical zzso The aim of this study was to determine the zzso value of zzso a novel long zzso recently characterized by our group and overlapping zzso zzso in BC zzso We first evaluated by zzso and zzso the expression of zzso in normal breast tissue and BC tissue and further analyzed zzso expression in an independent set of zzso primary BC with regard to clinical, zzso pathological and other biological zzso Also, we explored the possibility of zzso adding to the zzso value of zzso models that already included the traditional zzso zzso Finally, we identified in in zzso models the impact of zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso on cell migration and zzso Our results revealed that although zzso in zzso in two out of three sets of patients, and having the highest expression in zzso zzso negative zzso disease, zzso expression levels are zzso solely for a zzso of BC patients, namely for patients with zzso disease that have received zzso zzso zzso For this zzso high levels of zzso suggest the patients will not benefit from zzso containing zzso chemotherapy (shorter MFS and zzso Additionally, we found that zzso zzso cell migration and zzso zzso to zzso in a zzso zzso
