To study mechanisms which could be involved in the reverse dose rate effect observed during zzso induction after exposure to high LET radiation, synchronized mouse zzso cells were exposed to carbon 290 zzso beams with different LET values at the zzso zzso zzso or S zzso in the cell zzso The frequency of zzso zzso zzso induction was subsequently zzso The results showed that after exposure to high LET value radiation zzso and zzso zzso maximum zzso zzso were seen at the zzso phase, but after exposure to lower LET radiation zzso zzso the highest zzso zzso were observed at the zzso zzso The higher LET beam always produced higher zzso zzso in the zzso phase than in the zzso phase, regardless of radiation zzso These results suggest that cells in the zzso phase is zzso for zzso induction from high LET radiation, but not to zzso induction from low LET zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso showed that large deletions (which could include almost entire zzso of the mouse zzso gene were most efficiently induced in zzso cells zzso with high LET zzso These entire zzso deletions were not as frequent in cells exposed to lower LET zzso This suggests that inappropriate zzso repair might have occurred in response to condensed damage in condensed zzso in the zzso zzso In addition, by using a zzso zzso detection system zzso zzso a reverse zzso effect was clearly observed after exposure to carbon beams with higher LET values zzso zzso but not after exposure to beams with lower LET values zzso zzso Thus, zzso sensitivity towards zzso zzso and the dependence on radiation LET values could both be major factors involved in the reverse dose rate effect produced by high LET zzso
