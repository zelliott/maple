zzso zzso zzso is a zzso that also acts as a zzso signal early in zzso The zzso zzso zzso on the zzso of the zzso zzso cells controls zzso levels in the maternal zzso to maintain stable zzso blood flow and simultaneously provide zzso to the zzso The zzso zzso rate of zzso zzso is important for both the mother and the developing zzso The impact of zzso on the zzso zzso system during diabetic pregnancy is not zzso The present in zzso study investigated this important issue in human zzso zzso zzso cells that were cultured for zzso h in a medium containing either zzso zzso zzso or 25 zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso rates of the cultured cells were not altered at zzso zzso zzso in the range of zzso zzso but were decreased significantly at a zzso concentration zzso zzso To understand better the role of zzso on the zzso zzso system, we first characterized zzso in zzso cells at different zzso zzso and then determined the expression levels of zzso on the plasma membrane and in the zzso pools of zzso cells at the zzso and zzso zzso where the zzso rates were decreased zzso under zzso zzso zzso Finally, the importance of zzso of zzso molecules was zzso In zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso indicating that a large percentage of zzso proteins exist as zzso in zzso Under diabetic conditions, zzso no longer zzso zzso suggesting a disruption in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso we propose that under uncontrolled diabetic conditions, zzso zzso zzso zzso rates of zzso zzso by interfering with its functional expression in a zzso zzso
