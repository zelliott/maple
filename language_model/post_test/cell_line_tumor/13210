We investigated the therapeutic potential of zzso an inhibitor of the BET class of human zzso zzso in zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso We show that zzso zzso reduces the viability of zzso cell lines with high-risk zzso Among the most sensitive were lines with zzso of zzso which is zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and signals through zzso zzso and zzso to drive proliferation and suppress zzso As previously observed, zzso induced the zzso of zzso transcription, the loss of zzso at the zzso promoter, and the reduced expression of zzso target zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso transcription, depleted zzso from the zzso promoter, and reduced zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression profiling demonstrated a restricted effect of zzso on transcription, with zzso and zzso being among the most zzso zzso Indeed, zzso was the only zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells significantly zzso by zzso zzso In mice zzso with primary human zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso expression and zzso zzso and significantly prolonged zzso Thus, zzso zzso is a promising therapeutic strategy for zzso as well as other conditions dependent on zzso zzso
