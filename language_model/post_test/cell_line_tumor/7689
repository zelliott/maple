In this work, a DNA zzso replacement strategy for therapeutic activity is successfully designed for zzso zzso In this zzso therapy, zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules are used for zzso therapy zzso while zzso are used for selective binding to target cancer cells and for zzso therapy zzso with near infrared laser zzso zzso zzso which specifically targets leukemia T cells, is zzso to an zzso by a zzso zzso bond and then zzso with a zzso zzso to form a DNA double zzso When target cancer cells are zzso zzso is zzso and shows no zzso zzso However, when target cancer cells are present, the zzso changes structure to release zzso to produce zzso oxygen for zzso upon light zzso zzso by combining zzso and zzso agents, zzso dual therapy supplies a more effective therapeutic outcome than either therapeutic zzso zzso
