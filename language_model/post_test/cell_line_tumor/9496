zzso zzso zzso zzso is characterized by rapid tumor zzso high zzso potential and profound zzso We recently reported that induction of a zzso zzso in the zzso cell line zzso by long-term chemotherapy involves an increased zzso 1 beta zzso zzso of zzso oxide zzso accounting for efficient zzso zzso In the present study, we zzso the involvement of zzso an zzso zzso previously found in other zzso in this zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, but not zzso parental zzso cells, express high levels of zzso in an zzso zzso zzso cells subjected to short interfering zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited reduced zzso zzso oxide zzso expression and NO zzso as well as a significant increase of zzso drug-induced zzso zzso an effect reversed by the NO donor zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso protection to zzso drug zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso in example, by zzso as reported for other zzso activities, seemed to be zzso for zzso protection by zzso Neither the zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso zzso cells nor did the administration of various zzso zzso affect zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso expression in zzso of pancreatic cancer zzso supporting a potential role of zzso in the zzso of this zzso These findings substantiate our understanding of the molecular mechanisms leading to zzso in zzso cells and indicate the importance of zzso in this zzso
