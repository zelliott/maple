zzso intervention with specific fatty acids zzso tumor growth and enhances tumor responsiveness to zzso zzso of tumors with long chained omega-3 zzso fatty acids results in enrichment of tumor zzso zzso with omega-3 fatty acids resulting in an altered membrane composition and zzso zzso enriched with long chained omega-3 zzso fatty acids possess zzso with increased zzso an elevated zzso index, enhanced transport capabilities that results in zzso of selective zzso agents, increased activity of selected drug zzso zzso and zzso of signaling pathways important for cancer zzso These nutritionally induced changes in tumor fatty acid composition result in increased sensitivity to chemotherapy, especially in tumor lines that are resistant to chemotherapy and cause specific enhancement of zzso to tumor cells and protection of normal zzso zzso tumors to increased zzso through nutritional intervention with specific fatty acids has the potential to improve patient response to chemotherapy with fewer zzso side effects if these zzso findings carry over into a clinical zzso
