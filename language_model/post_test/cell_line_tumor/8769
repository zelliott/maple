zzso zzso models that zzso the key features of human pancreatic zzso zzso zzso are needed in order to provide biologically zzso models to probe disease progression and therapeutic responses and ultimately improve patient outcomes for this zzso Here, we describe the establishment and clinical, zzso molecular and genetic validation of a zzso zzso zzso model of zzso 

Human zzso were zzso and zzso implanted and zzso in zzso zzso Patient survival was correlated with zzso growth and zzso rate in zzso Human and mouse tumor pathology were zzso zzso were analyzed for genetic zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Fifteen human zzso were zzso zzso in zzso zzso mice developed zzso and liver zzso Time to tumor growth and zzso efficiency in mice each correlated with patient zzso zzso architecture, nuclear grade and zzso content were similar in patient and zzso zzso zzso tumors closely exhibited the genetic and molecular features known to characterize pancreatic cancer zzso high rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The correlation zzso of gene expression between patient tumors and zzso zzso through multiple generations was 93 to zzso Analysis of gene expression demonstrated distinct differences between zzso from fresh patient tumors versus commercially available zzso cell zzso 

The zzso zzso model derived from fresh human zzso closely zzso the clinical, zzso genetic and molecular aspects of human zzso This model has resulted in the identification of rational therapeutic strategies to be tested in clinical trials and will permit additional therapeutic approaches and identification of zzso of response to zzso
