zzso tumor zzso fluid pressure zzso is a characteristic of most solid zzso zzso zzso may hamper the zzso of zzso drugs into the tumor tissue reducing their therapeutic zzso In this study, a means of modulating zzso to increase the flux of zzso into tumor tissue is zzso which is based on the rationale that elevated plasma zzso zzso pressure zzso pulls water from tumor zzso lowering the zzso zzso human serum zzso zzso zzso used as an agent to enhance zzso reduced the zzso zzso from 8 to 2 zzso zzso in human tumor zzso models bearing zzso zzso zzso zzso To evaluate whether this reduction zzso the zzso of zzso the zzso distribution of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso using novel time domain zzso zzso zzso This method permitted discrimination and zzso of zzso zzso from background and unspecific probe zzso The zzso of zzso zzso together with either zzso or zzso was found to lower the zzso significantly and increase the concentration of the substances within the tumor tissue in comparison to control zzso Furthermore, combined administration of zzso zzso plus zzso reduced the tumor growth significantly in comparison to standard zzso zzso These data demonstrate that increased zzso lowers the zzso within hours and increases the zzso of therapeutic zzso into the tumor zzso leading to reduced tumor zzso This model represents a novel approach to facilitate the delivery of zzso into tumor zzso particularly zzso zzso
