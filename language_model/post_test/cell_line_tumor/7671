Changes in environmental conditions lead to expression variation that manifest at the level of gene regulatory zzso Despite a strong understanding of the role noise plays in synthetic biological systems, it remains unclear how propagation of expression zzso in an zzso regulatory network is distributed and zzso by cells transitioning through a key zzso zzso 

Here we investigate the zzso dynamics of a zzso zzso network of 45 zzso factors in zzso human zzso zzso leukemia cells undergoing differentiation to zzso We systematically measure zzso regulation of expression and variation by profiling 120 single cells at eight distinct time points, and zzso highly controlled regulatory zzso through which signaling operates with zzso zzso This reveals dynamic and specific zzso as a cellular strategy for zzso The integration of both positive and negative zzso networks further identifies the zzso zzso as a network hinge to zzso both the zzso and zzso zzso 

Compared to averaged cell zzso zzso zzso expression profiling provides a much more powerful technique to probe for zzso insights underlying cellular zzso We believe that our approach will form the basis of novel strategies to study the regulation of zzso at a zzso zzso
