Although progression to zzso at the zzso junction reflects exposure to acid and zzso acids associated with zzso mechanisms zzso this transformation remain zzso zzso zzso C zzso an zzso tumor zzso may represent a zzso marker and target of transformation at the zzso zzso The present studies examine the expression of zzso in normal zzso and tumors from esophagus and stomach and mechanisms regulating its expression by acid and zzso zzso 

Gene expression was examined by zzso zzso chain reaction, promoter analysis, zzso zzso and functional zzso zzso zzso was zzso by using zzso zzso and zzso zzso DNA binding of zzso factors was examined by zzso shift zzso 

zzso zzso and protein were zzso expressed in approximately zzso of zzso arising in, but not in normal, esophagus and zzso Similarly, in zzso human zzso cancer cells, zzso and acid induced expression of zzso This was associated with the induction of expression of zzso a zzso factor required for zzso zzso In turn, induction of zzso expression by zzso was zzso by binding sites in the zzso promoter for nuclear factor zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso increased zzso activity, associated with nuclear zzso and zzso promoter binding of the zzso zzso zzso Moreover, a dominant negative construct for zzso prevented zzso zzso nuclear zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso 

Transformation associated with zzso at the zzso junction reflects zzso by zzso acid and acid of a zzso program involving zzso and zzso which mediate zzso zzso and zzso expression of zzso
