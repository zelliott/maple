zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso showed that the different breast cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso respond differently to the zzso zzso album zzso preparations zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In order to determine the differences in the responsiveness of the cells more exactly, the gene expression profiles were determined by cells, which were treated with zzso zzso compared with zzso control zzso Such differences can be zzso in more detail by looking at the gene expression using Human Whole Genome zzso chips zzso zzso The results of the zzso analyses suggested that zzso preparations influenced the zzso of genes regarding immune defense, stress response, zzso and zzso zzso zzso Within the zzso was the zzso in zzso and zzso The zzso cells were affected on the genes which are involved in zzso contacts whereas zzso responded to the zzso extracts by changing the zzso levels of the immune and stress response zzso zzso the effects of the zzso zzso we conclude that zzso zzso and M have a greater influence on the immune defense and stress response genes whereas zzso A tends to affect the zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso analyses give us information on whether a cancer cell is sensitive to zzso extracts in relation to how many genes are significantly overrepresented after zzso treatment, and whether a particular zzso extract is more effective on a specific cancer cell than the other zzso
