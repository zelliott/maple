Recently, significant progress has been made towards understanding the zzso of cancer from the molecular zzso To this end, a growing number of approaches are being exploited for the identification and validation of new therapeutic targets suitable for potent and specific zzso The type 1 zzso growth factor zzso zzso system has recently become the focus of major attention in the arena of cancer zzso The involvement of the zzso and its downstream signaling zzso in the zzso process makes this system an excellent target for potential cancer zzso Indeed, advances in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind zzso zzso have led to the discovery of agents designed selectively for targeting zzso The potential application of these zzso is currently under intense clinical zzso This review describes the biology of zzso particularly from a cancer zzso The attempts to develop effective zzso zzso are discussed zzso with special emphasis on zzso and small zzso zzso zzso
