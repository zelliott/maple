zzso is one of the fundamental techniques in life zzso To preserve the viability of cells and zzso many researchers use plastic zzso zzso and immerse them into liquid nitrogen for long-term zzso However, the zzso liquid nitrogen usually infiltrates into the zzso and may cause a high rate of microbial contamination, and even some explosive incidents upon zzso To prevent these drawbacks while retaining the benefit of constant zzso temperature in submerged liquid zzso we used a zzso membrane to cover the upper portion of zzso After zzso the zzso were completely free of liquid nitrogen penetration in the zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso process did not affect the cell zzso This modified protocol provides an easy and efficient tool to ensure the integrity of zzso in long-term storage without interfering with existing zzso storage zzso
