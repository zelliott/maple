zzso zzso zzso is a major challenge because of its resistance to conventional zzso chemotherapy and zzso zzso therapy might be a new option for zzso zzso Our previous study showed that zzso gene was activated in zzso and was inhibited by zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the zzso of gene expression by zzso in zzso zzso zzso The results revealed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso was dramatically zzso in response to silence of zzso We speculated that the zzso of zzso was involved in the zzso mechanism of zzso zzso for cell zzso zzso we evaluated whether dual silence of zzso and zzso display a greater suppression of cell zzso The results confirmed that dual zzso of zzso and zzso zzso inhibited cell zzso Our results also showed that dual zzso of zzso and zzso significantly induced cell arrest at zzso zzso Furthermore, Western zzso zzso showed that dual zzso of zzso and zzso markedly reduced the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and inhibited the expression of zzso zzso Our findings imply that zzso silence of zzso might be an effective treatment for zzso
