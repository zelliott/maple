zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are the most promising zzso complexes for zzso zzso In this study, the zzso zzso of zzso was systematically varied (from zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the respective complexes were evaluated with regard to the rate of zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso by means of zzso zone zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated low stability of the complexes at pH zzso and 37 degrees C and a high zzso toward proteins zzso rate zzso in the ranges of zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso (between zzso and zzso zzso were found to be biologically accessible for zzso of the complexes in the zzso and the zzso compound shows the highest zzso activity in zzso
