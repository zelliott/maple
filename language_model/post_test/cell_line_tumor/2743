zzso for the zzso response in the concentration of zzso calcium zzso zzso i zzso and in the sodium zzso zzso current by zzso zzso were investigated in differentiated zzso zzso zzso hybrid zzso zzso zzso The results for the changes in zzso i ) by zzso were as zzso zzso The zzso zzso response was inhibited by 3 zzso zzso M zzso (a zzso zzso zzso but not by other types of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso response was mainly inhibited by zzso (a zzso zzso zzso but not by other types of zzso channel zzso or zzso M zzso (a zzso zzso channel zzso zzso When the zzso zzso was removed by exchange with zzso zzso or zzso the zzso zzso response was extremely zzso The results for the zzso zzso current by the whole cell zzso technique were as zzso zzso The zzso zzso current in differentiated cells was significantly larger than that in zzso zzso zzso The zzso value for zzso zzso current in zzso and differentiated cells was almost the same, about 4 zzso zzso M each zzso zzso The zzso zzso current was completely blocked by 3 zzso zzso M zzso but not by other zzso zzso zzso and zzso M zzso These results suggested that zzso zzso response in differentiated zzso cells was mainly due to zzso zzso zzso channels allowing zzso zzso to enter via zzso zzso but not through zzso zzso zzso
