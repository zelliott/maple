zzso zzso consensus zzso zzso regulatory factor 8 zzso is a zzso factor that regulates the differentiation and function of zzso zzso and zzso cells through zzso or repression of target zzso Although zzso is also expressed in zzso its roles in B cell and T cell maturation or function are ill zzso and few zzso targets are zzso Gene expression profiling of human zzso B cells and mouse B cell zzso showed that zzso transcripts were expressed at highest levels in zzso either from secondary zzso tissue or transformed zzso In addition, zzso for zzso was most intense in zzso zzso center zzso zzso zzso To discover B cell genes regulated by zzso we zzso zzso primary zzso B cells with enhanced green fluorescent zzso zzso generated small interfering zzso zzso of zzso expression in a mouse B cell zzso cell line, and examined the effects of a zzso zzso of zzso on B zzso Each approach identified zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as targets of zzso zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated in zzso occupancy of zzso sequences of both genes by zzso zzso These results suggest previously unappreciated roles for zzso in the zzso regulation of B cell zzso reactions that include direct regulation of zzso and zzso
