Recent studies have revealed a second class of zzso proteins in zzso These genes are termed zzso and it has been suggested that they perform similar functions as zzso zzso is expressed in diverse zzso including the central nervous system and seems to form gap junction channels in the zzso zzso expression zzso Since protein interacting partners have frequently been described for zzso the most prominent family of gap junction forming zzso we thus started to search for candidate genes of zzso interacting zzso zzso a protein belonging to the family of regulatory zzso of the zzso zzso channels, was identified as a binding partner of zzso in an zzso coli zzso zzso This result was verified by zzso laser scanning zzso using double zzso zzso zzso The zzso of both proteins at the plasma membrane is suggestive of functional zzso
