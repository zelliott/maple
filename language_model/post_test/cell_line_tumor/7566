The zzso zzso is zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells, which lack functional zzso zzso Loss of zzso in AT zzso zzso although zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to prolonged zzso arrest after treatment with zzso radiation zzso and partially reverses the zzso We observed similar zzso of the zzso zzso in a subset of oral zzso cell zzso zzso cell lines with zzso zzso In the present study, we report copy number gain, amplification, or zzso of the zzso gene in 8 of 20 zzso cell lines by zzso whereas the zzso gene showed copy number loss in 12 of 20 cell lines by zzso zzso zzso showed zzso of both zzso and zzso in 7 of 11 representative zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso or zzso with their respective zzso resulted in increased sensitivity of zzso cell lines to zzso by the colony survival zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso led to loss of zzso cell cycle zzso and an increased zzso zzso cell population by flow zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso zzso is zzso in a subset of zzso with zzso zzso loss and loss of the zzso phase cell cycle zzso The zzso zzso zzso appears to protect zzso cells from zzso catastrophe by enhancing the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and/or zzso increases the sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso These findings suggest that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso may enhance the efficacy of zzso radiation treatment of zzso
