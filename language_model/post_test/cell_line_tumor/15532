Bone zzso protein zzso is a zzso growth factor that has been implicated in inflammation and prostate cancer zzso zzso We investigated the potential role of zzso in the context of zzso and zzso prostate zzso When the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and human zzso zzso cell lines were zzso with zzso in the presence of zzso zzso increased zzso promoter activity and cell count zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso increased the expression level of zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein in zzso cell lines only in the presence of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso partially or completely blocked zzso zzso zzso hypersensitivity in zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling with zzso zzso in zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Using zzso and zzso cells with a zzso expression of zzso the induction of zzso in zzso resulted in a significant resistance to zzso However, this resistance was blocked after the removal of zzso with zzso zzso Taken together, these results show that zzso zzso zzso resistance by increasing the expression of zzso through zzso zzso
