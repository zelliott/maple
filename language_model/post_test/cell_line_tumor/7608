zzso C virus zzso zzso and release are closely linked to zzso zzso It has been described recently by our group that zzso plays an essential role for the targeting of the zzso zzso zzso from the zzso complex to the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso E was found to be associated with the viral zzso In light of the fact, that zzso harbors an zzso like domain and has a high affinity to zzso the interaction of zzso with the viral particle and the potential relevance for the release of the viral particle were zzso zzso and electron zzso analysis using zzso labeling revealed that zzso binds to the viral particle and stays associated with the released zzso zzso zzso of the zzso binding partner zzso by zzso zzso zzso the viral zzso However, destruction of zzso interactions by zzso of the zzso binding does not abolish the zzso replication domain but prevents the release of zzso zzso The binding of these zzso zzso to the viral particle is not affected by destruction of the zzso binding zzso Moreover, we found that these zzso zzso lacking the binding site for zzso zzso the de zzso zzso viral particles to the zzso compartment where the particles are zzso From this we conclude that the zzso zzso plays an essential role for the proper release of zzso C viral zzso
