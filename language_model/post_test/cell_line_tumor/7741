The quantitative distribution of zzso zzso in zzso bone, cortical bone and in skeletal zzso is required for calculation of zzso dose in zzso zzso An animal model of zzso tumor cell administration was developed to simulate zzso zzso for zzso study of zzso zzso 

In 45 Copenhagen rats zzso zzso prostate cancer cells were given zzso in both the zzso zzso zzso zzso was administered zzso zzso days after cells zzso and these animals were zzso at 4, 24 and 48 h after injection of the zzso The zzso of zzso was estimated in normal skeleton and the bone zzso by means of region of interest analysis using zzso The tumor to zzso ratio and the fractional zzso in cortical bone and zzso bone were zzso 

The zzso of zzso in cortical bone was zzso and in zzso bones was zzso after 4 zzso zzso and zzso after 24 zzso and zzso and zzso after 48 zzso zzso Assuming a zzso zzso distribution of zzso zzso zzso zzso dose to bone zzso was underestimated by zzso In bone zzso an zzso distribution with a minimal and zzso tumor to zzso ratio of 3 : 1 and 14 : 1 after 4 zzso 5 : 1 and 14 : 1 after 24 zzso and 5 : 1 and 16 : 1 after 48 h was zzso 

The zzso model zzso the zzso dose to the bone zzso because of zzso differences in the zzso of zzso in cortical and zzso bone and zzso zzso in skeletal zzso
