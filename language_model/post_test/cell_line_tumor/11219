Small interfering zzso zzso have attracted considerable attention, as compelling zzso providing safe and competent delivery systems are zzso zzso are emerging as appealing zzso delivery zzso thanks to their unique, zzso architecture and the resulting zzso and zzso confined within a zzso We have recently disclosed the structurally flexible zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as an effective zzso for delivery of sticky zzso bearing long complementary sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 or zzso Here, using combined zzso approaches, we successfully clarified zzso the underlying mechanisms of interaction between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso molecules bearing either complementary or zzso sequence zzso of different length and chemistry and zzso the impact of zzso zzso contributing toward the improved delivery zzso Using zzso with complementary zzso offer the best action in term of gene zzso through the formation of zzso that is, zzso structures resulting from synergistic and cooperative binding via zzso bridges zzso zzso 5 or zzso On the other hand, although zzso bearing long, zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 5 or 7) are endowed with considerably higher gene zzso potency than normal zzso with zzso they remain less effective than their sticky zzso zzso The observed gene zzso potency depends on zzso nature, and flexibility of the zzso which behave as a sort of zzso that hold and interact with the zzso zzso thus zzso zzso delivery performance and, ultimately, gene zzso Our findings can be instrumental in designing zzso entities with enhanced capability to achieve effective zzso interference for therapeutic zzso
