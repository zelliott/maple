The natural zzso are zzso constituents of all zzso zzso The objective of this work was to compare aspects of zzso metabolism in two related cell lines with the idea to investigate whether zzso differences can be attributed to functional differences of the zzso The human colon zzso cell lines zzso and zzso were chosen as zzso zzso cells were isolated from the primary zzso zzso cells from a zzso zzso of the same zzso zzso cells grow faster, and the key regulatory zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are more active in the zzso zzso Moreover, their ability to accumulate zzso from the environment is more important than of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were markedly higher in zzso cells, although they are much smaller than zzso cells, and have a particularly small zzso zzso Both cell lines show a striking diminution of zzso and zzso activities and changes in the zzso patterns at the transition from exponential to zzso zzso probably as a consequence of high cell zzso zzso of zzso and zzso due to zzso of zzso by zzso causes zzso of cells in zzso and a zzso decrease of zzso cells in both cell zzso Based on zzso and other criteria zzso and zzso cells were typified as poorly zzso In agreement with their low grade of differentiation they exhibit a low alkaline zzso zzso However, the zzso decrease of alkaline zzso is not typical of differentiation patterns of other zzso cell lines or of normal zzso The high capacity of de zzso zzso zzso and of zzso zzso is presumably a prerequisite for the rapid growth and zzso The fact that these properties were more zzso in the case of zzso cells and paralleled enhanced zzso properties indicate relationships between basic parameters of zzso metabolism and zzso
