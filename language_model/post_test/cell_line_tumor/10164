The availability of a variety of immune response zzso creates an opportunity for improved efficacy of zzso but it also leads to uncertainty in how to combine agents and how to assess those zzso We sought to assess the effect of the addition of zzso zzso factor zzso to vaccination with a melanoma zzso 

zzso patients with zzso melanoma zzso zzso were zzso zzso by stage, and zzso to receive a cellular melanoma vaccine with or without zzso The primary zzso was zzso hypersensitivity zzso response to melanoma zzso zzso responses, peripheral zzso counts, and survival were also zzso 

The zzso arm showed enhanced zzso responses with an increase in zzso zzso against the zzso zzso and increased zzso immune zzso This arm also had diminished zzso cell zzso hypersensitivity zzso zzso blood zzso profiles showed increases in zzso and zzso with decreased zzso in the zzso zzso These immune changes were accompanied by an increase in early melanoma deaths and a trend toward worse survival with zzso 

These data suggest that zzso is not helpful as an immune zzso in this dose and schedule and raise concern that it may be zzso Based on the zzso findings of an immune zzso and clinical outcome, the use of such surrogate zzso in selecting treatments for further evaluation must be done with a great deal of zzso
