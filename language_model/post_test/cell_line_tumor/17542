Trace element imaging and zzso analysis in cells and zzso compartments is a challenging and important objective for modern zzso chemistry in order to better understand the biological chemistry of essential and toxic zzso A focusing system based on zzso design zzso mounted on a zzso radiation scanning X-ray microscope has been developed at the zzso and was used for trace element quantitative imaging in single zzso The focused zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained in that way led to a zzso flux as bright as zzso zzso zzso zzso at 14 zzso The absolute detection limit of this zzso probe, as measured on standard reference materials, was shown to be 2 zzso zzso g for most zzso Chemical maps of human zzso and of zzso zzso cells were obtained for minor zzso zzso zzso zzso and trace elements zzso zzso Within human cancer cells, chemical elements are zzso distributed at the current spatial resolution and correlated with the zzso mass, except Fe, which shows zzso structures around the cell nucleus, and zzso which slightly concentrates in the nucleus, while chemical maps of zzso zzso show homogeneous pattern distribution at the cellular zzso
