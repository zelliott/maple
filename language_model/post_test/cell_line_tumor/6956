Many lines of research zzso zzso zzso zzso in tumor growth and zzso More specifically, we have shown that zzso zzso zzso promotes cell proliferation and invasion through zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso immune evasion through induction of zzso accelerating factor, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to increased zzso size and zzso We continue to identify novel zzso target genes in zzso zzso cells and report here that an immediate early zzso nuclear factor zzso zzso is induced by zzso that in turn regulates cell zzso Originally described as a critical zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso expression is rapidly but zzso induced by zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to the zzso zzso response element and enhances zzso of a reporter construct in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso expression is elevated in zzso mouse zzso and its levels were further increased following zzso zzso Human zzso zzso relative to matched normal zzso showed increased zzso zzso Although not previously described in zzso zzso zzso protein zzso to zzso zzso of zzso mouse zzso Finally, functional studies reveal that zzso protection from zzso is completely inhibited by a zzso zzso zzso Building on previous reports from our group on the zzso zzso zzso family of nuclear zzso these most recent data suggest that zzso a member of another family of nuclear receptors can stimulate progression of zzso cancer downstream from zzso zzso zzso
