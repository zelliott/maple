To investigate the effect of zzso zzso on the zzso cell cycle and zzso of human lung zzso cell line zzso 

The growth of zzso cells exposed to zzso was observed by zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso was performed to detect DNA fragmentation of the zzso zzso The cell cycle distribution of the exposed cells was analyzed using flow zzso and cell zzso was examined with zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to investigate zzso gene expression changes in the exposed zzso 

zzso gel zzso of the DNA from zzso cells showed a DNA zzso and typical zzso appearance of the exposed cells was observed under zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with 1 zzso zzso for 24 h resulted in a cell zzso rate of zzso significantly higher than the rate in control cells zzso zzso The treatment also caused a significant reduction of zzso zzso expression by zzso ( zzso 

zzso can significantly inhibit the zzso induce zzso and zzso zzso gene expression in human lung zzso cell line zzso suggesting the involvement of zzso gene in the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso
