The aim of the present study is to investigate whether differences between tumor cells in zzso are related to zzso or residual zzso strand zzso 

An zzso that allows measurement of absolute induction zzso for DNA double strand breaks zzso in defined regions in the zzso and that zzso rejoining of correct DNA ends has been used to study repair of zzso in three human tumor cell zzso DNA zzso breaks zzso were measured within a zzso Not 1 zzso on zzso X of human tumor cell lines with different zzso zzso rejoining of zzso was measured by zzso of zzso DNA probe to Not 1 restriction fragments separated according to size by zzso field gel zzso zzso zzso of zzso is zzso from the decrease in the intensity of the zzso restriction zzso and an zzso of a zzso below the zzso zzso of zzso results in zzso of the intact restriction zzso only if correct DNA ends are zzso By comparing results from this technique with results from a conventional zzso technique zzso zzso that detects all rejoining events, it was possible to zzso the zzso frequency after zzso of X zzso zzso breaks were measured zzso after zzso 

In terms of zzso zzso zzso cell zzso cell line zzso was the most zzso followed by the breast zzso cell line zzso while the zzso zzso cell line zzso was the most zzso zzso hours after zzso zzso cell line accumulated the highest level of residual zzso zzso followed by zzso and then zzso cell line, which showed the lowest level of residual zzso This was the same rank as in the zzso zzso Regarding zzso zzso zzso cell line showed the highest percent of incorrectly repaired zzso which does not agree with the results of the zzso zzso 

From our data, it could be concluded that residual zzso zzso zzso is more important in terms of zzso than incorrectly repaired zzso
