In this work, we have studied the distribution and dynamic properties of zzso Growth Factor zzso receptors in the plasma membrane of fixed and live cells as well as the extent of zzso of this zzso protein with proteins specific for zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso and zzso zzso This was achieved using a family of zzso tools called image correlation zzso zzso image zzso zzso zzso and dynamic image correlation zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso is zzso distributed on the cell surface at 37 degrees C and zzso as the temperature is lowered to 4 degrees zzso This zzso takes place within 15 zzso and is zzso Changes in temperature also affect the diffusion of zzso by two orders of zzso The dynamic properties of zzso are similar to the dynamic properties of a zzso protein known to be present in membrane zzso which motivated us to explore the extent of zzso of zzso with this membrane raft protein using zzso Our results indicate that more than half of the zzso population is present in membrane zzso and smaller percentages are present in zzso and zzso zzso
