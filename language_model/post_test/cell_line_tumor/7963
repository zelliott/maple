The family of zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins regulates a vast variety of cellular processes and, therefore, zzso in important zzso events like zzso zzso molecular zzso and zzso The majority of experimental data concerning this gene family has been focused on their engagement in zzso zzso critical point in tumor zzso In spite of the growing amount of evidence suggesting the zzso role of zzso the specific functions of every particular family member is still zzso This review focuses on recent evidence on specific zzso zzso of zzso A and zzso B proteins and attempts to connect the findings to their diverse biological functions in the normal and/or zzso transformed zzso
