zzso factors required for DNA replication will enrich our knowledge of this important process and potentially identify vulnerabilities that can be exploited in cancer zzso We applied an zzso that measures the stability of maintenance of an zzso zzso in human tissue culture cells to screen for new DNA replication zzso We identify an important role for zzso in zzso progression where it directly regulates DNA replication factor expression by promoting the recruitment of zzso zzso II to zzso gene zzso We find that the zzso locus is frequently amplified in breast cancer and that breast zzso cells with amplification of zzso are much more sensitive to its depletion than breast cancer cells and a breast zzso cell line that lacks zzso zzso Our results show a novel role for zzso in cancer cell proliferation and suggest zzso as a therapeutic target in breast cancer zzso 

zzso is required for cell proliferation by controlling the zzso of genes expressing DNA replication proteins in cancer cells in which the zzso locus is zzso and this has uncovered a dependence on zzso for cell zzso Given the high frequency of zzso amplification in breast cancer, our results highlight zzso as a promising candidate for targeted therapy of breast tumors with zzso amplification, and indeed we show that zzso zzso zzso a subset of breast cancer cells to zzso
