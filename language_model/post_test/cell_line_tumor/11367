zzso zzso zzso gene transfer is an attractive strategy to zzso T cells with defined zzso zzso using short-term in zzso procedures to target both zzso zzso and solid zzso zzso gene transfer poses different safety issues that might warrant the inclusion of a suicide zzso High affinity zzso may result in zzso zzso and zzso zzso directed against healthy tissue can be observed due to mixed zzso zzso zzso of a suicide gene as a safety switch may abrogate these unwanted zzso Human zzso has been proposed as a zzso suicide gene targeted by widely used zzso zzso zzso that can additionally function as a selection zzso However, zzso of T cells with a zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso resulted in poor zzso In this study, we demonstrated that zzso zzso of zzso and zzso resulted in profound zzso of both the zzso expressed zzso in melanoma zzso and zzso allowing selective as well as efficient elimination of these engineered T cells in zzso These results demonstrate the great potential of zzso zzso zzso to be broadly used in clinical trials as a safety zzso
