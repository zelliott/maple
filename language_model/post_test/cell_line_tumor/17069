zzso zzso and zzso cells are particularly vulnerable to serious damage by zzso zzso oxide zzso and/or zzso stress, most probably due to their low expression levels of zzso zzso This cellular damage has been regarded as one of major obstacles to success of zzso zzso transplantation for the treatment of type 1 zzso As an approach to preventing NO induced damage, zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso was zzso with rat zzso or zzso cells zzso in zzso zzso zzso effectively protected the cells from NO damage, generated by treating the cell zzso with zzso zzso a zzso oxide zzso at zzso up to 400 zzso preserving higher viability and insulin zzso than a control group (no zzso and no zzso When the cells were incubated with zzso without zzso there was zzso concentration dependent cellular damage, and a zzso zzso zzso revealed a typical cell zzso sign, indicating DNA zzso
