In response to zzso zzso zzso DNA breaks, cells undergo zzso arrest, allowing time for DNA repair before zzso the cell zzso zzso checkpoint zzso involves zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso resulting in zzso of zzso zzso and subsequent zzso zzso zzso Previous studies from our laboratory showed that the zzso checkpoint zzso after zzso exposure of zzso breast cancer cells is dependent on the zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso 1 and 2 zzso zzso In the present studies, we investigated the role of zzso zzso zzso toxin zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso checkpoint response and zzso zzso as well as in cell survival after zzso 

With zzso zzso dominant negative zzso zzso zzso and specific small interfering zzso the effect of zzso on zzso zzso checkpoint response and zzso zzso was examined in human breast cancer zzso In addition, the effect of zzso on cell survival after zzso was assessed by using zzso zzso 

zzso exposure of zzso breast cancer cells was associated with a marked zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso by using specific zzso zzso zzso zzso or specific zzso resulted in zzso of zzso zzso arrest and zzso diminution of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso of zzso Moreover, zzso zzso or decreased zzso expression also zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso and zzso Ultimately, zzso of zzso markedly increased cellular sensitivity to zzso exposure, which involves induction of zzso 

Studies in this report suggest that zzso zzso plays an essential role in the zzso of zzso zzso signaling and subsequent zzso checkpoint zzso Furthermore, results also support a role for zzso in promoting cell survival after zzso zzso
