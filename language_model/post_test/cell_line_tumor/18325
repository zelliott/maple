zzso a zzso modified zzso of zzso was recently identified as an zzso zzso zzso for a novel zzso coupled zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we analyzed the role of zzso and zzso in both pancreatic cancer zzso and pancreatic cancer cell zzso Furthermore, we zzso novel short zzso forms of zzso and tested the zzso effect of those zzso on in zzso cell functions that are relevant to zzso zzso cancer zzso showed significantly lower expression of zzso zzso than normal zzso zzso while cancer zzso showed significantly higher expression of zzso zzso than normal pancreatic zzso zzso In human pancreatic cancer cell lines, zzso zzso was highly expressed in 2 out of 6 pancreatic cancer cell lines, while zzso zzso was expressed in all cell lines at various zzso zzso cells showed the highest expression of zzso zzso zzso did not suppress cell proliferation but significantly reduced the in zzso migration of zzso cells ( zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Finally, we zzso 3 novel short zzso forms of zzso zzso zzso and zzso These zzso zzso significantly suppressed the migration of zzso cells and activated zzso These data suggest that the zzso zzso zzso is one of the promising targets for suppression of zzso and that small zzso zzso could be an zzso agent to pancreatic zzso
