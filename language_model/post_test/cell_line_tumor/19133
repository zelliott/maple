zzso fever is a potentially fatal disease caused by the bacterial pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso ( zzso zzso zzso zzso infection is a complex process that involves numerous zzso zzso zzso zzso and these are thought to zzso both stringent human host specificity and a high mortality zzso In the present study, we used a liquid zzso zzso zzso zzso strategy to investigate the zzso of zzso stationary phase, and low zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This represents the first large-scale comprehensive characterization of the zzso zzso zzso Our analysis identified a total of zzso zzso zzso zzso In an effort to identify putative zzso zzso zzso factors, we then compared our zzso zzso results to those obtained in a previously published study of the zzso zzso zzso under similar conditions ( Adkins, zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 2006, 5, zzso zzso Comparative zzso analysis of zzso zzso strain zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso revealed a subset of highly expressed proteins unique to zzso zzso that were exclusively detected under conditions that are thought to mimic the zzso state in zzso zzso These proteins included zzso zzso and gene products of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The differential expression of zzso zzso and zzso was confirmed by Western zzso zzso When our observations are taken together with the current literature, they suggest that this subset of proteins may play a role in zzso zzso zzso and human host zzso
