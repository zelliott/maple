zzso zzso and zzso zzso treatment of zzso rat zzso cells increased the zzso zzso level and the expression of the zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso To delineate the possible role of zzso in the induction of zzso we examined the source of zzso zzso and associated signal zzso zzso with the use of zzso of zzso zzso zzso The inhibitor of neutral zzso zzso zzso inhibited the induction of zzso whereas inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso or that of zzso de zzso synthesis zzso zzso had no effect on the induction of zzso zzso zzso of zzso induction was reversed by the supplementation of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso production by neutral zzso zzso is a key zzso in the induction of zzso The zzso zzso of zzso gene expression correlated with the decrease in the activity of zzso zzso of zzso zzso promoter activity by dominant negative zzso supported the role of zzso in the zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso DNA binding activity and its zzso were also reduced by zzso zzso and were completely reversed by the supplementation of zzso As the dominant negative zzso also reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso may be downstream of zzso Our results suggest that zzso generated by zzso may be a critical zzso in the regulation of zzso gene expression via zzso zzso zzso under inflammatory zzso
