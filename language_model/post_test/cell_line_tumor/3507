We have recently completed a large phase III trial in advanced zzso cell lung cancer zzso in the elderly which showed that the combination of zzso zzso plus zzso zzso with zzso administered first, did not improve any outcome as compared with each single zzso 

The zzso efficacy of different sequences of administration of zzso and zzso was investigated in a small panel of zzso cell lines, by using an in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Treatment of lung cancer cells with zzso followed by zzso resulted in moderate zzso in one cell line zzso and in antagonism in two cell lines zzso and zzso However, treatment of zzso cells with zzso followed by zzso resulted in antagonism in all cell zzso 

The results of this study show that the zzso combination is not superior to both single agents against zzso cells, independently of the schedule of administration of the zzso
