zzso is a zzso that binds to a zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in various tumors and is considered as playing an important role in tumor growth and zzso The aim of this study is to investigate the expression of zzso in human zzso zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso derived from zzso and the expression of zzso in zzso zzso in relation to regulatory T zzso zzso expression was examined by zzso of tissue specimens from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso group comprised 6 patients (4 zzso women, zzso zzso aged zzso zzso zzso zzso and the control zzso group also had 6 patients (4 zzso women aged zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was also examined by zzso in zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso while zzso zzso expression was examined by in zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso was expressed in the zzso of zzso cells from all patients, but was not expressed in the control zzso zzso and zzso cells expressed zzso zzso but zzso cells did zzso zzso in zzso tissue zzso zzso had a zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed by a part of zzso zzso T cells that were located adjacent to the border of zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso contributed to zzso inflammation by inducing the zzso of zzso cells with regulatory T cell markers around zzso
