zzso is a known zzso protein that zzso zzso zzso Here we report that zzso also binds to the zzso region of zzso and enhances zzso cellular zzso We show that zzso zzso enhances the zzso of zzso while zzso suppression results in impaired zzso Furthermore, we found an increase in consolidated zzso formation in zzso cells zzso zzso on uniform stimulation with zzso zzso a specific zzso of zzso In most zzso cells, one to two zzso directed toward higher zzso concentration were found, whereas most zzso cells had multiple zzso The data indicate that zzso is involved in sensing and amplifying a shallow zzso zzso zzso that leads to a limited number of accurate zzso directed toward the zzso zzso In addition to its separate roles in zzso and zzso zzso zzso as a common regulator of these zzso possibly plays a crucial role in the recruitment of immune cells expressing these zzso
