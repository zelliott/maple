The clinical zzso of zzso gene therapy is limited by the lack of zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso the native binding site for zzso zzso viral zzso and increases systemic zzso zzso can be genetically engineered to target zzso cell surface zzso Here, we present a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso that demonstrated a marked targeting bias against zzso a zzso for head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso 

Cell surface expression of zzso was determined in six human zzso cell lines and in negative and positive control zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was assessed by zzso in zzso cells, and subsequent zzso expression was zzso The contribution of the zzso zzso in zzso targeted gene transfer was evaluated with a blocking zzso zzso efficacy in a mixed cell population was determined by zzso 

zzso cells had significantly higher zzso zzso density than control cell zzso After zzso zzso significant zzso was found between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicating that viral entry occurred via zzso zzso This unique zzso entry feature significantly enhanced gene transfer relative to an zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso has a dominant role in zzso zzso zzso selectivity was maintained in a cell mixture, producing greater zzso expression in zzso zzso 

The enhanced targeting achieved with zzso highlights a potential strategy for clinically zzso targeted gene therapy against zzso or any tumor type expressing zzso
