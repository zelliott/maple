zzso zzso is a zzso involved in inflammatory and wound healing processes that is zzso primarily by T helper type 17 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression is limited to zzso cells of the zzso zzso respiratory tract and zzso Most zzso originating in these sites zzso zzso Interestingly, there is an increase in zzso frequency within the peripheral blood and zzso zzso of advanced cancer zzso zzso zzso has been shown to display both zzso and zzso zzso Because many zzso lack expression of the zzso zzso the effects of zzso on zzso growth are generated by cells that surround the zzso zzso Like zzso high levels of zzso have been detected in zzso zzso and the peripheral blood of cancer zzso however, the direct effect of zzso on zzso cells has remained largely zzso In this report, we show that zzso zzso production of vascular zzso growth factor zzso and the zzso factor zzso in zzso zzso human pancreatic cancer zzso Additionally, zzso zzso zzso cell production of zzso zzso We show further that zzso zzso of zzso cells diminished T cell production of zzso zzso through the action of zzso zzso we show for the first time that zzso can fully protect cancer cells from natural killer zzso zzso zzso by stimulating zzso production of zzso and transforming growth factor zzso Our data support the idea that zzso may act to promote the zzso of zzso rather than function in zzso zzso
