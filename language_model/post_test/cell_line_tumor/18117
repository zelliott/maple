Studies in zzso models of cancer as well as in cancer patients have demonstrated that the immune response to cancer is often zzso This paradigm is viewed as one of the major mechanisms of tumor zzso Many therapies focus on employing the professional zzso presenting zzso cells zzso as a strategy to overcome immune zzso in cancer zzso Death zzso 6 zzso is an orphan member of the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso It is zzso on many tumor cells and zzso mice display altered zzso We investigated whether zzso plays a role in zzso by zzso affecting the generation of zzso zzso We show that zzso is uniquely zzso from the cell surface of tumor cell lines by the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is often zzso on tumor cells and is associated with zzso We also demonstrate that zzso of zzso zzso into DC die when the zzso domain of zzso is zzso In addition, zzso affects the cell surface zzso of the resulting immature DC and changes their zzso production upon stimulation with zzso The effects of zzso are mostly amended when these immature DC are matured with zzso as measured by cell surface zzso and their ability to present zzso These results zzso zzso and zzso as a mechanism tumor cells can employ to actively escape detection by the immune system by affecting the generation of zzso presenting zzso
