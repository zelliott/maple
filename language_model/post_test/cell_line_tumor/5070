zzso zzso zzso is a highly zzso disease, and prior attempts to develop zzso zzso for zzso have yielded highly divergent results, indicating difficulty in identifying unified molecular zzso We performed a zzso of gene expression profiles in data sets from eight independent patient zzso across the zzso In addition, aiming to establish the real world zzso of a zzso system, we zzso 118 zzso zzso zzso from an additional patient zzso A total of zzso patients were zzso representing the major zzso of zzso zzso B and zzso collected from Western and Eastern zzso We observed three robust zzso zzso zzso S1, zzso and zzso each correlated with clinical parameters such as tumor size, extent of cellular zzso and serum zzso zzso An analysis of the components of the signatures indicated that zzso reflected zzso zzso of the zzso signaling pathway, zzso was characterized by proliferation as well as zzso and zzso zzso and zzso was associated with zzso zzso zzso studies indicated that the zzso zzso zzso signature characteristic of zzso tumors was not simply the result of zzso zzso but rather was the result of transforming growth zzso zzso thus representing a new mechanism of zzso zzso zzso in zzso These experiments establish the first consensus zzso framework for zzso based on gene expression profiles and highlight the power of zzso multiple data sets to define a robust molecular zzso of the zzso
