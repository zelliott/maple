zzso human zzso zzso factor zzso has been produced in several different cell types, and has different properties depending on the production process zzso There has been no report of zzso ratio or of the role of zzso for plant zzso zzso We investigated the terminal zzso of zzso produced in rice cells zzso using zzso zzso ratios of zzso and zzso zzso zzso were evaluated by chemical zzso After intravenous administration to rats, the clearance rates of zzso and zzso as well as zzso forms of them were zzso In zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were measured in zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso does not have terminal zzso zzso the zzso ratio was zzso higher than that of zzso and zzso sustained longer than zzso in the blood zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso have almost same zzso via zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was cleared faster than native forms, while zzso zzso and zzso were similarly cleared in blood zzso These results suggest that the zzso on zzso are superior to the zzso on zzso in terms of in zzso zzso
