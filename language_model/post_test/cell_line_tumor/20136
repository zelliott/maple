zzso zzso zzso is a rare primary zzso liver tumor with an extremely poor zzso Recently its zzso has increased, however, little attention has been directed to factors related to its molecular zzso including zzso tumor zzso genes and cell zzso zzso zzso is generally characterized by strong zzso invasion and early zzso These biological behaviors of zzso with respect to the genetic and molecular aspects, remain to be zzso In this study, we performed a zzso analysis to identify the zzso zzso associated with zzso of zzso zzso expression profiles of zzso cases of zzso were compared with those of adjacent zzso zzso duct zzso Among the 151 protein spots that showed a statistically significant expression difference ( zzso there were 50 spots with significantly increased intensity zzso zzso and 17 spots with decreased intensity zzso zzso in zzso zzso Of these, increased expression of fatty zzso protein 5 zzso was further confirmed by western zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso expression in tumor specimens obtained from 43 patients with zzso zzso type zzso showed a positive correlation of zzso zzso with tumor size zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and staging zzso In addition, zzso zzso with short hairpin zzso zzso suppressed cell proliferation and zzso in zzso cells, and conversely, zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells increased cell proliferation and zzso Our study shows that zzso is significantly zzso in zzso combined zzso zzso zzso and is involved in cell proliferation and invasion zzso Our data suggest that zzso may be associated with tumor progression in zzso
