zzso of zzso quantum dots zzso in the life sciences are limited by their poor zzso stability in zzso media and zzso interaction with zzso particularly cell zzso We have studied zzso stability and zzso interactions with living cells for zzso zzso zzso zzso and the traditionally used zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and found clear advantages of zzso In single zzso zzso experiments, zzso showed no zzso over the zzso relevant pH range of 5-9, whereas zzso showed significant zzso below pH zzso Upon exposure to living zzso Mac 6 cells, zzso which possess overall zzso surfaces, exhibited weak interactions with the cell membrane and were easily removed by zzso with zzso By contrast, the highly charged zzso strongly associated with the cells and could not be removed even by extensive zzso with buffer zzso zzso exhibit a high chemical stability even in strongly zzso conditions, in contrast to zzso zzso reported zzso This beneficial property may arise from reduced interactions between zzso zzso due to zzso effects of the zzso groups on their zzso zzso
