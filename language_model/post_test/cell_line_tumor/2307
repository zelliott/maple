The zzso growth factor zzso signaling axis is increasingly implicated in zzso and zzso Several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are currently in clinical zzso however, the zzso activity of the most advanced of these agents is against the zzso insert domain zzso zzso which compromises the zzso zzso Here, we report the zzso profile of zzso a novel and selective inhibitor of the zzso 2, and 3 zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso and suppressed zzso signaling and growth in tumor cell lines with zzso zzso zzso In a representative zzso human tumor zzso model, oral administration of zzso was well tolerated and resulted in potent zzso zzso activity, consistent with plasma exposure and zzso zzso of tumor zzso zzso at zzso doses, no evidence of zzso effects were observed, confirming the in zzso zzso selectivity of zzso Taken together, our findings show that zzso is a novel selective zzso inhibitor of zzso with potent zzso activity against zzso tumors in zzso zzso zzso is under clinical investigation for the treatment of zzso zzso
