zzso of tumor zzso and zzso zzso factors is necessary for breast cancer invasion; therefore, identifying those zzso and factors is crucial not only to advancing our knowledge of breast cancer, but also to discovering potential therapeutic zzso By analyzing gene expression profiles of polarized and zzso human zzso zzso cells in a zzso relevant three-dimensional zzso culture system, we identified zzso orphan nuclear zzso alpha zzso as a zzso regulator of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso We showed that expression of zzso was zzso in human breast cancer tissue and cell lines, and that reduced zzso levels of zzso and zzso correlated with poor zzso zzso zzso expression zzso breast cancer cells to form zzso structures in zzso culture and inhibited tumor growth in nude mice, accompanied by enhanced zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso human zzso zzso cells inhibited zzso zzso and impaired polarized zzso zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso reporter zzso we showed that zzso of zzso is directly regulated by zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cancer cells rescued the aggressive zzso zzso and tumor zzso These findings indicate that zzso is a potential tumor zzso and zzso tumor invasion by inducing zzso cell zzso
