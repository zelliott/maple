The zzso zzso zzso is associated with poor prognosis in colon zzso Although zzso are involved in zzso defenses, production of zzso by tumor cells may permit zzso cells escape to zzso immune zzso To investigate interactions between zzso and tumor cells in humans, we cultured zzso isolated from patients and tested the effect of these zzso on the production of zzso by several tumor cell zzso zzso were isolated from zzso zzso of patients with zzso and from zzso control zzso We demonstrated that culture zzso of zzso from both sources strongly zzso zzso production by the three different human colon zzso cell lines, Colo zzso Colo zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso of zzso by colon tumor zzso zzso against zzso and zzso prevented the effect of zzso culture zzso and of zzso respectively, on the production of zzso by the three cell zzso zzso of zzso and colon cancer cells showed that these tumor cells first zzso zzso to produce zzso which was then followed by zzso zzso production by colon cancer zzso Finally, we showed that zzso gene regulation was zzso by zzso which was zzso after the binding of zzso to zzso This is the first demonstration that zzso zzso by zzso can induce a zzso zzso production by colon tumor zzso
