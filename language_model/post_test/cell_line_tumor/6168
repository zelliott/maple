The ability of PET to image functional changes in tumors is increasingly being used to evaluate response and predict clinical benefit to conventional and novel cancer zzso Although the use of zzso PET is well established, zzso zzso PET has potential advantages as a more specific marker of cellular zzso zzso signaling is frequently zzso in cancer and is therefore an attractive therapeutic zzso zzso zzso is a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor with zzso activity in a range of tumor zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the utility of PET of zzso metabolism and cell proliferation to monitor tumor response to zzso in 2 cell lines with zzso zzso zzso 

Mice bearing zzso or zzso zzso were evaluated for changes in tumor volume and zzso and zzso zzso after daily oral treatment with up to 50 zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells were treated with zzso in zzso and analyzed for zzso zzso and expression of activated zzso zzso and zzso by zzso 

Treatment of zzso zzso zzso with 50 zzso zzso caused tumor zzso that was associated with a slow reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso day zzso and reduced expression of the zzso zzso 1, zzso Although baseline zzso zzso into zzso tumors was substantially higher than in zzso tumors, zzso zzso into zzso tumors remained unchanged on treatment at 50 zzso zzso despite tumor growth zzso of zzso on day 8 of zzso These findings were confirmed in zzso where treatment of zzso cells with 1 zzso zzso had no zzso effect on zzso zzso Furthermore, these cells demonstrated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling as demonstrated by zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso Both zzso and zzso tumors showed high baseline zzso of zzso which was reduced by 50% and zzso on days 4 and 8 of treatment, zzso 

While the results provide a strong rationale to investigate the use of zzso PET as a clinical zzso for monitoring tumor response to zzso zzso zzso PET may be a less robust zzso
