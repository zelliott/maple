The mechanism of cell zzso plays an important role in tumor zzso resistance zzso zzso zzso zzso gene is an zzso of cell zzso and is closely related to tumor zzso This study was to explore the effect of zzso gene on the reversal of zzso of human zzso zzso zzso and related zzso 

The zzso expression zzso zzso zzso was constructed and zzso into human zzso cell line zzso zzso and zzso of zzso cells to zzso zzso were measured by zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso cells was zzso The expression of zzso zzso was detected by zzso The expression of zzso resistance gene 1 zzso zzso resistance related protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso II alpha zzso II zzso were detected by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso 

The growth of zzso zzso cells was obviously slower than that of zzso zzso After zzso with zzso the zzso of zzso cells to VCR was enhanced at the concentration of zzso zzso zzso 10, and 25 zzso The optimal concentration was zzso zzso After zzso zzso and VCR treatment, the number of zzso cells was zzso the cells were swollen severely with irregular zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso After zzso zzso the expression of zzso and zzso in zzso cells was zzso zzso and the expression of zzso II alpha was zzso 

zzso zzso gene raises zzso of zzso cells to zzso which may be partly related to the zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso II zzso
