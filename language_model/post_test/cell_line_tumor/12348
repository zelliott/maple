zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and the effects of zzso on migration were studied in one zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer cell lines, as well as in human zzso cells in primary zzso Additionally, the effects of zzso on zzso zzso and calcium zzso were addressed in zzso and zzso zzso All cell types expressed multiple zzso zzso zzso evoked zzso calcium zzso in primary cultures, zzso cells and zzso zzso Neither proliferation nor migration was affected in primary cultures, whereas zzso partly inhibited proliferation in zzso and zzso zzso Low zzso zzso of zzso inhibited migration in zzso zzso and zzso cells, but zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso which mediate migratory responses, were strongly expressed in zzso cells, and zzso which zzso migration, was the dominating zzso in the other cell zzso The migratory effect in zzso cells was zzso by zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso and the zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso at zzso However, zzso failed to stimulate migration, whereas the zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso zzso expression may enhance zzso cancer cell migration and thus contribute to the zzso zzso of some zzso zzso
