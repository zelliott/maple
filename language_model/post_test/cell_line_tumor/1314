The zzso zzso zzso has shown zzso properties in many cancer types by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso or Aurora zzso zzso expression of zzso has been linked to progression of human tumors, particularly prostate zzso However, little is known about the role of zzso or its mechanism of action in zzso zzso Here, we provide evidence that zzso is an zzso in zzso cancer zzso zzso expression of zzso caused enhanced zzso invasion, migration and resistance to several zzso zzso while zzso loss resulted in slower zzso greater zzso and reduced zzso capability compared with control zzso zzso but not a zzso inactive zzso enhanced proliferation in immortalized zzso normal human zzso zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso A1 and prevented zzso A1 zzso leading to zzso of zzso A1 by a block in zzso zzso expression of wild type zzso but not an inactive zzso zzso resulted in zzso A1 zzso and increased cell zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso and zzso an important cell cycle regulator, zzso zzso raising the possibility of zzso targeting as a therapeutic strategy against zzso tumors in combination with zzso
