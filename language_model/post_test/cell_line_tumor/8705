To study the transport mechanism of zzso of zzso zzso extracts and the effect of Angelica zzso extracts on the zzso zzso of zzso by using zzso cell zzso model, in order to analyze the effect mechanism of Angelica zzso extracts on the zzso zzso of zzso 

The zzso cell zzso model was established with human zzso zzso cells, and used to study the effect of zzso time, drug concentration and temperature on the transport of zzso in zzso zzso zzso the effect of zzso and zzso zzso zzso on the zzso transport of zzso in zzso cell model, and the effect of zzso root extracts on zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso was absorbed well at 37 degrees C and under pH zzso condition and concentration zzso Its proteins became inactive at 4 degrees C, with a low zzso The zzso transfer zzso was zzso zzso After zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso were added, the value of zzso of zzso zzso but without any difference in zzso The transport of zzso was improved by zzso zzso and zzso times, after zzso zzso extract zzso volatile oil, and mixture of zzso and volatile zzso 

The transport mechanism of zzso is mainly passive transfer and supplemented with zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso extracts can enhance the zzso of zzso which may be related to the passive transfer zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso effect in opening the close junction among cells may be related to its expression or function in zzso zzso zzso
