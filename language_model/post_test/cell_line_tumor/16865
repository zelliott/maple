zzso zzso the movement of zzso particles in a zzso electric field, is of particular interest due to its ability to manipulate particles based on their unique electrical zzso zzso zzso zzso is an extension of traditional and zzso zzso zzso The devices consist of a sample channel and fluid zzso channels filled with a highly zzso zzso A thin insulating membrane between the sample channel and the fluid zzso channels serves to isolate the sample from direct contact with metal zzso Here we zzso for the first time, the properties of zzso devices in which the sample and zzso channels occupy distinct zzso zzso are conducted using commercially available finite element software and a less zzso demanding zzso approximation is presented and zzso We show that devices can be created that achieve a similar level of electrical performance to other zzso devices presented in the literature while increasing fluid zzso We zzso based on these models, that the ultimate limiting factors in device performance resides in breakdown zzso of the barrier material and the ability to generate zzso zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrate zzso of zzso breast cancer cells in a zzso device at a flow rate of zzso zzso when 250 zzso at 600 zzso is zzso
