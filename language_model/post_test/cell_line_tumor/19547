The zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in the growth and progression of breast zzso zzso of zzso or the high activity of zzso signal zzso has been related with increases in cell proliferation and a poor prognosis in patients with breast zzso Several human breast cancer cell lines depend on zzso for their zzso zzso may bypass the requirement of zzso for the proliferation of breast cancer zzso To evaluate this hypothesis, zzso breast cancer cells were zzso with zzso and the effects on cell zzso signal zzso and cell cycle progression were zzso The results demonstrate that zzso stimulation in the absence of others growth factors induced a modest effect on cell proliferation and the induction of a cellular arrest in the zzso phase of the cell zzso Although zzso of zzso and zzso proteins were zzso this zzso was insufficient to support of cell cycle zzso Cellular arrest in zzso phase was accompanied by an increase in zzso zzso down regulation of the zzso zzso induction of zzso and zzso an imprinted tumor zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso by itself is not sufficient for the proliferation of breast cancer cells and suggest the existence of a mechanism that zzso zzso upon zzso zzso
