The purpose of the present study was to investigate the usefulness of the zzso complex with zzso and zzso acid zzso which are zzso materials for foods and medical products, as a safe gene delivery zzso We formed zzso zzso complexes zzso DNA zzso zzso with high zzso zzso The zzso complex showed slight toxicity probably related to its total zzso zzso Then, we formed zzso complexes zzso zzso by addition of zzso zzso zzso and they showed no zzso The zzso efficiency of the zzso complexes was as high as that of the zzso complexes, although their zzso zzso were zzso zzso study of the gene expressions in zzso cells suggested that zzso complexes were taken up by zzso zzso and zzso On the other hand, zzso complexes were taken up by zzso zzso and zzso Thus, we succeeded in developing the zzso complex as a safe gene delivery zzso with zzso zzso
