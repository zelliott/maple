To validate whether the zzso effect of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso is zzso through regulating zzso zzso zzso 

The expression levels of zzso in zzso zzso and varied zzso cells were zzso by real-time zzso zzso zzso was zzso into zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso The effect of zzso zzso on proliferation and zzso of zzso and zzso cells was evaluated using zzso kit and flow zzso zzso The zzso segments of zzso containing the zzso binding sites were amplified by zzso and the zzso activity in the zzso cells was zzso zzso zzso level was zzso using zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso were detected using Western zzso 

In comparison with the expression level of zzso in zzso zzso or Chang liver cell, the expression level in zzso zzso or varied zzso cells was significantly decreased zzso zzso of zzso significantly inhibited the proliferation zzso and promoted the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the protein levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso suppressed the zzso activity of the zzso by approximately 50% compared with the negative control, while zzso or removal of the zzso binding site using zzso or zzso inhibitor blocked the zzso effect zzso 

zzso expression is zzso in human zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso cell growth and promotes the cell zzso by affecting zzso zzso zzso
