Before delivery to zzso portions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are assembled into zzso We demonstrate that such complexes are also present in zzso of cultured zzso To study the formation and properties of the complexes, we zzso zzso and zzso from culture media of zzso zzso cells that were infected with zzso bearing the respective zzso The biological activity of zzso was demonstrated by its zzso zzso to zzso D and that of zzso was demonstrated by feeding to zzso cultured cells that corrected the storage of radioactive zzso In gel zzso zzso behaved as an zzso and zzso as a zzso zzso altered the zzso of zzso such that the latter was shifted into zzso zzso zzso did not change the zzso of mature zzso zzso Using surface zzso resonance and an immobilized zzso zzso binding of zzso was demonstrated under neutral and zzso zzso zzso At pH zzso specific binding appeared to involve more than one binding site on a zzso zzso The zzso of the first site was characterized by a zzso of zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and also the activity of zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso behaved as a zzso yielding zzso and zzso and smaller zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso forms zzso that are capable of binding zzso spontaneously and independent of the zzso type zzso but not capable of binding mature zzso zzso In addition to binding zzso zzso behaves as an zzso and processing zzso and its binding partner as an zzso and zzso
