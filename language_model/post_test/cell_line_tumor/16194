zzso cell zzso zzso is an zzso zzso and plays an important role in the regulation of zzso T zzso Little is known, however, about the role of zzso in zzso T zzso In this study, we investigated the expression and function of zzso in human zzso T zzso zzso of zzso was rapidly induced in primary zzso T cells following zzso zzso and the zzso zzso T cells produced zzso When zzso zzso T cells were zzso with zzso cells with and without programmed cell death zzso zzso zzso the levels of zzso production and zzso in response to zzso zzso cells were diminished compared to the levels seen in response to zzso zzso zzso The attenuated zzso functions were reversed by zzso zzso When zzso zzso T cells were challenged by zzso tumors zzso with zzso zzso which induced zzso zzso zzso the resulting reduction in zzso production was only slight to moderate compared to the reduction seen when zzso zzso T cells were challenged by zzso zzso In addition, zzso activity of zzso zzso T cells against zzso zzso tumors was comparable to that against zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso triggering may partially overcome the zzso effect of zzso in zzso T zzso
