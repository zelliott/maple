zzso zzso in zzso zzso of the breast is a zzso group of zzso cellular zzso that have the potential to become zzso Very little is known about the molecular zzso involved in the progression from zzso to invasive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso and has been implicated in modulating zzso binding growth factor zzso zzso and zzso However, the role of zzso in breast cancer progression is poorly zzso zzso cells zzso as zzso express zzso and form zzso type zzso and progress to zzso when transplanted in zzso mice and, therefore, is an ideal model to study breast cancer zzso We evaluated the role of zzso in progression from zzso to zzso using mouse fat pad zzso zzso 

zzso control zzso and zzso zzso in zzso breast cancer cells were achieved by zzso zzso and two different zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso were established by injecting zzso and zzso deficient zzso cells in mouse zzso fat zzso zzso were subjected to zzso zzso for zzso analysis, zzso and zzso zzso zzso (to determine the extent of zzso Western zzso analysis and zzso 

Using a mouse zzso fat pad derived zzso model, we observed that compared to control treated zzso zzso of zzso was associated with significant delays in growth at Week 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso examination of the tumors demonstrated substantial differences in zzso zzso with marked zzso zzso and zzso of zzso markers zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 3 in zzso depleted zzso Furthermore, zzso depleted zzso retained the basement membrane integrity with decreased activity and expression of zzso zzso 9 zzso an zzso critical for degradation of zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso 

Our data suggest that zzso expression may be critical for human breast cancer zzso zzso of zzso leads to retention of zzso type zzso and delays the progression of zzso to zzso Further studies are necessary to determine if therapeutic targeting of zzso expression might delay the progression of zzso to zzso
