zzso amplification occurs in approximately zzso of human zzso and is associated with early tumor progression and poor outcome, despite intensive zzso zzso However, zzso zzso also zzso zzso cells to zzso Thus, uncovering the molecular mechanisms linking zzso to zzso might contribute to designing more efficient therapies for zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso to zzso requires zzso of zzso and its zzso at zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso accumulates on zzso zzso and its depletion by zzso interference zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso a DNA damage response that accounts for the zzso of zzso degradation through an zzso and zzso zzso zzso by the rare occurrence of zzso zzso and by the broad expression of zzso in our human zzso series, we evaluated the effects of the zzso compound zzso on this zzso At zzso from other tumor zzso in zzso zzso zzso further induced zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and in combination with zzso agents zzso virtually the entire cell zzso Altogether, our data uncover a novel mechanism linking zzso to zzso that can be triggered by the zzso compound zzso supporting its use in the most zzso subset of zzso
