The WW zzso zzso zzso gene encodes a tumor zzso We have previously shown that targeted zzso of the zzso gene in mouse increases the zzso of spontaneous and chemically induced zzso To investigate zzso function in zzso we examined zzso zzso mice for zzso zzso zzso mice are significantly reduced in size, die at the age of 2-3 weeks, and suffer a zzso disorder that affects the zzso zzso mice exhibit a delay in bone formation from a cell autonomous zzso in differentiation beginning at the zzso stage shown in zzso zzso ex zzso and supported by significantly decreased bone formation parameters in zzso mice by zzso zzso zzso zzso mice develop zzso bone disease, as a consequence of reduced serum zzso zzso and zzso leading to increased zzso activity and bone zzso Interestingly, we find zzso physically associates with zzso the principal zzso regulator of zzso zzso and on zzso zzso We show zzso functionally suppresses zzso zzso ability in zzso In breast cancer zzso cells that lack zzso zzso zzso restoration of zzso expression inhibited zzso and zzso target genes related to zzso zzso zzso profiling revealed common gene targets in multiple zzso In zzso mice, genes related to zzso assembly and cell growth genes were zzso and negative regulators of skeletal metabolism exhibited increased zzso Our results demonstrate an essential requirement for the zzso tumor zzso in zzso survival, growth, and metabolism and suggest a central role for zzso in regulation of bone tissue zzso
