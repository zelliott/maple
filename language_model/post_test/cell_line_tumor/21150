zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso factors zzso with a restricted expression zzso It has so far been detected predominantly in skeletal zzso where, zzso zzso it regulates the expression of the zzso zzso zzso Here we show that, in contrast to zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in a variety of human zzso zzso zzso expression pattern in these cells correlated completely with that of zzso but not with that of other zzso A similar correlation in the expression pattern of zzso and zzso transcripts was detected in distinct types of 70 primary neural tumors, such as zzso zzso but not in others, such as zzso In zzso cells, zzso is directly involved in the regulation of zzso zzso as shown by zzso and zzso factor binding zzso demonstrating that zzso interacts with a zzso motif present in the human zzso zzso zzso of zzso was thus accompanied by a reduction of both zzso zzso and protein levels by at least zzso dependent on the zzso tumor cell line zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso aimed at finding other potential target genes of zzso in zzso tumor cells, revealed the presence of bone zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, their expression patterns only partially overlap with that of zzso These data suggest a functional contribution of zzso zzso expression to zzso tumor zzso
