Sonic zzso zzso signaling plays major roles in embryonic development and has also been associated with the progression of certain zzso Here, zzso family members act directly as long range zzso and their ability to do so has been linked to the formation of freely zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso In this work we demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso from zzso sources, such as mouse zzso and primary chick zzso consists of zzso zzso that are zzso by zzso zzso and reducing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vary in molecular weight and possess elevated biological activity if compared with zzso Sonic zzso zzso However, zzso can also undergo zzso zzso via a zzso zzso zzso mechanism in zzso and HS isolated from different sources differs in its ability to mediate zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso directed against zzso zzso activity strongly decrease the amount of zzso zzso zzso These findings reveal an zzso ability of the zzso zzso zzso signaling domain to form biologically active, zzso zzso zzso and a novel HS function in this zzso zzso We suggest that in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling via enhanced protein signaling zzso
