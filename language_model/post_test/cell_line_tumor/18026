zzso growth factor zzso b zzso has been detected in human clinical zzso related zzso including zzso prostate zzso There are, however, few relevant experimental zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to neutralize zzso and inhibit the growth of zzso mouse zzso zzso cells in zzso and in zzso In the present study, we evaluated the zzso activity of zzso against zzso and zzso progression of zzso human prostate cancer zzso 

zzso zzso was zzso into zzso human prostate cancer cell line zzso and its zzso tumors were established zzso in zzso mice with or without zzso zzso at the dose of 400 zzso was injected twice zzso 

zzso zzso cells zzso zzso showed enhanced level of zzso zzso and showed more potent growth properties than zzso cells in zzso and in zzso zzso reduced these properties in zzso inhibited zzso in zzso zzso and showed zzso activity against established tumors zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso tumors were zzso However, they recurred as zzso zzso positive tumors after zzso zzso also inhibited the growth of established zzso tumors in the zzso states zzso 

These results indicate that humanized zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso are a promising candidate for therapy of zzso clinical prostate zzso zzso studies using zzso models with clinical zzso tumors are required to validate these early zzso
