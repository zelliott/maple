zzso targeting by zzso is largely limited by the zzso and zzso transport zzso In this article, we describe the use of a delivery zzso in which zzso served as a convenient bridge between a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso to improve the delivery of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso with a base sequence zzso to the zzso zzso and its sense control were incorporated separately into zzso along with zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso zzso were zzso zzso to both normal and nude mice bearing zzso breast tumor zzso The zzso showed much higher normal tissue levels for the zzso zzso independent of zzso or sense or zzso or zzso when administered as the zzso compared to zzso A statistically significant higher zzso of both zzso zzso compared to the respective sense control zzso was observed, along with much higher tumor zzso compared to historical naked zzso This study has provided evidence that the in zzso function of an zzso zzso within the zzso zzso is not zzso and, as such, the zzso zzso may be suitable for in zzso tumor delivery of zzso zzso and other zzso
