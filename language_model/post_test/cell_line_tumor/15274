Early reports suggested that zzso a member of the focal zzso zzso regulates cell zzso Here we investigated whether zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso progression and zzso We examined zzso expression in human zzso samples using zzso and western zzso The functional and molecular effect of zzso was studied in zzso by zzso in a zzso zzso cell line, as well as repression in a zzso cell zzso The in zzso effect of zzso repression was studied in zzso diabetic and severe combined zzso zzso We found that zzso was frequently zzso in human zzso patients and its zzso positively correlated with tumor size, stage, and zzso zzso expression also correlated with the zzso potential of zzso cell zzso zzso zzso induced the invasion and migration ability of zzso zzso cells, whereas zzso of zzso reverted the invasive zzso and zzso potential of zzso zzso cells through regulating the protein expression of certain focal zzso proteins including zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as regulating the zzso transition zzso Furthermore, there was a close association between zzso and zzso zzso cells with stronger zzso expression showed a higher zzso level, whereas zzso repression attenuated zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso enhanced the zzso of zzso cells towards zzso treatment by way of a collective result of suppression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso target of zzso pathways and zzso of zzso 

This study provides concrete evidence of a significant role of zzso in zzso progression and zzso by way of regulation of cell zzso and zzso an zzso transition process, and zzso to zzso zzso
