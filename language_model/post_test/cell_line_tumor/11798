zzso is a natural zzso zzso with significant zzso activity against many types of cancer cells, including zzso zzso This study investigated the molecular mechanisms by which zzso differently affects cell growth of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso analogue zzso human zzso cancer zzso The results show that zzso suppresses the growth of zzso cells more than the sensitive counterparts, by interfering with the expression of folate cycle zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, the impairment of the folate cycle also seems partly zzso to a reduced zzso of zzso a vitamin which plays an essential role in the zzso of zzso acids and zzso zzso This effect was observed in both lines, but especially in the resistant cells, zzso again with the reduced tolerance to this zzso zzso The data also indicate that zzso zzso cellular growth by affecting zzso zzso in particular through the zzso of the key zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this regard, zzso is shown to stimulate the zzso induction by the zzso analogue zzso zzso zzso zzso which alone was also able to zzso zzso zzso more than zzso zzso We report that the sensitivity of resistant cells to zzso or to zzso is reverted to the levels of sensitive cells by the zzso with zzso These data confirm the intimate zzso between folate cycle and zzso pathways and suggest that this zzso plant zzso could be a useful zzso therapeutic agent in the treatment of zzso zzso
