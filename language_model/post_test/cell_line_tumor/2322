To date, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has not been studied from a zzso point of zzso In the present work, aerial components of zzso zzso from Italy, were examined to assess their zzso and zzso activity on human melanoma zzso A relationship between zzso zzso activities and chemical composition has also been zzso 

zzso and fatty acid content in zzso zzso leaves, bark and woody parts were examined and compared by zzso zzso and zzso zzso content was also zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso test were used to assess zzso activities, and zzso zzso was used to evaluate zzso activity, on zzso human melanoma cells, after zzso with a UVA dose of zzso zzso 

zzso demonstrated the best zzso and zzso activity in comparison to bark and zzso In particular, leaves were shown to possess the highest zzso activity and zzso of zzso with zzso values of 64 and zzso zzso zzso The leaves had highest zzso activity with zzso value of zzso zzso The zzso investigation revealed different composition between the zzso zzso and zzso fatty zzso zzso and zzso content among plant zzso 

Data obtained indicate that this type of zzso tree may constitute an excellent source of zzso compounds, such as zzso zzso and fatty zzso This study offers a new perspective in developing others zzso potentially useful in zzso therapy for treatment of zzso skin zzso
