Human zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso that is involved in cell migration, tumor cell invasion and zzso Our recent study of oral zzso cell zzso zzso demonstrated that the degree of zzso expression of zzso was correlated with the severity of zzso zzso and significantly associated with a poor zzso grade of zzso Furthermore, it has been reported that zzso directly associates with the zzso growth factor zzso zzso in zzso cells upon stimulation with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acting downstream of zzso and zzso to promote cell zzso However, the molecular function of zzso remains zzso In this study we performed real-time zzso Western zzso and scratch zzso using zzso cell lines in order to clarify the molecular biological function of zzso expression associated with various growth factors including zzso and with the zzso signaling zzso zzso was found to have a marked influence on cancer cell migration and the expression of zzso zzso zzso in the oral cavity upon stimulation with zzso zzso promotes oral cancer cell migration, and the zzso zzso is one of the possible mechanisms responsible for progression of cancer in the oral zzso
