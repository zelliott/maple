zzso is a zzso factor essential for definitive zzso In all zzso the zzso gene is transcribed from two zzso a zzso promoter zzso and a zzso promoter zzso We previously found that zzso expression in a specific zzso cell population in zzso zzso depends on zzso Here we show that zzso zzso is directly bound by zzso and zzso binding factor zzso at the zzso and zzso zzso and within the zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in the zzso lateral zzso and influences promoter use, while zzso zzso its expression in the newly emerging cells of the tail zzso The zzso binding sites for zzso and zzso coincide with zzso modifications that zzso zzso properties, and two of the zzso sites behaved as zzso in an in zzso zzso The identified zzso and zzso binding sites are likely to be zzso elements zzso for zzso since they also recruit zzso zzso II zzso zzso depletion excluded zzso from two zzso zzso but not the promoters of zzso We propose that zzso and zzso have distinct functions in the regulation of zzso during zzso zzso and that these regulatory functions are likely to involve zzso zzso zzso zzso (but not zzso depletion enhanced zzso expression in a human leukemia cell line, suggesting conservation of zzso regulation through zzso
