zzso zzso is a potent zzso drug that has been found to be effective against several tumor types, including cervical zzso However, the exact mechanism underlying the zzso effects of zzso is poorly zzso Here, zzso induced the zzso of cervical cancer zzso cells and correlated with the enhanced zzso of zzso and zzso which was strongly inhibited by zzso small interfering zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso factor 3 zzso cells, zzso enhanced zzso through increased alpha and beta zzso expression of zzso however, these events were attenuated in cells containing inactive zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso expression did not change in zzso or zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso into the nucleus where zzso is zzso but not in zzso or zzso zzso zzso As confirmed by the zzso pull-down zzso zzso bound to the zzso domain of zzso resulting in the zzso of zzso or zzso transcription, a downstream target of zzso zzso of zzso prolonged the zzso of zzso by zzso its zzso and thereby enhancing its zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, zzso induced by zzso zzso the stability of zzso not its zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses show that zzso and zzso are recruited directly to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso these results reveal that zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells, at least in part, by enhancing zzso stability and its zzso zzso The investigation shows that zzso may function as a zzso factor through direct regulatory effects on zzso suggesting a functional link between zzso and zzso
