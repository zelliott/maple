During an acute phase response, zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression of the three zzso zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso in liver and lung zzso however, little zzso lung expression zzso Recently, we showed that the magnitude of zzso binding to three zzso motifs on the human zzso promoter zzso zzso with their functional activity in zzso although these zzso are critical for promoter zzso We determined the role of zzso signaling in zzso zzso of the zzso promoter in liver and lung zzso zzso Although zzso induced zzso promoter activity approximately zzso in zzso cells, it was increased only zzso in lung zzso zzso zzso production of zzso was demonstrated in both cell types by Western zzso however, lower production of both zzso and zzso explains, in part, reduced activity of the zzso promoter in lung zzso zzso zzso zzso induction of the zzso promoter zzso in both zzso and zzso cells for a combined increase in promoter activity of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso is likely due to the induction of zzso expression as well as prolonged intensity and duration of zzso zzso By zzso zzso signaling with zzso expression of the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso induced zzso promoter activity zzso in zzso zzso Together, the data suggest zzso differences in zzso zzso thereby limiting the extent of zzso zzso and zzso expression during lung zzso
