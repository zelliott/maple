The zzso zzso zzso signaling axis has emerged as a promising target for cancer therapy, zzso to its vital role in tumor zzso and zzso We have previously reported the regulation of zzso zzso cancer zzso invasion and migration by zzso and the implication of zzso axis in zzso acid zzso zzso zzso However, the expression profile of zzso and zzso in zzso their association with tumor zzso and their regulation by zzso remain zzso 

In this study, we examined the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in established zzso cell lines and assessed their correlation with cell zzso Moreover, using an zzso cancer tissue zzso zzso we analyzed zzso expression across a panel of 48 zzso with different disease stages and zzso zzso We also tested the effect of zzso on zzso and zzso expression and examined whether blocking zzso by zzso interference zzso affects zzso zzso zzso 

We show that zzso and zzso expression zzso with cell zzso and zzso expression in zzso cancer zzso correlate with tumor zzso In addition, zzso at 20 zzso significantly induced the expression of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso cells ( zzso zzso small interference zzso zzso zzso remarkably decreased zzso zzso effect ( zzso in zzso cells without significantly decreasing zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso significantly decreases both the zzso level cell invasion and zzso invasion promoting effect ( zzso 

These results suggest that decreasing zzso expression by zzso may prove to be an effective method to reduce the zzso potential of zzso cells exposed to elevated levels of zzso
