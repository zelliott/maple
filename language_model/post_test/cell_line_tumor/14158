A direct relationship exists between aging and increasing zzso of chronic zzso In fact, with most zzso diseases individuals manifest an underlying chronic inflammatory state as evidenced by local zzso of inflammatory cells, such as zzso and higher circulatory levels of zzso zzso complement components and zzso zzso zzso treatment with zzso agents provide symptomatic relief to several zzso diseases, even as remote as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease, indicating that chronic inflammation may play a substantial role in the zzso of these disease zzso The molecular mechanisms underlying this chronic inflammatory condition during cellular zzso is presently zzso Cellular damage by oxygen free zzso is a primary driving force for aging and increased zzso of zzso zzso factors, such as zzso that regulate the expression of zzso zzso has been documented in aged zzso versus their young zzso Human zzso zzso zzso a zzso degradation zzso shown to be zzso during differentiation and cellular zzso may represent a molecular link between aging and its associated zzso zzso promotes zzso oxygen species zzso production, activates the zzso zzso and zzso the production of zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso In these zzso zzso of zzso may represent a novel molecular target for intervening in zzso chronic zzso
