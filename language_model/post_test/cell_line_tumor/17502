To develop a zzso targeting zzso zzso for drug delivery based on active targeting technology zzso by zzso zzso 

Four types of targeting molecules with zzso zzso were zzso and mixed with zzso lipids zzso to prepare zzso with integrated property of zzso specificity and pH zzso zzso zzso was selected with the best zzso activity through cellular zzso zzso Property analysis was made through experiments of competitive zzso of zzso red blood cell zzso in zzso zzso test by zzso zzso and mediation of zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso on gene zzso zzso 

zzso zzso had the desired properties of zzso zzso pH sensitivity, low zzso and high zzso zzso 

zzso zzso can be further developed as a potential zzso targeting delivery zzso
