A common zzso in breast cancer is the expansion of the zzso zzso zzso cell population and an inappropriate zzso of zzso zzso the latter zzso patients for a poorer prognosis than those with lower levels of the zzso A zzso zzso zzso model was developed in the zzso cell line to assess induction of zzso gene zzso and growth in response to zzso in zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso resulted in zzso promoter occupancy and gene zzso in the absence of hormone, which was independent of zzso and zzso zzso This increased zzso activity required the zzso zzso domain and was not inhibited by zzso which supports an enhancement of zzso function, yet was independent of zzso zzso and 118 zzso zzso zzso was accompanied by an increase in growth in the absence of hormonal zzso The results suggest that elevated levels of zzso in breast cancer cells can result in zzso of zzso zzso function in a manner distinct from classical mechanisms that involve zzso binding or growth zzso zzso Further, they describe a potential mechanism zzso increases in zzso concentration may provide a zzso advantage by zzso zzso function regardless of zzso zzso
