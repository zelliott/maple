Recent studies have reported that elevated levels of zzso in different types of zzso The mechanisms underlying its abnormal regulation in cancer cells remain, however, zzso Here, we have examined the relationship between zzso and zzso a gene previously associated with zzso of zzso While zzso and protein analyses revealed a consistent and irreversible zzso of zzso throughout progression of lymphoma, no correlation with zzso was zzso In fact, most of the zzso cell lines expressing high levels of zzso did not express any zzso level of zzso although expressed zzso gene following zzso treatment, indicating that zzso was functional in these zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso analyses rather suggested that zzso expression was associated with changes in DNA zzso This conclusion was supported by data using zzso agent zzso Furthermore, disruption of the DNA zzso zzso and zzso induced zzso zzso our data suggest that abnormal expression of zzso in zzso cells is not dependent on zzso but is rather associated with DNA zzso
