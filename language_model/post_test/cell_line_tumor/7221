zzso cell invasion and zzso are the hallmark of zzso zzso Despite advances in the management of zzso zzso and other solid tumors, zzso continues to be the most significant cause in cancer zzso To gain new insights into this complex process in zzso zzso we established a zzso zzso cell line zzso with high zzso capacity to the lung by sequential passage of a human zzso zzso cancer cell line zzso through the lung of a nude zzso Global patterns of gene expression were analyzed in cells of the parental zzso and the zzso using zzso human cancer zzso array with zzso zzso zzso In total, 184 genes were zzso expressed more than zzso times, and 64 genes were zzso expressed over two zzso Among those 64 zzso 43 were zzso and 21 genes were zzso Many genes whose increased expression was thought to be related to tumor progression were identified, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The most highly expressed gene is the zzso zzso higher than zzso which is a member of a small calcium binding protein family and is involved in the cell proliferation and cancer zzso The zzso zzso in the zzso cells was later confirmed by Northern zzso and real-time reverse zzso Analysis of 49 zzso tumor specimens by real-time reverse zzso zzso benign zzso 36 zzso and five zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso was present in most advanced zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and was associated with poor zzso None of the benign zzso was found to have zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso could be used as a zzso marker for zzso zzso Given that zzso is involved in tumor progression and zzso it may be a potential target for therapeutic zzso
