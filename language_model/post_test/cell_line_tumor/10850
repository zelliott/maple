zzso therapies for zzso zzso cell zzso zzso including zzso target of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have produced clinical zzso However, most patients acquire resistance over zzso Thus, new therapeutic strategies need to be zzso Here, we evaluated the effect of the dual zzso inhibitor zzso in combination with the zzso inhibitor zzso on zzso cancer cell proliferation and survival in zzso as well as on tumor growth in zzso 

The zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso were treated with zzso or zzso either alone or in zzso zzso cell proliferation and zzso were investigated in zzso The zzso efficacy of zzso alone, or in combination with zzso was also evaluated on zzso zzso in nude zzso 

Treatment of zzso and zzso cells with zzso or zzso resulted in reduced tumor cell proliferation and increased tumor cell zzso in zzso The combination of zzso and zzso was more effective than each compound zzso Similarly, in zzso zzso or zzso reduced the growth of zzso generated from zzso or zzso zzso The zzso efficacy of zzso in combination with zzso was superior to zzso or zzso zzso 

Our findings indicate that the simultaneous use of zzso and zzso has greater zzso benefit compared to either drug alone and thus provides a treatment strategy in zzso
