The zzso zzso zzso stress response detects malfunctions in cellular zzso and microbial pattern recognition receptors recognize external threats posed by infectious zzso This study has investigated whether zzso zzso expression by zzso zzso cells is affected by the induction of zzso zzso zzso of zzso stress, in combination with zzso zzso zzso zzso markedly enhanced expression of zzso of the unique zzso zzso of zzso and also significantly zzso zzso of zzso zzso These effects were not seen for zzso zzso The zzso gene was found to be a target of the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso protein zzso which exhibited enhanced binding in the context of both zzso stress and zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells significantly reduced the synergistic effects of zzso and zzso stress on zzso zzso but did not affect expression of other zzso zzso The integration of zzso stress signals and the requirement for zzso in the induction of zzso responses was also investigated in a zzso zzso infection of zzso cells with zzso zzso resulted in the expression of zzso zzso and induced the binding of zzso to the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso significantly reduced the expression of zzso in response to this zzso zzso zzso the effects of pathogens and other environmental factors on zzso stress can profoundly affect the nature of innate and zzso immune zzso
