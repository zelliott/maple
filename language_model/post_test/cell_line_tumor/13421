To investigate the effect of zzso expression zzso zzso on the zzso cell cycle, zzso invasion and migration of human gastric zzso zzso cells in zzso 

The zzso expression zzso zzso was constructed and confirmed by zzso zzso and sequencing zzso Then, it was zzso into zzso cells via the zzso The expression of zzso zzso and protein was detected by zzso fluorescent zzso and Western zzso zzso The proliferation of zzso was tested by zzso the cell cycle and zzso rate by flow zzso and the effects of zzso on the cell invasion and migration by zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso expression zzso zzso was constructed successfully and zzso into zzso The expression of green fluorescent protein was observed using a zzso microscope and both zzso and protein of zzso was zzso by zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso revealed that the proliferation of zzso cells were significantly inhibited by zzso ( zzso zzso zzso indicated that the cells were arrested at zzso phase ( zzso and cell zzso was evidently inhibited ( zzso zzso chamber experiments showed that the abilities of both invasion and migration of the cells decreased by zzso ( zzso 

The zzso zzso the proliferation of human gastric zzso zzso cells, arrests cell cycle at zzso phase, decreases the abilities of invasion and migration and promotes zzso
