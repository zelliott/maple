Chemical and physical stimuli trigger a zzso response by first inducing the main zzso cells, zzso to produce specific zzso that are responsible for the initiation of skin zzso zzso zzso cell communication, namely zzso recruitment and zzso zzso through the selective barrier of the vascular zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we describe an in zzso model which takes into account the various steps of human skin zzso from zzso zzso to the zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso Human adult zzso were subjected to stress by exposure to zzso zzso or zzso then the zzso culture medium was used to mimic the natural zzso conditions for zzso zzso A relevant in zzso model must include appropriate cells from the zzso This is shown in the present study by the selective reaction of zzso zzso compared with zzso lines from distinct origins, in terms of zzso zzso sensitivity to stress and nature of the zzso zzso zzso This simplified model is suitable for the screening of zzso molecules whose activity requires the presence of various skin zzso
