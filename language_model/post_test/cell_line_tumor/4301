The main zzso driver in zzso leukemia is zzso which activates genes by forming zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment prevents zzso nuclear zzso but most genes with zzso sites are insensitive to zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that fewer than zzso of zzso sites show dynamic changes in zzso occupancy when zzso leukemia cells are zzso between the zzso and zzso states with zzso zzso Dynamic zzso sites are functional, being highly associated with zzso target zzso are located mainly in zzso zzso and frequently overlap with zzso zzso In line with the latter association, we show that expression of zzso a gene with key roles in normal zzso development and in zzso zzso is zzso regulated by zzso factors and dynamic zzso binding to zzso zzso Like zzso most zzso target genes and associated dynamic zzso sites zzso zzso zzso defined by zzso binding of zzso binding factor, which appears to restrict the regulatory potential of dynamic zzso zzso More zzso the majority of dynamic zzso sites lie in zzso zzso elements with exceptionally broad and high levels of zzso Changes in zzso occupancy produces dynamic zzso in zzso levels across the entire breadth of zzso and in the promoters of zzso target zzso These findings link regulation of zzso function to zzso a master regulatory factor and potent zzso in the context of immature T cells, and delineate a generally zzso zzso for identifying functional zzso sites in cellular zzso
