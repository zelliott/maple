Our laboratory recently reported that treatment with the zzso acid containing zzso zzso zzso zzso cell death in multiple myeloma cell zzso Because of the intriguing biological activity and promising in zzso activity of zzso we pursued strategies for increasing the therapeutic efficacy of the linear zzso These efforts led to a zzso zzso zzso with increased in zzso activity and robust in zzso activity as a single agent using two myeloma models that consider the bone zzso zzso zzso treatment similar to zzso induced zzso oxygen species, depleted zzso levels, and failed to activate zzso Moreover, zzso is zzso in zzso cells selected for acquired resistance to zzso Here, we pursued an unbiased chemical biology approach using zzso zzso affinity zzso and liquid zzso mass zzso analysis to identify binding partners of zzso Using this approach, zzso was identified as a zzso binding zzso zzso the expression of zzso was sufficient to induce cell death in multiple myeloma cell lines, indicating that multiple myeloma cells require zzso expression for zzso zzso expression of zzso correlated with increased binding of the zzso zzso However, zzso expression of zzso was not sufficient to increase the sensitivity to zzso cell zzso zzso we show that zzso cell death occurs via a zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso Finally, we show that zzso has robust activity as a single agent in the zzso bone implant and zzso in zzso model of multiple zzso
