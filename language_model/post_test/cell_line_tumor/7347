zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso that play a key role in the regulation of the cell cycle zzso In zzso cells, distinct zzso activated upon zzso with specific zzso and upon zzso zzso coordinate in an orchestrated way the appropriate transition between consecutive zzso of the cell zzso zzso expression or altered activity of distinct zzso complexes results in escape of cells from the cell cycle control and leads to zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso in zzso cells provides a new strategy in the fight against zzso Recently, selective zzso zzso targeting distinct zzso were zzso They represent promising zzso drugs due to their strong zzso efficacy combined with a relative low direct zzso The aim of this study was to compare the effect of two related zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on the cell cycle progression in human breast cancer zzso zzso Both examined zzso zzso zzso affected the cell cycle progression in zzso zzso Whereas zzso arrested cells in zzso zzso inhibited cells at S to zzso transition and increased the number of cells residing in the zzso Moreover, both zzso zzso modulated the cell cycle progression with distinct zzso zzso of zzso cells beginning 6 h after exposure of cells to zzso coincided with a strong zzso of the zzso Interestingly, zzso triggered zzso in zzso cells by zzso of zzso zzso Loss of the integrity of zzso membrane observed after exposure of cells to zzso for 6 h led to release of distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso inducing factor zzso In contrast to zzso zzso cell cycle changes could be detected after 12 h of the zzso zzso did not zzso zzso zzso It indicates that both examined zzso zzso are selective and block the cell cycle progression of human breast zzso cells at different zzso
