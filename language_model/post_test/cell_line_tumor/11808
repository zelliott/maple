Advanced zzso cancer responds poorly to most zzso New therapies and combinations are zzso The aim of this study was to examine both in zzso and in zzso activity of two relatively new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a variety of zzso zzso zzso zzso against a panel of nine human zzso cancer cell zzso 

The zzso activity and the effects of zzso zzso and their combinations on zzso cancer cells were determined by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso was assessed by the median effects model of zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso were active against the zzso cancer cell lines irrespective of their zzso zzso and zzso was effective in preventing growth of human zzso cancer zzso in zzso zzso Further studies showed that both zzso induced zzso zzso also elevated zzso zzso 3, zzso and zzso and decreased levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested both zzso modulated genes associated with the cell cycle, DNA damage and zzso Most of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were either inactive in zzso or were active only at high zzso However, the novel combinations of either zzso or zzso zzso with either zzso or zzso zzso inhibited cell growth of zzso cancer cells in zzso 

In zzso these zzso either alone or combined with selected zzso may have a role in treatment of aggressive zzso zzso
