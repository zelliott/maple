In the present study, we examined the ability of a zzso zzso to prevent zzso zzso oxygen radical formation and zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso had an acute significant zzso effect against the zzso (30 zzso oxygen radical formation in zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, in these cells, zzso at zzso zzso had a significant protective effect against zzso though at 100 zzso it was itself harmful to the zzso The possible effect of zzso in preventing zzso in unilateral zzso zzso bundle (full zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso rat zzso models of Parkinson's disease was studied in three treatment zzso a zzso zzso or zzso or their zzso zzso responses to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were assessed at weeks 1 and 2 zzso zzso had no consistent zzso effect in either model at zzso zzso once a day or 100 zzso twice a zzso Furthermore, no protection was observed in zzso zzso positive zzso cell numbers, zzso fiber density or in zzso levels of zzso These in zzso and in zzso results cast doubt on the theory that zzso exerts reliable zzso effects against zzso zzso In zzso zzso seems to be protective at low doses but damaging at high zzso
