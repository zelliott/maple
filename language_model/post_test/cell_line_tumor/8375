A central question in zzso signaling is the regulation of zzso zzso and zzso Multiple zzso including zzso alpha and zzso are involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso have been implicated in the regulation of zzso However, which zzso zzso zzso in zzso and how the specificity of zzso zzso is regulated are not zzso In this study, we show that zzso regulates zzso zzso and degradation in zzso We demonstrate that zzso is required for zzso signaling in zzso Moreover, we have identified zzso alpha as the regulatory zzso of zzso that controls zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso directly interacts with zzso zzso interference zzso of zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso and decreases zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso alpha enhances zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggest that zzso alpha specifically regulates zzso zzso zzso and plays an essential role in zzso zzso
