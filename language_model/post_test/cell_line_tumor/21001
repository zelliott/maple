zzso virus zzso infection in tumor cells is generally restricted to the zzso forms of viral zzso Switching the zzso form of viral infection into the zzso form may induce tumor cell zzso High levels of nuclear factor zzso can inhibit zzso zzso zzso and aspirin has the ability to inhibit zzso zzso The aims of the current study were to determine the effects of aspirin on inducing zzso zzso infection, and thus to reveal the possibility of targeting zzso cancer cells by zzso Our results showed that aspirin depleted zzso zzso in the nucleus and zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso exhibited decreased viability in a zzso and zzso manner when incubated with zzso When zzso was used in combination with aspirin to treat zzso zzso cells and zzso cells, the zzso effect of aspirin was zzso We demonstrated that aspirin reduced the viability of zzso B zzso due to its ability to induce zzso zzso zzso
