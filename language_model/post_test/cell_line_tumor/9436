To study the effects of two novel zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso discovered in 2 families of Alzheimer's disease zzso in China, on human zzso cells and the protective role of zzso growth zzso zzso 

Two zzso type zzso zzso genes with the zzso sites zzso and zzso were zzso These 2 zzso zzso wild type zzso zzso zzso and mock were zzso zzso into the human zzso cells of the line zzso The 4 kinds of zzso cells were divided into 3 zzso zzso control zzso cultured in normal medium with serum, zzso serum deprivation zzso cultured in the medium without serum, and zzso serum deprivation + IGF-1 zzso cultured in serum deprivation medium plus zzso zzso hours later zzso zzso was used to calculate the cell survival zzso zzso method and zzso zzso double zzso flow zzso were used to observe the cell zzso The zzso zzso was zzso Western zzso was used to analyze the protein expression of zzso zzso protein zzso in the cell zzso 

Different tests all showed that the cell survival rates of the zzso and zzso serum deprivation zzso were both significantly lower than those of the corresponding zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso the cell survival rates of the all serum deprivation + IGF-1 zzso were significantly higher than those of the corresponding serum deprivation zzso (all P zzso zzso The zzso zzso rate was not significantly different among different subgroups, but IGF-1 addition made the zzso zzso increase by about zzso (all P zzso zzso The zzso expression in the cell membrane of the serum deprivation + zzso zzso increased by zzso - zzso respectively, however, without significant zzso 

zzso sensitivity to zzso withdrawal in the cells with the two Chinese zzso zzso most likely contributes to the zzso loss in zzso The sensitivity to zzso is not caused by impaired zzso zzso but IGF-1 still can protect cells from serum deprivation that compensates the negative effect through enhancing zzso transport and zzso zzso
