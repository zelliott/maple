The role of NO and zzso signaling in tumor biology has been extensively studied during the past three zzso However, whether the zzso is beneficial or zzso in cancer is still open to zzso We suggest several reasons for this zzso first, although NO zzso in normal signaling zzso zzso and zzso NO is also a zzso or zzso zzso when produced at high zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso components may vary among different zzso and cell zzso Furthermore, solid tumors contain two zzso the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso supporting zzso including zzso zzso blood vessels, and inflammatory zzso with different NO zzso Thus, the zzso signaling molecules in tumors as well as the surrounding tissue must be further characterized before targeting this signaling zzso for tumor zzso In this review, we focus on the zzso expression in tumor and surrounding cells and summarized research outcome in terms of cancer zzso We propose that a normal function of the zzso signaling axis may be important for the prevention and/or treatment of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the tumor inflammatory zzso combined with zzso of the zzso signaling may be a favorable alternative to chemotherapy and zzso for zzso zzso
