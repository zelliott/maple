The zzso zzso DNA interaction and zzso behavior of new zzso zzso zzso complexes with nitrogen zzso are zzso Three series of zzso compounds of zzso zzso were zzso (with zzso 3- or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The crystal structures of zzso zzso and zzso were resolved and the characterization was completed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments were performed by zzso zzso to estimate the zzso potential of the zzso zzso The interaction with zzso zzso DNA was studied through the examination of the zzso mobility and atomic force zzso and interaction with zzso by circular zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies based on the zzso zzso zzso The zzso behavior of the series with zzso was zzso against two tumor cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso The results revealed a moderate zzso with a higher activity for the zzso cell line compared to the zzso zzso
