In a previous study, we demonstrated that zzso zzso implanted in zzso mice is eliminated by zzso administration of zzso zzso zzso Our results also suggested that the in zzso destruction of zzso cells by zzso lead to a robust zzso immune zzso In this work, zzso harvested from zzso animals treated with zzso zzso exhibited significantly higher zzso activity against tumor target cells than did those from zzso derived from control zzso In zzso zzso depletion experiments indicated that zzso T cells were essential for the zzso zzso activity of zzso Moreover, adoptive transfer of zzso obtained from mice cured of zzso by zzso zzso markedly delayed the tumor growth of previously established zzso in recipient zzso zzso These results confirmed that treatment with a zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso immunity against zzso that is mainly zzso by zzso zzso T zzso zzso mice, on the other hand, were zzso with zzso zzso cell zzso prior intravenous challenge with zzso zzso As a control, mice were vaccinated with either zzso zzso cell zzso alone or mixed with zzso or with PBS prior tumor cell zzso zzso showed that survival is significantly prolonged only in mice zzso with zzso tumor zzso This finding clearly suggested that in zzso zzso infection of zzso cells turns these cells into a potent tumor zzso Further studies in zzso treatment of zzso using attenuated zzso alone or in combination with zzso with zzso zzso should improve the probability for successful translation in the zzso
