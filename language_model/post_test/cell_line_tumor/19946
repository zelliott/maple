zzso mechanisms of prostate cancer progression are frequently studied in mice by zzso injection of aggressive cell lines, which yield primary tumors that spontaneously zzso to zzso zzso In this report, we characterized the human prostate zzso cell line zzso in an zzso system and evaluated the functional relevance of the zzso zzso a correlate of invasive human prostate cancer, to progression in this zzso To provide real-time insights into these zzso we first validated use of an zzso growth zzso zzso to illuminate zzso prostate tumors and their zzso in whole animal zzso Animals receiving zzso injections were tracked throughout a zzso zzso zzso sizes were correlated zzso with total zzso zzso of 22 prostate zzso In contrast to the highly zzso and zzso zzso cells, the zzso line was zzso zzso but not zzso despite larger tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso was successfully zzso in animals with zzso tumors on zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso did not alter growth zzso of primary zzso tumors, but all animals implanted with zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is implicated as an zzso of prostate cancer zzso zzso
