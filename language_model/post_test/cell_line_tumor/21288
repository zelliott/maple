zzso tumors are capable of degrading the surrounding zzso zzso resulting in local invasion or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its cell surface zzso zzso are central molecules in one of the major zzso systems involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging of this zzso in zzso with zzso peptides that specifically target zzso may therefore be useful to decipher the potential zzso of zzso zzso 

In this study, we developed a zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso with zzso acid zzso and labeled with zzso for zzso imaging of mice bearing zzso human zzso zzso zzso and zzso human breast cancer zzso zzso 

Surface zzso resonance zzso show that zzso with zzso zzso at the zzso group zzso has high affinity toward zzso zzso imaging reveals a rapid and high zzso of zzso in zzso zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso at zzso hours, zzso zzso 3) but not in zzso zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso at zzso hours, zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso imaging of zzso was validated by further control zzso First, a zzso zzso of zzso carrying a single zzso acid replacement zzso does not target zzso tumors in zzso Second, targeting of zzso tumors by zzso is specifically inhibited by a zzso zzso 

The successful demonstration of the ability of a zzso labeled zzso probe to zzso zzso expression in zzso may allow clinical translation of this class of zzso for zzso cancer detection and patient zzso for zzso zzso cancer zzso
