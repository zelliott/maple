The zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly expressed in most acute zzso and frequently zzso in acute zzso leukemia zzso The zzso form of the zzso is zzso activated and known to play an important role in zzso but the zzso state of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is, at present, zzso In this study, we examined the zzso state of the zzso zzso in zzso We found that the zzso zzso was zzso zzso in 8 of 12 primary zzso samples and 4 of 13 leukemia cell zzso To explain why zzso is often zzso we investigated the expression of its zzso FL, by these same zzso zzso of FL with zzso was a universal finding in both primary zzso samples and zzso cell zzso To further prove that zzso signaling was accounting for the zzso we showed that zzso media but not fresh media was able to activate zzso In addition, an zzso that blocks binding of zzso to the zzso blocks zzso zzso Finally, depletion of FL from zzso media is able to block the zzso of zzso Taken together, these findings represent strong evidence that zzso is often zzso activated in zzso and thus, like its zzso form, might contribute to the altered signaling that characterizes zzso
