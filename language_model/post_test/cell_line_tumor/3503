To assess the activity of zzso in combination with hormonal therapy in zzso models of prostate zzso 

Since prostate cancer has a zzso for the bone, we assessed the zzso activity of zzso in in zzso models of both bone zzso and localized prostate cancer, using zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso efficacy was observed regardless of whether the tumor cells were implanted in the prostate or in the zzso zzso activity was also evident in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso that zzso efficacy might be enhanced if it were to be used earlier in the course of the disease, we studied the sequence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of standard treatment for zzso prostate zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The activity was similar whether zzso and zzso zzso were used alone, zzso or in zzso indicating a lack of zzso or zzso Finally, we studied the combination of zzso and zzso on zzso and zzso cell lines in zzso and in zzso zzso did not increase the activity of zzso in these zzso 

These results provide a strong zzso rationale for the clinical development of zzso for the treatment of both locally advanced and zzso prostate zzso
