Cellular zzso within zzso zzso capsules has broad applications in tissue zzso In seeking to improve the inherent instability of zzso zzso zzso zzso we previously demonstrated the zzso stabilization of zzso zzso zzso beads via zzso zzso zzso using a zzso zzso terminated zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we zzso zzso zzso linear and zzso and zzso zzso with zzso groups to evaluate the effect of size, structural design, number of functional groups, and charge on the resulting zzso zzso All zzso resulted in enhanced zzso stabilization of zzso zzso with significant decreases in swelling and resistance to dissolution via zzso zzso The zzso zzso resulted in the most stable and homogeneous zzso with the most restrictive zzso even after zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells within the zzso zzso zzso beads resulted in minimal effects on zzso whereas the degree of proliferation following culture varied with zzso zzso Altogether, the results illustrate that manipulating the zzso structural design permits flexibility in resulting zzso beads zzso zzso stabilization of zzso zzso beads with these zzso zzso and zzso zzso provides a unique platform for cellular zzso
