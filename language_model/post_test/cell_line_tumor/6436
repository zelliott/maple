A small animal imaging system for zzso zzso zzso reporter gene expression will enable monitoring of zzso or therapeutic intervention in zzso zzso mouse was developed in which zzso zzso zzso expression was controlled by the zzso zzso The zzso signals of the transgenic zzso were strong at their liver region and decreased after zzso zzso imaging zzso of a transgenic mouse treated with zzso revealed distinct zzso activity in the liver and an increased pattern with zzso The transgenic mouse model can be used to monitor zzso producing zzso by a chemical zzso in a live animal by zzso
