Two novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been zzso The reaction of zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso ratio in dry ethanol at 50 degrees C afforded the complexes zzso zzso and zzso zzso in 26 and zzso yield, zzso The reaction carried out from the same starting compounds in a zzso zzso ratio at 75 degrees C led to the formation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in 16 and zzso yield, zzso The products were characterized by zzso analysis, one- and two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso electronic zzso zzso zzso and X-ray zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibit remarkable zzso activity in three human zzso cell lines, zzso zzso cell lung zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The novel complexes show an zzso mode of interaction with DNA, which may render them attractive alternatives to metal compounds with a zzso mode of zzso
