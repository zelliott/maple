Members of the nuclear zzso beta zzso family maintain cellular zzso by enhancing the zzso of genes involved in zzso immune response, cell zzso and zzso zzso tumor cells often express inflammatory zzso through enhanced zzso of zzso The zzso zzso appears to result from the zzso formation including zzso and zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso element binding zzso protein zzso and/or zzso zzso factor zzso We observed that proteins expressed by zzso zzso melanoma cells are highly zzso compared with normal zzso and zzso zzso reduced the zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso activity of zzso The promoter activity of zzso zzso was also reduced by the expression of zzso zzso The promoters of these zzso contain a zzso displacement protein zzso site near the zzso zzso compared with zzso cells, in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bound efficiently to zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso were reduced, and zzso the binding of zzso to zzso A was zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This study contributes to our understanding of the role of zzso in an zzso of zzso zzso zzso in human melanoma zzso
