Tests for skin zzso are required prior to the market launch of new zzso ingredients and in zzso tests are needed to replace the current animal zzso zzso zzso is the common feature of skin zzso and it is a crucial question whether a cellular in zzso zzso can detect protein zzso of diverse test zzso The signaling zzso involving the zzso protein zzso and the zzso factor nuclear zzso zzso factor 2, which binds to the zzso response element zzso in the promoter of many phase II zzso zzso is a potential cellular marker because zzso had been shown to be zzso modified by zzso which leads to zzso of zzso zzso To evaluate whether this regulatory zzso can be used to develop a zzso cellular in zzso test for zzso 96 different chemicals of known skin zzso potential were added to zzso cells and the induction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was zzso In zzso 102 chemicals were tested on the reporter cell line zzso which contains an zzso repeat of the ARE sequence upstream of a zzso zzso Among the zzso skin zzso 14 out of 15 and 30 out of 34 moderate zzso induced the zzso zzso activity and in many cases this response was paralleled by an induction of zzso activity in zzso zzso Sixty percent of the weak zzso also induced zzso activity, and the overall accuracy of the zzso was 83 zzso Only four of 30 tested zzso induced low levels of zzso activity, indicating a high specificity of the zzso Thus, measurement of the induction of this signaling zzso provides an interesting in zzso test to screen for the skin zzso potential of novel zzso
