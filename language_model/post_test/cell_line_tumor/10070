We and others have previously demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso gene therapy delivered zzso through ex zzso zzso zzso cell zzso is competent to promote the zzso of established zzso zzso In this report, we have developed a conditional expression system zzso to determine the zzso requirements of transgenic zzso production by administered DC on therapeutic outcome in a subcutaneous zzso melanoma zzso zzso infected with zzso zzso zzso zzso in a tightly regulated fashion in response to a synthetic zzso small zzso zzso in zzso and the treatment benefit of zzso delivered into zzso zzso was strictly zzso dependent in zzso Indeed, zzso therapy promoted the zzso of established day 7 zzso tumor zzso after zzso injection, provided that zzso administration occurred within 24 h of DC injection and was sustained for approximately 5 or more zzso Treatment efficacy was correlated to the magnitude of systemic zzso zzso T cells zzso in zzso which in turn, appeared dependent on the early enhanced in zzso survival of zzso transferred zzso in tumor and zzso zzso zzso The unique safety feature of zzso application was emphasized in a combined treatment model with zzso where profound zzso toxicity could be ameliorated upon zzso of zzso zzso zzso
