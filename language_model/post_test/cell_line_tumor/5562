Death receptors of the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso super family have been implicated in zzso zzso of nuclear zzso B zzso in pancreatic cancer zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso a natural zzso zzso zzso and zzso invasion of zzso zzso zzso cells through suppression of zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment resulted in zzso zzso of zzso cell growth and cell proliferation with zzso induction of zzso A zzso array analysis revealed that zzso zzso expression of more than 20 genes at zzso level with maximum decrease observed in zzso expression and a parallel increase observed in the expression levels of zzso an zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells was found to down regulate activated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that mostly impart zzso in zzso zzso and zzso analysis showed a marked decrease in zzso and zzso DNA binding activity, respectively, with modest decrease in zzso promoter activity and significant decrease in zzso promoter activity with zzso zzso zzso consistent with these findings, we further found that transient zzso of zzso by zzso interference significantly zzso zzso induced changes in cell zzso cell invasion and zzso paralleled with decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso DNA binding zzso zzso of zzso zzso with an extra cellular domain blocking zzso demonstrated similar zzso These data provide evidence that zzso could provide a biological rationale for treatment of pancreatic cancer or as an zzso with conventional therapeutic zzso
