Although zzso is rapidly becoming an indispensable tool for the analysis of peptides in complex zzso the sequence coverage it zzso is often quite zzso Low protein expression resulting in zzso signal zzso that fall below the limit of detection of the zzso system in combination with differences in zzso zzso efficiency plays a significant role in zzso A second important factor stems from differences in zzso properties of each zzso and how these properties relate to zzso retention and ultimate zzso To identify and understand those properties, we compared data from zzso identified peptides with data from peptides predicted by in zzso digest of all corresponding proteins in the experimental zzso Three different complex protein zzso extracted were used to define a training set to evaluate the zzso acid retention zzso based on linear zzso zzso The retention zzso were also compared with other previous zzso and retention zzso From this, we have constructed an empirical model that can be readily used to predict peptides that are likely to be observed on our zzso system based on their zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrated that in zzso prediction of peptides and their retention zzso can be used to generate an inclusion list for a targeted mass zzso identification of low abundance proteins in complex protein zzso This approach is based on zzso derived data to zzso the method and therefore may theoretically be applied to any zzso system on which data are being zzso
