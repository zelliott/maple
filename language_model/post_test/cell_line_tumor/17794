We hypothesized that signaling through multiple zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways is essential for the growth and zzso of zzso zzso which are zzso tumors derived from zzso zzso We tested this using zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell lines and anthrax lethal toxin zzso a bacterial toxin that zzso zzso Western blots confirmed that zzso treatment reduced the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso Although short treatments with zzso only modestly affected cell zzso sustained treatment markedly reduced cell zzso zzso also substantially inhibited the zzso release of zzso factors including vascular zzso growth factor, zzso and basic zzso growth zzso Similar results were obtained with cell lines derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In zzso zzso decreased zzso activity and blocked zzso zzso Growth zzso correlated with decreased cellular proliferation and extensive zzso and it was accompanied by a decrease in tumor mean vessel density as well as a reduction in serum expression of zzso zzso Vital imaging using high-resolution ultrasound enhanced with contrast zzso revealed that the effects of zzso on tumor zzso were remarkably rapid zzso zzso and resulted in a marked reduction of zzso within the tumor but not in zzso zzso These results are consistent with our initial hypothesis and lead us to propose that zzso zzso by zzso is a broadly effective strategy for targeting zzso in zzso and other similar zzso zzso
