The zzso growth zzso zzso zzso and its zzso have been implicated in the zzso and progression of various zzso including those arising in the zzso zzso We therefore evaluated whether the zzso could serve as a potential target for therapy of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The expression and zzso of the zzso and some of its downstream signaling zzso components were evaluated in both human zzso cancer specimens and zzso cancer cell zzso The therapeutic potential of a humanized zzso zzso zzso directed against zzso was assessed in zzso and in zzso in an zzso model of zzso zzso volume and overall survival time were analyzed to evaluate the efficacy of A12 in zzso 

zzso was zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso with A12 was effective in attenuating zzso signaling both in zzso and in zzso However, the zzso effects of A12 on cell proliferation were cell line dependent, as those zzso cell lines that had zzso levels of zzso were more sensitive to A12 zzso A12 was equally effective in zzso where it brought approximately 57% zzso zzso zzso zzso in tumor zzso The zzso use of A12 and zzso produced additive effects and resulted in a zzso zzso zzso zzso reduction in tumor zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso and decreased proliferation and zzso density but increased zzso within the tumor zzso Our results also highlighted a previously undefined zzso zzso effect on zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso the zzso with A12 seems to be a potential avenue for treating patients with zzso by its direct zzso effects and its effects on the tumor zzso
