zzso is an zzso zzso that is elevated in zzso during zzso and zzso zzso and has been implicated in asthma and other lung zzso There, zzso is considered an important zzso of zzso functions and zzso but its effects on zzso expression and turnover during tissue zzso are zzso We examined the effects of zzso on lung zzso cells with particular attention to the expression of zzso a zzso zzso highly expressed in injured zzso that has been implicated in wound zzso In zzso lung zzso cells, we found that zzso induced expression of zzso zzso and protein in a zzso and zzso manner and found that the zzso effect of zzso was inhibited by specific zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation was associated with increased levels of zzso zzso and with zzso and DNA binding of the zzso response element binding protein zzso known for its ability to stimulate zzso gene zzso To confirm the latter, zzso cells were zzso with a DNA construct containing the human zzso promoter connected to a zzso reporter zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and this effect was blocked by zzso of protein zzso zzso Finally, we tested primary lung zzso and primary zzso zzso type II cells and found increased zzso expression in response to zzso Overall, our observations suggest that zzso might zzso tissue zzso by stimulating zzso expression in lung zzso cells through induction of zzso zzso signals that target zzso zzso and stimulate zzso gene zzso
