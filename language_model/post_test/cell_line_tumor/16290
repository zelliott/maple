The in zzso zzso effect of the zzso extract from zzso zzso zzso zzso ex zzso Rich zzso on the zzso liver cell damage as well as the possible zzso mechanisms involved in this protective effect, were zzso The zzso investigation of this zzso extract led to the isolation of six compounds identified zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso activity of these compounds was tested in zzso against zzso damage in rat zzso zzso In addition, zzso activity, zzso acid model system, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to measure zzso activity of crude extract and isolated zzso zzso and zzso were used as standard references and, respectively, exhibited significant zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed significant zzso and zzso activities as indicated by their ability to prevent liver cell death and zzso zzso leakage during zzso zzso These results suggest that the protective effects of crude extract of zzso zzso against the zzso zzso possibly involve the zzso effect of these zzso
