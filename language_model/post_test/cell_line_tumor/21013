To ask whether highly zzso zzso show more marked zzso zzso zzso response than poorly zzso zzso 

The progressive zzso zzso showing zzso and zzso potential and the zzso zzso zzso showing neither zzso nor zzso potential were both isolated from a parental rat colon zzso zzso survival, zzso and zzso cell cycle distribution, DNA zzso zzso and zzso breaks zzso induction and repair were zzso 

zzso phenomenon was demonstrated in PRO zzso Before zzso PRO cells show more spontaneous damage than zzso zzso After zzso zzso PRO cells zzso zzso More DNA zzso 15 zzso zzso zzso more zzso DNA zzso processed by the zzso zzso zzso and by the zzso zzso zzso zzso more zzso than zzso cells while neither zzso nor zzso zzso nor cell cycle arrest was observed in both zzso 

zzso response of PRO zzso may be induced by zzso in zzso repair that targets zzso cells and zzso repair that targets zzso zzso The cellular consequences of such zzso are a failure to arrest in cell cycle, the propagation of damage through cell cycle, zzso death but not zzso zzso zzso cells with high zzso potential may zzso show zzso zzso
