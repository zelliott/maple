We observed that the zzso mouse zzso virus zzso strain zzso reached a zzso of approximately 2 zzso higher than that of the zzso strain zzso in zzso zzso zzso To determine whether the spike protein is responsible for the difference, a zzso virus, zzso that contains the zzso zzso with a spike from zzso was used to zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso behaved like zzso thus establishing a role for the spike protein in viral zzso The inverse correlation between viral zzso and growth was further established in four different cell types and with a zzso zzso the zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso While both zzso and zzso entered cells at similar levels, viral zzso and protein zzso were significantly delayed for zzso Interestingly, when the zzso zzso were delivered directly into the cells via zzso the levels of gene expression for these viruses were zzso Furthermore, cell zzso experiments revealed that significantly more zzso zzso for the zzso zzso were detected in the zzso zzso zzso within the first 2 h after infection than for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso reversed its properties in zzso formation, virus production, and zzso transport to the zzso These findings identified a novel role for the spike protein in regulating the zzso and delivery of the viral zzso to the zzso after zzso
