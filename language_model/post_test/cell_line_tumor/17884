Cancer chemotherapy continues to be challenged by the emergence of resistant tumors, and one zzso entwined in the development of drug resistance is the zzso zzso Recently, we discovered a group of zzso zzso zzso compounds that zzso resident zzso proteins from the zzso region resulting in their zzso These compounds are also potent zzso agents, which together with their action on the zzso made a compelling case for testing them against zzso 

The zzso activity of a group of zzso compounds was examined both in zzso and in zzso The role of the zzso in the zzso effect was assessed by comparing the proliferation of individual cell lines with the distribution and total cellular expression of selected resident zzso zzso 

The zzso activity of zzso compounds is partially zzso zzso and zzso zzso and translates to tumor growth zzso in zzso While zzso compounds zzso resident zzso proteins from the zzso region in all cells, those that are resistant to the zzso effects differ from sensitive cells in that they have the capacity to protect these zzso proteins from zzso 

These results illustrate the utility of targeting the zzso for cancer drug zzso They also reveal a cellular strategy for resisting zzso drug effects through protection of displaced zzso proteins from degradation thus allowing their continued zzso
