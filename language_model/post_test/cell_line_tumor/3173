zzso zzso and zzso signaling is pivotal to differentiation along the zzso cell zzso One crucial protein that may play a central role in this signaling zzso is the Ras zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso that may exert a positive role in zzso zzso In this report, we studied the dynamics of zzso zzso zzso during differentiation of zzso zzso cells upon treatment with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, we observed that, among other zzso signaling events, zzso induced a rapid and sustained decrease of zzso zzso which was not due to zzso Instead, we identified a specific zzso event at the zzso of zzso This zzso was acute and correlated perfectly with the signaling dynamics of the zzso zzso Moreover, it persisted throughout prolonged treatment and zzso differentiation of zzso cells, zzso with sustained zzso of zzso Most importantly, zzso zzso of zzso correlated with a shift of zzso zzso from the nucleus to the zzso We propose that zzso sustained zzso zzso is a requirement for prolonged recruitment of zzso from the nucleus to the zzso in order for a fine regulation of zzso zzso activity to be achieved during zzso
