zzso plays an essential role in cancer zzso which therefore has become an attractive target for zzso zzso zzso zzso is tightly regulated by multiple signaling pathways that usually function zzso in addition, zzso between these pathways forms a complicated network that is regulated by zzso zzso Given the complexity of zzso mechanisms underlying tumor zzso most currently used zzso zzso that only target single pathways may be insufficient and probably generate drug resistance, thus, increasing the necessity for development of novel zzso zzso Traditional Chinese medicines zzso are receiving great interest since they have relatively fewer zzso and have been used for thousands of years to clinically treat various types of diseases including zzso zzso zzso Huang zzso a well-known traditional Chinese zzso that was first prescribed 450 years ago, has long been used as an alternative remedy for zzso However, the precise mechanism of zzso zzso activity remains to be further zzso Using a zzso cancer mouse zzso model, in the present study, we evaluated the effect of zzso on tumor zzso and investigated the underlying molecular zzso We found that zzso inhibited tumor growth since zzso treatment resulted in decrease in both tumor volume and tumor weight in zzso zzso In addition, zzso suppressed the zzso of several signaling pathways such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso on these pathways resulted in the zzso of tumor zzso as demonstrated by the decrease of zzso density in tumor zzso Moreover, zzso treatment reduced the expression of zzso factors including zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as their specific receptors zzso and zzso Altogether, our findings suggest that zzso of tumor zzso via suppression of multiple signaling pathways might be one of the mechanisms zzso zzso affects zzso
