zzso of the global zzso considered to be composed mainly of repetitive zzso is consistently observed in zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of zzso islands zzso in promoter regions are also zzso Since zzso zzso in unique promoter sequences and in other zzso regions have distinct consequences, we analyzed the relationship between the global zzso and the zzso of unique promoter zzso using human gastric zzso Seven of ten gastric cancer cell lines showed marked decreases in zzso content, which correlated with zzso of the zzso repetitive zzso Six of the seven cell lines showed zzso in five or all of the six normally zzso zzso in promoter regions of six zzso and this was associated with induction of zzso zzso The remaining three cell lines without global zzso showed promoter zzso in one or none of the six zzso zzso promoter zzso however, did not correlate with frequent promoter zzso In primary gastric zzso too, global zzso was associated with zzso of zzso repetitive sequence and promoter zzso Of 93 gastric zzso 33 zzso with frequent promoter zzso and 27 zzso with frequent promoter zzso constituted different zzso These findings represent experimental evidence that frequent zzso of normally zzso promoter zzso is associated with global zzso and that these zzso occur independently of frequent promoter CGI zzso
