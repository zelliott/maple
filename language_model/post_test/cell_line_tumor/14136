zzso therapy zzso is a tool for the treatment of certain zzso and zzso zzso The natural precursor of zzso zzso acid zzso has been extensively used as a zzso in zzso zzso poor zzso has been enhanced by chemical zzso with zzso zzso Some of the zzso zzso proved to be more efficient than zzso for zzso zzso In the present work we studied the nature of zzso synthesis regulation from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in an zzso cell zzso We found that zzso is incorporated into the cells at a higher rate, followed by zzso and zzso whereas zzso and zzso zzso zzso at the same rate zzso by passive zzso Although zzso entrance to the cell might be regulatory at low zzso zzso zzso zzso is not a limiting zzso At high zzso the regulation of zzso conversion into zzso is driven by the zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso is regulated by zzso The key conclusion of this contribution is that the use of zzso zzso has to be limited to low zzso where no regulation on zzso synthesis takes zzso
