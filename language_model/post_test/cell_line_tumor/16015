Several zzso support that zzso is associated with zzso cell transformation and zzso We have previously reported that a cell line, named zzso zzso which only expressed zzso zzso compared with parental cells zzso zzso zzso zzso cell line) was isolated by gene zzso The decreased expression of zzso is sufficient for zzso transformation of zzso cells, which involved in the loss of zzso growth and migration in nude mice with the existence of zzso The previous study in our lab on zzso zzso showed that the expression of zzso D1 zzso cycle zzso was zzso in zzso cell zzso Here, we not only confirmed the results by Western zzso but also demonstrated that zzso zzso accelerate the progression of zzso cells from zzso phase into S phase by zzso zzso zzso This proposed that the zzso zzso could change the progress of cell cycle in the zzso zzso Otherwise, zzso zzso also showed that the zzso factor zzso was zzso But, the original zzso gene zzso and zzso factor zzso have not obviously changed compared with zzso zzso cells obtained the zzso in nude mice with the existence of zzso and the zzso showed the interactions of zzso with zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso expression was increased as further zzso of zzso So, we zzso that zzso zzso could induce the zzso of zzso signaling pathway, in order to adjust the development and zzso By zzso technology, the down regulation of zzso could activate zzso zzso and zzso signaling pathway, including the zzso of zzso and zzso However, the mechanism of zzso zzso in the early transformation and signaling zzso of zzso zzso cells is zzso Here, we report that zzso of zzso protein expression leads to zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso signaling and consequently early transformation in zzso zzso
