A series of novel zzso zzso were zzso and assessed for their zzso activity on the drug-resistant pancreatic cancer cell line zzso Among them, one compound exhibited potent zzso properties and zzso activity against the pancreatic cancer model zzso both in zzso and in zzso with no adverse zzso This compound did not inhibit DNA synthesis and therefore does not resemble the clinical drug zzso It did, however, significantly zzso the expression of heat shock protein 27 zzso a small molecular zzso playing an important role in drug resistance and highly expressed in drug-resistant cancer forms, and thus represents the first small molecular zzso lead with such a mode of zzso
