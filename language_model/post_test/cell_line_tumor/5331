zzso zzso acid has been shown to selectively induce tumor zzso in cell cultures and animal models in several types of zzso and is about as a promising new class of zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso acid showed synergistic zzso activity with radiation, zzso and tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso in some zzso Here, we report zzso zzso acid also induced zzso in human oral cancer zzso Western zzso showed zzso zzso acid increased zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein expression and activated zzso and zzso The zzso was almost completely inhibited by zzso inhibitor zzso and attenuated by zzso inhibitor zzso Human zzso zzso zzso protein but not zzso or zzso significantly inhibited zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso acid zzso zzso mainly through zzso of zzso death zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso of zzso zzso acid sensitize two TRAIL resistant human oral cancer cells, zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Combined treatment of zzso zzso acid and TRAIL may be used as a new promising therapy for oral zzso
