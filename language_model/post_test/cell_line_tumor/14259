The zzso zzso zzso of zzso C virus zzso is essential for viral replication and therefore has been one of the most attractive targets for developing specific zzso agents against zzso zzso a highly selective, zzso and potent zzso inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso is currently in clinical development for the treatment of zzso zzso In this report, we describe the in zzso characterization of zzso activities of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso resulted in a zzso and zzso reduction of zzso zzso and proteins in zzso zzso Moreover, following a zzso incubation with zzso a reduction in zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso was observed, and this reduction resulted in elimination of zzso zzso from zzso cells, since there was no rebound in zzso zzso after withdrawal of the zzso The combination of zzso and alpha zzso was additive to moderately synergistic in reducing zzso zzso in zzso cells with no significant increase in zzso The benefit of the combination was sustained over time: a zzso reduction in zzso zzso level was achieved following a zzso incubation with zzso and alpha zzso at lower zzso than when either zzso or alpha zzso was used zzso The combination of zzso and alpha zzso also suppressed the emergence of in zzso resistance zzso against zzso in zzso zzso
