Aurora zzso play an essential role in orchestrating zzso zzso segregation and zzso during zzso zzso with both zzso and B frequently zzso in a variety of human zzso zzso of the ABC drug zzso proteins zzso zzso and Breast cancer resistance protein zzso is a major obstacle for chemotherapy in many zzso types with zzso zzso particularly poor prognosis in acute zzso zzso zzso zzso is a highly selective inhibitor of zzso zzso that has shown zzso activity against a range zzso cell lines including those of zzso zzso zzso 

Effect of zzso on the zzso zzso and cell viability was measured in a panel of zzso cell lines and 37 primary zzso samples by flow zzso zzso status was determined by flow zzso and zzso status by flow zzso and real-time zzso 

In this study we report the creation of the cell line zzso which zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso protein zzso through prolonged treatment of zzso cells with zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso expressing zzso cell lines are less sensitive to zzso induced zzso zzso and subsequent loss of viability compared to zzso negative cell zzso We also show that zzso resistance in these cell lines can be reversed using known zzso and zzso zzso We report that zzso is not an inhibitor of zzso or zzso but by using zzso that it is zzso by these zzso Using zzso zzso zzso as a zzso of zzso responsiveness in primary zzso blasts we determined that zzso and zzso positive primary samples were less sensitive to zzso induced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than samples without these zzso However, we demonstrate that zzso zzso of zzso by zzso was achieved in zzso of these samples after 1 hour drug treatment, in contrast to the resistance of the cell zzso 

We conclude that zzso and zzso status and zzso zzso in patients treated with zzso should be monitored in order to establish whether zzso zzso is sufficient to adversely impact on the efficacy of the zzso
