The implication of zzso zzso zzso in the major stages of cancer progression has fueled interest in the design of synthetic zzso zzso zzso as a novel zzso zzso Thus far, drugs used in clinical trials are zzso zzso the therapeutic index of which proved disappointingly zzso The development of selective zzso for tumor zzso zzso is, thus, likely to offer improved therapeutic zzso 

The zzso capacity of a series of zzso derivatives was tested in zzso in a zzso zzso and the most potent compound was further evaluated in zzso in different human tumor zzso zzso The activity of this novel selective zzso was compared with zzso a zzso zzso 

zzso an inhibitor with high selectivity for zzso zzso and membrane type 1 zzso showed the highest zzso activity in zzso In zzso zzso reduced the growth of tumors induced by the zzso of different cell lines producing zzso and inhibited the zzso effect of zzso on breast zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso reduced tumor zzso and blocked zzso in a rat zzso ring zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso expression in tumor cells and promoted zzso in the zzso ring zzso 

zzso a selective and orally zzso zzso with zzso activity against zzso expressed by tumor and/or zzso cells, is a potent zzso and zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso the administration of zzso was not associated with the occurrence of adverse side effects that might hamper the therapeutic potential of these zzso
