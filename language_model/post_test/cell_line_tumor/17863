The zzso strain of zzso C virus zzso is unique among zzso zzso in that the zzso virus can traverse the entire replication cycle in cultured zzso However, without zzso zzso only low levels of infectious virus are zzso In the present study, the effects of five zzso that were selected during serial passage in zzso cells were zzso zzso zzso containing all five zzso produced zzso logs more infectious zzso than did wild zzso Neither a coding zzso in zzso nor a silent zzso in zzso was zzso whereas coding zzso in zzso zzso and zzso all increased virus zzso A zzso replication zzso in zzso cells was developed to study more precisely the effect of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso had minimal effect on the amount of infectious virus released but probably enhanced entry into zzso In contrast, both the zzso and zzso zzso independently increased the amount of virus zzso
