Mouse zzso melanoma cells of lower zzso potential to lung were treated in zzso with same concentration zzso zzso of zzso prepared from plasma of mice bearing lung zzso of zzso zzso or zzso melanoma cell lines of increasing zzso potential to lung zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and injected to normal mice through tail zzso The number of zzso tumor zzso formed in lung increased gradually in mice receiving zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells compared to mice receiving zzso cells without any zzso zzso Similarly, mouse zzso melanoma cells treated in zzso with 50 zzso concentration of zzso prepared from spent culture media of zzso zzso or zzso cells cultured in zzso were injected to normal mice through tail zzso The number of zzso tumor zzso formed in lung increased gradually in mice receiving zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells compared to mice receiving zzso cells without any zzso zzso The results indicated that zzso zzso present in plasma and culture media of zzso of increasing zzso potential to lung enhanced zzso potential of zzso zzso The increasing concentration of zzso zzso present in plasma and in culture media of zzso of increasing zzso potential possibly determined increase in zzso potential of zzso zzso
