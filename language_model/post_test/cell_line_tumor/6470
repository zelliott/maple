zzso A and zzso are potent zzso natural products with a mechanism of action similar to that of zzso However, the binding site of zzso A and zzso on zzso remains poorly zzso Drug resistance in zzso treatment is a serious zzso We developed zzso A- and zzso cell lines by selecting zzso human zzso zzso cells that were able to grow in the presence of one of these zzso The zzso resistant cells zzso were zzso resistant to the selecting agent and zzso zzso to zzso A, whereas the zzso A resistant cells zzso were zzso resistant to the selecting agent while they remained sensitive to zzso Neither cell line showed resistance to zzso or other drugs that bind to the zzso site on zzso nor was there resistance to zzso zzso The resistant cells exhibited impaired zzso zzso zzso zzso and impaired zzso zzso zzso zzso were found in the zzso zzso zzso or zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso This is the first zzso evidence to support a zzso site for zzso A and zzso To determine whether the different resistance zzso of the cells were attributable to any other zzso zzso the zzso zzso composition of the cells was zzso Increased expression of zzso and zzso was observed in zzso cells zzso These results provide insight into how zzso in zzso lead to unique resistance profiles for two drugs, zzso A and zzso that have a similar mode of zzso
