zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as components of the zzso part of complex I, are essential for zzso zzso zzso zzso or lack of expression of these zzso have significant zzso consequences in zzso However, the way these events affect complex I assembly is poorly zzso To understand the effects of particular zzso in zzso zzso on complex I zzso we studied four human cell zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso cells, and zzso degrees cells that do not express any zzso zzso in comparison with normal complex I control zzso In control cells, all the seven zzso zzso complex I zzso were found to be attached to the zzso inner zzso except for the 24 zzso zzso which was nearly equally zzso between the zzso and the zzso zzso of a single zzso zzso or even all the seven zzso zzso caused no major changes in the zzso complex I zzso content of zzso However, in cells lacking zzso or zzso very low amounts of 24 zzso zzso were found associated with the zzso whereas most of the other zzso zzso remained zzso In contrast, membrane association of most of the nuclear zzso was significantly reduced in the absence of all seven zzso zzso zzso detected several zzso One of these, containing the 23, 30 and 49 zzso zzso also contained zzso This is the first description of zzso interaction with complex I zzso and suggests that this protein might play a role in the assembly or degradation of zzso complex zzso
