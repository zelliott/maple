zzso zzso factor zzso is involved in not only the physiology of normal B cells, but also the zzso of aggressive B cells related to zzso and zzso zzso However, how excessive zzso promotes aggressive zzso proliferation and survival is not well zzso Here we show that excessive human soluble zzso zzso enhanced cell proliferation and survival in normal and zzso zzso cells, which was associated with suppression of zzso resulting in zzso of zzso This is supported by the findings that zzso with zzso or zzso expression of dominant negative zzso or zzso of zzso prevented zzso zzso of zzso and cell zzso in the zzso It appears that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso as zzso with zzso zzso or zzso significantly attenuated these zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso zzso with zzso or zzso zzso also attenuated zzso zzso signaling and zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso activates zzso in part through zzso zzso of zzso increasing cell zzso in normal and zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso or manipulation of zzso zzso may be exploited for prevention of excessive zzso aggressive zzso zzso and zzso zzso
