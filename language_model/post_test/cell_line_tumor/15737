The purpose of this study was to zzso two new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso and to evaluate the potential of these PET zzso for assessing the function of two major drug zzso zzso zzso zzso and breast cancer resistance protein zzso zzso and zzso were zzso by zzso of each zzso precursor with zzso zzso for injection as PET zzso In zzso zzso zzso showed that treatment with zzso zzso (1 and 2) enhanced the zzso zzso capacity of zzso and zzso zzso zzso In PET studies, the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso mice zzso with 1 were approximately zzso higher than that in zzso mice, and the zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso knockout mice were zzso to zzso higher than that in zzso zzso The increased zzso of zzso and zzso was similar to that of parent compounds zzso and zzso previously zzso indicating that zzso levels in the brain after injection of zzso and zzso are related to the function of drug zzso zzso Also, these results suggest that the structural difference between parent compounds zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso do not obviously affect the potency against drug zzso zzso In zzso analysis of mice, the unchanged form in the brain and plasma at 60 zzso after zzso of zzso plus 1 were higher zzso for zzso zzso for zzso than that after zzso of zzso plus zzso zzso is a promising PET probe to assess the function of drug zzso zzso
