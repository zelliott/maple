zzso zzso regulates a broad spectrum of fundamental cellular processes like zzso death, migration and zzso zzso zzso elevated levels of zzso may be zzso to various zzso conditions including cancer, fibrosis, zzso zzso diseases and zzso zzso Here we report that zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso degrades zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso Moreover, we investigated its effect on cellular responses typical of fibrosis, cancer and zzso zzso using zzso zzso cells, zzso cells, breast zzso and colon zzso zzso zzso cells as disease zzso In all cell types, zzso zzso but not an inactive zzso disrupted zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso disruption of zzso zzso signaling by zzso depletion inhibited proliferation and expression of zzso tissue growth factor in zzso cells, zzso migration and zzso expression in zzso cells, and proliferation and migration of zzso zzso Upon intravenous injection of zzso in mice, plasma zzso levels rapidly declined by zzso within 1 h and then recovered to normal 6 h after zzso Using the chicken zzso membrane model we further demonstrate that also under in zzso conditions zzso but not the inactive zzso inhibited tumor zzso zzso as an zzso zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso zzso is active under zzso conditions and holds promise as a new zzso therapeutic for diseases associated with increased levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso
