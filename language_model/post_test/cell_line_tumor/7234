Several studies suggested that zzso channels are involved in the proliferation of cancer cells but the involvement of the large zzso zzso zzso channels zzso in the zzso phenomenon is still zzso In the present study, we used zzso a specific blocker of zzso and report the activity of an zzso current in various human breast cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as in normal zzso zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso an zzso of zzso did not interfere with either cell proliferation or with the invasive properties of the cells, under normal culture zzso However, zzso zzso of zzso which induced transient increases in zzso zzso zzso revealed a significant reduction effect of zzso on cell zzso We conclude that the zzso current is not involved in cell proliferation in zzso conditions but zzso when the zzso zzso concentration is zzso These experiments also suggest that zzso channels are not involved in the zzso transformation and are probably a relic from normal zzso
