One of the major mechanisms of zzso resistance zzso in cancer therapy is the zzso of zzso zzso We previously reported that zzso zzso a synthetic zzso zzso in the clinic for the treatment of malaria infections, was capable of reversing zzso zzso in zzso tumor zzso Here we further evaluated the reversal activity of zzso using two zzso human tumor cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso significantly enhanced the sensitivity of zzso and zzso cells to zzso zzso but had no such effect on the parent zzso and zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso persisted for longer than zzso after removal of the agent from the zzso In nude mice bearing zzso zzso zzso significantly enhanced the zzso activity of zzso when given zzso or orally without increasing the toxicity of zzso Our observations suggest that zzso represents a promising agent for overcoming zzso in cancer zzso
