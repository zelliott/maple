We have investigated whether zzso a calcium zzso could improve the zzso of platinum in tumors and enhance the zzso efficacy by increasing drug diffusion through the zzso tumor zzso zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso combined with 10 zzso zzso in 2 zzso saline serum led to tumor cure in four of eight rats and produced major tumor zzso in the other zzso In contrast, zzso injection of zzso alone or zzso alone had no zzso zzso zzso increased platinum zzso both in zzso and ex zzso in the zzso zzso zzso alone was zzso at a concentration of 10 zzso but neither increased platinum zzso nor zzso toxicity on cultured zzso zzso cancer zzso We conclude that zzso could be a useful and zzso zzso for enhancing zzso zzso zzso
