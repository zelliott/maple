To investigate the role of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso with short hairpin zzso zzso in human zzso cancer cells zzso in zzso and in zzso 

A zzso zzso expression zzso was zzso into zzso cells, and the expression of zzso protein was detected by Western zzso Cell proliferation was determined using the zzso zzso and the cell cycle was detected using flow zzso A tumor zzso experiment was established to evaluate the tumor growth under the condition of zzso zzso and the expression of zzso zzso cell nuclear zzso and zzso D1 were detected by Western zzso or zzso 

zzso zzso reduced the protein level of zzso leading to marked proliferation zzso and significant cell cycle zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso reduced the tumor zzso growth implanted with zzso zzso The protein expression of zzso zzso cell nuclear zzso and zzso D1 were zzso in the zzso tumor zzso 

The zzso of zzso by zzso could inhibit zzso tumor growth and might be an alternative approach for human zzso cancer zzso
