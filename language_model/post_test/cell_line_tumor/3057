Resistance to chemotherapy represents a major obstacle to improving the survival of patients with zzso zzso In this study, the zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated to markedly enhance the zzso of colon cancer cells induced by zzso one of the key zzso drugs widely used to treat various types of zzso The treatment of the colon cancer cell lines zzso and zzso with zzso resulted in increased zzso of the zzso pathway, which was blocked by zzso a zzso zzso In both cell lines, zzso zzso by zzso led to a dramatic enhancement of the zzso zzso as determined by cell cycle analysis and zzso zzso zzso although the inhibitor alone did not affect zzso This effect was restricted to zzso since zzso did not alter the sensitivity to other drugs, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso selective zzso of the zzso zzso by small interfering zzso zzso also increased the zzso cell death induced by zzso These findings highlight the importance of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso and suggest that a combined treatment with zzso and zzso zzso could be an attractive therapeutic strategy against colon zzso
