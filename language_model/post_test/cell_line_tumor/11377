A set of nine zzso zzso medium ring zzso has been zzso using zzso as zzso pool and evaluated against a panel of three human cancer cell lines and a normal cell zzso The synthetic route to the targeted zzso is simple, concise, and high yielding compared to other reported zzso zzso studies have resulted in the identification of a potent zzso zzso (10) exhibiting zzso growth zzso against zzso cell line with an zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso which is lower than that of naturally occurring molecules of this class and of comparable activity to the synthetic drug zzso zzso 10 zzso the zzso signaling zzso by selectively targeting the zzso zzso of zzso This leads to zzso stress that causes zzso of zzso c from zzso to zzso which in turn activates zzso zzso cell zzso Further in zzso zzso simulations of four zzso with zzso zzso have been carried out to zzso the orientation zzso
