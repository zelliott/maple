Wild type zzso could induce zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein is related with zzso of zzso This study was designed to investigate the effects of zzso zzso gene zzso on the growth of rat zzso cell line zzso 

A zzso expression zzso zzso was constructed, and zzso into zzso zzso The cells were selected by zzso The expression of enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso was observed under fluorescent zzso and the expression of zzso zzso and protein was detected by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso The effects of zzso gene on cell cycle zzso cell growth, and proliferation of zzso cells were measured by flow zzso cell growth curve, and zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso and zzso cells, which separately expressed zzso and zzso zzso were constructed zzso S phase proportion was significantly higher in zzso cells than in zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells grew faster than zzso and zzso zzso The clone formation rate was significantly lower in zzso cells than in zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso gene could promote cell cycle progression of zzso zzso cells from zzso phase to S phase, and accelerate cell growth, but can't increase the clone zzso
