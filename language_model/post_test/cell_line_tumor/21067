The zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso is an important regulator of cell cycle progression as it zzso regulates zzso progression and plays a major role in controlling the cell zzso The screening of the zzso sequence identified many potential zzso zzso To investigate the effects of the zzso of zzso zzso protein lacking the zzso sites on zzso zzso cell cycle, and zzso a zzso was constructed containing zzso of zzso at zzso zzso zzso and zzso into the zzso cell line with zzso zzso and zzso zzso plasmids zzso were zzso separately as control zzso 

We detected the proliferation of zzso cells by the Cell Counting Kit and zzso zzso zzso and analyzed the expression and zzso of zzso by Western zzso analysis and cell zzso The zzso dependent zzso activity was determined by in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso cells was greatly inhibited and cell cycle was arrested in zzso phase after zzso zzso zzso expression much more than zzso zzso The expressed zzso zzso proteins were zzso from the zzso into nucleus much more compare with zzso Compared with zzso control, transient zzso of zzso zzso decreased expression of zzso D1 and the zzso form of zzso zzso 

These findings support the potential effectiveness of a zzso zzso form of zzso in zzso zzso gene zzso
