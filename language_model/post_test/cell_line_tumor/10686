zzso zzso activity has been implicated in a variety of zzso Thus, zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso are often effective cancer zzso Here, we employed zzso zzso a selective zzso zzso to determine the possible involvement of zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso for overcoming zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso were more susceptible to zzso treatment than were their parental cells zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso appeared to be due to zzso arrest at zzso without induction of zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso induced zzso in zzso zzso cells but not in zzso zzso cells, which implies that a high level of zzso may protect zzso cells from undergoing cell zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells is accompanied by an zzso of the zzso signaling zzso However, we found that in zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso was zzso from the induction of zzso due to the zzso of zzso by delayed zzso zzso We also found that zzso zzso of zzso 1 from zzso leads to zzso in zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that functional zzso in response to zzso may lead to cell survival in zzso zzso cells, while defective zzso may contribute to zzso of growth in zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso of zzso may be used zzso as zzso therapeutic agents during the treatment of zzso with zzso zzso
