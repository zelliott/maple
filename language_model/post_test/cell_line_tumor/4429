zzso channels, which are zzso in several zzso have been identified as regulators of cell proliferation and migration, key processes in cancer zzso Their role in lung cancer has not been studied zzso but we showed previously that zzso channels are involved in cell migration, proliferation and repair of normal lung zzso zzso We now investigated the role of these channels in lung cancer cell lines and their expression levels in human lung zzso zzso zzso First, we observed that the zzso rates of zzso lung zzso cell zzso were reduced by zzso and zzso or after zzso with zzso zzso zzso decrease of zzso cell growth and cell zzso in zzso phase were seen after zzso zzso zzso also affected zzso and zzso migration of zzso zzso Similarly, zzso cell growth, migration and wound healing were diminished by this zzso Because zzso channel zzso has been encountered in some zzso we assessed zzso expression levels in tumor zzso from patients with lung zzso zzso protein expression in tumor samples was increased by zzso to zzso compared to paired zzso zzso in 17 of zzso In zzso our data reveal that zzso channel blockade efficiently reduces zzso and zzso cell proliferation and zzso Moreover, zzso zzso in zzso samples suggests that it could be a potential therapeutic target in lung zzso
