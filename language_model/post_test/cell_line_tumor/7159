zzso zzso factors play a critical role in the control of cell cycle zzso regulating the expression of genes involved in DNA zzso DNA repair, zzso and cell zzso This involves both zzso and zzso zzso zzso the latter group including the zzso zzso which has been shown to function as an zzso zzso of zzso gene zzso In an effort to better delineate the context of zzso function, including the mechanisms of zzso functional zzso we used zzso zzso zzso to assess when and with what genes zzso associates during a cell zzso We find that zzso associates specifically with the zzso target genes that are activated at zzso this interaction occurs during S phase of the cell zzso In sharp contrast, zzso does not bind to zzso genes activated at zzso In the absence of zzso zzso can bind to the zzso promoters and compensate for loss of zzso zzso Indeed, zzso of both zzso and zzso activity results in specific zzso of these genes during S zzso We conclude that zzso functions as a zzso of zzso zzso during S phase and given the specificity for the zzso zzso we propose that zzso functions to distinguish zzso and zzso zzso during the cell zzso
