We describe a novel quantitative viral screening method based on zzso detection that does not require zzso DNA of human zzso virus zzso the major zzso agent of cervical cancer, served as the screening target in this zzso Eight zzso zzso DNA zzso were designed complementary to the zzso gene of zzso zzso The zzso were zzso stained with Alexa zzso zzso and zzso to the target in zzso The individual zzso molecules were zzso with an intensified zzso device zzso in two zzso In the zzso mode, target molecules were detected via zzso from zzso zzso zzso This system could detect zzso DNA in the presence of human zzso DNA down to zzso zzso and had a linear dynamic range of over 6 orders of zzso In the zzso mode, we employed zzso resonance energy transfer and added zzso dye as the zzso The two colors from Alexa zzso zzso and zzso were dispersed by a transmission grating located in front of the zzso With this reinforced criterion for identifying the zzso zzso zero zzso count was zzso We also showed that DNA extracts from Pap test specimens did not interfere with the zzso
