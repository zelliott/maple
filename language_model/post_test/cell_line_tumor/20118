zzso is a zzso factor which is functionally and structurally similar to the zzso box protein zzso zzso has been shown to be associated with zzso a pregnancy associated disease, and to have potential implications in late onset Alzheimer's zzso However, the exact function of zzso and its target genes are still largely zzso zzso in this study we performed zzso zzso coupled to shotgun cloning to discover novel zzso target zzso Our results show that zzso a member of the zzso family, is directly zzso by zzso Additionally, we show that zzso expression is zzso in the zzso of Alzheimer's disease patients where zzso expression has been shown to be zzso In conclusion, these results further indicate the potential involvement of zzso and its target genes in the zzso of Alzheimer's zzso
