The zzso interactive domain zzso gene zzso which encodes one of the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso complex, carries zzso and is responsible for loss of protein expression in gastric zzso particularly with zzso virus zzso infection and a zzso zzso zzso We used zzso to investigate the significance of zzso loss in zzso gastric zzso cases, including 67 zzso and 136 zzso gastric zzso zzso to a zzso zzso zzso Loss of zzso expression was significantly more frequent in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gastric zzso than in zzso zzso zzso gastric zzso zzso zzso Loss of zzso correlated with larger tumor size, advanced invasion depth, zzso zzso zzso and poor prognosis in zzso gastric zzso A correlation was found only with tumor size and zzso zzso in zzso gastric zzso but no correlation was observed in zzso gastric zzso Loss of zzso expression in zzso gastric zzso was highly frequent in the early stage of gastric zzso although zzso infection did not cause zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso failed to show loss of zzso and zzso infection did not cause loss of zzso in gastric zzso cell zzso Taken together, loss of zzso may be an early change in zzso and may zzso zzso infection in gastric zzso cells, while loss of zzso promotes cancer progression in gastric cancer cells without zzso infection or loss of zzso zzso Loss of zzso has different and zzso roles in gastric zzso
