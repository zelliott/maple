In an effort to better understand the zzso effects of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we report the coordination chemistry of these zzso with the zzso metal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These complexes are compared with their zzso zzso which were reported zzso The crystal structures of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are reported where similar zzso coordination modes of the zzso are zzso In pure zzso all complexes except the zzso compounds exhibit zzso zzso zzso Fe, zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso All complexes show zzso reductions at low zzso zzso in a mixed zzso zzso only zzso zzso responses from the Co and zzso zzso zzso all complexes show zzso activity against the zzso zzso cell line similar to zzso or significantly greater than that of the zzso zzso which suggests a mechanism that does not only involve the zzso activity of these zzso In fact, we suggest that the complexes act as zzso transport zzso that allow entrance to the cell and enable the delivery of both the zzso and metal which act in concert to inhibit zzso
