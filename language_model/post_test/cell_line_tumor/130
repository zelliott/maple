zzso zzso C zzso zzso zzso is considered to participate in formation of zzso zzso which represents the first stage of zzso zzso However, the mechanism of how zzso is involved in zzso formation is not precisely zzso Using zzso cells, we demonstrated here that zzso was zzso from zzso to zzso membrane zzso known as zzso zzso within 30 zzso after zzso growth zzso zzso zzso which was accompanied by zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The protein zzso C zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso themselves decreased zzso zzso levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso zzso zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso Treatment of cells with zzso a zzso zzso attenuated the zzso of zzso to zzso zzso and the zzso formation induced by zzso although zzso of zzso was not zzso zzso and zzso analysis indicated that zzso stimulation induced the zzso of zzso to zzso zzso in the edge of zzso and formation of the complex with zzso Moreover, we demonstrated that zzso of zzso zzso resulted in significant zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest a novel role for zzso in zzso formation induced by zzso via the zzso of zzso association with zzso and zzso of zzso in the membrane zzso
