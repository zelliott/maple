Emerging evidence suggests that zzso zzso viral zzso zzso can be used for specific gene targeting in human zzso zzso We have developed an zzso zzso construction procedure employing fusion zzso and a single cloning step that considerably zzso the knockout zzso We demonstrate its utility by zzso genes at specific positions within human colon cancer cells as well as within immortalized normal zzso zzso This technology should be broadly zzso to in zzso studies that require the manipulation of the human zzso
