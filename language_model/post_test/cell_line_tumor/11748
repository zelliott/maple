zzso is a zzso analog that has improved zzso activity over zzso but its therapeutic potential and mechanism of action is unknown, which is important to address as zzso targets multiple signaling zzso zzso zzso the zzso but not the zzso signaling zzso in zzso human prostate cancer cells and zzso zzso melanoma zzso zzso zzso zzso in these cells apparently by zzso zzso zzso and also enhances the expression of several zzso target zzso zzso and zzso zzso treatment significantly suppressed the growth of zzso prostate cancer zzso in zzso mice and resulted in tumor zzso zzso enhanced the expression of the zzso target zzso in zzso tumor zzso but suppressed the expression of markers of zzso cells zzso D1 and zzso In zzso mice injected with zzso cells, zzso treatment inhibited the formation of lung zzso prolonged animal survival, inhibited zzso expression and increased the expression of zzso target zzso zzso profiling of zzso regulated by zzso in zzso and in zzso showed that the zzso activity of zzso reflected the enhanced expression of potential tumor zzso zzso as well as the suppressed expression of zzso zzso including zzso Taken together, our data suggest that zzso is a potent zzso agent and selectively targets zzso signaling and zzso zzso indicating that zzso has significant potential as a therapeutic agent in various zzso
