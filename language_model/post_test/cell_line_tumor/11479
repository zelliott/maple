zzso modifications of zzso acids have long been known to affect their functional and structural zzso For instance, numerous different chemical modifications zzso the structural organization, stability or translation efficiency of zzso and zzso In contrast, little is known about modifications of zzso Here, we demonstrate for the first time that the two well-studied regulatory long zzso zzso zzso and zzso are targets of zzso zzso zzso In both zzso and zzso we found zzso zzso located within or near functionally important regions that are known to mediate interaction with zzso protein zzso We show that zzso zzso in the zzso A structure strongly affects binding to the zzso complex zzso in zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso may serve as a general strategy to regulate the function of long zzso zzso
