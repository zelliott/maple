Cancer aggressiveness is related to the ability of cancer cells to escape the zzso dependency toward the zzso zzso a process regulated by the zzso zzso and its zzso zzso Here, we characterized the expression of the zzso gene in human zzso melanoma cell lines with distinct zzso properties and investigated some of the mechanisms underlying the variations of their zzso Strong and weak expression of zzso was observed in cells with no zzso and high zzso zzso properties, zzso zzso and DNA binding of the zzso factors zzso zzso protein 1 zzso (both acting as zzso and nuclear factor I zzso (a strong zzso to the zzso promoter were demonstrated in all cell zzso A reduced expression of zzso combined with a dramatic increase in zzso correlated with the suppression of zzso expression in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells entirely abolished their zzso in zzso zzso These zzso melanoma cell lines might therefore prove particularly useful as cellular models to investigate zzso function in the zzso of invasive zzso zzso
