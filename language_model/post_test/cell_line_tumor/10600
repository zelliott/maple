zzso is known to play important role in the development and progression of many zzso including pancreatic zzso Studies have shown that the acquisition of zzso transition zzso zzso and induction of cancer stem cell zzso or cancer zzso cell zzso are highly zzso and contributes to drug resistance, tumor zzso and zzso The molecular zzso by which zzso contributes to the acquisition of zzso zzso and induction of zzso zzso capacity is poorly zzso zzso we established zzso zzso pancreatic cancer zzso cells, which showed increased cell growth, zzso and cell zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso led to the acquisition of zzso zzso by zzso of zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which is consistent with increased zzso zzso capacity and expression of zzso surface markers zzso and zzso We also found that zzso of zzso led to decreased expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso however, zzso of zzso inhibited the expression of zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso and induced the expression of zzso leading to the reversal of zzso zzso Finally, we found that zzso a natural zzso agent, inhibited cell growth, zzso cell migration and invasion, zzso zzso and formation of zzso consistent with reduced expression of zzso and zzso These results suggest, for the first time, that zzso zzso is responsible for the acquisition of zzso and zzso zzso which is in part zzso through the regulation of zzso and these zzso could be easily attenuated by zzso
