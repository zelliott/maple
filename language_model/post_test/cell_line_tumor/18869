zzso signaling pathways or zzso zzso factors represent an important category of molecular events leading to zzso gene regulation in gastric cancer, among which the role of zzso zzso remains zzso zzso is a critical zzso factor in controlling cell proliferation via zzso with the zzso signaling zzso In order to gain a knowledge of the expression of zzso and zzso in gastric cancer, a zzso analysis was carried zzso Our results showed that in about 50 and zzso of 42 tested patients with gastric cancer, the zzso expression of zzso and zzso was significantly zzso as compared with zzso normal control, zzso Besides, zzso of zzso was shown to promote the proliferation of gastric zzso cell zzso via induction of zzso zzso Taken together, our present study demonstrated for the first time the increased expression of zzso and zzso in human gastric cancer, an zzso which may zzso in zzso
