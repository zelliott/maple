There is an increasing awareness of the therapeutic potential for combining zzso therapies with chemotherapy in the treatment of zzso diseases, but few published studies evaluate possible zzso synergies between chemotherapy and zzso immune zzso Human V alpha zzso beta zzso zzso cells are being evaluated for use in zzso zzso of zzso because of their immune regulatory functions and potent zzso zzso In this study, we evaluated the zzso of combinations of chemotherapy and zzso cells to determine whether there is a potential to combine these treatment zzso for human cancer zzso The zzso of zzso cells was tested against zzso derived cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with or without prior treatment of these target cells, with a range of chemotherapy zzso Low zzso of zzso agents led to zzso of cell lines to zzso zzso with the greatest effect being observed for prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso occurred in an zzso cell in a zzso zzso zzso agents induced zzso of cell surface zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso increasing the capacity for zzso cells to recognize and kill via zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that administration of zzso immune cells after chemotherapy may increase zzso activities in comparison with the use of either treatment zzso
