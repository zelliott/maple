Human zzso in zzso mice are frequently used as zzso models of cancer to investigate the targeting of zzso In order to distinguish specific from zzso targeting of the zzso the mice can be implanted with different zzso cell zzso We studied in zzso success and growth rates after zzso of human zzso and breast cancer cells to begin an assessment of the zzso of this approach for distinguishing specific from zzso zzso zzso were undertaken to determine the effect of two different zzso zzso and prior radiation needed for one of the zzso on zzso success and growth zzso 

Female zzso mice were given 4 zzso of external beam radiation 4 days prior to subcutaneous zzso abdominal zzso of 6 zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso One week later, 3 zzso zzso zzso blood zzso zzso zzso human breast cancer cells were implanted zzso in a zzso abdominal zzso zzso were evaluated frequently zzso zzso success and growth rates were compared to those observed in zzso control groups, wherein only a single zzso of each type was zzso 

zzso zzso developed from zzso of the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were successful in the experimental zzso The zzso zzso zzso success rate was zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso success rate was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not affect the growth rate of the zzso zzso and the mean doubling time for the experimental zzso zzso was zzso days zzso zzso compared to the zzso control group mean of zzso days zzso zzso p zzso zzso Similarly, the growth rates for the zzso zzso zzso were not affected by the zzso zzso and the zzso needed for this zzso Mean doubling time for zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso was zzso days zzso zzso compared to a doubling time of zzso days zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso studies 1 and 2, zzso Mean zzso zzso zzso doubling time for the zzso control group was zzso days zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso breast cancer zzso in the same mouse did not affect zzso success or growth rates, even when zzso radiation of 4 zzso was used to promote zzso zzso These observations are not intended to imply an absence of differences in other biological parameters in this zzso or to encourage zzso of the conclusions zzso to other zzso zzso zzso our aim was to encourage other investigators to further validate these frequently used zzso
