zzso zzso zzso is essential for human zzso virus zzso entry into the sensitive zzso The zzso zzso is believed to be one of the promising approaches in zzso therapy, including gene zzso A powerful mechanism that enables to regulate gene expression is zzso interference which could be exploited to zzso zzso zzso Here, three artificial zzso directed against the human zzso zzso gene were generated and their zzso activity in indicator cells developed on the basis of the zzso cell line was zzso zzso of two or more artificial zzso in one transcript has been demonstrated to enhance the gene zzso A zzso reduction of the zzso expression has been achieved using the most efficient zzso zzso
