zzso is consistently detected in Hodgkin's lymphoma, zzso zzso and has also been detected in zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso is detected in the absence of the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that an alternative mechanism is responsible for zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso zzso and zzso are functional zzso and recent zzso analysis indicates that zzso may zzso activate the zzso zzso in zzso zzso with evidence that zzso can bind to and activate the zzso promoter, we hypothesized that expression of zzso results in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso to zzso its zzso Our data indicate that zzso zzso activates the zzso zzso in B cells and zzso zzso zzso of zzso alone is sufficient to activate its own expression and the zzso signaling domain is required as zzso is unable to activate the zzso zzso In addition, point zzso in zzso 31, 101 and 112 each results in a significant decrease in zzso promoter zzso zzso of the zzso consensus sequences results in a significant decrease in promoter zzso The observation that zzso activates its own promoter suggests that zzso exploits the zzso zzso in order to control its own expression and may explain zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso
