zzso which is predominantly zzso in the liver, is a major zzso zzso that readily zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso binding protein zzso especially the zzso delta zzso is increased in the early phase of zzso However, the role of zzso delta in zzso zzso is zzso 

Male zzso mice were zzso to one of four groups: a control group, a group receiving orally administered ethanol (4 g zzso body zzso zzso a zzso zzso group and an zzso zzso Mice were sacrificed after 5 or 10 weeks for various zzso The in zzso effect of ethanol on the expression of zzso zzso beta and delta was studied in zzso zzso 

By week 5, ethanol treatment had significantly increased liver zzso delta and beta protein expression (by zzso and zzso respectively), which then returned to the control level by week zzso In contrast, the expression of zzso alpha was evident only at week zzso The in zzso study shows that zzso delta expression was elevated significantly at 24 h but not at 48 or 72 zzso zzso beta expression was highest at 48 zzso whereas zzso alpha expression was highest at 72 zzso We also found that a low concentration of ethanol plus zzso acid enhanced zzso delta expression in zzso zzso 

zzso delta expression appears to play an important role in the early phase of zzso zzso in mice and in zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso enhances the expression of zzso delta in zzso zzso Thus, zzso delta might be a therapeutic target in alcoholic zzso
