zzso zzso zzso is the most lethal form of brain zzso With the available treatments, survival does not exceed zzso zzso from the time of zzso We describe a novel strategy to selectively induce the death of zzso cells and other cancer cells that zzso the zzso zzso Using a zzso delivery zzso that homes to the zzso zzso we target synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a strong zzso of zzso selectively to cancer zzso 

Poly zzso was delivered by means of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced rapid zzso in the target cells in zzso and in zzso zzso of several zzso and zzso zzso of zzso tumor cells was detected in zzso and in zzso zzso delivery of the zzso zzso zzso induced the complete zzso of zzso zzso tumors in nude mice, with no obvious adverse toxic effects on normal brain zzso A year after treatment completion the treated mice remain zzso and zzso Similarly, zzso delivery of zzso zzso completely eliminated zzso breast cancer and zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso cancer cell lines, suggesting that the strategy is zzso to other zzso zzso 

The strategy described has yielded an effective treatment of zzso zzso zzso in an animal zzso If this strategy is translated successfully to the clinical setting, it may actually offer help to zzso zzso zzso the elimination of two additional zzso zzso zzso in zzso suggests that in principle this strategy can be applied to treat other tumors that zzso zzso
