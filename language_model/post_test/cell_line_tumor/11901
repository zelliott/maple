The interaction of nuclear and zzso genes is an essential feature in maintenance of normal cellular zzso Of 82 structural zzso that make up the zzso zzso system in the zzso zzso DNA zzso encodes 13 zzso and rest of the zzso are zzso by nuclear zzso zzso in zzso genes zzso the 13 zzso have been reported in a variety of zzso However, little is known about the nuclear response to impairment of zzso function in human zzso 

We isolated a zzso zzso of zzso zzso of a breast cancer cell zzso Our study suggests that depletion of zzso results in zzso stress, causing increased zzso zzso in breast cancer zzso Using a zzso zzso we compared differences in the nuclear gene expression profile between a breast cancer cell line zzso zzso and its zzso zzso impaired in zzso zzso zzso of several nuclear genes involved in cell zzso cell architecture, energy zzso cell growth, zzso including general zzso factor zzso zzso zzso was induced in zzso zzso zzso of several genes was also down zzso These include zzso C, zzso related zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso C, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso dependent zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso zzso growth and zzso 

zzso impairment in breast cancer cells results in altered expression of nuclear genes involved in zzso cellular architecture, zzso cell growth and zzso and zzso These genes may mediate the cross talk between zzso and the zzso
