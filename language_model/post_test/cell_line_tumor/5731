The expression profile and functions of the zzso zzso small zzso had remained zzso Using specific zzso against zzso we found the protein to be exceptionally enriched in zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the embryonic mouse zzso In the adult brain, zzso is rather specifically expressed in zzso zzso zzso protein zzso mature zzso but is not clearly zzso in either zzso zzso zzso zzso mature zzso or zzso zzso zzso In probing for specific functions of zzso we found that zzso zzso in zzso cells resulted in abnormal trafficking of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pull-down zzso and zzso analysis indicated that zzso could associate with zzso in a zzso zzso zzso is thus a zzso protein specifically expressed in the zzso lineage and may have a role in regulating zzso trafficking in some cell zzso Given that zzso signaling zzso zzso development and zzso of multiple cell types, zzso may thus have specific zzso or zzso roles in cell types which it is enriched zzso
