It was believed that tumors originated from the transformation of their zzso stem zzso However, bone zzso cells zzso which possess an unexpected degree of plasticity and often reside in other zzso might also represent a potential source of zzso To study whether zzso play a role in the source of other tumors, zzso from mice were treated with zzso until zzso transformation was zzso Here we show that transformed zzso could form many tumor types, including zzso tumors, neural tumors, muscular tumors, tumors of zzso blood vessel zzso tumors, and tumors of poor differentiation in zzso Moreover, a single transformed zzso has the ability to zzso differentiate spontaneously into various types of tumor cells in zzso express markers associated with zzso and form zzso in zzso These data suggest that zzso cancer stem cells seemed to originate from transformed zzso zzso these findings reveal that zzso might be a source of many tumor types, even zzso In addition, zzso cancer stem cells might originate from zzso transformed zzso
