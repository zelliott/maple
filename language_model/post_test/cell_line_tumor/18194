zzso a major zzso in brown sea algae, has recently been demonstrated by us to inhibit the proliferation of colon cancer cells, and this effect was associated with growth zzso These results, taken together with previous studies with zzso suggest that it may be useful in zzso of other human zzso The present study was designed to evaluate the molecular mechanisms of zzso against zzso cancer using the human zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso reduced the viability of zzso cells accompanied with the induction of cell cycle arrest during the zzso phase at 25 zzso This concentration of zzso inhibited the zzso of the zzso protein zzso at zzso zzso zzso position 18 h after zzso The zzso activity of zzso D and zzso complex, responsible for the zzso of zzso zzso site, was zzso 18 h after the zzso Western zzso analysis revealed that the expression of zzso zzso protein was suppressed by treatment of zzso This reduction was partially blocked by concurrent treatment with the zzso inhibitor zzso indicating the involvement of the zzso zzso In addition, zzso analysis revealed that zzso also appeared to repress zzso D zzso Thus, both the protein degradation and zzso repression seem to be responsible for suppressed zzso D level in zzso zzso cells which may be related to the zzso zzso
