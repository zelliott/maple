A series of zzso and zzso were prepared and examined for alpha zzso alpha zzso and zzso zzso zzso receptors binding affinities as well as zzso activity against human tumor cell zzso Among the compounds tested, zzso zzso zzso exhibited a significant affinity for both alpha zzso and zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso showed the highest binding affinity to alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso displayed the highest zzso affinity with a Ki value of zzso zzso and a high selectivity with respect to alpha zzso and zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso None of the tested zzso zzso displayed zzso zzso
