zzso toxicity associated with Wilson's disease is known to cause zzso damage and death in the zzso zzso and frontal zzso leading to zzso symptoms and cognitive zzso Our previous work in cultured human zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso is dependent on the induction and nuclear zzso of the tumor zzso zzso zzso Because zzso acts as a zzso zzso factor, this work used an zzso array to identify zzso target genes that are zzso regulated in zzso zzso zzso representing 145 human genes expressed downstream of zzso were zzso with labeled zzso from control and zzso zzso zzso regulated zzso included those involved in the regulation of the cell cycle, zzso mechanisms, and zzso zzso zzso of cells with a zzso zzso construct enabled us to determine which molecular events were dependent on zzso zzso zzso treatment resulted in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso all known to participate in cell cycle zzso zzso mechanisms included the zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso 70 and zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso mechanisms leading to zzso were identified including zzso growth factor binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and several members of the zzso active zzso family of zzso Thus it appears that following zzso zzso DNA damage, the regulation of a variety of zzso and zzso genes are responsible for determining zzso zzso
