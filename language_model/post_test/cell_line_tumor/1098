zzso zzso virus 1 encodes at least four genes whose functions include blocking zzso induced by zzso agents zzso zzso zzso zzso and BAD zzso or zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso lacking both copies of the alpha 4 zzso zzso one of these four zzso encodes a zzso zzso that has been demonstrated to block zzso induced by zzso cellular proteins or by the zzso zzso The zzso acid context of zzso zzso by zzso is similar to that of the zzso protein zzso zzso We report that zzso the pattern of proteins zzso by zzso in zzso cells or in cells infected with zzso virus zzso that of zzso targeted by zzso zzso zzso of zzso blocks zzso induced by zzso zzso or by BAD protein independently of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso peptides containing the zzso or zzso targeted by zzso including that present in the regulatory type II alpha zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso cells the regulatory type II alpha zzso is zzso in a zzso zzso We conclude that a major zzso of the zzso activity of the zzso protein zzso is the zzso of zzso zzso by either or both zzso
