zzso resistance represents a major problem for disease management in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been shown to zzso the cell cycle, to induce zzso and to sensitize cancer cells for other zzso Our study shows that the zzso zzso acid zzso and the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso the zzso effects of each other towards several cancer cell zzso This zzso with the zzso degradation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by the zzso or zzso Moreover, we found that zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso can zzso resistance against zzso and zzso Both zzso interact with zzso and compete with other zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso may contribute to chemotherapy resistance as zzso zzso Since the biological effects of zzso and zzso could be achieved at zzso used in current treatment zzso the combined application of these compounds might be considered as a potential strategy for cancer zzso
