Currently, only patients with zzso tumors are candidates for zzso zzso However, recent clinical observations suggest that the survival of patients with zzso breast zzso who lack zzso amplification, may benefit from zzso therapy that targets zzso In this study, we explored a mechanism through which these benefits may be zzso zzso by the hypothesis that zzso signaling in breast zzso cells zzso promotes zzso and survival, we obtained evidence that zzso 1 zzso produced by zzso promotes their proliferation and zzso in zzso tumors, including in zzso breast zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or both receptors reduced breast zzso survival and zzso in zzso and in zzso and increased zzso sensitivity to zzso zzso Through a tissue zzso analysis, we found that zzso expression and associated zzso zzso occurred in a subset of zzso breast zzso Our results offer an explanation for why zzso zzso blocks the growth of zzso breast zzso Moreover, they argue that dual zzso of zzso and zzso may offer a useful therapeutic strategy to target zzso in these zzso In generating a zzso rationale to apply zzso therapies in patients with zzso tumors, this work shows why these therapies could benefit a considerably larger number of patients with breast cancer than they currently zzso
