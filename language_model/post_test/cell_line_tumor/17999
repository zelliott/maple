To examine the significance of zzso of zzso zzso protein 1 zzso expression in gastric zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso infection zzso gastric zzso inflammation and DNA damage of zzso cells, which associate with gastric zzso zzso is expressed after DNA damage and zzso zzso in human cell zzso 

zzso zzso and corpus zzso were obtained from 13 patients with chronic zzso and 17 with gastric zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso was examined by zzso reverse zzso zzso chain reaction and zzso of zzso zzso was studied by direct sequence zzso The grade of zzso was assessed according to the updated Sydney zzso zzso were compared between patients with gastric cancer and chronic zzso 

In the zzso zzso zzso expression was significantly lower in patients with gastric cancer than in those with chronic zzso ( zzso In patients with chronic zzso expression of zzso zzso was significantly higher in the zzso than in the corpus ( zzso In patients with chronic zzso zzso zzso with high zzso expression tended to have severe zzso zzso No zzso was found at zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso gastric zzso expression of zzso would be higher when the inflammation is severe or zzso zzso is zzso Insufficient expression of zzso may play a role in gastric zzso in patients infected with zzso zzso zzso
