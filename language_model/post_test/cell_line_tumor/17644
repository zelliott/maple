zzso is a member of a novel family of nuclear zzso zzso identified through their ability to interact with the zzso zzso The zzso role of these zzso is largely unknown, but we have recently reported on the involvement of zzso in the induction of zzso of tumor cells after zzso stress through zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso drug zzso increases zzso protein expression and its zzso activity, and that zzso is involved in zzso zzso Indeed, induction of zzso and of cell death by zzso are efficiently inhibited by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso or the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso efficiently reduces the zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene promoters as well as zzso cell death after treatment with zzso These findings, along with the involvement of zzso zzso at zzso 46 zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso gene zzso suggest a critical role for zzso in triggering zzso zzso in response to the zzso drug zzso
