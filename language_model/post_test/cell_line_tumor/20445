The regulation of cell zzso is a dynamic process under the control of multiple protein complexes acting in a coordinated zzso zzso zzso zzso and their zzso products are widely involved in zzso regulation by interacting with proteins regulating zzso Class II zzso zzso have been implicated in the regulation of the zzso zzso although their exact role and mechanism of action remain to be zzso In this report, we have identified zzso a zzso family zzso zzso exchange factor zzso as an interaction partner of zzso zzso was zzso with zzso in zzso cells and cancer cell zzso zzso of Class II zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso led to increased stress zzso formation and cell zzso zzso we found high zzso zzso activity and increased serum response factor zzso zzso downstream of zzso upon serum zzso In contrast, the zzso form of zzso strongly reduced cell spreading and stress zzso formation, as well as zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells strongly increased zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but failed to show similar effect in the cells with the zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso growth factor zzso and zzso stimulation led to increased zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in cells with elevated zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, increased expression of zzso protected zzso from zzso death zzso in a zzso zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that zzso zzso the cell zzso and survival through a specific interaction with zzso and the zzso of zzso
