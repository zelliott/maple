The dynamic reorganization of zzso zzso is regulated by a large number of zzso zzso Among them, the interaction of zzso with zzso and zzso zzso is very important, since it zzso zzso zzso It also positively influences zzso zzso The activity of zzso is zzso regulated by zzso and zzso at zzso with the zzso form zzso being zzso Here, we studied the effects of zzso of zzso and two zzso zzso in the human colon zzso zzso cell zzso We have generated the zzso cells expressing three different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 Ala zzso zzso zzso or zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso inactive zzso The cells expressing zzso zzso were characterized by abundant cell spreading and zzso of zzso with the zzso zzso Similar effects were observed in cells expressing zzso zzso In contrast, zzso cells expressing zzso zzso remained zzso in zzso and zzso was equally distributed within the cell zzso Furthermore, the migration ability of zzso cells expressing different zzso zzso was zzso In comparison to control cells, we have noticed a zzso approximately fourfold increase in the migration factor value of cells zzso zzso type zzso The zzso of zzso zzso resulted in an almost complete zzso of cell zzso The zzso of zzso pool in the zzso of zzso cells expressing zzso zzso has shown a significantly lower level of total zzso in reference to control zzso The opposite effect was observed in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso In zzso the results of our experiments indicate that zzso zzso of zzso is a factor affecting the zzso zzso organization and migration abilities of colon zzso zzso zzso
