zzso C zzso is a novel zzso compound isolated from the saline soil derived fungus zzso zzso Our previous study showed that zzso exerted a potent zzso effect on many kinds of cancer cell lines, especially on human lung cancer zzso zzso Here, we report the zzso mechanisms of zzso in a variety of lung cancer zzso The results showed that zzso induced zzso zzso cell death and elevated zzso zzso oxygen species zzso Interestingly, if zzso was blocked by zzso or zzso zzso zzso triggered a shift from zzso cell death into zzso zzso cell zzso In addition, zzso with the zzso zzso or zzso could effectively reverse the effect of the enhanced zzso oxygen species production, which in turn almost completely prevented the cell death induced by zzso Thus, this study provided new insights into the mechanisms underlying zzso cell death, which indicated that zzso could be a potential drug candidate for therapy of lung zzso
