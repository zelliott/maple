Atomic force zzso enables the simultaneous acquisition of high-resolution topographical and zzso data allowing integrated analysis of cell surfaces during development and zzso and, zzso can link molecular and zzso zzso Here we used atomic force zzso to zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso differentiated zzso zzso zzso zzso sample preparation techniques enabled zzso and zzso zzso zzso Comparative analysis using atomic force zzso and scanning electron zzso demonstrated the utility of atomic force zzso for examining tissue zzso and its ability to generate data allowing differentiation of cells from different origins to be zzso At low resolution atomic force zzso produced zzso data complementary to scanning electron zzso images, whilst at high resolution atomic force zzso captured novel cell surface structural detail for both zzso and zzso cell zzso Analysis of surface zzso provided zzso data which enabled qualitative and quantitative differences between samples to be zzso This study provides an important zzso of sample preparation enabling more generalized atomic force zzso zzso for cellular analysis required for advanced cell surface zzso zzso
