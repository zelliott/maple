The development of hormone zzso prostate cancer marks the onset of the terminal phase of the zzso Despite the use of traditional zzso drugs as well as many novel agents life expectancy is not significantly increased beyond zzso care zzso zzso is a zzso that is incorporated into a number of essential zzso and a minimum intake is necessary for the maintenance of zzso In the last few years evidence has accumulated from zzso and limited zzso control data that zzso doses of zzso could inhibit the progression of prostate zzso While much attention has focused on its use as a zzso agent, its use as specific therapy has been zzso We hypothesized that dietary supplementation of zzso would inhibit the progression of hormone zzso prostate cancer in an experimental zzso 

We established zzso zzso tumors in the zzso of 6-week-old male nude mice and fed them a baseline zzso replete diet zzso zzso supplementing intake with different forms of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at 2 different zzso zzso and 3 zzso in drinking zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly retarded the growth of primary zzso tumors and the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso which was associated with a decrease in zzso 

High dose dietary supplementation of zzso zzso zzso the progression of hormone zzso prostate cancer, which is due at least in part to a decrease in zzso
