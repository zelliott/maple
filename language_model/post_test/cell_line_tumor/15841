zzso breast zzso have several zzso distinguishing molecular features, but most of these are features of the cancer cells zzso The unique zzso zzso and more generally, zzso features of zzso breast zzso have not been well zzso To identify characteristic zzso features of zzso breast cancer, we performed zzso of several zzso breast cancer cell lines with zzso and compared these with zzso of zzso breast cancer cell lines with zzso zzso between zzso cancer cells and zzso induced expression of numerous zzso and zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Under the influence of zzso zzso breast cancer cell lines also showed increased migration in zzso zzso was less pronounced for zzso zzso but, these lines were more likely to have altered zzso These differences were relevant to tumor biology in zzso as the gene set that distinguished zzso and zzso zzso interactions in zzso also zzso zzso from zzso tumors with zzso accuracy in zzso zzso and zzso accuracy in an independent test zzso However, comparisons between zzso where cells were in direct contact and zzso where interaction was solely through soluble factors suggest that there is an important impact of direct zzso zzso The zzso and gene expression changes invoked by cancer cell interactions with zzso support the zzso and zzso interactions as intrinsic features of breast cancer zzso
