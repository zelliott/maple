zzso has been implicated in the zzso of human prostate cancer zzso and is the target of a new treatment for zzso breast cancer using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, a novel zzso emitting zzso zzso which targets the zzso zzso domain on zzso cells, was prepared and evaluated in zzso We used zzso flow zzso and Western zzso analysis to examine the expression of zzso in a panel of established human zzso cell lines, used the zzso zzso to evaluate the zzso of zzso on these cell lines and the zzso zzso to document zzso The results indicate that zzso cells express high levels of zzso zzso in contrast, zzso 145 cells express low to medium levels, and zzso cells express an zzso level of zzso zzso zzso was specifically zzso to zzso cells in a zzso fashion, cause the cells to undergo zzso whereas zzso 145 showed an zzso zzso response to zzso zzso In contrast, zzso cells were resistant to zzso zzso The zzso induced zzso in zzso cells could be inhibited by incubation with zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso might be a promising new agent for the treatment of zzso cancer cell clusters or zzso with high levels of zzso zzso
