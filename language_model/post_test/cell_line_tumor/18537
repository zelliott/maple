zzso are the most common primary zzso of the central nervous system, with nearly 15,000 diagnosed annually in the United States and a zzso approaching zzso within the first year of zzso zzso The marked induction of zzso in zzso suggests that it is a necessary part of zzso zzso however, the precise molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of brain zzso growth and zzso remain zzso Here we report that a candidate zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in regulating brain zzso growth and zzso zzso of zzso is significantly reduced in zzso as compared with normal human brain zzso and the extent of reduction zzso with the progression from lower to higher grades of zzso In mice, zzso of human zzso zzso which has decreased expression of zzso grow significantly faster and have higher vascular volume zzso than control zzso We show that zzso physically interacts with zzso zzso zzso of nuclear factor zzso and that zzso regulates brain zzso zzso through zzso repression of zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso has an important role in brain zzso zzso
