zzso zzso coated zzso quantum dots zzso zzso were successfully zzso via a zzso zzso route in an zzso system at room zzso The as prepared products were characterized by transmission electron microscope zzso energy zzso spectrum zzso X-ray zzso zzso zzso zzso transform infrared zzso zzso X-ray zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso spectrum zzso The zzso zzso were about 5 zzso in diameter and exhibited excellent zzso and zzso zzso The cellular distribution, zzso and zzso of zzso zzso with different amount of zzso zzso were also investigated by laser scanning zzso microscope zzso and zzso zzso in human pancreatic zzso zzso zzso All the results reveal that these zzso could be easily zzso by cells and localized in zzso around zzso Moreover, zzso zzso were proved to be low zzso (the concentration of zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso and high zzso (the zzso energy density zzso 2 zzso zzso W zzso within zzso cells, which was mainly due to the zzso silk zzso The resulted zzso zzso might have many potential applications in tumor imaging and zzso And the synthesis strategy could be easily extended to fabrication of other zzso coated with silk zzso
