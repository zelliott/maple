To explore the effects and mechanism of zzso in the growth zzso of zzso cancer both in zzso and in zzso 

After the treatment of zzso the cellular proliferation of human zzso cancer cell line zzso was detected by the method of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to determine the cellular zzso And the location of nuclear factor zzso was identified by the method of zzso zzso Western zzso was employed to detect the cellular expressions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells were injected zzso into nude mice to establish a zzso zzso After 2 weeks of zzso the mice were zzso into 2 groups zzso zzso zzso zzso vehicle alone zzso zzso zzso (5 zzso daily by zzso zzso All treatments lasted for 2 zzso At Week 7 zzso the mice were sacrificed and their tumor weights and zzso rates zzso zzso was used to detect the positive expressions of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso 

The proliferation of zzso cancer cells was inhibited significantly by zzso at 20, 40, 80 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso all P zzso zzso zzso rate induced by zzso was more significant than that of the control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso all P zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso could significantly lower the nuclear expression of zzso The expressions of zzso and zzso were zzso in zzso cells after the treatment of zzso But zzso had no effect on the expression of zzso The final tumor weight showed significant decrease in the test group versus the control group zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Furthermore, the positive expressions of zzso zzso and zzso decreased in tumors after the administration of zzso 

zzso exerts zzso effects on zzso cancer both in zzso and in zzso through the zzso of zzso and its regulated molecules such as zzso
