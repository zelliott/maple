We have investigated the mechanisms by which zzso zzso acid zzso causes growth zzso of zzso zzso zzso As a model, we have studied the zzso cell line, which is sensitive to zzso and the zzso cell line, which is zzso We have found that treatment of zzso cells with zzso causes a zzso fold increase in the protein level of the zzso dependent zzso inhibitor zzso zzso protein zzso is important in zzso zzso as primary tumors are frequently found lacking this zzso The increase in zzso is detected by day 3 of zzso treatment of zzso cells, and is zzso by day zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso do not change in zzso cells following zzso treatment, however, we have shown that zzso zzso is more stable in zzso treated zzso zzso zzso the zzso resistant cell line zzso fails to show zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso component protein zzso appears to be decreased in zzso cells treated with zzso We have also shown that the zzso dependent increase in zzso protein in zzso cells leads to a decrease in the zzso activity of zzso dependent zzso 4 zzso following zzso zzso Finally, we found that zzso cells zzso zzso with a zzso zzso which express lower levels of zzso following zzso treatment, and have a higher zzso zzso activity are less sensitive to zzso induced growth zzso Taken together our data suggest zzso growth zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells involves zzso of the zzso inhibitor zzso
