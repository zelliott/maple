zzso agents such as zzso zzso or zzso are well-established drugs in clinical treatment of zzso zzso However, because of their highly complex chemical structures, the synthesis and hence the supply issues are still quite zzso Here we set on stage zzso a chemically accessible precursor of zzso that was identified as a potent zzso agent produced by zzso Although much simpler in chemical structure, zzso abrogates proliferation and long-term survival as well as zzso growth, and also zzso zzso and zzso in invasive tumor cells equally potent to zzso Moreover, zzso zzso in zzso efficacy shown in a chicken zzso membrane zzso model with zzso zzso tumor cells, in a mouse zzso model using zzso zzso cancer cells and finally in a model of lung zzso induced by zzso mouse breast cancer zzso zzso zzso cell death via the intrinsic zzso zzso by zzso the expression of pivotal zzso zzso namely zzso and zzso and shows distinct zzso properties in combination with TRAIL in two- and three-dimensional cell culture zzso zzso the underlying signaling pathways provides novel information: zzso zzso zzso degradation of zzso by zzso of zzso protein zzso (especially zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso which is then targeted by the zzso zzso zzso zzso complex for zzso and zzso In sum, we designate the zzso compound zzso as a highly promising novel agent for zzso treatment and zzso treatment of invasive zzso
