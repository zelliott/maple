Human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso for target cell entry in the acute phase of infection, while later in disease progression the virus switches to the zzso zzso in approximately 50% of zzso In response to zzso the zzso immune response is zzso and zzso zzso production is zzso to block zzso zzso We recently determined that zzso cells zzso can efficiently capture zzso zzso restore zzso and transmit infectious virus to target zzso Here, we tested the effect of zzso on trans transmission of zzso or zzso zzso zzso We observed that transmission of zzso by immature as well as mature zzso was significantly higher for zzso than zzso viral zzso Additionally, zzso zzso directed against either the zzso or zzso region of the envelope such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibited transmission of zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso virus demonstrated zzso or increased zzso To further study the effects of zzso usage we tested zzso cloned zzso zzso with modifications in the envelope that were based on zzso zzso zzso and zzso variable loop sequences from a patient progressing to zzso We observed that zzso zzso facilitated infection of zzso T zzso of viral strains with an envelope zzso found late in zzso Taken together, our results illustrate that zzso transmit zzso zzso much more efficiently than zzso zzso we zzso that this discrimination could contribute to the in zzso zzso switch after zzso and could be responsible for the increase in viral zzso
