zzso zzso is most frequently associated with zzso in zzso which encodes a class zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to the zzso zzso zzso in competition with zzso zzso zzso zzso is released from zzso by increasing zzso of zzso and free zzso may then regulate iron zzso by binding other zzso To search for new zzso zzso we expressed zzso forms of zzso in the human cell line zzso zzso protein was zzso zzso and made into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso in competition with zzso but in addition we detected a binding activity on some cell types that was not blocked by zzso or by zzso in zzso that prevent binding to zzso We identified this second zzso zzso as the zzso independent zzso zzso zzso also known as the zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso binding was zzso through zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso also bound to zzso zzso bound to zzso was prevented from binding zzso until released by increasing zzso of zzso a feature consistent with an iron sensing zzso However, it remains to be determined whether zzso zzso in zzso also acquires the zzso zzso modification and binds to zzso
