zzso concentration of oxidized zzso zzso zzso is higher in women with zzso than in normal pregnant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the scavenger receptors for zzso and is abundantly expressed in zzso It is well known that zzso activates nuclear factor zzso zzso factor 2 zzso a master regulator of zzso and zzso genes such as zzso zzso zzso which play an important role in zzso However, it has yet to be zzso whether zzso along with zzso zzso in the pathology of zzso 

The objective of the study was to assess zzso expression and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and to manifest their zzso roles in zzso 

zzso and regulation of zzso zzso and zzso were evaluated by real-time quantitative zzso and Western zzso The functions of zzso and zzso were examined using an zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso a zzso cell line, and zzso zzso 

Both zzso expression and zzso zzso were significantly decreased in zzso zzso compared with normal zzso A significant decrease in zzso zzso was found in zzso zzso cultures under hypoxic zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in both the zzso cells and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso increased zzso zzso whereas the blockade of zzso inhibited the increase of zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso may contribute to high zzso zzso low zzso zzso and low zzso zzso These findings provide novel insights into the crucial role of zzso and zzso in the zzso of zzso
