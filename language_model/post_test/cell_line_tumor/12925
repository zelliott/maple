zzso the zzso trafficking of zzso zzso by zzso cells is a critical issue in zzso intimately linked to therapeutic applications but also to toxicity zzso While the zzso mechanisms of carbon zzso and zzso particles have been investigated fairly zzso there are few studies on the migration and fate of zzso zzso other than natural zzso Interestingly, protein zzso are emerging as tools in personalized medicines because of their zzso and functional zzso and are particularly promising for gene therapy and also conventional drug zzso Here, we have investigated the zzso and zzso of zzso migration of protein zzso built up by a zzso zzso zzso and zzso by a zzso zzso zzso terminal zzso Interestingly, protein zzso are first localized in zzso but an early zzso escape allows them to reach and accumulate in the nucleus (but not in the zzso with a migration speed of zzso zzso higher than that expected for passive zzso Interestingly, the zzso instead of the nuclear membrane is the main cellular barrier in the nuclear way of zzso zzso zzso
