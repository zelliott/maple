zzso zzso factor zzso has recently been shown to be the most potent inhibitor of zzso in the zzso eye, and is involved in the zzso of zzso eye disease such as zzso diabetic zzso However, a functional role for zzso in tumor growth and zzso remains to be zzso In this study, we have investigated both the in zzso and in zzso growth characteristics of human zzso melanoma zzso cell lines, zzso zzso to zzso human zzso zzso levels of zzso proteins in melanoma cell lines zzso and zzso were comparable with that of human cultured zzso whereas vascular zzso growth factor levels in two tumor cell lines were much stronger than that in normal zzso zzso of zzso was found to significantly inhibit tumor growth and vessel formation in zzso nude mice zzso Furthermore, in zzso proliferation rates of zzso cells were decreased in zzso zzso zzso proteins showed zzso induced growth zzso and zzso cell death in zzso zzso cells, which were completely prevented by treatment with zzso against the zzso zzso Our present study highlights two beneficial effects of zzso treatment on melanoma growth and zzso one is the suppression of tumor zzso and the other is induction of zzso zzso zzso in tumor zzso zzso therefore might be a promising novel therapeutic agent for treatment of patients with zzso
