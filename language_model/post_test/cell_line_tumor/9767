A unique acquisition method is proposed for zzso zzso zzso MR zzso imaging for the study of drug distribution aiming at zzso zzso information in zzso The use of fast spin echo zzso at zzso allowed us to obtain zzso images with minimal effect of magnetic zzso and to acquire several zzso signals simultaneously by the method of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was designed for simultaneous, zzso zzso imaging and zzso zzso A time course study including all the main zzso at 10-minute resolution was attained with an oral dose of 1-2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso With acquisition parameters zzso for in zzso zzso of 40 zzso images of zzso effective zzso of the zzso drug zzso were obtained at the level of 200 zzso in the tumor for all the mice studied with a linear correlation (R zzso zzso between image intensity and the quantity determined in the excised zzso The method exhibits potential capability of molecular imaging with a variety of zzso compounds and drug zzso
