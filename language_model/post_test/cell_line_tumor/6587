zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso in zzso In diabetic individuals, altered rates of zzso are responsible for increased zzso zzso output and sustained zzso zzso zzso of zzso has not been assessed to date as a treatment for zzso We have designed a zzso zzso zzso approach to induce zzso gene zzso of zzso zzso using zzso gene zzso A transient reduction of zzso zzso activity zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso that correlated with decreased protein content of up to 50% was achieved using this strategy in diabetic zzso zzso partial zzso was sufficient to demonstrate lowered blood zzso zzso zzso 26 vs 364 zzso 33 zzso P zzso zzso and improved zzso tolerance together with decreased circulating zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso (65 zzso 11 vs 102 zzso 16 zzso P zzso zzso in the absence of liver zzso or zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso animals, suggesting a role for this zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso These data reinforce the significance of zzso in sustaining zzso zzso and validate zzso intervention at the level of zzso for diabetes gene zzso
