zzso silicon particles zzso with a pore size in the range of zzso zzso were modified with zzso zzso to yield zzso zzso which were subsequently zzso with zzso Thus, zzso particles were zzso with the zzso zzso mainly anchored inside the zzso of the zzso zzso These hybrid particles were used as carriers to deliver zzso to human breast cancer zzso Due to the gradual degradation of the zzso zzso under zzso conditions, the zzso zzso were released from the pore interior in a sustained zzso zzso characterization revealed that the released zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso shape and narrow particle size distribution between 15 and 30 zzso Gene zzso against the zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer gene showed dramatic gene zzso zzso Moreover, comprehensive zzso studies were performed for the zzso particles both in zzso and in zzso and demonstrated that the zzso particles exhibited significantly enhanced zzso As a consequence, zzso porous silicon particles may have substantial potential as safe and effective zzso delivery zzso
