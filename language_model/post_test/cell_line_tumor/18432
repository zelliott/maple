Using zzso shuttle zzso we identified six zzso zzso zzso from the zzso strain that exhibited decreased adherence and cell zzso zzso zzso chain reaction and DNA sequencing revealed that the same locus was interrupted in these six zzso zzso and zzso acid sequences showed no zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This novel open reading frame contained zzso base zzso The zzso acid sequence shared zzso identity with a putative zzso zzso in zzso zzso and 23 and zzso identity with type zzso restriction zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso showed zzso activity with the recognition and zzso site zzso Two open reading frames were located upstream of the gene zzso zzso Together, zzso and these two putative zzso zzso and zzso function as a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso genes were found in 9 of the 15 zzso zzso strains zzso When compared with the full zzso significantly lower G + C content of zzso zzso genes implied that these genes might have been acquired by horizontal gene zzso zzso DNA transformation efficiencies and zzso DNA zzso zzso demonstrated protection from zzso zzso by the zzso zzso In conclusion, we have identified a novel zzso system present in approximately zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso system results in cell zzso and zzso to zzso zzso
