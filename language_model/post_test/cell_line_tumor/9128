A recent systematic sequence analysis of zzso human protein coding genes or consensus coding sequences led to the identification of 189 genes displaying zzso zzso in breast and zzso zzso Based on their zzso zzso a subset of these genes was identified as cancer candidate zzso genes as they could be potentially involved in zzso We evaluated the zzso profiles of 19 CAN genes in the highly aggressive zzso glioblastoma, melanoma, and pancreatic zzso Among other changes, we found novel zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso affecting zzso acids not previously found to be zzso in human zzso Interestingly, we also found a zzso zzso zzso of zzso that was previously reported as a zzso zzso Our results identify specific genetic zzso in glioblastoma, melanoma, and pancreatic zzso and indicate that CAN genes and their zzso profiles are tumor zzso Some of the zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso are clearly amenable to zzso intervention and could represent novel therapeutic targets for these incurable zzso We also speculate that similar to other zzso and tumor zzso zzso zzso affecting zzso could be involved in cancer zzso
