zzso is circulating as a zzso group of zzso It has been addressed that zzso can inhibit zzso replication zzso using zzso clone and/or zzso which have only one zzso The current study was conducted to assess whether zzso can inhibit different zzso zzso with many zzso and to assess whether consensus zzso have the same effect as regular zzso 

We generated two chemically zzso consensus zzso zzso and zzso which cover most known zzso zzso sequences and zzso using zzso zzso zzso positive zzso patient's serum with nine zzso was zzso zzso to zzso cell line which supports zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso according to zzso zzso technique and subsequently cultured for eight zzso zzso replication was monitored by zzso for detection of plus and minus zzso zzso zzso was used for zzso of zzso whereas detection of the viral core protein was performed by western zzso 

zzso zzso levels decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in cells zzso with zzso and zzso respectively, on Day 2 post zzso and continued for Day 3 by zzso and Day 7 by zzso Reduction of core protein expression was reported at Day 2 post zzso zzso zzso and at Day 1 post zzso zzso which was persistent for Day 4 for the former and for Day 6 for the zzso 

Consensus zzso could be used as a new molecular target therapy to effectively inhibit zzso replication in the presence of more than one zzso zzso
