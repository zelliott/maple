In our efforts to find zzso materials of plant origin, several compounds were isolated from zzso zzso zzso The protective effect against zzso cell death was zzso and the subsequent effects on the levels of expression of Parkinson's zzso zzso and zzso were evaluated in a zzso zzso Five compounds were isolated and zzso D protected cell death against zzso in human zzso zzso zzso The effects of zzso D on the levels of zzso and protein expression of zzso and zzso were subsequently examined using reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and western zzso zzso Treatment with zzso D resulted in an zzso of zzso zzso levels and a zzso of zzso zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso protein expression was decreased in accordance with an increase in zzso protein zzso These results demonstrate that the protective effects of zzso D were presumably due to the zzso effects on the zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso expressions against zzso zzso zzso zzso D can be considered as a candidate for therapy for Parkinson's zzso
