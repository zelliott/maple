zzso resistance observed in some human tumors has prompted research in platinum derivatives that can circumvent this zzso Despite initial works reporting lack of activity of zzso zzso complexes with the general formula zzso exhibit zzso activity in zzso and zzso cell zzso Here we reported the chemical and biological properties of seven platinum complexes with zzso or zzso in trans to several zzso They show important zzso properties in tumor cell zzso Among the compounds, those with a replacement of an zzso zzso in the inactive zzso by a zzso zzso have an important enhancement of their zzso zzso In zzso no zzso nor zzso zzso was observed after treatments, and zzso was launched probably by a mechanism independent of classical checkpoints zzso Our data indicate that our compounds are not zzso with zzso and might be promising agents in the treatment of tumors unresponsive to zzso
