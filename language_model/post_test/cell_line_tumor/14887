zzso zzso as a zzso virus can be zzso with an zzso drug and has been proposed to serve as a carrier to deliver drugs to cancer cells for targeted zzso However, how zzso zzso zzso alone affects cancer cell biology is zzso zzso libraries provide an inexhaustible zzso of new zzso against tumor cells and zzso that have potential therapeutic and diagnostic applications in cancer zzso Some of these identified zzso might stimulate various cell zzso Here we identified new cell zzso peptides (and the zzso with such peptides fused to each of zzso copies of their major coat zzso using landscape zzso libraries and for the first time investigated the zzso dynamics when selected zzso are zzso into the zzso breast cancer zzso Our results show that zzso harboring zzso and zzso peptides could selectively zzso into the zzso breast cancer cells with high zzso and also show rapid involvement of membrane zzso and zzso of zzso zzso during the zzso zzso The zzso dynamics was studied by using live cell and zzso zzso The zzso zzso were found to enter breast cancer cells through energy dependent mechanism and zzso entry interferes with zzso zzso resulting in reorganization of zzso filaments and increased membrane zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest that, when zzso enters zzso cells, it triggers transient changes in the host cell zzso zzso This study also shows that using zzso zzso libraries considerably increases the repertoire of available zzso zzso with potential applications in targeted drug delivery, imaging, molecular monitoring and profiling of breast cancer zzso
