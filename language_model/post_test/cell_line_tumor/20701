To investigate the effect of zzso interference of the zzso gene on the zzso of the mouse prostate cancer cell line zzso and its zzso 

We constructed zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting the zzso gene with the molecular biological technique, and determined the expressions of zzso zzso and protein on radiation after zzso with zzso zzso by zzso using zzso and Western zzso zzso We also detected the zzso of zzso cells by zzso zzso and their zzso by zzso zzso 

The expressions of zzso zzso and protein were significantly lower in the zzso cells than in the control and negative interference groups after zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while the zzso of zzso cells remarkably higher in the zzso than in the control group after radiation treatment zzso zzso zzso The activity of zzso was markedly decreased zzso zzso zzso and the zzso rate of the zzso cells in the zzso group was zzso after radiation zzso 

zzso interference of the zzso gene could enhance the zzso of the mouse prostate cancer cell line zzso which might be associated with its zzso of zzso expression and induction of cell zzso
