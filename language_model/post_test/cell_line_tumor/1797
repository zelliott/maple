zzso protein zzso can be engineered for various bionanotechnology zzso Using the zzso scaffold of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso we introduced non-native surface zzso for zzso zzso The modified zzso zzso zzso and zzso properties were comparable to the zzso scaffold zzso and after zzso of zzso zzso zzso to these zzso the zzso remained intact and stable up to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of particles reduced zzso by human zzso zzso and zzso breast cancer cells, with decreased zzso as zzso chain length is zzso In zzso zzso and zzso zzso yielded zzso zzso zzso serum C4 remaining and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso demonstrating that complement zzso is weak for zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to these particles moderately increased complement response to give zzso zzso zzso C4 remaining and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso of the zzso protein zzso can zzso cellular zzso and induce low levels of complement zzso likely via the zzso zzso
