Here, we describe a synthetic approach for generating artificial proteins by the zzso of naturally occurring zzso zzso Two motifs respectively related to zzso induction and protein zzso were encrypted into different reading frames of an artificial gene zzso which was then zzso random frame shifts at the junctions between the zzso units yielded zzso zzso of three reading zzso Among the proteins created, zzso was found to penetrate through cell zzso and exert a strong zzso effect on several cancer cell zzso Because a simple linkage of these motifs was not sufficient to construct a zzso zzso and the successful zzso was dependent on how they were joined together, the zzso strategy is important for zzso functions from zzso of zzso This zzso approach represents a novel system for creating proteins with desired zzso
