zzso a zzso zzso zzso derived from the medicinal plant zzso zzso has been used to treat chronic inflammatory and zzso diseases, but its mechanism is not well zzso zzso we investigated the effects of zzso on cellular responses activated by zzso a potent zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso induced by zzso and zzso agents and inhibited invasion, both regulated by zzso zzso We found that zzso induced the expression of gene products involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proliferation zzso D1 and zzso invasion zzso and zzso zzso and that zzso treatment suppressed their zzso Because these gene products are regulated by zzso we zzso that zzso mediates its effects by modulating the zzso zzso We found that zzso suppressed both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to inhibit the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation, zzso nuclear zzso and zzso and zzso reporter gene zzso Recent studies indicate that zzso zzso zzso requires zzso of zzso and we indeed found that zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso Overall, our results suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso invasion through suppression of the zzso zzso
