A common feature of human zzso zzso used for cancer treatment is that their zzso efficacy requires high serum trough levels and continued therapy for several zzso Treatment cycles, zzso consume several grams of zzso translating into significant drug needs and zzso The basis for the low in zzso zzso which is in contrast to high in zzso zzso cellular zzso zzso is not well zzso Here, we have explored factors contributing to this zzso using zzso zzso a fully human zzso zzso against zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a humanized zzso with specificity for the human zzso growth factor zzso type 2 zzso zzso We found that zzso levels of human zzso strongly inhibited zzso of both zzso zzso zzso showed some dependence on the density of zzso and zzso targets, the zzso cell line tested and on zzso cell and serum zzso zzso of zzso by affinity zzso abolished the zzso effect of a serum zzso zzso of zzso was fully restored by adding back the zzso fraction or by an equal amount of zzso from a commercial zzso We further demonstrate that zzso zzso within human zzso contributed zzso to zzso and that normal serum levels of zzso effectively zzso for in zzso binding of an zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso type III zzso as is present on natural killer zzso zzso Competition of serum zzso for binding of therapeutic zzso to zzso cell may be one important reason why high zzso doses are required in the clinic for treatment of cancer by an zzso zzso
