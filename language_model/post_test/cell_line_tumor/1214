zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso which acts zzso in various tumor cell lines independent of the hormone zzso zzso We investigated whether combinations of zzso with various zzso or zzso compounds may result in an additive effect on the proliferation of human breast cancer zzso The breast cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso line zzso with the zzso gene were zzso All cell lines were incubated in the concentration range of zzso zzso to 25 zzso with zzso alone and in zzso combinations with the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The effect of zzso and zzso alone and in zzso combinations was tested in the concentration range of zzso to 1 zzso zzso was measured after 4 days using the zzso zzso In zzso cells zzso in combination with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso led to an additive zzso In zzso cells only zzso combined with zzso zzso and zzso showed an additive zzso Both zzso and zzso were nearly similar effective in zzso of the zzso zzso Here no additive effect was zzso zzso displayed zzso actions in various human breast cancer zzso In addition zzso was able to increase the zzso property of certain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits a similar property as compared to zzso in zzso the zzso zzso Since zzso was well tolerated in a recently conducted phase II trial in patients with zzso zzso breast cancer, the combination of zzso with zzso or zzso may offer a new clinically relevant treatment zzso
