The Signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso is activated in tumor cells, and zzso are able to induce the death of those zzso zzso zzso zzso which bind to the DNA zzso zzso zzso of zzso are efficient zzso However, they also inhibit zzso whose activity is essential not only to resistance to zzso but also to cell growth zzso and programmed cell death zzso The aim of this study was to design zzso zzso which do not affect zzso zzso 

New zzso with a hairpin zzso were zzso zzso were introduced, based on the comparison of zzso and zzso interactions with DNA using zzso structural zzso The designed zzso were tested for their ability to inhibit zzso but not zzso by zzso zzso cell death in the active zzso zzso colon zzso cell line, zzso absence of zzso of zzso zzso zzso cell death, zzso expression of zzso targets, and zzso nuclear location of zzso and zzso One zzso was found to efficiently induce the death of zzso cells without interfering with zzso zzso This zzso was found in a complex with zzso but not with zzso using an original zzso pull-down zzso this zzso also did not inhibit zzso zzso zzso nor did it inhibit the expression of the zzso zzso Furthermore, it prevented the nuclear transfer of zzso but not that of zzso zzso 

Comparative analyses at the atomic level revealed slight differences in zzso and zzso zzso interaction with their DNA zzso These were sufficient to design a new discriminating zzso that zzso zzso and not zzso thereby inducing tumor cell death without interfering with zzso zzso zzso interaction with zzso depends on zzso sequence modifications but might also result from DNA shape changes, known to zzso zzso zzso The finding of a zzso zzso establishes the first rational basis for designing zzso zzso zzso
