To clarify the roles of the zzso inhibitor of zzso protein zzso we investigated the effects of zzso zzso on zzso cell growth arrest and zzso in the prostate cancer cell line zzso After the zzso of zzso zzso into zzso cells, we established zzso cell lines that zzso zzso and examined the zzso effects on growth and zzso by zzso zzso salt and flow zzso zzso The effects of zzso zzso on zzso were examined by zzso analysis and activity zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso in zzso cells was examined by zzso with zzso and zzso zzso followed by zzso and zzso zzso Large amounts of zzso were expressed in the established cell zzso Although the growth rates were reduced in a zzso and zzso manner by zzso these effects were significantly decreased in zzso zzso zzso cell zzso In addition, we found that zzso treatment induced the zzso of zzso followed by zzso and that the zzso of zzso inhibited zzso by attenuating the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso bound to zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso and this interaction was inhibited by zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso through the decrease of zzso activity and zzso of the processing of zzso
