zzso zzso selectively zzso gene zzso zzso is often accompanied by replication delay and can be prevented by zzso zzso Here we report a zzso protein complex involved in the prevention of zzso zzso The protein complex interacts with an essential zzso region within the human zzso zzso zzso and includes zzso zzso zzso complex, and zzso which are members of the locus control region zzso zzso complex zzso zzso between zzso and zzso prevented zzso zzso and replication zzso zzso that did not contain the zzso zzso region of zzso zzso late and exhibited stable zzso that could not be affected by a DNA zzso zzso In contrast, zzso that contain a zzso of the zzso region of zzso that could not bind zzso exhibited a silent state that could zzso be zzso by DNA zzso The effect of DNA zzso was zzso and prolonged exposure to a zzso inhibitor induced zzso stable, zzso zzso These observations suggest that the interaction of zzso complex with zzso plays a role in preventing gene zzso and provides support for a novel, zzso mechanism of resistance to zzso zzso
