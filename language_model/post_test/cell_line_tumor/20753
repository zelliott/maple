It is widely assumed that during the zzso cell cycle, four major zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are expressed in an orderly scheduled pattern in zzso cultured zzso In zzso cultured cells and in zzso growing cells, whether these zzso are expressed in the same pattern remains zzso In this study, we investigated the expression of zzso by flow zzso and zzso in cultured zzso and zzso cells at zzso We found that, in zzso cultures, the expression levels of zzso D, zzso and A within each cell cycle phase was less than their levels in zzso zzso zzso B1 was slightly reduced in zzso phase and unexpectedly expressed in zzso zzso The zzso B1 expressed in zzso phase was localized mainly in the zzso and its level was positively correlated with zzso Moreover, we obtained similar zzso expression pattern in zzso zzso tumor cells from zzso mice and zzso cells from leukemia zzso These findings describe an altered pattern of zzso expression in zzso cultured cells as well as in zzso tumor zzso We suggest that zzso cultures might mimic the in zzso growth conditions and such experimental situation may be useful for cell cycle zzso
