zzso genes zzso have been classically defined as genes whose loss of function in tumor cells contributes to the formation and/or maintenance of the tumor zzso zzso containing nonsense zzso may not be expressed because of zzso zzso zzso zzso We combined zzso of the zzso process, which zzso transcripts that contain nonsense zzso with the application of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis to discriminate zzso content in order to identify candidate zzso in five breast cancer cell zzso We identified zzso as a target of zzso in the zzso breast cancer cell line, likely as a consequence of a zzso in zzso which introduces a premature stop zzso at position zzso zzso encodes a human zzso of zzso zzso which is an integral member of the zzso complex, an zzso zzso zzso zzso Although we did not find any zzso zzso in 11 breast tumors, which show DNA zzso loss at the zzso locus adjacent to zzso we show that low zzso zzso or nuclear protein expression is associated with more aggressive breast cancer zzso such as high tumor grade, in two independent zzso of over 200 human breast cancer cases zzso We also found that low zzso nuclear expression becomes more prevalent during the later stages of breast tumor zzso Finally, we found that zzso zzso in the zzso cell line results in significant zzso of colony formation in soft zzso These results suggest that zzso may be a candidate zzso in breast zzso
