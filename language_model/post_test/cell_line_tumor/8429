zzso II favors the development of zzso Our goal was to determine if foam cell formation increases zzso II generation by the zzso zzso system zzso and if zzso produced zzso II promotes zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso native LDL zzso or no zzso zzso of zzso genes was assessed and zzso zzso levels were zzso in media and cell zzso zzso increased zzso zzso levels and the zzso zzso ratio in cells and media after foam cell zzso zzso zzso or activity did not change, but zzso blockade completely inhibited the increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso but not protein level was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso G zzso and activities were enhanced by zzso zzso of zzso zzso or the zzso II zzso 1 zzso largely abolished zzso zzso formation in cells exposed to zzso and decreased scavenger zzso A zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso or the zzso in cells treated with oxidized LDL also decreased zzso and zzso protein and foam cell zzso zzso also increased zzso II by human peripheral blood zzso zzso whereas blockade of zzso decreased cholesterol zzso formation in these zzso These findings indicate that, during foam cell formation, zzso II generation by the zzso zzso is zzso and that zzso generated zzso II is crucial for cholesterol zzso zzso in zzso exposed to modified zzso
