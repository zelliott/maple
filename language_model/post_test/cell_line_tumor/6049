The application of small interfering zzso zzso for cancer treatment is a promising strategy currently being explored in early phase clinical zzso However, efficient systemic delivery limits clinical zzso We developed and tested a novel delivery system comprised of zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso directed against zzso and zzso a zzso zzso zzso containing both a positively charged zzso condensing block and a zzso block to facilitate zzso zzso The modular design of the carrier zzso the exchange of different targeting zzso and zzso to permit its usage in a variety of tumor zzso The zzso was zzso using the zzso addition fragmentation chain transfer zzso technique and formed zzso capable of binding zzso and zzso A zzso zzso confirmed the predicted membrane zzso activity of the zzso under zzso conditions typical of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated in zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells expressing zzso but not in zzso negative zzso zzso Gene zzso was significantly improved with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso produced zzso reduction of gene zzso This zzso zzso carrier may be useful for zzso delivery to zzso zzso
