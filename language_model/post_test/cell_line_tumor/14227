zzso bone disease is one of the major causes of morbidity and mortality in prostate cancer zzso zzso are currently used to inhibit bone zzso and reduce zzso skeletal zzso More effective zzso would enhance their clinical zzso 

We tested several zzso in a green fluorescent protein zzso human prostate cancer nude mouse zzso The in zzso effects of four zzso including zzso zzso acid, and zzso on bone tumor burden in mice zzso zzso with zzso human prostate cancer cells were zzso by zzso zzso imaging and zzso 

The zzso cells produced extensive bone zzso when injected into the zzso of zzso zzso The skeletal progression of the zzso cell growth was monitored by zzso zzso and the bone destruction was evaluated by zzso We showed that zzso acid zzso was the most effective zzso treatment in reducing tumor burden as assessed by zzso imaging and zzso The zzso tumor area and X-ray score significantly zzso zzso tumor growth in the bone was accompanied by reduced serum zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

The serum zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels were significantly correlated with zzso area and X-ray zzso Treatment with zzso reduced tumor growth in the bone measured by zzso and X-ray imaging zzso Imaging of zzso expression enables monitoring of tumor growth in the bone and the zzso results complement the X-ray assessment of bone zzso The data in this report suggest that zzso has potential as an effective inhibitor of the skeletal progression of clinical prostate zzso
