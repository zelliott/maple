zzso of zzso DNA zzso in zzso gastric zzso mostly induced by zzso zzso infection, is now known to be deeply involved in predisposition to gastric zzso zzso field zzso and zzso of zzso genes has been analyzed so zzso In this study, we aimed to clarify the involvement of zzso zzso gene zzso in the field zzso First, we selected three zzso genes as zzso after analysis of six candidate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels of the three genes zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in 56 normal gastric zzso of healthy volunteers zzso volunteers with zzso zzso and 28 zzso 45 zzso gastric zzso of gastric cancer patients (29 patients with zzso zzso and 16 zzso and 28 gastric cancer zzso (13 zzso and 15 diffuse zzso Among the healthy volunteers, individuals with zzso zzso had zzso higher zzso levels than those without zzso zzso zzso Among individuals without zzso zzso zzso gastric zzso of gastric cancer patients had zzso higher zzso levels than gastric zzso of healthy volunteers zzso zzso zzso Different from zzso zzso individuals with past zzso zzso infection retained similar zzso levels to those with current zzso In cancer zzso zzso levels were highly zzso and no difference was observed between zzso and diffuse zzso zzso This strongly indicated that zzso of zzso zzso in addition to that of zzso zzso contributed to the formation of a field zzso for gastric zzso
