zzso and zzso zzso hormone signaling act in an integrated fashion to control inflammation and immune zzso Here we establish a new mode of interaction of these two pathways and propose zzso of zzso Signaling zzso as an essential player in zzso zzso We observed that zzso zzso zzso and zzso form an zzso complex through an interaction, which required the zzso domain of zzso and the zzso binding domain of zzso Furthermore, zzso stimulation was found to increase the nuclear level of zzso zzso binding to the zzso did not require zzso binding of the zzso however, it was abolished after long term zzso zzso suggesting a functional role of the interaction for the early phase of zzso zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso appeared to zzso influence the zzso of the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso because the zzso expression of these genes was inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso and enhanced in zzso zzso embryonic zzso as compared with zzso treated zzso zzso Our results suggest a prominent role of zzso in the early phase of zzso between zzso and zzso zzso
