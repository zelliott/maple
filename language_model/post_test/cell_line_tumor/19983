The acoustic zzso technique provides some extraordinary advantages for determining mechanical properties of living zzso It is relatively fast, of excellent spatial resolution, and of minimal zzso Sound zzso is a measure of the cell zzso zzso of zzso is a measure of zzso zzso These parameters are of crucial interest for studying cell zzso and volume regulations and to establish the functional role of the various elements of the zzso Using a scanning acoustic zzso zzso wave speed, zzso and thickness profile of a biological cell were measured earlier by zzso et zzso zzso zzso 78, zzso zzso In that study it was assumed that the cell properties did not change through the cell thickness but could vary in the lateral zzso In that effort the zzso signal was modeled as a plane wave striking the cell at normal zzso Such assumptions ignored the effect of cell zzso and the surface zzso zzso zzso In this paper a rigorous lens model, based on the zzso zzso point source zzso is zzso For the first time in the literature the cell is modeled here as a zzso material and the effect of some external drug stimuli on a living cell is zzso
