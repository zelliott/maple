The effect of zzso a potential zzso drug, on zzso free zzso levels zzso and growth in zzso human prostate cancer cells was examined by using zzso as a fluorescent zzso indicator and zzso as a fluorescent growth zzso zzso at zzso above 10 zzso increased zzso in a zzso manner with an zzso value of 100 zzso zzso zzso influx was confirmed by zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso signal was also reduced by removing zzso zzso zzso with 1 zzso zzso (an zzso zzso zzso pump zzso to zzso the zzso zzso zzso nearly abolished 200 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso completely inhibited zzso zzso zzso The zzso release induced by 200 zzso zzso was not affected by zzso zzso C with 2 zzso zzso Overnight treatment with zzso zzso zzso decreased cell viability in a zzso zzso These findings suggest that in human zzso prostate cancer cells, zzso increases zzso by evoking zzso zzso influx and releasing zzso zzso from the zzso zzso via a zzso zzso zzso zzso may be zzso to prostate cancer zzso
