zzso production of zzso IX zzso is successfully exploited for zzso therapy zzso on zzso cells, following zzso acid zzso administration and light zzso This treatment kills cancer cells by damaging zzso and zzso zzso pathways via cellular zzso oxygen species zzso zzso We studied the efficiency of zzso zzso from zzso on zzso generation, in the zzso resistant zzso zzso resistant zzso and sensitive zzso zzso leukemia cell zzso zzso were incubated 4 zzso with 1 zzso zzso and then zzso during different times with fluorescent zzso One hour later, production of zzso was analyzed by flow zzso using different fluorescent zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for hydrogen zzso zzso damage was examined with zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso production in the three cell lines increased with zzso time whereas no zzso hydrogen was zzso zzso damage also increased in an zzso time dependent manner, being higher in the zzso resistant zzso Previous studies have demonstrated that zzso cell death increased with zzso time, which is consistent with these results, indicating that zzso are critical in zzso efficiency to kill zzso zzso
