Lung cancer ranks first in both prevalence and mortality rates among all types of zzso zzso is the main cause of treatment zzso zzso are critical to early diagnosis and prediction and monitoring of progressive zzso Several zzso have been identified for lung cancer but none have been routinely used zzso The present study assessed the diagnostic and zzso value of zzso protein 1 zzso for lung zzso zzso zzso abundance and protein content were determined by real-time zzso and western zzso analysis and/or zzso in biopsy specimens (24 zzso and 6 zzso freshly collected at surgical lung zzso in 82 zzso banked lung cancer specimens and in cultured zzso zzso and invasive zzso lung cancer zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed to correlate zzso zzso signal with cancer type and zzso In zzso cell migration was performed to determine the effect of zzso zzso zzso gene zzso on zzso of zzso zzso These analyses collectively demonstrated that: zzso both zzso zzso abundance and protein content were significantly higher in zzso compared to zzso specimens and in zzso compared to zzso specimens but not different between zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso signal was significantly stronger in zzso specimens and zzso cells compared to zzso specimens and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso adequately attenuated the invasive capacity of zzso cells in zzso These findings suggest that zzso of zzso in lung cancer cells, particularly at the zzso stage, may have significant clinical implications as a zzso factor for lung zzso
