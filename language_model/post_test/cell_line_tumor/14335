To study the zzso and mechanism of zzso killer zzso cells to breast cancer cell line zzso 

The zzso changes of zzso cells were observed by HE zzso The zzso of zzso cell line was examined by zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was determined by zzso zzso 

The result of HE zzso revealed that zzso cells moved toward the target cells, forming typical zzso zzso zzso substances appeared in zzso of tumor cells, but only zzso patch was found in some tumor cells while breast cancer cells as control grew zzso zzso zzso indicated that the cells in control group were not stained or dyed zzso light zzso As the cells in experiment group became smaller, zzso or zzso was dyed deep zzso The zzso rate of zzso cells zzso with zzso cells was increased after 4-12 hours and was decreased after zzso hours, with a significant difference compared with control group ( zzso zzso zzso showed that the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins in zzso group declined but the expression of zzso protein increased with the passage of time, which was significantly different compared with control ( zzso 

The mechanism of killing zzso cells by zzso cells is closely related to the zzso of the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins and to the zzso of the expression of zzso zzso It also has close relation with the time of exposure to zzso zzso
