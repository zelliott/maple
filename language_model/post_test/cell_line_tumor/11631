Variations and zzso of copy numbers zzso and zzso carry disease zzso and drug responsiveness zzso Although there are many molecular methods to measure copy numbers, sensitivity, zzso cost, and time issues zzso In the present study, we were able to solve those problems utilizing our modified real competitive zzso method with cloned competitors zzso First, the zzso for zzso copy number was established, and the results were comparable to current standard methods but with a shorter zzso time and a lower zzso Second, the zzso zzso for 24 zzso genes were established, and the results in a panel of zzso cells were comparable to those from real-time zzso and zzso Third, the zzso results for zzso and the zzso zzso were comparable to those by the zzso ratio test zzso but without zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is comparable to the currently available standard or the most sensitive zzso In addition, zzso would be invaluable for measurement of zzso in genes with zzso of similar structures, because combination of the other methods is not necessary, along with its other advantages such as short zzso time, small sample amount requirement, and zzso to all sequences and zzso
