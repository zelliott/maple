We describe zzso mode scanning zzso zzso zzso in which a single zzso tip zzso was used to acquire high-quality topographical and zzso images of living cells zzso This was achieved by switching the applied zzso so as to change the zzso current from a hindered diffusion feedback signal (for distance control and topographical zzso to the zzso flux measurement of zzso This imaging method is zzso and a single zzso zzso zzso which is simple to produce, is used for both topography and activity zzso In order to minimize the delay at zzso zzso we used zzso carbon zzso with zzso zzso that rapidly reached a zzso zzso typically in less than zzso for the largest zzso and faster for smaller zzso In addition, these carbon zzso are suitable for convoluted cell topography imaging because the zzso value zzso of overall probe diameter to active zzso zzso is typically in the range of zzso We first evaluated the resolution of zzso mode topography imaging using carbon zzso Next, we performed zzso zzso to zzso membrane proteins on zzso cells and to detect zzso from a zzso zzso We also combined zzso with surface zzso zzso to allow simultaneous zzso and topographical zzso zzso opens up new opportunities in zzso chemical mapping at zzso and should find wide application in the physical and biological zzso
