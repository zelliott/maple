zzso oxide zzso is a potent tumor zzso however, its clinical use is limited by systemic side zzso We have demonstrated previously that gene transfer of the human zzso NO zzso zzso gene into tumor cells and tumors zzso zzso NO production that significantly enhances tumor zzso with no observed side zzso zzso zzso gene transfer enhances tumor zzso via zzso cell zzso Because NO and zzso radiation are both known to promote zzso zzso we hypothesized that zzso zzso might be a primary mechanism for the zzso of these two zzso zzso We report that NO and zzso radiation zzso activate zzso in zzso zzso grown in zzso mice by zzso zzso of zzso at zzso zzso The effect of NO and zzso radiation on tumor cell zzso and tumor zzso is significantly reduced in zzso knockout zzso cancer cell zzso Furthermore, the transfer of both zzso and zzso genes into tumor cells lacking functional zzso enhanced their zzso more than transfer of either gene zzso
