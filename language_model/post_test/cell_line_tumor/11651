The binding of zzso and zzso to the zzso domain of zzso establishes zzso zzso zzso Reduction and loss of zzso expression degrades zzso zzso zzso zzso and causes zzso to progress into aggressive zzso Since both zzso are zzso regulated and play distinct roles when they zzso from zzso evaluation of their zzso zzso zzso and the correlation with zzso expression are important zzso However, the same analyses are not readily performed on zzso cell zzso in which zzso expression determines the disease zzso In the present study, we examined expression and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in oral zzso zzso zzso zzso and its implications in the zzso progression and zzso expression using zzso At the invasive front, zzso zzso cells were decreased in the zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and invasive zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and with the zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Carcinoma cells with zzso zzso and/or nuclear zzso were increased at the invasive front compared to the center of tumors zzso zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso shift from three to one associates with zzso zzso it was not observed after zzso zzso or zzso zzso The total amount of zzso expression was decreased upon zzso of zzso with zzso or zzso The above data indicate that zzso membrane zzso is a primary zzso for zzso zzso zzso and progression of oral zzso Furthermore, it suggests that loss of zzso expression and zzso zzso of zzso fine-tune the zzso zzso
