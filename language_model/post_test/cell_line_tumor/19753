zzso in the zzso and zzso tumor zzso genes are one of the most common zzso associated with human zzso zzso restoration of zzso zzso or zzso functions is seen as a particularly promising approach for cancer gene zzso In zzso and in zzso data have demonstrated that zzso zzso gene transfer can induce active cell death and zzso tumor zzso 

To evaluate the efficiency of zzso injection of naked DNA in tumor growth zzso in an zzso zzso zzso For that purpose, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso alone or in combination were zzso 

zzso mice were injected zzso with the human zzso zzso cell line zzso Three weeks after zzso zzso mice were injected twice a week with zzso zzso carrying zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso plasmids and saline buffer were used as zzso zzso growth was monitored to evaluate the zzso potential with zzso and/or zzso zzso 

When compared to the control, zzso repeated injections of naked zzso DNA zzso zzso were zzso tumor zzso This zzso was not observed with zzso and no zzso could be obtained between zzso and zzso zzso expression was restored in zzso of mice injected with zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was restored in zzso of mice injected with zzso zzso zzso 

In this report we demonstrated that: zzso naked DNA represents an efficient gene transfer in the zzso zzso zzso zzso restoration of zzso gene allows tumor growth zzso and zzso this zzso could be correlated with zzso expression as seen in zzso of treated mice after repeated naked DNA zzso These results allow us to zzso naked DNA as a therapeutic zzso in zzso cancer treatment, zzso with tumor zzso and zzso
