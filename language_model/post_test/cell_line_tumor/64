The inner membrane of the nuclear envelope zzso was previously shown to contain a zzso zzso zzso tightly linked to zzso zzso that mediates transfer of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso and constitutes a zzso zzso This transfer was initially observed with isolated zzso and is now demonstrated in living cells in relation to zzso zzso zzso Four cell lines with varying expression of zzso and zzso in the zzso were zzso with zzso zzso indicators genetically targeted to zzso zzso zzso and zzso to monitor zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was indicated with zzso zzso caused progressive loss of zzso which was rapidly replaced on addition of zzso zzso to those cells containing fully functional zzso differentiated zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso following zzso depletion occurred in cells containing little or no zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso No change in zzso due to applied zzso was seen in zzso cells, which entirely lack zzso zzso entry to zzso was also blocked by zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso and zzso were elevated independent of zzso and remained in approximate equilibrium with each zzso zzso rise in the zzso originated in the zzso region and extended to the entire zzso zzso These results indicate the nuclear zzso complex acts to gate zzso transfer from zzso to zzso an alternate route to the zzso zzso calcium zzso zzso They also suggest a possible zzso mechanism for independent regulation of nuclear zzso
