zzso was one of the earliest identified, and is the most zzso long zzso zzso It is presumed that zzso is essential for regulating development and disease conditions, and it is associated with zzso for many zzso However the biological function and regulatory mechanism of this zzso zzso particularly with respect to its effect on transcription, remain largely zzso 

We performed zzso zzso zzso zzso and deletion mapping to identify the proteins that are associated with zzso In addition, we employed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso to investigate the functional aspects of zzso 

Our research further verifies that zzso is bound to zzso zzso and this interaction is located within the zzso zzso zzso region of zzso Moreover, zzso zzso the interaction between zzso U and zzso which zzso zzso at zzso of the zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso domain zzso consequently preventing zzso Pol zzso zzso We also showed that zzso U is essential for zzso zzso zzso 

In this study, we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso Pol zzso zzso by zzso the zzso zzso zzso 

These data suggest that zzso regulates general zzso and exerts wide-ranging effects in zzso
