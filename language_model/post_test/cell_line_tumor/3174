Previously, we established an in zzso cellular zzso model of oral zzso cell zzso zzso including the human immortalized oral zzso cells zzso and its derived zzso zzso zzso In this study, comparative zzso analysis identified that zzso A1 was one of the significantly zzso genes in the zzso zzso zzso To investigate zzso A1 zzso and its potential usefulness as a molecular marker in zzso we further screened zzso A1 expressions with a panel of zzso lines, and clinical samples of zzso and the paired adjacent normal zzso from primary zzso zzso By Western zzso analysis and real-time zzso we showed that both zzso A1 zzso and protein expressions decreased in zzso cell lines except in two cell lines for the zzso zzso zzso and real-time zzso also showed that both zzso A1 zzso and protein expressions decreased in the zzso zzso from zzso patients compared with those in the paired adjacent zzso zzso More importantly, both zzso A1 zzso and protein expressions zzso correlated with the zzso differentiation grades of zzso zzso The lower zzso A1 zzso or protein expressions correlated with the poorer zzso differentiation zzso These results suggest that decreased expression of zzso A1 contributes to the zzso progression of zzso and zzso A1 may be a potential zzso for zzso differentiation grade of zzso
