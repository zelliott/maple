The zzso extract of zzso flowers zzso zzso zzso introduced Sage zzso zzso zzso European elderberry zzso zzso zzso and common dandelion zzso zzso zzso were zzso by High Performance zzso zzso and incorporated in different zzso onto zzso thin zzso In order to assess the biological impact of these zzso compounds on cell zzso human zzso zzso zzso cell line was seeded on the thin films and cell proliferation was determined by using an zzso zzso In addition, their zzso activity was estimated by using an zzso diffusion zzso Data indicated the zzso between cell viability and concentration of zzso These findings suggest that these zzso zzso films might be suitable for tissue engineering applications, on account of the combined activity of zzso and zzso
