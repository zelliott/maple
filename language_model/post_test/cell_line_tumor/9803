As distinct from zzso zzso zzso migratory zzso zzso has been described as a potential additional mechanism of melanoma spread in which tumor cells migrate along the external surfaces of zzso zzso melanoma cells are linked to the zzso by a zzso containing zzso In addition, it has been shown that zzso zzso zzso increases zzso migration of human green fluorescent protein zzso melanoma cells along vessels in a chicken zzso membrane model zzso In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that expression levels of some genes related to zzso and zzso are zzso expressed in zzso zzso melanoma areas zzso avascular melanoma areas from the same zzso 

zzso human melanoma cells in a zzso chick zzso zzso were used to study zzso associated with the presence of zzso zzso melanoma zzso For both high-quality zzso and zzso preservation in zzso zzso we used a zzso zzso coupled with zzso rapid tissue processing as previously zzso Using laser capture zzso zzso melanoma areas as well as avascular areas were zzso Using quantitative real time zzso chain reaction zzso six genes have been zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso data were zzso to human zzso zzso gene and values were compared against Human Total zzso Final results were expressed as percentage of zzso 

All tumors demonstrated a similar pattern, zzso zzso of zzso melanoma zzso The zzso zzso sections presented both zzso areas and avascular zzso All genes were zzso in zzso melanoma areas zzso avascular melanoma areas, especially zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

This study shows that several genes related to zzso are zzso in zzso melanoma areas zzso avascular melanoma zzso Since zzso migration of melanoma cells along vessels has been demonstrated in the zzso model, taken together these results suggests that some zzso and zzso receptors may play a role in zzso migratory zzso This model may represent a promising strategy to analyze differential gene expression in zzso
