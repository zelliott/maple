Most G zzso receptors are zzso after interaction with their respective zzso a process that subsequently contributes to cell zzso zzso zzso trafficking, and finally cell zzso Although cellular mechanisms leading to cell zzso have been widely zzso those responsible for cell zzso are still poorly zzso We examined here the traffic of the high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso following prolonged exposure to high zzso zzso Fluorescence and zzso zzso of Chinese zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells expressing green fluorescent zzso zzso zzso revealed that under prolonged treatment with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso accumulated in the zzso recycling compartment zzso During this cellular event, cell surface receptors remained markedly depleted as detected by both zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso In dividing cells, we observed that following prolonged zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors were removed from the zzso accumulated in dispersed zzso inside the zzso and subsequently zzso at the cell zzso This zzso binding recovery allowed for constant cell zzso and led to a chronic zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso Under these conditions, the constant zzso of zzso zzso generates an zzso zzso These observations support the potent role for zzso such as zzso in cancer zzso
