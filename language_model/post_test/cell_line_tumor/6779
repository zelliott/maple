Identification of reliable surrogate zzso for evaluation of cancer vaccine efficacy is a critical issue in zzso We analyzed quantitative and qualitative zzso T cell parameters in a large pool of zzso mice that were zzso against zzso self zzso zzso After zzso mice were zzso and kept alive for a subsequent tumor challenge to correlate results of immune monitoring zzso with tumor zzso or progression in each individual animal, and to assess the zzso value of the zzso The parameters tested were 1) percentage of in zzso zzso zzso zzso T zzso 2) results of zzso tests from fresh zzso 3) percentage of zzso zzso T cells in culture after in zzso zzso 4) in zzso increase of zzso zzso T cell population expressed as fold of zzso and 5) zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso Except for the zzso zzso each zzso tested was shown by zzso statistical analysis to correlate with tumor zzso However, zzso analysis revealed that only in zzso percentage of zzso zzso T cells was an independent zzso factor that predicted tumor zzso These findings should be considered in the design of new immune monitoring systems used in cancer zzso zzso
