zzso zzso zzso are the most common and deadly brain tumors in adults, currently with no satisfactory treatment zzso Apart from de zzso glioblastoma, it is currently accepted that these zzso mainly progress from lower grade zzso zzso However, the molecular entities governing the progression of zzso are poorly zzso zzso and membrane proteins are key zzso found at the zzso communication interface and hence are a promising zzso zzso that could help understand the development of zzso zzso the current study aims at identifying new protein markers of human zzso zzso For this purpose, we used zzso tumors generated zzso with zzso and zzso human zzso cells in nude zzso This setup allowed also to discriminate the protein origin, zzso human zzso or mouse zzso zzso and membrane proteins were selectively zzso using zzso followed by zzso affinity zzso zzso proteins were zzso and then identified and zzso employing zzso zzso A total of 23 and 27 zzso zzso and membrane proteins were identified in the zzso and zzso models, zzso zzso two-thirds of these were predominantly produced by the zzso whereas the remaining proteins appeared to be mainly zzso by the host zzso Following extensive zzso we have focused our attention on zzso protein zzso This protein was further investigated using zzso in a large collection of human zzso samples of different zzso The results showed that zzso protein 1 expression zzso with zzso grade, suggesting the possible role for this protein in the progression of this zzso
