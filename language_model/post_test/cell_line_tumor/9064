zzso zzso zzso 11 ), a zzso protein reported recently, possibly zzso in a broad range of cellular zzso including regulation of cell cycle, zzso zzso zzso cell transformation and cell zzso An efficient expression of functional zzso in zzso coli will promote the study on its structure and zzso zzso zzso expression zzso zzso (with zzso fusion zzso was constructed with zzso + ) and the zzso of zzso gene cloned in our zzso zzso was then expressed in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso on the induction of zzso zzso and Western zzso indicated that zzso zzso obtained in zzso was in the form of inclusion body, whereas that from zzso zzso was mainly in soluble zzso and accounted for zzso and zzso of the total zzso zzso After zzso and zzso the obtained zzso protein was carried into zzso cells by zzso to observe its influence on cell growth and cell zzso zzso 1 from zzso was proved to be lack of any zzso activity, while a growth zzso ratio of zzso on zzso cell was observed, and cell cycle progression of zzso cells was also arrested from zzso to S phase, with the zzso from zzso zzso zzso indicating that the above zzso fusion protein from zzso zzso had significant biological zzso This is the first report on functional zzso zzso protein expressed in zzso zzso
