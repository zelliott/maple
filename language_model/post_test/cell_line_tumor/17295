The reliable detection and zzso of gene zzso is crucial to clinical zzso Although there are different detection techniques, the zzso in zzso zzso zzso method has become highly accepted over past years because it is a reliable, zzso and quick zzso Unfortunately, automatic zzso of gene amplification based on zzso zzso has not been possible thus zzso Because current spot counting methods are reliable only when analyzing low amplification rates, we attempted to establish another method, zzso to zzso the intensity of different FISH signals using an automatic zzso zzso device on zzso zzso zzso quantitative FISH zzso 

We zzso the zzso zzso of the differently labeled FISH zzso zzso and zzso zzso to three different zzso cell lines, six peripheral blood zzso samples, 10 spiked zzso samples, and nine zzso samples using the zzso system zzso zzso zzso To obtain the zzso copy number per cell, the ratio between the zzso zzso of the zzso gene and reference sequence zzso was zzso For automatic analysis of the zzso status in tumor cells, labeled FISH zzso specific for zzso and a zzso zzso probe were zzso to peripheral blood and tumor specimens and analyzed using the automatic zzso 

When measuring the zzso intensity per cell for both probe pairs zzso and zzso amplified and zzso cells, showed distinct zzso with only little zzso Whereas normal cells showed a zzso ratio peak for zzso between 200 and zzso cells with zzso amplification clearly exceeded this ratio value zzso to zzso When mixing a varying number of zzso amplified cells zzso zzso to normal zzso the spiked tumor cells could be zzso Even one zzso tumor cell in 1000 zzso cells could reliably be detected using our zzso In zzso patient samples, zzso cells were distinguished from amplified zzso zzso and manually counted signals gave matching results in amplified and zzso zzso zzso cells were automatically detected in the breast cancer samples zzso 

The automatic measurement of zzso signal zzso not only allows a reliable discrimination between zzso and amplified cells but also exact zzso of amplified zzso This is the prerequisite for the following zzso detection of amplified cells in the bone zzso and zzso zzso comparison between primary and zzso or zzso and zzso zzso detection of tumors with focal gene zzso and zzso of elimination of amplified gene zzso
