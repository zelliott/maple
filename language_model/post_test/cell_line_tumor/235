zzso is a zzso zzso agent and a powerful component of standard treatment regimens for several human zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso are mainly responsible for cellular toxicity and induction of zzso Identification of the mechanisms that control sensitivity to zzso is central to improving its therapeutic index and to successfully encountering the acquired resistance frequently emerging during zzso In the present study, using zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso we examined the zzso cellular responses to zzso exposure in two human urinary zzso cancer cell lines characterized by different zzso grade and zzso genetic zzso Both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell types proved to be vulnerable to zzso zzso activity, albeit in a zzso and drug zzso manner, as demonstrated by the zzso processing profiles of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso repertoire characteristic zzso zzso and zzso zzso as zzso The differential resistance of zzso and zzso cells to zzso zzso was associated with an zzso zzso zzso zzso pattern of zzso together with structural amputations of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso administration resulted in a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso molecular zzso exclusively occurring in zzso zzso To generate functional networks, expression analysis of a number of zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was performed, strongly supporting the role of zzso and zzso zzso responses in zzso zzso of zzso cancer zzso
