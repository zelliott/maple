The purpose of this study was to identify new zzso zzso zzso zzso in clear cell zzso cell zzso zzso carry out functional analysis of their zzso role and identify their specific target zzso 

To explore zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and real-time zzso were performed using zzso and zzso zzso Cell zzso invasion and wound healing zzso were carried out for functional analysis after zzso zzso To determine target genes of zzso we used zzso zzso zzso zzso and target scan zzso to identify target zzso A zzso zzso zzso was also zzso zzso expression of target genes in zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso and was compared with zzso expression in zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cells was zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso of zzso dramatically decreased cell zzso The zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso and predicted to be target zzso The zzso decreased zzso zzso activity of zzso and zzso protein zzso Low expression of zzso in zzso zzso was correlated with high expression of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso inhibited cell zzso 

zzso is a new zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cell zzso through zzso of zzso
