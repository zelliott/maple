To study the potential effects of zzso zzso gene zzso on the differentiation of leukemia cell line zzso and its possible molecular zzso 

The zzso zzso expression zzso zzso + zzso containing full-length human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the blank zzso + zzso were zzso into leukemia cell line zzso by zzso The zzso zzso and protein in cells were detected by zzso and Western zzso Cell zzso zzso reduction and zzso zzso expression in zzso cells were zzso to evaluate cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso genes was determined by zzso zzso after zzso 

Compared with zzso cells, zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso + zzso cells had higher zzso differentiation rates and higher zzso expression levels after exposure to zzso for 48 zzso The percentage of zzso reduction in zzso cells was lower than that in control zzso The difference in zzso reduction rate between zzso and control cells was gradually increased after treated with zzso for three zzso The expression levels of zzso zzso and zzso genes in zzso cells were notably zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso gene could partially inhibit the differentiation of zzso cells by zzso the expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
