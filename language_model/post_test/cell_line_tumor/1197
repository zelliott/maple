zzso regulation of zzso and zzso genes is a crucial process in the development of zzso zzso Here we have investigated the regulatory mechanism of the expression of the zzso zzso zzso one of the zzso zzso in zzso cells using zzso zzso cells as a zzso zzso sequence analyses revealed that the extent of zzso in the zzso region of the zzso gene was correlated zzso with the expression of the zzso gene in zzso primary tumors and cell zzso zzso treatment induced the expression of the zzso gene in zzso zzso cell lines, and the induction of expression was associated tightly with the zzso of zzso at zzso zzso in the middle of an zzso binding site to which the zzso but not zzso zzso The replacement of zzso with zzso or zzso zzso zzso binding and also the zzso activity of the zzso zzso including zzso The zzso of zzso expression by small interfering zzso reduced the expression of the zzso gene in zzso normal zzso indicating zzso as a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso status of the zzso region is one of the mechanisms to determine the zzso expression of the zzso gene through the regulation of the binding of zzso
