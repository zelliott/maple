zzso is a well-documented zzso zzso gene whose zzso of action have yet to be fully zzso The purpose of this report is to discuss recent advances in investigating the potential role of a novel zzso zzso activity identified recently in our laboratory, a zzso function zzso in general, with DNA repair and zzso We have employed a zzso zzso approach to demonstrate that the zzso zzso activity of zzso is required for its zzso zzso zzso zzso with a role in DNA repair, we also observe that the single zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for the maintenance of zzso integrity and normal zzso of DNA repair in response to exposure to ultraviolet zzso These results and their implications for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso functions in cancer are zzso
