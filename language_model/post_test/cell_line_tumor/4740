zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the most aggressive types of cancer characterized by complete zzso to zzso treatment zzso zzso strategies based on the simultaneous use of zzso zzso and death zzso zzso have been shown to induce zzso in several tumor types but have not yet been explored in zzso 

The aim of this study was to investigate the ability of the zzso inhibitor zzso to induce zzso in zzso cell zzso zzso was used as a single agent or in combination with zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso family that selectively zzso tumor cell zzso The molecular effects of zzso were investigated by analyzing the expression of key regulators of cell cycle and zzso and the zzso of different zzso zzso 

zzso induced zzso in zzso cells at doses achieved in the clinical setting, differently from conventional zzso zzso zzso treatment with low doses of zzso and TRAIL had a synergistic effect in inducing massive zzso cell zzso zzso increased the expression of zzso TRAIL zzso zzso zzso and zzso second zzso zzso of zzso inhibitor of zzso binding protein with low zzso and reduced the expression of zzso zzso such as cellular zzso death zzso zzso converting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and inhibitor of zzso thus resulting in cell death induction through the zzso zzso zzso 

The combination of zzso zzso and TRAIL zzso to induce the destruction of zzso zzso zzso and could represent a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of zzso zzso zzso
