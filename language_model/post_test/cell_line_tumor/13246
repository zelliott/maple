zzso zzso belongs to the zzso family of zzso zzso Among the zzso zzso zzso is most closely related to zzso which can transport iron, zzso zzso and zzso Here we investigated the iron transport ability of zzso its zzso zzso pH zzso and regulation by zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso enhanced the zzso of zzso and zzso by 200 and zzso respectively, compared with zzso Excess iron inhibited the zzso of zinc and vice zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transport was zzso zzso of zzso zzso and inhibited by zzso zzso also zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso (I or zzso By using zzso analysis, we found that zzso expressed in zzso zzso cells localized to the plasma membrane and partially in early zzso Iron loading increased total and zzso levels of zzso in zzso rat zzso zzso We also determined by using zzso zzso that zzso zzso 40, 88, and 96 of rat zzso are zzso and that zzso is not required for iron or zinc zzso Analysis of 20 different human zzso revealed abundant zzso expression in lung and zzso and showed that its expression profile differs markedly from zzso suggesting zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression in zzso cells, a zzso cell line, reduced iron zzso by zzso suggesting that zzso zzso in zzso iron zzso zzso these data identify zzso as an iron transport protein that may function in iron zzso
