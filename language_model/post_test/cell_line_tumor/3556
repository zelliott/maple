In acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso of death receptors and zzso of the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso on zzso cells after chemotherapy is not always accompanied by zzso suggesting that the zzso death zzso signaling zzso is zzso Because zzso protein with death domain zzso is the main zzso for zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1 death zzso expression of zzso was analyzed by Western zzso and zzso in zzso cells of 70 de zzso zzso patients treated with the European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer zzso zzso trial before initiation of induction zzso Thirty seven percent of patients (17 of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso cells had a primary zzso disease compared with zzso of zzso patients (3 of 24; P zzso zzso zzso expression was significantly associated with a worse zzso survival zzso zzso zzso zzso and overall survival zzso zzso zzso In zzso analysis, zzso protein expression was independently associated with a poor zzso and overall survival zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein expression predicted poor zzso even in patients with zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, we identified low or absent expression of the zzso protein in zzso cells at diagnosis as a poor independent zzso factor that can predict worse clinical outcome even for patients with zzso or zzso zzso
