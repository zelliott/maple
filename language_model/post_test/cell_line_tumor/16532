The main aim of the present work was to investigate the potential effect of zzso extract of zzso zzso leaf zzso in multiple zzso zzso in human breast cancer zzso zzso treatment significantly induced dose and time dependent, irreversible zzso of breast cancer cell growth with moderate toxicity to normal breast zzso zzso This observation was validated using zzso B zzso Cell cycle analysis by zzso zzso showed cell cycle arrest in zzso phase and induction of zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso and displayed an increase in zzso population in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso double zzso zzso zzso the loss of zzso membrane potential in multiple breast cancer cell lines when compared to normal zzso zzso To understand the role of zzso in zzso induced zzso we employed a sensitive cell based platform of zzso cells expressing zzso zzso zzso to zzso was accompanied by the disruption of zzso membrane potential and marked zzso in zzso activity zzso zzso zzso with this data, zzso induced zzso zzso as evidenced by ratio change in zzso zzso sensor expressing zzso cell line and zzso of prominent zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso accelerated cell death in a zzso dependent manner in continuous live cell imaging mode indicating its possible zzso zzso zzso generation of zzso oxygen species zzso by zzso played a critical role in zzso zzso cell death and zzso zzso zzso induced dose and time dependent zzso of cancer cell growth which was associated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with the zzso of zzso 9 dependent zzso zzso zzso also possessed strong zzso effect on cancer cell line that was zzso through rapid zzso zzso potential loss and partial zzso zzso involving generation of zzso zzso
