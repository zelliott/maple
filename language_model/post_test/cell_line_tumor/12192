Head and neck cancer remains a zzso and often fatal disease and at the present time few effective molecular markers have been zzso The purpose of the present work was to identify new molecular markers for head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso We applied zzso arbitrarily primed zzso zzso to isolate sequences zzso zzso in zzso The most frequently zzso zzso we found maps close to a zzso zzso zzso zzso island on zzso zzso and zzso of this zzso island was associated with zzso zzso of an alternative transcript of the zzso zzso Using combined zzso restriction analysis zzso zzso of this zzso was detected in 13 of 14 zzso zzso cell lines studied and 21 of 32 zzso primary tumors, whereas little or no zzso was seen in 10 normal oral zzso zzso We extended this investigation to other cancer cell lines and zzso was found in those derived from zzso breast, leukemia and zzso and zzso was also found in zzso primary colon zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso is a good cancer marker in zzso as well as in other kinds of zzso and confirm the importance of searching for markers of zzso zzso in zzso
