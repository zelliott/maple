zzso association studies have identified a zzso zzso on zzso within the prostate stem cell zzso zzso zzso as a risk factor for zzso zzso To zzso this region, we zzso zzso zzso within 100 zzso of zzso in addition to 33 markers zzso in one of the reported zzso association study in zzso zzso A multivariable zzso zzso model adjusted for zzso revealed a unique zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso In the combined analysis of zzso cases and zzso controls, we detected a zzso odds ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso The effect was stronger in carriers of both risk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso and there was a significant zzso interaction zzso zzso zzso between these two zzso which requires replication in future zzso The T risk zzso of zzso was associated with increased zzso zzso expression in two sets of zzso tumor samples zzso zzso 36, P zzso zzso and zzso zzso 34, P zzso zzso and in normal zzso samples zzso zzso 35, P zzso zzso but zzso was not associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso is located 10 zzso upstream of zzso within an alternative untranslated first zzso of zzso The zzso zzso G of zzso showed strong interaction with nuclear proteins from five cell lines tested, zzso a regulatory zzso In conclusion, a joint effect of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggests that both zzso may be important for zzso cancer zzso possibly through different mechanisms that influence the control of zzso expression and interaction with regulatory zzso
