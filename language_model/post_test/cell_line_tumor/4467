zzso therapy zzso has not been reported for human zzso because cancer cells only zzso take up the zzso zzso green zzso is a zzso normally zzso into the zzso and zzso zzso is impaired in human zzso We examined whether human zzso cell lines zzso take up the zzso and then assessed the effectiveness of zzso using zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso human zzso cell lines were transplanted zzso into zzso zzso zzso and zzso tumors were confirmed that zzso took up the zzso in zzso after zzso was administered to mice via tail zzso The zzso tumor showed a high zzso zzso intensity ratio, zzso whereas zzso intensity of zzso is increased twofold compared to zzso zzso cell transplanted mice were divided into three groups: zzso administration only zzso zzso zzso and zzso laser exposure zzso zzso and zzso laser exposure only zzso zzso 

Mean tumor volume in the zzso and zzso groups increased zzso In contrast, mean tumor volume in the zzso group did not change between days 0 and zzso Mean tumor volume did not differ significantly between the zzso and zzso groups, but was significantly different between the zzso group and both the zzso and zzso groups zzso 

zzso is zzso taken up by zzso and zzso human zzso cell line zzso The zzso ratio of zzso tumors, in particular, was extremely zzso zzso with zzso laser zzso suppressed zzso human zzso cell line tumor zzso
