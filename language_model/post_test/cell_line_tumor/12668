The purpose of this study was to investigate the zzso of the zzso activity and enhanced cellular retention of zzso zzso zzso after surface zzso with wheat germ zzso zzso against colon cancer zzso zzso patterns of representative colon cancer cells confirmed the higher expression levels of zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso cells, than in the zzso zzso Cellular zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso against colon cell lines was evaluated alongside control zzso zzso zzso and quantitative analysis of zzso zzso were used to monitor the zzso and retention of zzso inside the zzso zzso showed enhanced zzso activity against zzso and zzso cells compared to corresponding zzso without zzso zzso zzso The greater efficacy of zzso was associated with higher cellular zzso and sustained zzso retention of zzso which in turn was attributed to the zzso of zzso zzso on the colon cell zzso zzso also demonstrated increased zzso retention in the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso cells, following zzso incubation with fresh zzso compared to the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Cellular trafficking study of zzso showed zzso zzso could successful escape from the zzso compartment and release into the zzso with increasing incubation zzso It may be concluded that zzso has the potential to be applied as a targeted delivery platform for zzso in the treatment of colon zzso
