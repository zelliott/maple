zzso protein zzso zzso plays a key role in the repair of DNA zzso breaks zzso that are probably the most deleterious form of DNA zzso zzso of zzso has been considered as an attractive approach to decrease resistance to zzso induced DNA zzso zzso radiation zzso and zzso which induce zzso are used in the treatment of breast zzso We determined the cellular concentration of zzso and other zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the effect of zzso zzso by zzso on DNA repair, cell cycle, and survival after zzso or zzso treatment in three human breast cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso representing different breast cancer zzso zzso cells had the highest expression of zzso zzso and zzso and the most rapid rate of DNA zzso zzso zzso caused a zzso to zzso increase in zzso activity and two to zzso induction of zzso in all 3 cell zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso activity in all cell lines with zzso in the range zzso zzso zzso retarded the repair of zzso and significantly increased the sensitivity of all cell lines to zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso The greatest zzso by zzso was observed in zzso zzso zzso affected the cell cycle distribution in all studied cell zzso increasing zzso of cells in zzso phase after DNA zzso Our data indicate that zzso might be an effective target for zzso and zzso in breast cancer and suggest that further development of zzso zzso for clinical use is zzso
