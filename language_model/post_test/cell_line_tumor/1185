zzso staging of zzso cancer zzso has been attributed to the failure to detect zzso zzso zzso by conventional zzso We have previously reported the use of zzso mapping to accurately identify those zzso zzso most likely to harbor zzso disease and permit focused zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso at zzso 12 or 13 occurs frequently in early stages of zzso zzso The purpose of our study was to assess zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso using a unique zzso zzso acid zzso clamp zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso zzso primary zzso and paired zzso were evaluated by zzso clamp zzso for zzso zzso Thirty primary tumors zzso were positive for zzso zzso and in 5 of these cases the zzso were positive for zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso clamp zzso identified zzso zzso in an additional 6 patients, zzso zzso of zzso positive primary zzso zzso zzso zzso No zzso zzso were detected among the 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso This study demonstrates the utility, specificity and sensitivity of zzso clamp zzso zzso in identifying zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso patients by zzso zzso zzso
