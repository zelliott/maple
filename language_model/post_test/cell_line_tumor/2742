zzso resistance zzso is a significant problem underlying the poor prognosis associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso is thought to induce the genes expression involved in zzso To evaluate the effect of zzso zzso in human zzso zzso cells, cells were zzso with zzso interference zzso zzso and cultured under hypoxic zzso The effect of zzso on zzso and zzso zzso protein 1 gene zzso and protein levels was zzso zzso rates of zzso were zzso zzso and zzso at 24, 48, 72 h zzso zzso zzso rates of zzso protein were zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein levels decreased by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells were significantly more sensitive to zzso and zzso compared to zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso plays a role in zzso zzso drug resistance in zzso zzso zzso zzso may prove to be an effective therapeutic means of treating zzso
