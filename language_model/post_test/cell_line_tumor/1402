zzso zzso is a synthetic zzso with a strong zzso effect towards different cancer cell lines in zzso and it is currently tested in clinical zzso zzso of zzso oxygen species zzso and zzso of zzso zzso levels are zzso events observed upon zzso treatment, but there is still a lack of understanding of their relationship and their contribution to cell zzso zzso analysis of zzso revealed that in human leukemia zzso and zzso cells, zzso induced zzso but not zzso zzso even at zzso zzso zzso prevented the zzso zzso zzso but it did not prevent the loss of viability and increase of zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso acid, zzso and vitamin E reversed zzso effects on cell death but not zzso zzso zzso described as a zzso zzso exerted a significantly higher zzso activity than vitamin E and zzso zzso zzso It did not however rescue cellular zzso Taken together, this study demonstrates that early changes observed upon zzso treatment, zzso zzso zzso and zzso production, are mechanistically independent zzso Furthermore, the results indicate that zzso cell death may occur even in the absence of zzso or zzso zzso These observations should be taken into account for an improved design of drug zzso
