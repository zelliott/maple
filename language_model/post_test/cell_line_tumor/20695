We examined the association of zzso zzso growth factor zzso with the zzso features of zzso and investigated the effect of zzso zzso on the biological behavior of tumor cells in zzso in order to determine whether zzso is a valuable zzso predictor for zzso zzso 

zzso cases of zzso were zzso The zzso zzso zzso cell proliferation index zzso and zzso zzso were evaluated by zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso as well as the follow-up data of patients, was analyzed zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with short interference zzso for zzso and the cell zzso migratory ability and zzso to zzso were evaluated in zzso 

Both high zzso expression in tumor cells zzso zzso and high zzso were significantly associated with high-grade zzso and increased zzso in tumors zzso zzso However, only zzso grading zzso and zzso of zzso zzso emerged as independent zzso factors for the overall survival of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and protein expressions were significantly decreased in zzso after zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the cell growth and reduced cell migratory zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso enhanced the zzso of zzso zzso cells to zzso 

This study indicated that there was significant correlation among tumor zzso zzso cell proliferation and zzso proliferation in zzso zzso might influence tumor progression by modulating the cell growth, migration and zzso to zzso Increased expression of zzso may be a valuable predictor for zzso evaluation of zzso zzso
