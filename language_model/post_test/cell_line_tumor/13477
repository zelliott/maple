zzso therapy to prevent the progression from acute to chronic pain in cancer patients remains zzso We developed three novel cancer models in mice that together zzso the zzso zzso and functional characteristics of acute and chronic head and neck cancer pain in zzso Using zzso and genetic approaches in these novel cancer models, we identified the interaction between zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso zzso to be of central zzso We show that zzso zzso such as zzso induce acute cancer pain in a zzso zzso zzso cancer pain is associated with elevated zzso zzso in the cancer zzso and zzso zzso in peripheral zzso zzso zzso zzso greatly reduces the severity of persistent cancer pain in zzso mice, but most zzso the development of chronic cancer pain is prevented in zzso zzso Our results demonstrate a direct role for zzso in acute cancer pain and suggest that zzso zzso may favor the development and maintenance of chronic cancer zzso zzso the zzso zzso interaction is a promising approach to the treatment of acute cancer pain and prevention of chronic cancer zzso
