Many zzso associated with zzso disorders and inflammation have been shown to activate the zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso plays key roles in the zzso of these zzso zzso investigating the zzso of zzso activity and the efficacy of selective zzso zzso in animal models of such disorders is essential to a better understanding of the biology of zzso and to assess the potential clinical benefits of zzso zzso 

Through zzso zzso screening using the zzso compound library, we identified zzso zzso zzso as a novel inhibitor of zzso zzso and efficacy of this compound were investigated in both cellular and animal zzso 

We show that zzso zzso has selectivity for zzso over other zzso zzso members, as well as over other zzso zzso such as zzso in various cellular zzso zzso and zzso studies strongly suggested that zzso zzso bound directly to the zzso domain of zzso Also zzso levels were significantly increased in the zzso zzso of rat zzso with acute zzso and the treatment of these rats with zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso and suppressed the inflammatory zzso 

The zzso of zzso was closely correlated with acute zzso inflammation and that zzso of zzso activity by zzso antagonists, such as zzso zzso alleviated the inflammation in zzso
