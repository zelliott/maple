Current zzso are characterized by efficient tumor zzso and severe side effects mostly derived from zzso zzso Hence targeted delivery of these drugs to tumor cells is actively zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso zzso carbon zzso are able to zzso zzso a widely used zzso cancer drug, by simple zzso and thereby deliver the drug for killing of cancer zzso The zzso when these zzso carbon zzso were used was equivalent to when a commercial zzso of zzso was zzso Here we show that by further mixing the zzso zzso with zzso a zzso zzso that recognizes the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso is zzso targeted to zzso tumor cells in zzso This supports progressing to in zzso zzso Moreover, the construct is unusual in that all three components are assembled through zzso zzso Such zzso assembly could enable zzso screening of zzso zzso
