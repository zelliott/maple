Parkinson's disease zzso is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder whose zzso is still unclear in spite of extensive zzso It has been hypothesized that zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso could be an zzso zzso zzso To gain further insight into its role in the neurodegenerative process, both zzso mice and zzso zzso cells were treated with zzso and the data were compared with those obtained by the use of zzso a well-known zzso zzso zzso injection of zzso in zzso mice caused a long-lasting depletion of zzso providing evidence of in zzso zzso of zzso Both in mice and in zzso cells, zzso treatment induced extensive zzso stress, as evidenced by protein zzso and zzso zzso and affected the expression of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso whose levels are modulated by zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments support these findings, indicating an zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was also found to be modulated by zzso zzso The present work provides a solid background sustaining the hypothesis that zzso is involved in zzso zzso by inducing extensive zzso stress and protein zzso
