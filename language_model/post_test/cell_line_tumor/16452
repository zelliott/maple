Major zzso complex class I zzso molecules are critically important in the host defense against various pathogens through presentation of viral peptides to zzso T zzso zzso a process resulting in the destruction of zzso zzso zzso interfere with zzso elimination of infected cells by various mechanisms, including zzso of zzso transport and zzso zzso of zzso trafficking, and zzso and zzso of cell surface zzso In this study, we show that zzso zzso type 4 zzso zzso zzso cell surface expression through two different zzso First, zzso can lead to a significant zzso of zzso expression at the cell surface through the product of zzso a protein expressed with early zzso from a gene that is zzso to zzso zzso virus 1 zzso The zzso zzso protein reduces cell surface zzso as early as 4 h after zzso Second, zzso can interfere with zzso zzso zzso starting at 6 h after infection, by zzso of the zzso associated with zzso processing zzso through its zzso zzso Although zzso has no immediate effect on overall surface zzso levels in infected cells, it blocks the supply of zzso peptides to the zzso zzso zzso and transport of zzso zzso to the cell zzso Taken together, our results show that zzso encodes at least two viral immune evasion zzso zzso reduces zzso molecules on the cell surface at early times after infection, and zzso interferes with zzso zzso presentation by blocking zzso transport in the zzso
