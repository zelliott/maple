In this paper, we report the successful use of zzso quantum dots zzso as highly efficient and nontoxic optical zzso for imaging live pancreatic cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso with high quality and bright zzso were prepared by a hot zzso synthesis method in zzso zzso The surfaces of these zzso were then zzso with zzso acid to make them highly zzso in zzso zzso Further zzso with pancreatic cancer specific zzso zzso such as zzso 4 and zzso stem cell zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso allowed specific in zzso targeting of pancreatic cancer cell lines (both immortalized and low passage zzso The zzso delivery of the zzso was further confirmed by the observation of poor in zzso targeting in zzso cancer based cell lines which are negative for the zzso These observations suggest the immense potential of zzso zzso as zzso safe and efficient optical imaging zzso in diagnostic imaging, particularly for early detection of zzso
