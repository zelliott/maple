zzso zzso may function as either zzso or tumor zzso in the zzso progression of different tumor zzso zzso was recently reported to be decreased and identified as a tumor zzso in gastric zzso We also verified its role in zzso cell proliferation of a gastric cancer cell zzso In this study, however, zzso was found to be zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells compared with human immortalized zzso zzso cells, using a zzso zzso and this higher expression was confirmed in zzso tissue zzso Indeed, zzso of zzso impaired the proliferation of zzso cells in zzso and the zzso tumor growth of zzso in nude zzso zzso zzso directly targeted zzso to promote the cellular zzso transition, as the zzso effects of zzso on the zzso transition could be rescued by zzso zzso Our results imply that zzso may act as an zzso in zzso The newly identified zzso axis zzso the molecular mechanism of zzso cell proliferation and represents a novel strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of patients with zzso
