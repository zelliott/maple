zzso of the zzso zzso acids zzso zzso acid zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso and their respective zzso zzso acids zzso in zzso and biological zzso is the zzso hallmark of patients affected by the zzso disorder known as maple syrup urine disease zzso Considering that brain energy metabolism is possibly altered in zzso the objective of this study was to determine zzso zzso zzso activity, a key zzso of energy zzso in zzso zzso cells exposed to zzso The cells were incubated with 1, 5, or 10 zzso zzso for 3 h and the zzso activity measured zzso The results indicated that the zzso significantly inhibited zzso activity at all tested zzso Furthermore, the zzso caused by the zzso on zzso activity was totally prevented by zzso with the energetic zzso zzso and by zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso oxide zzso zzso indicating that deficit of energy and zzso oxide zzso are involved in these zzso In contrast, other antioxidants such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso Vitamin zzso were not able to prevent zzso zzso In addition, we observed that the zzso cells changed their usual rounded zzso when exposed for 3 h to 10 zzso zzso and that zzso and zzso prevented these zzso zzso Considering the importance of zzso for brain metabolism zzso it is conceivable that zzso of this zzso by increased levels of zzso may contribute to the zzso of zzso zzso
