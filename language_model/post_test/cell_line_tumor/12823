zzso zzso cells zzso are capable of zzso zzso T cells and therefore represent an attractive zzso for vaccine development in zzso zzso Numerous protocols have been described to date using different maturation cocktails and time periods for the induction of mature DC zzso in zzso For clinical application, the use of zzso that can be generated in only three days saves on the costs of zzso needed for large scale vaccine cell production and provides a method to produce cells within a standard zzso schedule in a zzso zzso 

In this study, we addressed the properties of zzso zzso processing and presentation by zzso DC prepared in three days zzso zzso compared with conventional DC prepared in seven days zzso zzso which represent the most common form of DC used for vaccines to zzso 

Although they showed a reduced capacity for spontaneous zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed higher capacity for stimulation of T cells after loading with an extended synthetic zzso that requires processing for zzso zzso indicating they were more efficient at zzso processing than zzso zzso We found, however, that zzso DC were less efficient at expressing protein after introduction of in zzso transcribed zzso by zzso based on published zzso This deficit was overcome by altering zzso zzso which led to improved protein expression and capacity for T cell stimulation using low amounts of zzso 

This new procedure allows zzso zzso to replace zzso zzso for use in zzso vaccines that zzso long zzso proteins or zzso as sources of specific zzso
