The standard therapy for advanced zzso zzso zzso is zzso with most patients experiencing disease progression within 6 zzso zzso cancer cells zzso represent a novel zzso of cancer stem cells zzso The objective was to test whether zzso are resistant to zzso 

We tested human zzso derived zzso and zzso before and after treatment with zzso 

zzso derived from human zzso are relatively resistant to zzso The proportion of zzso in zzso cell lines is increased after zzso while the general population of cancer cells zzso growth zzso We show that zzso demonstrate improved viability and toxicity profiles, and reduced zzso over zzso We show that after treatment with zzso zzso zzso the zzso marker zzso zzso 1 family, zzso zzso family, cell survival and proliferation zzso and zzso zzso cell cycle arrest, cell zzso and stem cells differentiation zzso This phenomenon was accompanied by zzso zzso of specific zzso of the zzso target proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso but not in zzso A molecular zzso map for zzso treated zzso is zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso derived zzso are relatively resistant to zzso Since zzso can generate zzso with as few as 10 cells, our data suggest a potential role for these cells in disease zzso Further investigation of this phenomenon might provide novel insights into cancer biology, cancer recurrence and drug resistance with important implications for the development of novel cancer therapies based on targeting zzso
