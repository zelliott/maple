Traditional chemotherapy generally results in systemic zzso which also limits drug levels at the area of zzso Two ultrasound contrast agents zzso with diameters between 1-2 zzso in diameter and shell thicknesses of zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso zzso one loaded by surface zzso and the other loaded by drug incorporation in the zzso were compared in zzso for potential use in cancer zzso These zzso zzso zzso zzso platforms contain a gas core that in an ultrasound zzso field can cause the zzso to zzso or zzso Following a systemic injection of drug loaded zzso with external application of US focused at the area of interest, this platform could potentially increase drug toxicity at the area of need, while protecting healthy tissue through zzso of the zzso In zzso toxicity in zzso breast cancer cells of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso loaded zzso were examined at 5 zzso zzso using a pulse repetition frequency of 100 zzso at varying pressure zzso Both platforms resulted in equivalent cell death compared to free zzso and US when zzso at peak positive pressure zzso of zzso zzso and zzso While no significant changes in cell death were seen for surface zzso zzso with or without zzso cell death using the platform with zzso incorporated within the shell increased from zzso to zzso zzso approaching double the potency of the platform when zzso at peak positive pressure zzso of zzso zzso and zzso This mechanism is believed to be the result of zzso zzso at higher zzso pressure zzso resulting in more exposed drug and shell surface area as well as increased cellular zzso of zzso containing zzso shell zzso This study has shown that a zzso zzso with drug housed within the shell may be used for zzso cell zzso US zzso can be used to make a carrier significantly more potent once in the area of zzso
