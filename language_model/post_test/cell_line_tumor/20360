Drug resistance is a main obstacle for the successful chemotherapy of lung zzso In this work, a new zzso system, zzso complex zzso zzso to overcome zzso zzso resistance in zzso human lung cancer was designed and zzso The experimental results showed that zzso could facilitate drug into cells and induce zzso zzso zzso into zzso on zzso and zzso cells, achieve efficient gene delivery and induce zzso zzso interference on zzso zzso The zzso of zzso against zzso cells was zzso lower than that of free zzso The enhanced efficacy of zzso against zzso cells was associated with zzso zzso and cell arrest in zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein by zzso could lower the zzso threshold of drug resistant cells and render zzso agents more zzso Moreover, the zzso of zzso activity by zzso was found to increase zzso zzso in zzso zzso The in zzso zzso efficacy showed that zzso were more effective than that of the zzso As a result, the zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso could be a very powerful approach to improve the therapeutic effect of zzso in resistant lung zzso
