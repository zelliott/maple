In multiple zzso the presence of highly resistant cancer stem cells zzso that are responsible for tumor zzso and zzso has been zzso zzso for achieving complete response, new therapeutic zzso that effectively eradicate both, zzso and bulk cancer zzso need to be zzso For achieving that goal, an innovative zzso treatment combining targeting of zzso de zzso synthesis zzso and a zzso by the zzso electron emitting zzso analogue zzso zzso could be a promising zzso The zzso with zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso 1 zzso for 1 zzso efficiently induced proliferation and terminal differentiation of isolated myeloma zzso zzso Moreover, zzso stimulation led to a decreased activity of a functional zzso marker, zzso zzso zzso The zzso conditioning by zzso emerged to be essential for enhanced incorporation of zzso zzso with 50 zzso zzso zzso cells for 4 zzso and, consequently, for the induction of zzso DNA zzso zzso showed a pronounced zzso effect on isolated tumor zzso zzso More than zzso of the treated cells were zzso despite zzso of DNA repair zzso Most important, exposure of metabolically zzso cells to zzso resulted in a complete zzso of zzso zzso This is the first report showing that zzso with zzso zzso the zzso cell compartment in multiple myeloma to zzso induced by zzso zzso of zzso
