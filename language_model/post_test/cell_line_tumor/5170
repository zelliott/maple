zzso cell dissemination through corporal zzso zzso zzso and body cavity zzso is a distinctive feature of the zzso zzso zzso cell transition from fluid to adhesive conditions involves an early polarization event and major zzso of the zzso zzso that remain poorly zzso As regulation of cortical zzso binding might be important in this process, we investigated the role of zzso and zzso which are key zzso proteins of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We used short interfering zzso zzso to show that zzso is crucial for invasion by melanoma cells in zzso zzso and in early lung zzso Using live imaging, we show that following initial zzso to the zzso or zzso zzso zzso is redistributed away from the region of zzso thereby generating a polarized zzso a stable cortical zzso dome enriched in zzso and an invasive membrane domain full of zzso Using zzso a zzso zzso that binds zzso we show the initial symmetry breaking of cortical zzso zzso during early attachment of round zzso We also demonstrated that zzso and zzso are zzso distributed during initial invasion of zzso zzso and, specifically, that zzso controls zzso zzso of zzso and subsequent zzso II zzso Our results reveal that polarized zzso plays a role in zzso zzso zzso zzso II zzso and cortical zzso stability, which is crucial for driving directional vertical migration instead of superficial spreading on the zzso tissue zzso We propose that this mechanism of cortical polarization could sustain zzso of zzso zzso cells during the process of zzso
