zzso zzso represents a model of tumor development after long-term inflammation which causes DNA damage or zzso DNA repair zzso AID and zzso both appearing in zzso B cells, are involved in affinity maturation of the zzso zzso with increased zzso zzso A normal zzso line showed the induction of AID transcripts after stimulation with zzso whereas zzso transcripts appeared zzso in this cell zzso Next, we examined the expression of AID and zzso in clinical zzso specimens to obtain information whether their expression levels are associated with the zzso grade of zzso AID expression was similarly detected in the clinical cases of both zzso and zzso zzso On the contrary, zzso expression was detected in zzso cells at a higher level in the nucleus of zzso zzso with shorter zzso than in that of zzso zzso The high and low cases of nuclear zzso expression showed no change in the frequency of the zzso zzso however, further investigation by in zzso experiment demonstrated that the high zzso expression caused the increased number of zzso zzso after DNA damage by zzso These results suggest that zzso is involved in regulation of DNA repair mechanism and the abnormal zzso of zzso together with AID might be associated with rigorous DNA damage, potentially causing the zzso development of zzso during long-term zzso
