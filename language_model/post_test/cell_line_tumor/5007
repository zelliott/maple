Upper zzso tract zzso cancer has not experienced significant overall survival improvement for over 20 years, and no successful treatments for systemic disease zzso Most patients with zzso cancer experience immune suppression, therefore immune zzso therapies may offer promise for these zzso We presently tested the efficacy of zzso zzso stimulating factor zzso delivered via zzso continuous infusion zzso in combination with zzso tumor cells, in a flank model of zzso zzso 

Five groups of rats were zzso with zzso zzso derived zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso were implanted in the zzso flank to deliver zzso at 0 zzso zzso 1, 10, or 100 zzso zzso zzso 6 per zzso for 28 zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso were injected at the site of the zzso infusion on days 0, 3, 7, 14, and 21 immune infiltrates in tumors were zzso 

zzso that received 10 or 100 zzso zzso had a significantly slower tumor growth rate compared to those who received 0, zzso or 1 zzso zzso P zzso zzso There were increased CD zzso CD zzso and CD zzso cells in tumors of zzso treated animals over zzso 

zzso (10 or 100 zzso delivered locally via zzso pump with zzso slows the growth rate of zzso derived zzso cell zzso in rats while improving immune cell zzso The efficacy of locally delivered zzso zzso in this model may be a first step toward this zzso strategy for zzso
