zzso zzso is an important adverse zzso marker for zzso zzso patients, which is associated with higher risk for developing zzso as a consequence of the limited responsiveness to standard treatments of zzso zzso zzso zzso The use of zzso has been advocated as a possible therapeutic approach to overcome zzso resistance zzso being active on cell lines that are resistant to conventional zzso In this study, we evaluated in zzso effects of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Type I zzso but not zzso showed tangible zzso effects on zzso cell growth, which were higher in zzso cell lines compared to parental zzso The higher sensitivity of zzso zzso cells to Type I zzso zzso with higher expression of the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso two zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso signaling zzso whereas no differences were observed with respect to the expression or zzso of the Type I zzso zzso and zzso Exposure of zzso zzso cells to Type I zzso decreased the expression of zzso This effect resulted in a significantly increased zzso of zzso cells to zzso zzso our data support the use of zzso or zzso in the treatment of zzso patients who zzso zzso in their primary tumors, and respond insufficiently to current therapeutic zzso
