We have generated zzso T cells expressing zzso immune receptors zzso against human zzso zzso zzso zzso and evaluated their tumor therapeutic efficacy alone and in combination with zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and bone zzso zzso cells zzso The zzso engineered T cells demonstrated zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso tumor cells in zzso by zzso zzso and zzso activity in zzso using a Winn zzso In the zzso injected zzso melanoma model, early local but not systemic zzso administration of zzso zzso zzso T cells significantly increased mice zzso This improvement was further enhanced when combined with zzso with zzso followed by zzso T cell treatment with zzso in the active therapy model, possibly through mechanisms of enhancing zzso cellular immune zzso This synergistic effect was lost without delivery of the zzso Our findings suggest that combining engineered T cells with specific vaccination strategies can improve the active tumor zzso
