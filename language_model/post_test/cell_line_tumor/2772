zzso expression of zzso in zzso melanoma cells zzso to increased migration, and increased zzso of zzso in a zzso dependent manner, whereas zzso nuclear expression is found in benign zzso zzso cells were zzso with a zzso expressing zzso fused to a nuclear zzso signal zzso Despite significant nuclear zzso of zzso there was still transport of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso treatment of cells zzso with zzso resulted in an exclusion of zzso from the nucleus, despite the zzso To ascertain whether zzso or zzso were involved in this zzso we zzso the putative zzso sites within the zzso We found that mutating the zzso zzso sites to mimic a zzso state did not cause a shift of zzso to the nucleus of the cells, but mutating the zzso sites zzso zzso of either site to mimic zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso sites exhibited decreased zzso These data imply that zzso zzso of zzso can be controlled by zzso zzso effects on zzso zzso
