To evaluate zzso zzso status and zzso gene amplification in a series of primary zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso To assess the efficacy of zzso a potent inhibitor of Class I zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso against primary zzso harboring zzso gene amplification and/or zzso zzso 

Twenty-two primary zzso cell lines were evaluated for zzso zzso amplification by zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and for zzso gene zzso by direct DNA sequencing of zzso 9 and zzso In zzso sensitivity to zzso was evaluated by zzso viability and proliferation zzso zzso cellular responses to zzso were assessed by measuring zzso of the zzso protein by zzso 

Five of 22 zzso zzso cell lines contained zzso zzso zzso although 9 zzso zzso zzso gene amplification by zzso zzso caused a strong differential growth zzso in zzso zzso when compared with zzso zzso zzso mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso tumors, P zzso zzso zzso zzso harboring zzso zzso were significantly more sensitive to zzso exposure when compared with zzso cell lines harboring zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with a significant and zzso decline in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene amplification may represent zzso to identify patients harboring zzso who may benefit most from the use of zzso
