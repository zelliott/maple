zzso zzso is one of the most aggressive tumors affecting zzso Together with the characteristic zzso zzso that zzso activates the zzso zzso zzso in cellular tumor zzso pathways are additionally required in order to allow the cells to overcome zzso barriers and zzso in an uncontrolled zzso The zzso locus on zzso zzso is considered a safeguard locus since it encodes the two important tumor zzso zzso zzso and zzso By regulating the zzso and zzso pathways zzso and zzso respectively act as zzso and cell cycle inhibitor zzso The importance of the zzso locus has been well documented in several human tumors as well as in zzso zzso Although the mechanisms responsible for the zzso regulation of the zzso locus have been thoroughly zzso less is known about its zzso zzso In this study we found that zzso and zzso are zzso zzso in a panel of zzso cell zzso We demonstrate that along with the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the complete zzso of the locus is achieved by the improper turnover of zzso proteins by the zzso system zzso as the zzso inhibitor zzso blocks zzso degradation and zzso a dramatic stabilization of the zzso zzso We establish that the simultaneous deregulation of both DNA zzso patterns and the zzso zzso system is required to completely inactive the zzso zzso opening new prospects for the understanding and treatment of zzso zzso
