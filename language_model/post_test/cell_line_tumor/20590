zzso zzso the most common adult brain zzso infiltrates normal brain area rendering impossible the complete surgical zzso resulting in a poor median survival zzso zzso despite the aggressive zzso treatments zzso such as radiation and zzso zzso is characterized by hypoxic and zzso regions due to a poorly organized tumor zzso leading to inadequate blood supply and consequently to hypoxic and zzso zzso We have previously shown that, under zzso zzso primary cells increased the expression of zzso markers as well as the expression of the nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and also the crucial role played by zzso in mouse neural stem cells maintenance and zzso Due to the importance of zzso signaling in cell proliferation and zzso in this work, we analyzed the expression of zzso in zzso zzso both in zzso and hypoxic zzso The results obtained suggest a differential regulation of the three zzso by zzso thus indicating a possible therapeutic strategy to counteract zzso zzso
