This article investigates the mechanism of zzso of zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso expressions and activities of zzso and membrane zzso zzso were zzso and a zzso zzso of zzso human zzso was measured in the presence of zzso human membrane zzso zzso zzso oxide increased expressions of both zzso zzso and zzso the zzso processing of zzso from the zzso to the final active zzso zzso human membrane zzso zzso was able to process zzso human zzso to fully active zzso zzso had no effect on zzso human zzso zzso zzso oxide scavenger zzso strongly attenuated zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, tissue inhibitor of zzso markedly reduced the zzso of zzso in response to zzso zzso These studies identify membrane zzso zzso as a target for zzso oxide, which may be critical for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso
