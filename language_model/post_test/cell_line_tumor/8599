We hypothesized that zzso the zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso forms that are zzso in lung cancer, via global analysis of zzso zzso zzso and systematically zzso the ensuing network zzso should offer a new, more zzso perspective of the molecular zzso Here, we describe an zzso zzso of 263 proteins and offer a zzso core network critical to the viability of multiple zzso lung cancer zzso zzso with acquired resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had differential dependence of the core network proteins based on the underlying molecular mechanisms of zzso Of the 14 zzso 9 are shown to be specifically associated with survival of zzso lung cancer cell zzso This included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso With the use of a drug network associated with the core network zzso we identified two compounds, zzso and zzso that could overcome drug resistance through direct zzso zzso when combined with zzso Our results, enabled by zzso zzso suggest new targets and combination therapies that could circumvent zzso zzso zzso
