zzso zzso and copy number variation are frequently observed in cancer cells, including multiple myeloma zzso zzso abnormalities seen in zzso cells correlate with the disease stage and drug zzso Here, we investigate the nuclear arrangement of the zzso zzso amplification of this region is an important diagnostic and zzso marker of zzso We examined the zzso cell line zzso zzso multiple myeloma zzso zzso cells, and the zzso bone zzso fraction of patients diagnosed with zzso In this experimental system, we observed that zzso and selected zzso drugs such as zzso and zzso did not significantly alter the nuclear zzso arrangement of the zzso region and other relevant regions of zzso zzso Similarly, zzso nuclear zzso positioning after zzso treatment was observed for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso When analyzed zzso a protein zzso by a gene mapped to the zzso region, we found that the zzso zzso is highly expressed in multiple myeloma zzso cells, but not in peripheral blood zzso of healthy donors or zzso zzso zzso this is in contrast to the expression pattern of the zzso zzso On the basis of these observations we suggest that the zzso region is an important diagnostic marker of zzso particularly the gene zzso the zzso zzso which can be easily detected by western zzso
