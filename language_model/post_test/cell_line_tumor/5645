This study examined the role of zzso a major zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Treatment with zzso zzso increased zzso of zzso at zzso in zzso human zzso zzso The zzso of a zzso active zzso zzso zzso A beta zzso led to a significant decrease in zzso at zzso an increase in the activity of zzso and an increase in the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso for a zzso zzso was zzso zzso and specific activity of zzso was zzso zzso In addition, zzso and zzso were zzso in zzso cells and brain zzso and zzso formed a complex only with zzso zzso We conclude that in zzso zzso can zzso zzso at zzso and form a stable complex with zzso suggesting the possibility that zzso regulates the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso
