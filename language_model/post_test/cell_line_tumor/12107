zzso M is a zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso Several lines of evidence indicate that zzso M is a tumor zzso important in breast zzso however, the zzso that leads to zzso of zzso M during cancer progression is zzso zzso of the human zzso M locus uncovered a large and dense zzso island within the zzso region of this gene zzso zzso Analysis of cultured human breast tumor lines indicated that zzso M expression is either zzso or in low abundance in several zzso however, enhanced gene expression was measured in cells cultured on the DNA zzso agent zzso zzso Increased zzso M expression does not correlate with a zzso response to zzso rather, various molecular approaches indicated that the zzso gene was zzso zzso in these tumor lines as well as in primary breast zzso Moreover, zzso (12 of zzso of primary tumors analyzed displayed zzso zzso indicating that this zzso characteristic is common in breast zzso Finally, zzso and invasive breast tumor cells were zzso from nine archival breast cancer zzso Of the five tumors displaying zzso gene zzso four tumors displayed zzso in both zzso zzso in zzso and invasive breast zzso zzso and reduced expression of zzso M in these tumors was confirmed by zzso In zzso this study establishes that the tumor zzso zzso M is a novel target for zzso zzso during zzso zzso and that this zzso event can occur before development of invasive breast zzso
