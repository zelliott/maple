zzso are zzso and functionally zzso tumors zzso of distinct zzso that drive disease progression and are responsible for resistance to zzso Identification and characterization of such zzso are highly important to develop novel targeted zzso However, this can be a challenging task as there is a lack of clearly defined markers to distinguish the melanoma zzso from a general tumor cell zzso Also, there is a lack of optimal isolation methods and functional zzso that can fully zzso their zzso Here we describe a method for zzso tumor cells from fresh human tumor tissue specimens using an zzso coupled magnetic zzso sorting technique that is well established in our zzso Thus, melanoma cells are enriched by negative cell sorting and elimination of zzso cell population such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso Enriched unmodified tumor cells can be further used for zzso and functional characterization of melanoma zzso
