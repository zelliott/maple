zzso of the host immune system represents a promising therapeutic approach against cancer, including multiple zzso Recent findings indicate that the zzso group zzso zzso and zzso accessory zzso zzso receptors play a prominent role in tumor recognition and elimination by zzso zzso suggesting that the levels of zzso and zzso zzso expression on tumor cells may be a critical factor to improve the immune response against zzso In this study, we tested the effect of zzso and zzso drugs targeting the heat shock zzso zzso zzso protein and displaying zzso activity, on the expression of zzso and zzso zzso in human myeloma cell zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso are able to zzso both zzso class I zzso zzso A and zzso protein surface and zzso expression in human myeloma cell lines, without any significant effect on the zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or induction of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso factor heat shock zzso by zzso zzso is essential for the zzso of zzso expression and zzso of heat shock zzso using small hairpin zzso interference blocks this zzso Moreover, in zzso and in zzso binding of heat shock zzso to zzso and zzso promoters indicates that it may enhance zzso zzso expression at the zzso zzso Finally, exposure to zzso zzso renders myeloma cells more efficient to activate zzso cell zzso and a blocking zzso specific for zzso significantly reduces this zzso Thus, these results provide evidence that targeting zzso zzso expression may be an additional mechanism supporting the zzso activity of zzso zzso and suggest their possible zzso zzso
