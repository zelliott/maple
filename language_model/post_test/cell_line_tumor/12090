To evaluate the effects of selective and zzso zzso on the growth and zzso of colon cancer cell lines in zzso 

The proliferation of colon cancer cells was determined by zzso zzso and the cell cycle progression was analyzed by flow zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in combination with flow zzso zzso was used to detect zzso induced by zzso 

It was found that zzso zzso and aspirin could inhibit the growth of zzso or zzso cell and showed a concentration dependent zzso zzso protein was expressed in zzso and zzso but not in zzso zzso In addition, zzso levels in both zzso cell and zzso cells were reduced by aspirin and zzso Both aspirin (10 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso and zzso colon cancer cells, the zzso rates were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Both zzso selective and zzso zzso can potentially inhibit the growth of colon cell lines and such zzso effect on zzso negative colon cancer cells is also zzso
