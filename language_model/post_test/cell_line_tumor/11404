zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso A growing body of evidence has been accumulated describing the role of zzso molecules in cancer development and the involvement of zzso in cancer progression has recently been zzso 

Our analysis, based on real-time zzso focused on the expression of zzso in a panel of breast cancer zzso compared to the normal zzso 

In cancer zzso we found a significantly strong zzso of this zzso zzso we identified and characterized a novel zzso zzso named zzso This zzso has a novel zzso zzso created by the usage of alternative donor and zzso zzso sites internal to the zzso zzso By in zzso analysis we found that the new transcript 3' zzso lacks some zzso zzso binding sites, suggesting possible consequences on both spatial and zzso expression of zzso The translated sequence of zzso lacks the zzso tail, crucial for triggering the reverse signaling described for the zzso zzso We also demonstrated, by zzso analysis of zzso and zzso zzso that the protein clearly localized to the zzso zzso and plasma zzso In conclusion, zzso gene products are strongly down modulated in breast cancer zzso and a new zzso named zzso has been described and zzso 

Our work states a clear relation among breast cancer and zzso zzso zzso we describe for the first time the zzso protein and report here the analysis of zzso zzso messenger, the protein expression and the cellular zzso
