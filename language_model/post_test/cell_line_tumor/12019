The folate zzso zzso is a valuable zzso marker, since it is frequently zzso on various cancer zzso The purpose of the present study was to zzso evaluate novel zzso modified zzso folate zzso 4, zzso 5) and zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso 4-6 were prepared by a zzso zzso In zzso zzso (K zzso and B zzso of the zzso was performed with zzso zzso zzso zzso distribution was studied in zzso zzso zzso experiments were performed with a dedicated small animal zzso zzso 

The complexes 4-6 were formed in high yields zzso zzso zzso of the zzso (K zzso in zzso zzso zzso 5: zzso zzso zzso were similar to those of zzso acid (K zzso in zzso zzso In zzso the folate derivatives showed significantly better zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 5: zzso zzso 4 h zzso than the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 h zzso zzso of all zzso from the blood pool and from zzso zzso was efficient zzso to blood ratio zzso zzso 24 h zzso zzso tissue and zzso were successfully zzso via small animal zzso 

zzso 4-6 are the first zzso zzso prepared via a kit zzso which exhibit full biological activity in zzso and in zzso zzso derivatives 4 and 5 revealed significantly better zzso properties than the zzso zzso zzso Promising zzso zzso results warrant further assessment of zzso zzso for detection of zzso zzso
