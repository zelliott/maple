The protein C zzso zzso is an essential process for attenuating zzso generation by the zzso zzso complexes zzso and zzso In this pathway, protein S zzso serves as a zzso for activated protein zzso zzso zzso in plasma both in a free form and in complex with complement component zzso protein zzso zzso is a known acute phase zzso thereby suggesting a relation between zzso and the acute phase zzso zzso zzso has been shown to increase both zzso and zzso gene zzso Our objective was to study the regulation of zzso gene expression by zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso both zzso zzso and protein levels in zzso zzso zzso The promoter of the zzso gene zzso was cloned upstream from a zzso reporter zzso After zzso in zzso cells, the zzso activity was shown to be zzso by the addition of zzso zzso exerts its effect through Signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso that interacts with the zzso promoter at a binding site in between zzso 229 to zzso upstream from the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso expression via zzso A possible function for zzso zzso expression in cell survival is zzso
