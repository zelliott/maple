Human zzso zzso downstream regulated gene 2) was identified as a candidate tumor zzso gene due to its low expression in human zzso and other cancer zzso However, the mechanisms that lead to zzso of the zzso gene remain zzso In the present study, zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis were used to confirm that zzso zzso and protein levels are decreased in several cancer cell zzso We found zzso deletion of zzso in zzso cells, and showed that zzso (at zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso promoter occurred in several cancer cell zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso of the zzso core promoter significantly reduced zzso zzso Finally, we showed that zzso expression was decreased in several breast cancer zzso zzso changes in the zzso gene were not zzso Here, we describe for the first time, the mechanisms involved in zzso gene zzso
