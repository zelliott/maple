We systematically analyzed multiple myeloma zzso cell lines and patient bone zzso cells for their zzso capacity in zzso mice and validated the response of the resulting zzso to zzso zzso 

Using flow zzso and near infrared zzso zzso growth zzso of zzso cell lines zzso and zzso and patient bone zzso cells were investigated with use of a zzso subcutaneous bone zzso zzso and intravenous approach in zzso zzso treated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice zzso 

zzso growth was significantly increased in the absence of natural killer cell activity zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso revealed enhanced growth zzso in the former, especially with respect to zzso tumor sites which were exclusively observed zzso In zzso zzso cells were more zzso when injected zzso than zzso In zzso in contrast, the use of juvenile long bone implants was superior to zzso or intravenous cancer cell zzso Using the zzso zzso model, mice developed typical disease symptoms exclusively when implanted with human zzso cell lines or zzso bone zzso cells, but not with healthy bone zzso cells nor in zzso zzso zzso and zzso delayed myeloma progression in zzso as well as zzso zzso cell bearing zzso zzso activity could be zzso via flow zzso and in zzso imaging zzso 

Our results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso model mimics the clinical situation of the zzso disease and serves as a valuable tool in the development of novel zzso zzso
