We generated several cell models of zzso in order to study the mechanisms of zzso in diseases involving abnormal changes of zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines were created that zzso express different zzso of the repeat domain of zzso zzso when exposed to zzso zzso zzso The following three zzso were zzso zzso the repeat domain of zzso that zzso with the core of zzso paired zzso zzso zzso the repeat domain with the deletion zzso zzso known from zzso zzso and highly prone to spontaneous zzso and zzso the repeat domain with zzso and two zzso point zzso that inhibit zzso The comparison of zzso zzso and zzso zzso shows the zzso zzso zzso of zzso is toxic to zzso zzso The degree of zzso and toxicity depends on the propensity for zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso that cannot zzso are not zzso zzso zzso is preceded by zzso zzso zzso of zzso in cells is initially due to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso (at zzso zzso precedes zzso but is not correlated with the degree of zzso zzso zzso of zzso disappear when the expression is zzso showing that zzso is zzso zzso zzso can be prevented by drugs and even zzso zzso can be dissolved again by zzso Thus, the cell models open up new insights into the relationship between the structure, zzso zzso zzso and toxicity of zzso that can be used to test current hypotheses on zzso and to develop drugs that prevent the zzso and zzso of zzso
