Two zzso zzso duplex drugs zzso zzso and zzso zzso were designed and zzso at gram scale according to the zzso method in an overall yield of about zzso The in zzso evaluation of the zzso effects indicated highly varying sensibilities of the panel of 60 tested tumor cell lines against the duplex zzso zzso had a 50% growth zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso However, only zzso of those cell lines showed corresponding zzso values when the zzso zzso was zzso Total growth zzso was achieved using zzso zzso of the duplex zzso The zzso zzso of the duplex drug can cause very different effects like zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso activities, which drastically changed efficiency as well as specificity of the zzso activities of the duplex drugs, in comparison to those of the zzso zzso
