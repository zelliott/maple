The biggest challenge for the treatment of zzso resistance cancer is to deliver high concentration of zzso drugs specifically to cancer cells for longer period of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1000 zzso zzso are known zzso of zzso Mixed zzso prepared from zzso 407 and zzso may increases the therapeutic efficacy of drug by delivering high concentration of drug inside the cells and zzso of zzso zzso zzso is a naturally derived novel zzso agent but poor zzso limited its clinical zzso In this study, we have developed zzso 407 and zzso mixed zzso zzso zzso for treatment of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mixed zzso were prepared by thin film zzso method and their zzso properties were zzso Cellular zzso and in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso mixed zzso were studied in zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso The diameter of zzso zzso zzso mixed zzso was about zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso potential of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso efficiency of zzso was ranged from zzso with drug loading was about zzso zzso scanning zzso and X-ray powder zzso studies confirmed that zzso was zzso by the zzso The in zzso release studies showed that mixed zzso sustained the release of zzso for more than 9 zzso zzso from cellular zzso studies indicated that zzso zzso zzso mixed zzso had increased cellular zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso mixed zzso was found to be 3 folds more than free zzso after 48 of zzso 

This study suggests that zzso zzso mixed zzso might be a suitable zzso for zzso to treat zzso resistant zzso zzso
