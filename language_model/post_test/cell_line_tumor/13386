zzso zzso associated protein zzso is an zzso protein that regulates multiple biological zzso Although zzso expression of zzso is associated with breast cancer, its function in tumor cells is poorly zzso In this report, we provide evidence that zzso regulates breast tumor cell proliferation and zzso zzso zzso protein expression is elevated in primary and zzso tumor zzso and zzso zzso expression levels correlated zzso with patient survival in two large breast tumor zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells increased cell growth, whereas zzso zzso in tumor cells inhibited cell proliferation in zzso and suppressed tumor growth in zzso zzso zzso zzso The growth regulation of zzso tumor cells controlled by zzso appears to be zzso at least in part, by zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells enhances zzso of zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso in zzso tumor cells inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso significantly reduced three-dimensional zzso growth induced by zzso zzso the zzso functional and zzso analyses suggest a role of zzso in tumor promotion in human breast zzso
