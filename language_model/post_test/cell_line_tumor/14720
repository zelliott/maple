The zzso transition zzso induced by zzso agents promotes zzso tumor zzso however, the mechanism underlying the drug-induced zzso remains zzso In this study, we reported that zzso is the most zzso zzso following zzso zzso of zzso correlated with zzso induction in breast cancer in zzso and in zzso With the use of zzso zzso analysis, we demonstrated that zzso suppression zzso zzso by directly targeting special zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to elevated levels of zzso and zzso increasing zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, we also found that the zzso zzso directly binds the promoter of zzso suppressing its transcription, suggesting a positive feedback loop between zzso and zzso Furthermore, all patients who received zzso zzso zzso plus zzso zzso plus zzso chemotherapy showed zzso suppression, an increased zzso zzso expression and acquisition of zzso zzso These findings reveal an underlying regulatory pathway, in which the zzso between zzso and zzso is important for restrain zzso suppression upon chemotherapy and may have a role in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso feedback loop during clinical treatment may improve the chemotherapy response of human breast zzso in which zzso is a critical zzso
