zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits potent zzso activity on systemic administration in nonhuman primates without deleterious side effects for normal zzso However, there is a controversy about the potential toxicity of TRAIL on human zzso The use of different zzso TRAIL forms only partially explains the contradicting reports on TRAIL sensitivity in primary human zzso zzso 

To clarify this issue, we zzso tested four different zzso forms of TRAIL for their zzso capacity on zzso obtained from a total of 55 human zzso between day 1 and day 8 of in zzso zzso 

One day after zzso isolation, all but one zzso form of TRAIL zzso an zzso form of TRAIL zzso induced zzso in zzso zzso induction by TRAIL in these cells could only be fully inhibited by zzso blockade of TRAIL zzso 1 and TRAIL zzso zzso At day 4 of in zzso culture, when surrogate markers indicated optimal zzso in zzso function, only high doses of zzso zzso killed zzso whereas the other three zzso TRAIL forms did zzso zzso zzso of day 4 zzso with zzso zzso for zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso which are commonly used in the treatment of gastrointestinal zzso did zzso 

Our data show that whereas TRAIL alone or together with selected zzso drugs seems to be safe, the combination of TRAIL with zzso is toxic to zzso
