zzso zzso have potential for the treatment of cervical zzso We describe the synthesis and biological characterization of a new series of zzso zzso based derivatives lacking the zzso acid zzso of the previously reported zzso zzso inhibitor zzso acid zzso and bearing a variety of zzso acid zzso on the zzso group of the zzso Our lead compound 2 zzso zzso zzso activity and has improved zzso zzso and zzso properties in cervical cancer cells containing human zzso Further, it zzso synergistic killing of cervical cancer cell lines when tested in combination with an zzso approved zzso zzso zzso of the potential mechanism of zzso zzso by our lead compound using in zzso zzso studies suggests that the zzso group of its zzso zzso is susceptible to zzso attack by the zzso side chain within the zzso sites of the zzso
