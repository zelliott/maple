In the zzso zzso cell line, replication of the zzso zzso zzso strain of zzso C virus zzso is attenuated compared to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso This study identifies the poorly characterized integral membrane zzso zzso as a major zzso for this replication zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the entire zzso gene from zzso in place of the zzso zzso sequence zzso approximately zzso better than the zzso parent and to levels similar to that of the adapted zzso zzso An intermediate level of replication enhancement was zzso by zzso zzso containing the poorly zzso zzso 47 zzso or the remaining zzso C zzso of zzso zzso The zzso activity within the N zzso of zzso was further mapped to two zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso the mechanism of enhanced zzso replication revealed that zzso zzso primarily increased zzso zzso synthesis on a per cell basis, as indicated by the similar capacities of zzso and parental zzso to establish replication in zzso cells and the higher levels of both zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso than for the zzso zzso Additionally, enhanced zzso replication was not the result of zzso zzso effects on zzso translation efficiency or zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in trans did not improve the replication of the zzso parental zzso suggesting a zzso role for zzso in zzso zzso These results provide the first evidence that zzso variation in the zzso sequence between closely related zzso significantly impacts zzso replication in cell zzso
