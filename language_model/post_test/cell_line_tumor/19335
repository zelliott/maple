The deregulation of homocysteine metabolism leads to zzso a condition described as an independent cardiovascular disease risk zzso zzso plasma membrane zzso systems can play a dual zzso and zzso role in zzso In this study, we test the hypothesis that homocysteine, as a zzso active compound, could zzso the zzso plasma membrane zzso zzso We show that homocysteine behaves as a very potent zzso of this zzso Furthermore, we show that this inducing effect is also produced on tumor cells and that it can be observed at both the activity and protein zzso On the other hand, homocysteine treatment decreases the activity of the specific zzso tumor zzso zzso Taken together, these results underscore a potential zzso action of zzso
