zzso has potential as an zzso agent for cancer treatment because of its ability to effectively stimulate zzso T cell, natural killer T cell, and natural killer cell zzso However, its effectiveness may be limited by negative zzso checkpoints that zzso immune zzso Recently a clinical trial of zzso in cancer zzso was zzso Finding strategies to zzso negative regulators and enhance efficacy of zzso is critical and meaningful for such clinical zzso In a zzso study, we evaluated zzso combined with zzso to block negative immune regulator zzso T zzso zzso 4 zzso and programmed death zzso 1 zzso in an established zzso transgenic zzso of mouse prostate zzso prostate tumor zzso zzso treatment resulted in a significant zzso of survival in zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso with zzso did not improve animal survival over that of zzso zzso However, simultaneous administration of zzso with zzso and zzso was associated with increased numbers of tumor zzso zzso zzso T cells, increased zzso zzso tumor zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso release, decreased rates of tumor growth, and improved animal survival compared with zzso zzso Furthermore, triple combination therapy was associated with zzso of zzso functions of zzso regulatory T cells and zzso regulatory T zzso Thus, simultaneous blockade of zzso and zzso protected zzso and/or zzso zzso activity from these regulatory T zzso Combining the immune zzso properties of zzso with simultaneous removal of two critical immune zzso zzso we showed enhancement of immune responses, leading to increased zzso zzso
