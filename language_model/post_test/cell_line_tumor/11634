zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be a promising zzso zzso for locally advanced and zzso breast zzso Unfortunately, a significant proportion of patients developed resistance to this type of zzso therapy but the molecular mechanisms governing cellular responsiveness to this agent remain poorly zzso Here, we've reported that zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance breast cancer cells to zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso further promoted cell cycle arrest induced by zzso Using an zzso zzso mouse model, we found that zzso of zzso significantly reduced tumor growth in zzso zzso zzso of zzso further zzso tumor growth zzso by zzso zzso studies indicated that combination of zzso treatment and zzso zzso is able to zzso inhibit the expression of zzso target zzso zzso zzso experiments further supported a role for zzso in regulating the recruitment of zzso zzso II and zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso target gene promoter in the presence of zzso These results demonstrate a role for zzso in zzso resistance to the pure zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso
