The aim was to study the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and to explore its correlation with the presence of zzso zzso zzso among patients with zzso zzso 

The expression levels of zzso zzso in zzso cell lines and in ten zzso of zzso and adjacent normal tissue were examined by quantitative real-time zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, protein expression of zzso in 71 zzso zzso zzso was assessed by zzso Finally, the serum level of zzso in 177 zzso patients and 103 healthy controls was evaluated by zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The expression of zzso zzso in zzso cells was significantly lower than in the adjacent normal zzso ( zzso When the expression of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso cell lines was zzso we found that both zzso and protein expressions of zzso were significantly higher in zzso zzso Furthermore, the results of zzso analysis demonstrated that the frequency of reduced zzso expression in zzso zzso was significantly higher than that in zzso zzso 

In this study, we have confirmed that zzso is significantly zzso in zzso zzso In addition, based on our preliminary results, we propose that the reduction of zzso in zzso cells is associated with the presence of the zzso zzso and/or the expression of zzso zzso zzso may play an important role in zzso zzso zzso
