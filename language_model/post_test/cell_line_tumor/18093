The molecular zzso of acute zzso and other tumors constitutes a major obstacle towards understanding disease zzso and developing new zzso zzso gene regulation is a hallmark of cancer and plays a central role in determining tumor zzso We predicted that integration of different zzso zzso regulatory marks along with gene expression levels would provide greater power in capturing biological differences between leukemia zzso Gene zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso were measured using zzso zzso zzso in primary human acute zzso leukemia zzso and acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso We found that DNA zzso and zzso zzso distinguished these zzso of distinct cell zzso as expected, but that an zzso analysis combining the information from each platform revealed hundreds of additional zzso expressed genes that were missed by gene expression zzso zzso This integrated analysis also enhanced the detection and statistical significance of biological pathways zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies are thus feasible using clinical samples and provide superior detection of zzso zzso programming than zzso zzso zzso
