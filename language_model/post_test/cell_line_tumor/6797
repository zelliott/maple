Cancer zzso has been limited by zzso of patient T cells, inadequate numbers of precursor zzso zzso and difficulty in producing therapeutic doses of zzso To overcome these limitations, zzso zzso have been used to create artificial zzso receptors that direct zzso activated T cells zzso to target tumor zzso Studies reported zzso were designed to characterize zzso zzso zzso functions during multiple rounds of targeted cell zzso 

zzso were generated from human peripheral blood zzso cells zzso by culture with zzso and zzso 2 for 14 days and armed with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso were examined for a range of functions after repeated stimulation with the zzso breast cancer cell line zzso zzso isolated from cancer patients treated with zzso zzso were tested ex zzso for zzso against zzso 

In zzso armed zzso divided, maintained surface zzso and expressed a range of activities for extended periods of zzso zzso zzso activity by armed zzso continued for at least 336 hours, and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and regulated on zzso normal zzso expressed and zzso protein zzso were zzso during successive rounds of zzso Furthermore, zzso isolated from patients over their courses of zzso exhibited significant zzso activity against zzso as a function of zzso zzso zzso 

These studies show that armed zzso are specific, zzso and highly functional zzso populations in zzso These previously unappreciated broad and long-term functions of armed zzso are encouraging for their therapeutic use in treating zzso
