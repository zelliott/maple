The occurrence of zzso resistance zzso is the major obstacle to successful zzso cancer zzso In the present study, we assessed the effects of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso with zzso properties in tumor cell lines, on a number of molecular mechanisms involved in the resistance of human breast zzso cell lines to zzso zzso zzso studies in zzso zzso and their zzso zzso zzso zzso cells showed a synergistic effect between zzso and zzso when exposure to zzso preceded or was simultaneous with zzso treatment in zzso zzso zzso This effect of zzso seems to be due in part to its ability to increase zzso levels and to zzso cellular zzso zzso In addition, zzso increased zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells by interfering with zzso zzso zzso as evidenced using a specific zzso that recognizes the active form of the zzso zzso was also found to affect the expression levels of proteins involved in response to drug treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso is a potential new agent that may improve the clinical effect of zzso in tumors exhibiting a zzso zzso
