zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are marine derived compounds which demonstrate zzso zzso The present study was performed to zzso the relationship between the expression of zzso and zzso with resistance to either zzso or zzso 

We evaluate the association between expression of zzso zzso and zzso proteins and zzso or zzso resistance in a large panel of zzso resistant cell lines derived from zzso unrelated human tumors that were selected with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso 

zzso selected resistant cell lines expressed high levels of zzso (but not zzso or zzso did not demonstrate zzso to either zzso or zzso In contrast, the zzso selected resistant cell lines also expressed high level of zzso (but not zzso or zzso but did demonstrate significant zzso to both zzso and zzso The zzso selected cell lines demonstrated zzso to zzso zzso and zzso while most of the above zzso selected cell lines demonstrated zzso to zzso and zzso but not to zzso On the contrary, zzso and zzso selected cell lines demonstrated no zzso to zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression in zzso selected cell lines caused partial zzso to both zzso and zzso but not to either zzso or zzso 

These results indicate that cell lines selected for resistance to either zzso or zzso are zzso to many other drugs and that, for these cell lines, zzso zzso is not necessary to zzso resistance to either zzso or zzso Diversity of zzso observed in these zzso resistant cell lines are associated with the initial drug used for in zzso selection, but not to zzso zzso This study suggests that a common molecular zzso other than zzso may be involved in the mechanism of resistance to zzso or zzso
