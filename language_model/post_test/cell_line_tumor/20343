Gene expression depends on binding of zzso regulators to gene zzso a process controlled by zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes involved in zzso progression and becomes zzso following zzso by the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso Interestingly, the DNA motifs recognized by zzso and signal zzso and zzso of zzso 5 zzso are zzso Because zzso stimulation in zzso cells can also be triggered by zzso zzso we asked whether both factors have opposing roles in zzso regulation and whether zzso zzso may coordinate a zzso factor zzso We used zzso zzso to show that active zzso promotes release of the zzso zzso while increasing binding of zzso to a zzso reporter zzso We further show in zzso cell lines that the zzso zzso status of the zzso zzso correlated with the zzso status of zzso and zzso Three cellular genes zzso zzso zzso small zzso modifier 1) were identified to be zzso regulated by zzso and zzso and responded to zzso zzso with increased expression and corresponding changes in promoter zzso Together, our data show that zzso zzso controls a group of target genes that are zzso by zzso and activated by zzso providing novel insights into the zzso of gene zzso by zzso zzso
