zzso acid zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are now emerging as an important new class of zzso zzso This paper provides evidence, based on zzso liquid zzso zzso mass zzso zzso gas zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the occurrence in mouse and bovine brain extracts of a compound zzso by a mass spectrum attributable to a zzso not previously zzso zzso the zzso of zzso acid zzso A highly sensitive zzso method was developed for zzso of naturally occurring zzso and, also, for purposes of comparison, that of zzso zzso a structurally related compound commonly determined in animal zzso The results obtained show that zzso levels in mouse brain are zzso higher than those of zzso Moreover, zzso was found in human zzso cell zzso zzso at significantly higher levels following exposure of the cells to the zzso inhibitor zzso All this evidence not only shows surprisingly that zzso may be found naturally in zzso biological extracts despite the unusual functional group zzso zzso zzso but also raises many important questions concerning its biological zzso
