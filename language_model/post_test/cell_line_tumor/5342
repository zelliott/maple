A zzso carbon zzso zzso drug delivery system was developed by zzso combining carbon zzso with the zzso agent zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso as the zzso between zzso and drug zzso The surface zzso of the zzso were carried out by enrichment of zzso groups with zzso zzso treatment, followed by zzso linking zzso zzso zzso via zzso reaction, and then zzso was chemically attached to carbon zzso through a zzso zzso zzso It is demonstrated that the obtained zzso zzso are superior in zzso activity both in zzso and in zzso to clinical zzso zzso In zzso single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging and ex zzso gamma zzso counting analyses reveal that zzso zzso have relatively long blood circulation and high drug zzso in the tumor zzso These properties together with the enhanced cell zzso and zzso presentation of zzso on a single zzso benefit substantially the zzso effects and would boost significantly the applications of carbon zzso in the zzso zzso
