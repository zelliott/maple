As stem cells undergo zzso zzso DNA zzso copy number is strictly regulated in order that specialized cells can generate appropriate levels of zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso to undertake their specific zzso It is not understood whether zzso cells regulate their zzso in a similar manner or whether zzso is essential for zzso We show that human neural stem cells zzso increased their zzso content during differentiation in a process that was zzso by a synergistic relationship between the nuclear and zzso zzso and results in increased respiratory zzso zzso zzso zzso cells failed to match the expansion in zzso copy number, patterns of gene expression and increased respiratory capacity observed in zzso zzso depletion of zzso cell zzso rescued zzso replication events and enhanced cell zzso However, prolonged depletion resulted in impaired zzso zzso reduced proliferation and induced the expression of early zzso and zzso markers including zzso class 5 zzso 1 zzso and sonic zzso zzso The transfer of zzso cells depleted to varying degrees of their zzso content into zzso mice resulted in tumors requiring significantly longer to form compared with zzso zzso The number of tumors formed and the time to tumor formation was relative to the degree of zzso zzso The tumors derived from zzso depleted zzso cells recovered their zzso copy number as part of the tumor formation zzso These outcomes demonstrate the importance of zzso to the initiation and maintenance of zzso in zzso zzso
