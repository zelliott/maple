The term zzso mimicry zzso indicates the process by which aggressive tumor cells are able to generate in zzso zzso zzso channels zzso by zzso zzso Although zzso has been described in several human zzso the molecular basis of this phenomenon is not entirely zzso In the present study, we examined zzso in two zzso cancer cell lines with different invasion capability zzso I, low invasion zzso zzso high invasion zzso Specifically, we focused on the potential role played by zzso zzso zzso a membrane spanning zzso highly expressed in tumor cells, in zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso may be involved in the progression of zzso by regulating the expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso In this study, we found significant correlations between expression of zzso in zzso cancer cell lines and tumor zzso the activity of the zzso and the ability to form vascular zzso The treatment of zzso cells with small interfering zzso against zzso suppressed the ability of these cells to generate zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso into the zzso I cell line resulted in an increased tumor zzso and enabled the formation of vascular zzso Altogether, our data suggest that zzso may play a critical role in zzso of zzso I and zzso human zzso cancer cell zzso
