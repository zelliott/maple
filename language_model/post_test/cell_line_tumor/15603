zzso signals play key roles in zzso and zzso through the zzso of cell fate and zzso zzso zzso proteins are zzso signaling molecules implicated in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso showing zzso zzso zzso Here, we identified and characterized human zzso of zzso zzso and zzso using zzso Human zzso gene was located within human zzso draft sequence zzso zzso position zzso in the forward zzso and human zzso gene within zzso zzso position zzso in the reverse zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed zzso zzso zzso Seven zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso between zzso and zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso proteins revealed that zzso zzso and zzso are zzso of human zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso fetal brain, eye, heart, adult brain zzso gastric cancer zzso ring cell zzso zzso colon zzso acute zzso zzso germ cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso zzso tract zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were mapped to human zzso zzso and zzso zzso Human zzso zzso is deleted in zzso while human zzso zzso is deleted in breast, zzso and gastric zzso Based on evolutionary and functional conservation of zzso signaling molecules as well as human zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes are predicted to be potent zzso zzso
