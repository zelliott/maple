zzso zzso therapy zzso caused a zzso decrease of zzso cell detachment by zzso zzso acid zzso in human zzso zzso and zzso zzso This happened zzso with the increase of zzso free calcium zzso zzso which increased zzso induced further decrease in zzso cell detachment and increased zzso zzso effects were observed when zzso zzso acid zzso an zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso changes in zzso and cell detachment were not blocked by calcium channel zzso zzso zzso or zzso nor were they altered when cells were zzso in a buffer free from zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is derived from the internal calcium zzso zzso cell migration was observed after zzso as assessed by zzso and zzso zzso Our findings indicated that internal calcium zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso cell detachment decrease and zzso Cell migration may be affected by these zzso
