zzso zzso linkage and zzso studies support the role of zzso genes in the zzso of zzso zzso To further examine the role of genetic variation underlying zzso we zzso zzso single zzso zzso in 152 genes involved in zzso DNA repair, immune response and zzso stress pathways among a unique sample of 165 unrelated familial cases including patients with chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and 107 spouse zzso We confirmed previous studies showing a zzso in the zzso promoter zzso to be associated with zzso lymphoma, as this zzso was found to be associated with both zzso and zzso We also confirmed the role of zzso variation to be associated with zzso zzso in zzso were associated with both zzso and zzso Future replication and functional studies are needed to clarify the role of these genetic zzso Finally, our data further support the close association of zzso and zzso
