zzso alpha 2 zzso a member of the zzso family, has a central role in zzso transport and is zzso in many zzso Our previous study identified zzso as significantly zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with poor survival of zzso However, the precise mechanism of this effect remains zzso The aim of the present study was to examine the role of zzso in the proliferation and zzso of zzso cells, and its clinical significance in tumor zzso zzso quantitative zzso analysis revealed high expression levels of zzso in 162 out of 191 zzso fresh zzso zzso which was significantly correlated with International Federation of zzso and zzso zzso stage, zzso zzso type, zzso and prognosis of zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso of zzso expression significantly increased the proliferation and zzso of zzso cells zzso and zzso in zzso and in zzso by promoting cell growth rate, zzso formation, soft zzso colony formation, and tumor formation in nude zzso By contrast, zzso of zzso effectively suppressed the proliferation and zzso of these zzso cells in zzso and in zzso Our results also indicated that the molecular mechanisms of the effect of zzso in zzso included promotion of zzso cell cycle transition through zzso of zzso enhanced zzso activity of zzso zzso of zzso activity, suppression of zzso activity, zzso of zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso regulator zzso zzso Our results show that zzso has an important role in promoting proliferation and zzso of zzso and may represent a novel zzso zzso and therapeutic target for this zzso
