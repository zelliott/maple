The precise regulation of zzso zzso zzso seems to be critically important for the proper functioning of all zzso zzso Even small changes in the levels of specific zzso can initiate pathological zzso including zzso zzso there is a great need to develop effective methods for the regulation of zzso zzso and zzso In this study, we focused on the final step of zzso zzso zzso zzso processing by zzso To test our hypothesis that zzso molecules can function not only as zzso zzso but also as zzso regulators, we previously identified by zzso a pool of zzso zzso that bind to human zzso We found that certain of these zzso zzso could selectively inhibit the formation of specific zzso Here, we show that these specific zzso can simultaneously bind both zzso and zzso These zzso zzso interfere with zzso maturation by affecting zzso structure and zzso zzso Based on these zzso we designed a set of short zzso (12 zzso zzso that were capable of influencing zzso processing in zzso both in reactions involving zzso human zzso and in zzso zzso We propose that the same strategy may be used to develop effective and selective regulators to control the production of any zzso Overall, our findings indicate that the interactions between zzso and other zzso may form very complex regulatory networks that zzso zzso zzso and consequently gene zzso
