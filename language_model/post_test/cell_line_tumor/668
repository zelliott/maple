We recently demonstrated that zzso zzso at low zzso pressure zzso had few if any short-term effects on zzso dissemination when an zzso cancer cell line was zzso just prior to zzso The objective of the present study was to evaluate the impact of surgical zzso environment on zzso tumor growth and dissemination over time when tumors were present before zzso 

On zzso zzso mice received an zzso zzso of a mouse zzso cancer cell line zzso On day 0, mice were zzso into four groups: zzso alone, zzso zzso at a low (2 zzso or high (8 zzso zzso or zzso Groups were further subdivided into four groups of eight animals each and a zzso was performed to evaluate dissemination on zzso day zzso 1, 2, 7 or zzso 

zzso dissemination score was significantly higher in the zzso group compared with in the remaining three groups on zzso 2 and zzso We detected no significant differences in the zzso dissemination scores among the zzso zzso and zzso groups on zzso 2 and zzso However, there were no significant differences in the zzso dissemination score among the three surgical groups on zzso zzso zzso examination demonstrated that the zzso of invasion of cancer cells into the muscle layers was significantly higher in the zzso group than in the zzso and zzso groups on zzso zzso There were no significant differences in tumor growth among the four zzso 

The present findings suggest that zzso zzso at either high or low zzso has few if any short-term effects on zzso dissemination when tumors are well established before zzso
