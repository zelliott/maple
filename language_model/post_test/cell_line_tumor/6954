To identify zzso zzso that could be effective in treating zzso we tested the zzso properties of zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso cell zzso First we examined the effects of these three agents on cell growth zzso and cell viability by the zzso and zzso B zzso Treatment of zzso cells with increasing zzso of these compounds led to a significant zzso of cell proliferation and decrease of cell viability in a zzso and zzso manner at zzso concentration zzso zzso Treatment with a combination of zzso and zzso resulted in synergistic effects on growth zzso cell cycle arrest and induction of zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso arrested the cells in the zzso phase and zzso blocked cell cycle progression at the zzso stage, in contrast to the combined effects of both agents that did not arrest growth at any particular phase of the cell zzso Further analysis of zzso induction demonstrated an increase from 17 to zzso of both early and late zzso cells and a very low percentage of zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso was the zzso type of cell death after treatment of zzso cells with both zzso as well as with their zzso
