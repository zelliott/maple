zzso expression of zzso zzso a zzso zzso is frequently associated with many transformed cell zzso Various studies suggest that zzso may contribute to tumor progression as well as zzso in multiple tumor zzso High levels of zzso have been reported in patients with zzso zzso including zzso We found that the expression of zzso corroborates with the aggressive zzso of the breast cancer cells zzso the expression of zzso is acquired as the breast cancer cells become more zzso To assess the zzso of zzso in breast zzso expression of zzso zzso was knocked down in zzso zzso human breast zzso cells using zzso zzso We targeted multiple regions of the zzso transcript for zzso zzso along with zzso and zzso zzso zzso controls to distinguish between zzso and potential zzso effects including zzso gene zzso zzso The zzso zzso by zzso suppressed tumor take in zzso zzso The zzso cells also showed significantly lower invasion and migration in modified zzso chamber zzso and reduced ability to grow in soft zzso Thus, in addition to the widely reported roles of zzso in late stages of tumor zzso these results provide functional evidence that zzso contributes to breast tumor growth as zzso
