zzso zzso are largely represented in nature and possess many biological activities such as zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso partially due to their interaction with the cell zzso The zzso of zzso zzso is a simple test to evaluate this zzso and this activity has been linked to the structure of the zzso and also depends on the sugar zzso of the zzso To further complete our study of the zzso relationships of zzso zzso zzso and related zzso zzso were zzso to better understand the influence of the second sugar zzso zzso or zzso and the substitution of this sugar on zzso zzso 2, 3 or zzso zzso and zzso activity on zzso cells were zzso These compounds probably interact with membrane cholesterol and produce zzso of the membrane inducing zzso zzso could involve the same zzso although some zzso induce an zzso zzso The nuclear structure of the zzso cell was thus investigated by zzso zzso The zzso activity of a second group of zzso zzso zzso was also zzso Our results showed that zzso was a result of both the sugar part and the structure of zzso zzso acid or zzso zzso
