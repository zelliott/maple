A mature zzso zzso zzso develops late in zzso and is maintained throughout the life of the zzso Although the mechanisms driving zzso gene expression have been well zzso those promoting the acquisition of zzso zzso zzso zzso and polarization have been less zzso The zzso zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso regulate zzso gene expression and zzso zzso zzso We report here that zzso expression zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso in human zzso 205 cancer zzso Within days of zzso or zzso zzso a new zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso This is a specific response to zzso zzso as a zzso zzso failed to elicit the zzso Additionally, zzso zzso 205 cells demonstrate a reduced zzso capacity and an increase in the zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso of these cells demonstrate induction of tight, zzso and zzso zzso as well as a zzso shape and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso determined that it was zzso dependent and could be blocked by an zzso zzso However, zzso protein levels and zzso distribution were zzso zzso expression restored the ability of the cell zzso to adhere and undergo zzso We conclude that zzso or zzso expression is sufficient to induce an zzso zzso of zzso 205 zzso This zzso is associated with polarization and zzso membrane zzso as well as induction of a differentiated zzso zzso zzso the mechanism for this novel zzso effect may yield insight into the development of mature zzso zzso
