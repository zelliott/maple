zzso has been shown to function as a tumor zzso zzso gene and reduce the number of zzso in different zzso The expression of zzso or zzso like other tumor zzso is commonly reduced or completely zzso in a variety of zzso via an unknown zzso Here we show that the loss of zzso expression in highly zzso breast cancer cell lines zzso directly with the expression levels of two zzso factors, zzso zzso zzso and specificity protein 1 zzso which zzso activate the zzso regulation of zzso in breast cancer zzso Although the zzso promoter contains multiple zzso binding zzso zzso regulation occurs indirectly through zzso sites, as determined by deletion and zzso zzso zzso of zzso into highly zzso breast cell lines did not alter zzso zzso zzso gene zzso However, zzso of zzso zzso or the dominant negative form of zzso lacking its zzso zzso domain, zzso together with zzso increased zzso promoter activity dramatically, suggesting that zzso regulation of zzso zzso does not require direct binding to the zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that zzso directly zzso with zzso to form zzso complexes at two tandem zzso sites of the promoter to activate zzso zzso Together, our results indicate that zzso and zzso are strong zzso regulators of zzso and that loss or decreased expression of zzso in breast cancer may account for the loss of tumor zzso zzso zzso expression and thus increased cancer zzso
