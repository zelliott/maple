To establish the DNA zzso patterns of the promoter zzso islands of 14 zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso specific zzso chain reaction in conjunction with sequencing zzso was used to establish the zzso patterns of the 14 genes in the liver zzso of four healthy liver donors, as well as tumor and the paired zzso zzso of 30 zzso zzso 

While 11 genes zzso zzso zzso G zzso member zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leukemia viral zzso zzso zzso zzso binding protein 1 zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 2 zzso zzso tumor protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso II beta zzso maintained the zzso patterns, three genes displayed to various zzso the zzso state in tumor zzso in comparison with the normal zzso The zzso zzso was zzso in tumor and the neighboring zzso tissue of one case zzso Both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in tumor and zzso zzso in the paired zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator, zzso cassette zzso C, member 7) zzso zzso zzso in tumor and zzso zzso in the paired zzso zzso genes were zzso zzso in zzso as well as their neighboring zzso zzso No significant difference in the zzso occurrence was observed between the zzso and its neighboring zzso zzso 

zzso of promoter zzso islands of both zzso and zzso genes occurs zzso in zzso which may correlate with the low expression of these two genes at the zzso level and has the profound zzso and clinical zzso It is likely to be specific to the early phase of zzso zzso
