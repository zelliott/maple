zzso zzso has cell growth zzso activity, and is the only currently known zzso zzso with unique zzso zzso The expression levels of zzso a zzso of zzso were positively correlated with the degree of zzso cancer zzso The present study aimed to investigate the effects of zzso and zzso gene zzso on the zzso cell cycle, and zzso of zzso cancer zzso The zzso zzso method was used to zzso the zzso cancer strains zzso and zzso zzso zzso chain reaction was used to detect target gene zzso zzso zzso reduction was applied to detect cell zzso and flow zzso was used for cell cycle and zzso zzso zzso cancer cells with zzso and zzso gene zzso showed high expression of the foreign target gene and zzso zzso with zzso gene zzso showed markedly inhibited proliferation zzso zzso zzso a significantly higher proportion of cells in the zzso phase zzso zzso zzso a significantly lower proportion of cells in the S phase zzso zzso zzso and a significantly increased zzso rate zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso gene zzso did not show significant changes in zzso cell cycle, or zzso rate zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso gene expression can inhibit zzso cancer cell proliferation and induce zzso which may be achieved by blocking the tumor cell growth cycle, whereas effects of the zzso gene on the proliferation of zzso cancer cells were not zzso
