Currently there is only a modest level knowledge of the zzso status of zzso cell lines that are commonly used in cancer biology as well as their binding affinities to different zzso zzso Through use of zzso and zzso zzso technology, this study has zzso to define the different zzso of cell surface zzso structures to zzso zzso The screening of breast cancer zzso cells, cervical cancer zzso cells and colon cancer zzso zzso and zzso cells was conducted to determine their differential zzso to a variety of zzso and zzso structures printed on the array zzso An inverse relationship between the number of zzso structures zzso and the variety of cell surface zzso was zzso Of the cell lines tested, it was found that four bound to zzso structures in initial zzso Secondary screening in the presence of a zzso inhibitor zzso significantly reduced zzso acid zzso The array technology has proven to be useful in determining the zzso signatures of various zzso as well as their zzso binding zzso The findings of this study provide the groundwork for further investigation into the numerous zzso interactions that are exhibited by zzso cell zzso
