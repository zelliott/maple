zzso zzso zzso block zzso zzso was zzso to construct a zzso zzso gene zzso potentially useful for selective zzso of zzso zzso zzso spontaneously formed a zzso complex zzso zzso with zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso solution without any zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso thus prepared achieved substantially higher zzso efficiency compared to the control zzso zzso without zzso zzso against zzso cells possessing zzso zzso receptors recognizing the zzso zzso This pronounced zzso efficacy of the zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by the addition of excess zzso zzso a natural zzso against the zzso zzso indicating zzso zzso zzso to be a major route of the cellular zzso of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso revealed enhanced zzso compared to the control zzso zzso at a lower dose of zzso demonstrating the feasibility of using the zzso zzso zzso zzso for gene delivery to targeted zzso
