zzso which zzso the zzso and plasma zzso is involved in the growth and zzso potential of cancer zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso was described recently, but its roles and the underlying zzso remain zzso In our study, we first showed that zzso in zzso cell is expressed in the nucleus as well as in the zzso and plasma zzso Then, by using zzso we revealed that interference of zzso expression suppressed the growth, zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that zzso may directly regulate tumor formation in zzso To explore the molecular mechanisms through which zzso contributes to the proliferation and zzso of zzso cells, we used zzso zzso to analyze zzso zzso cells and the control zzso of zzso genes zzso 297 were zzso expressed upon zzso zzso including some zzso and zzso genes such as zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso led to decreased zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso was dependent on the zzso of these zzso Finally, zzso zzso on 80 zzso specimens and 50 normal zzso zzso revealed that the expression levels of 3 altered genes involved in the regulation of cell proliferation and tumor zzso including zzso zzso and zzso were altered in zzso and their expression pattern correlated with zzso zzso Taken together, we propose that zzso might function in the growth and zzso of zzso cells through the zzso and zzso zzso
