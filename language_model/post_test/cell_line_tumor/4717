Many zzso zzso are zzso zzso and have intriguing expression zzso zzso and/or zzso expressions of some zzso are presumably controlled by unique zzso regulatory elements that zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso we identified several zzso whose primary transcripts could be regulated by zzso zzso elements zzso to their zzso start zzso Such zzso include zzso zzso which is reportedly controlled by a unique regulatory mechanism during zzso Here, we define a mechanism distinct from that previously proposed to regulate zzso zzso We find that the zzso gene resembles a zzso zzso and might be driven by the zzso zzso factors, zzso and zzso This mechanism is specified by the zzso zzso zzso element and might be common among different zzso zzso it needs to be considered that two distinct mechanisms that would play critical roles in zzso functions and differentiation are actually concerned with the regulation of zzso
