In order to investigate the zzso potential and related mechanisms of zzso (a novel zzso zzso zzso a series of experiments in zzso and in zzso were carried zzso The proliferation on human cell lines of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was examined by zzso zzso zzso was examined by chick zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso and tube formation zzso Related zzso proteins and their zzso expression were determined by western zzso and zzso In addition, the zzso nude mouse zzso model was used to evaluate the zzso of tumor zzso The results showed that zzso inhibited cell zzso zzso of zzso and tube formation, and zzso related positive zzso zzso The above indicated zzso could serve as a promising candidate of zzso zzso by interrupting the zzso zzso
