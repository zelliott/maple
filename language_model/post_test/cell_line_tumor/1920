To construct and express the zzso zzso a fusion protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso variable zzso of zzso zzso zzso against human zzso zzso and to enhance the targeted killing effect of zzso 

The expression of the fusion protein was induced in zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso affinity zzso was used to separate and purify the expressed zzso The specific binding activity of the zzso zzso protein was examined by indirect zzso zzso and the zzso was determined using zzso zzso 

The expressing zzso of fusion gene zzso was constructed zzso zzso protein retained a high binding affinity to zzso human zzso cancer cell zzso and had a stronger capability to activate zzso and kill the target cells compared to SEA alone, with a killing rate of zzso at 4 zzso 

zzso fusion protein could specifically target zzso cancer cell, enhance the activity of kill tumor cell and has potential applications in the targeted therapy of zzso zzso
