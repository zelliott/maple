zzso growth factor zzso is a zzso zzso factor originally isolated from zzso medium of the zzso cell line zzso zzso has greatest zzso in an zzso acid sequence with high mobility group 1 zzso which has been characterized as a zzso zzso and potent zzso outgrowth zzso zzso is reported to be widely expressed and act as a growth factor in many kinds of zzso However, it has not been investigated in the nervous zzso Here, we show by Western zzso analysis that zzso is present in the mouse brain from the embryonic period until zzso In zzso zzso and zzso analyses revealed that zzso was expressed mainly in zzso and zzso protein was localized to the zzso zzso and high mobility group 1 were zzso under zzso conditions and released zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, we showed that zzso supplied zzso had a zzso effect and was able to partially prevent the cell death of zzso in which zzso zzso was zzso zzso we propose that zzso is a novel type of zzso factor, on account of its zzso in the nucleus and its potential to function in an zzso manner under both zzso and pathological conditions throughout zzso
