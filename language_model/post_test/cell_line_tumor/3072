zzso zzso and zzso melanoma tumors were implanted zzso in the zzso region of the foot of zzso zzso progression was compared to standard zzso in the zzso Although foot tumors only reached zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the mean volume of flank tumors, a more zzso zzso in terms of zzso and survival rate was observed in this type of zzso Moreover, lung zzso were only detected in hosts bearing foot tumors, in contrast to zzso and zzso populations with tumors growing in the zzso In addition, cellular influx and local immune reaction were higher in the zzso region of the zzso According to our results, the zzso of the flank allows excessive tumor growth due to its low zzso Thus, differences in innate and zzso immune zzso between the evaluated tumor zzso would account for the differences in tumor zzso Due to its striking differences with the standard flank zzso the tumor zzso model zzso introduced could be a valuable tool to study the zzso potential of different cell lines and the zzso components affecting tumor zzso
