The elimination of tumor cells by zzso is the main mechanism of action of zzso drugs used in current treatment protocols of acute zzso leukemia zzso Despite the rapid zzso zzso serious acute and late complications are zzso and resistance to chemotherapy zzso During the past decade, new strategies to kill cancer cells by zzso mechanisms have flourished and many zzso of alternate cell death pathways have been zzso In the present study we have evaluated the efficacy of an zzso zzso zzso zzso to induce zzso in an in zzso model of childhood zzso In particular we found that zzso increased zzso 1 zzso the conversion of the soluble form of zzso protein 1 light chain 3 zzso to the zzso zzso form zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso degradation of zzso areas zzso by zzso structures was demonstrated by electron zzso This effect was associated with massive reduction of zzso mass and a strong survival advantage for mice treated with zzso The discovery of alternative pathways involved in cell death execution and the role that it plays in leukemia suggest zzso zzso should be included in future chemotherapy protocols of zzso
