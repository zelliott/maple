zzso zzso is the most common bone tumor affecting the zzso The veterinary options for therapeutic management of zzso are limited and prognosis for such patients is zzso zzso zzso are attractive tools for experimental zzso as they can replicate and spread within tumors to directly induce tumor zzso However, a major impediment to systemic zzso zzso injection is the presence of pre-existing zzso zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of a zzso canine zzso zzso to treat zzso in the presence of zzso and the use of canine zzso cells as carrier vehicles for evading zzso Our systemic zzso data indicated that canine tumor cells could successfully reach the tumor site and deliver zzso to tumor cells in an zzso mice zzso Furthermore, the use of carrier cells also reduced zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso alone was not effective to control tumor growth in a zzso zzso mouse zzso On the contrary, systemic zzso activity of zzso zzso was evident even in the presence of circulating zzso which is a relevant result from a clinical point of zzso These findings are of direct zzso relevance for the future design of canine clinical zzso
