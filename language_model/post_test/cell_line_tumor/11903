zzso expressed genes between normal liver and zzso zzso were investigated using differential zzso In previous study, human zzso was identified as a zzso expressed zzso zzso in zzso zzso In this study, we developed an in zzso cloning approach to rapidly and accurately characterize the mouse zzso of the human zzso Mouse zzso encodes a 239 zzso protein exhibiting zzso similarity to the human zzso zzso zzso analysis was carried out in various species and showed that zzso was zzso zzso from zzso to zzso Based on the alignment results, zzso tree was established zzso
