The zzso zzso gene is amplified in zzso of human zzso zzso We assessed the functional significance of zzso amplification by zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso in a panel of zzso cancer cell lines expressing varying levels of zzso zzso of zzso inhibited cell proliferation and induced zzso zzso only in lines with amplified zzso indicating that these cells are addicted to continued zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso of all three zzso zzso inhibited proliferation of zzso zzso zzso cancer cells without inducing zzso zzso and did not inhibit the proliferation of zzso zzso surface zzso zzso The arrest induced by zzso zzso was accompanied by an increase in the level of the zzso inhibitor zzso and a decrease in zzso A expression and zzso activity, and could be reversed by zzso zzso of zzso or zzso or by zzso of zzso zzso The arrest induced by zzso of all three zzso zzso could similarly be reversed by zzso zzso Our findings indicate that the addiction of zzso zzso cancer cells to zzso differs from the dependence of zzso zzso cancer cells on zzso zzso but both are zzso at least in part, by zzso They also suggest that growth of zzso zzso may be blocked by zzso of zzso or zzso zzso
