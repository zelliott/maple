Gene targeting provides a powerful means for analyzing gene function, as exemplified by knockout mouse studies and recent work with the highly zzso chicken zzso zzso zzso In human cultured cells, however, the low frequency of gene targeting is a serious barrier to efficiently generate knockout zzso Moreover, commonly used human cell lines are zzso abnormal or zzso Here, we show using zzso targeting zzso that zzso a human zzso ALL cell line, is highly zzso for gene targeting by zzso zzso Indeed, the efficiency of zzso gene targeting in zzso appears nearly two orders of magnitude higher than that in zzso a colon cancer cell line popularly used for gene zzso zzso analysis revealed a lack of zzso expression in this cell zzso As zzso has a stable zzso zzso with normal zzso status, our results underscore the usefulness of zzso for gene knockout studies in zzso
