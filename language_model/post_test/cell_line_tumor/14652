The main problem in the treatment of zzso zzso is their invasive zzso zzso zzso of the main zzso mass cannot prevent recurrence due to single cells invading the surrounding brain zzso at the time of zzso The classical combination therapy, zzso zzso zzso and zzso used for over 30 years; has shown its clinical effectiveness in the treatment of zzso zzso and zzso is still zzso Using an in zzso three zzso invasion model, we tested the effect of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso on the invasion activity of a panel of zzso zzso cell lines, including two established zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso and two primary cell lines, originating from zzso zzso and zzso and in normal zzso A dose response curve for each drug alone and in combination was zzso The half zzso zzso concentration zzso concentration of zzso was between zzso and zzso zzso which did not affect invasion activity of the cell zzso The zzso concentration of zzso was between zzso and zzso zzso and at zzso zzso zzso had a slight transient zzso effect on invasion activity of all tested zzso The combination of zzso at zzso zzso and zzso at zzso zzso however, zzso inhibited cell growth and invasion activity and could not be reversed by drug zzso A combination treatment with zzso zzso zzso and zzso drugs shows promise in tackling both zzso proliferation and invasion, and could present a new treatment regimen for zzso zzso
