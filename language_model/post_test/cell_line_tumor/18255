The aim of this study is to evaluate cellular interaction between zzso zzso zzso zzso strains and zzso target cells in zzso Two Thai strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso strain from the environment and zzso strain from the patient's zzso fluid and the Center of Disease Control zzso zzso strain from Atlanta zzso were zzso Human zzso zzso and African Green monkey zzso zzso cells were used as target zzso Each cell line was zzso with each strain of zzso zzso at a ratio of zzso and observed for 7 zzso The zzso target cells and each strain of zzso zzso were used as zzso The numbers of the challenged and unchallenged cells as well as the zzso zzso were counted three times by zzso blue exclusion zzso The zzso began when the zzso attached to the cell membrane and zzso the target zzso In this study, extensive zzso with many floating zzso cells and abundant number of zzso were zzso The destruction pattern of both zzso zzso and zzso target cells were zzso Interestingly, zzso was more susceptible to zzso zzso strains than the zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso strain showed the highest destruction pattern for each target zzso Our findings suggest that the zzso should be used as a base model for studying the zzso in primary zzso zzso zzso
