This unit describes experimental procedures for development of therapeutic vaccines, particularly zzso zzso zzso Specifically, a general procedure for handling and zzso zzso cell lines in zzso and their subsequent challenge into zzso mice is zzso Several protocols describe the production of various zzso zzso or cellular zzso vaccine zzso In particular, the novel approach of rendering zzso zzso zzso or Id zzso by fusing it with a zzso zzso is zzso As an alternative, a protocol for expression and zzso of these zzso proteins from zzso coli is zzso A general procedure is included for cloning of zzso zzso for example, zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Support protocols are presented for chemically zzso intact zzso protein with zzso to produce a zzso protein vaccine and using the zzso Gene Gun System to zzso mice with zzso DNA tumor zzso
