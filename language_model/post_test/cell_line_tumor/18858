zzso differentiation and partial zzso of zzso trigger cell death in a zzso cell line zzso Neither induction of differentiation nor partial zzso of zzso alone affects the viability of zzso zzso We wanted to identify genes whose expression alters under zzso conditions and may account for cell zzso 

We used gel zzso to analyze total zzso DNA for the detection of DNA zzso zzso zzso Genome zzso version 2 zzso was used to screen for approximately 6,000 functionally characterized genes and approximately 6,000 expressed sequence tags zzso Real time zzso zzso was performed to provide an accurate assessment of changes in gene zzso 

zzso differentiation and partial zzso of zzso trigger zzso characterized by zzso DNA fragmentation in zzso zzso We found that the expression of 41 genes changed zzso or more primarily under zzso conditions midway through zzso Based on real time zzso the expression of zzso zzso 96, a zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso cell activated protein C zzso zzso increased between zzso whereas the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso decreased ranging from 8 to 37 zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso was detected as early as zzso h post simultaneous zzso 

We identified new genes that might be involved in zzso events in zzso zzso
