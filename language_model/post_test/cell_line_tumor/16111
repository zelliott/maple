The zzso zzso zzso and 2 zzso proteins play an important role in cancer cell proliferation and zzso zzso proteins also are important for normal cell zzso Thus, zzso therapies that block all zzso signaling may result in zzso toxicity to normal zzso As an alternative, we have used zzso and biological approaches to identify zzso weight compounds that have the potential to interact with unique zzso zzso sites and selectively inhibit interactions with zzso involved in promoting cell zzso 

Colony formation and water soluble zzso salt zzso zzso were used to determine the effects of test compounds on cell zzso Changes in zzso and protein expression in response to test compound treatment were examined by zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined with zzso and zzso activity zzso 

In zzso modeling was used to identify compounds that were structurally similar to a previously identified parent compound, called zzso From this screen, several compounds, termed zzso zzso and zzso sharing a common zzso core with an zzso side group, inhibited proliferation and induced zzso of zzso zzso However, the active compounds were less effective in zzso proliferation or inducing zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso appeared to be through intrinsic mechanisms involving zzso zzso and decreased zzso of the zzso Bad zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso indicated that compounds zzso and zzso directly inhibited zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso which zzso and zzso zzso more effectively than the parent compound zzso Further examination of the test zzso mechanism of action showed little effects on related zzso zzso or other cell survival zzso 

These findings support the identification of a class of zzso molecules that can induce zzso in transformed cells by zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso
