zzso zzso potentially could be used to enhance cell killing by zzso therapeutic zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso S and zzso checkpoint arrest in the cells of various zzso cell lines and has been investigated in combination with zzso However, little is known about its potential use in combination with zzso We report the effect of 20 zzso radiation given in conjunction with zzso on the zzso and growth of subcutaneous zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used for zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso The effect of zzso and/or 20 zzso on tumor zzso and tumor volume was investigated to determine therapeutic zzso zzso zzso tumors were hypoxic with a tissue zzso of zzso zzso Treatment with 20 zzso or zzso significantly reduced tumor growth, and a modest increase in tumor zzso was observed in tumors treated with 20 zzso However, zzso with 20 zzso 12 h after zzso treatment resulted in a significant zzso of tumor growth and a significant increase in tumor zzso to zzso zzso from day 1 zzso compared to the control, zzso or zzso zzso Treatment with zzso 12 h after 20 zzso also led to a similar growth zzso of the tumors and a similar increase in tumor zzso The changes in tumor zzso observed after the treatment correlated zzso with the tumor volume in the groups receiving zzso with 20 zzso This zzso approach could be used to enhance the outcome of zzso Furthermore, tumor zzso could be a potential marker of therapeutic zzso
