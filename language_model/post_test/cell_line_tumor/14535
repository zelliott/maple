The zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso is an emerging target for imaging and therapeutic applications for prostate zzso However, the use of zzso for detecting circulating prostate tumor cells remains zzso The present study focuses on the specific labeling of zzso prostate cancer cells with a fluorescent zzso inhibitor and the zzso of zzso cells in blood by flow zzso zzso using a gating strategy to separate labeled zzso cells from peripheral blood zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells were incubated with the fluorescent zzso inhibitor zzso zzso parameters zzso temperature, and label zzso were varied to zzso cell zzso A gating protocol based on double fluorescent labeling of zzso and zzso was developed for the zzso of zzso cells in the presence of white blood cells from bovine zzso zzso beads were added to the labeled cell mixture and served as internal standard for precise cellular zzso of zzso cells by flow zzso 

The fluorescent zzso inhibitor zzso was specific for zzso zzso The minimum time and concentration of zzso for effective labeling of zzso cell suspensions at zzso was zzso and zzso zzso no labeling was observed on zzso zzso zzso or zzso of zzso cells with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso resulted in a zzso reduction in fluorescent labeling with zzso thereby confirming that the labeling was specific for zzso In blood samples in which zzso cells were added, an average of five cells were detected in a zzso sample of the most dilute sample examined zzso three cells were expected zzso The greater loss of labeling of zzso cells with zzso when zzso with zzso is consistent with the irreversible mode of binding of zzso to zzso and subsequent zzso of the zzso zzso 

The results suggest that fluorescent zzso zzso can be zzso to effectively detect and zzso zzso cells by zzso These results support the use of such compounds in the application of zzso to zzso zzso and characterize circulating prostate tumor zzso
