We measured individual zzso of zzso labeled zzso in the nucleus of zzso cells in the time range of zzso by combining a few acquisition zzso At short times the motion is zzso with zzso approximately zzso and it changes to normal diffusion at longer zzso The short times diffusion may be explained by the zzso model and the transient diffusion is consistent with a model of zzso that are subject to a local binding mechanism with a wide but finite distribution of waiting zzso These findings have important biological implications with respect to the zzso organization in the zzso
