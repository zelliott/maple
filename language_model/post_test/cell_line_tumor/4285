zzso the zzso zzso network that zzso the immune response holds great potential for cancer zzso Although encouraging results have been obtained by focusing on individual members of the common zzso zzso zzso family and zzso zzso zzso so far, combination strategies might be required to further improve the effectiveness of the zzso zzso Here, we propose the combination of zzso zzso and zzso in a single, zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso fusion protein was generated, composed of a zzso zzso zzso zzso linked to a zzso of the zzso chain zzso and the zzso domain of zzso In soluble and targeted forms, the zzso zzso fusion protein zzso was shown to stimulate activated zzso proliferation and induce zzso zzso to a similar degree as the zzso zzso fusion zzso On the other hand, in targeted form, the zzso fusion protein was much more effective in inducing zzso proliferation and zzso release of zzso peripheral blood zzso cells zzso Here, the additional signal enhancement could be attributed to the zzso activity of zzso indicating a clear benefit for the simultaneous presentation of zzso and zzso in one zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso fusion protein was more effective than the corresponding zzso fusion proteins in reducing zzso in a tumor mouse model in zzso zzso the targeted combination of zzso and zzso in the form of a zzso zzso protein is a promising new approach for cancer zzso
