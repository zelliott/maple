zzso zzso zzso zzso represent a promising new class of zzso zzso In the current investigation, we examined the activity of the zzso zzso in zzso models of prostate zzso In zzso proliferation zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso inhibited the growth of prostate cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso and was zzso to these zzso zzso experiments indicated that exposure to zzso for relatively short periods of time zzso zzso induced zzso zzso and that cells exposed to zzso zzso zzso for 48 zzso retained the capacity for regrowth following drug withdrawal, while cells exposed to zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso Cell cycle analyses demonstrated that zzso induced zzso arrest and increased the percentage of cells with zzso DNA content, thus confirming the zzso and zzso effects of this zzso zzso prostate zzso cells were generally less susceptible to the effects of zzso than were prostate cancer zzso In an zzso prostate cancer tumor model, zzso inhibited tumor growth by up to zzso Moreover, zzso lung zzso were present in zzso of zzso animals but in none of the animals administered zzso zzso with its observed zzso activity, zzso inhibited the migration of prostate tumor cells and increased the production of tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso by these cells, the latter effect being zzso by zzso zzso of zzso zzso also increased the expression of zzso and decreased the expression of potentially zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso These results support the clinical evaluation of zzso for the treatment of prostate zzso
