We had previously reported that zzso zzso of zzso containing the zzso C are virtually absent in normal adult zzso but are highly abundant in high-grade zzso with a prominent zzso pattern of zzso We now report that the zzso C of zzso is strongly expressed in the majority of lung zzso with a vascular and zzso pattern of zzso Using zzso zzso technology, we have generated a human zzso zzso zzso with a zzso constant zzso zzso zzso zzso for the human domain zzso The zzso zzso expressed in zzso and in zzso zzso format, as well as a zzso fusion zzso was then characterized in quantitative zzso studies using mice grafted zzso with zzso zzso revealing a selective tumor zzso with zzso ratios up to zzso at 24 zzso A zzso preparation of zzso was also investigated in a double zzso study using an zzso rat zzso model, confirming the zzso ability to zzso zzso at the tumor site, with zzso ratios superior to the ones observed with zzso These zzso properties, together with the strong zzso zzso of human tumor zzso indicate that the zzso zzso may be used as a portable targeting zzso for the selective delivery of imaging and therapeutic agents to zzso and lung zzso
