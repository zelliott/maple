Recently, the zzso repeat G zzso zzso 5 zzso was identified as a potential marker of zzso stem cells in zzso The zzso is known as a zzso signaling target zzso and its expression pattern is related with zzso zzso zzso is a member of zzso oxygen species zzso and regulates zzso aging, zzso and the intensity of growth factor zzso In addition, it acts as a negative or positive regulator of zzso zzso However, the effect of zzso on zzso signaling and its target gene zzso is not zzso In this study, we investigated the effects of zzso on cancer stem cells, in zzso cancer zzso zzso cancer cells were treated with zzso zzso after which cellular responses and the expression of zzso were zzso In zzso cells, proliferation increased following treatment with zzso of zzso whereas cell viability significantly decreased after treatment with zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso which aid in the reduction of zzso stress, were induced in the low dose zzso zzso zzso The zzso expression level was significantly increased following zzso zzso zzso in addition, zzso was increased in zzso colon cancer zzso However, the increased zzso was detected not in the nucleus but in the zzso which means that zzso was stabilized in the zzso and not zzso into the nucleus where it could function as a zzso factor for the expression of zzso In addition, there was no direct interaction between zzso and zzso In this study, we found that zzso expression increased when cancer cells were treated with a low dose of zzso Our results indicate that the zzso increase resulted via zzso of the zzso signaling zzso The induction of zzso expression influenced cell proliferation in zzso cancer zzso
