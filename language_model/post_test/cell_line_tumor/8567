In this study, we evaluated a zzso display system for analysis of viral entry by using a zzso zzso zzso carrying a zzso gene and zzso zzso zzso that displays the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso were infected with zzso Ad zzso in the presence of zzso that expressed or lacked zzso zzso and zzso zzso Treatment with zzso even at doses as high as zzso failed to zzso the zzso activity of zzso zzso In contrast, treatment with zzso with doses as low as zzso significantly decreased the zzso activity of infected cells, which reached zzso reduction at zzso These findings suggest that a zzso zzso system could be used to evaluate viral zzso
