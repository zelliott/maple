zzso of zzso zzso gene expression is critical to the establishment and maintenance of zzso following infection by members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Previous studies of zzso zzso 68 zzso have demonstrated that loss of zzso function results in a complete failure to establish virus zzso in the zzso of laboratory zzso Here we report the characterization of alternatively spliced zzso and zzso zzso transcripts zzso by zzso Similar to other zzso alternative zzso coupled with alternative 3' processing, of a zzso zzso zzso unit can lead to expression of either zzso or zzso during zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso transcripts were initially identified from an analysis of the zzso zzso infected zzso zzso cell line zzso but were also detected during zzso infection of zzso zzso zzso zzso Random amplification of zzso ends zzso analyses identified two distinct zzso zzso and zzso that drive expression of spliced zzso zzso Analysis of zzso and zzso using zzso zzso reporter zzso mapped the minimal sequences required for promoter activity and demonstrated that both promoters are active in the absence of any viral zzso Analysis of spliced zzso and zzso transcripts in zzso recovered from zzso infected mice at days 16 and 42 zzso revealed that spliced zzso transcripts can only be detected zzso suggesting that these may be associated with cells zzso from zzso In contrast, spliced zzso transcripts were detected in zzso 1 in 4,000 zzso harvested at day 16 zzso zzso based on the frequency of viral zzso zzso at day 16 zzso zzso 1 in zzso only 5 to zzso of viral zzso zzso express zzso The failure of the majority of infected zzso at day 16 zzso to express zzso may contribute to the contraction in the frequency of zzso infected zzso as chronic infection is established, due to failure to maintain the viral zzso in zzso B zzso
