zzso DNA damage response pathways may create vulnerabilities of cancer cells that can be exploited zzso One such selective vulnerability is the sensitivity of zzso or zzso tumors zzso defective in DNA repair by zzso zzso zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso an zzso critical for repair pathways alternative to zzso While promising, treatment with zzso zzso zzso faces some hurdles, including zzso acquired resistance, zzso search for other zzso zzso cancer defects and zzso lack of zzso to predict response to zzso Here we addressed these issues using zzso on 20 human cell lines from zzso of the breast, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso complex zzso cancer cells to zzso while zzso status was less zzso even in response to zzso combinations with zzso or zzso zzso Furthermore, monitoring zzso and zzso zzso formation as surrogate markers for zzso activity and HR, respectively, supported their candidacy for zzso of zzso zzso As to resistance mechanisms, we confirmed the role of the zzso resistance zzso zzso and its zzso More importantly, we demonstrated that zzso zzso depletion of zzso in human zzso breast cancer cells increased their resistance to zzso Given the preferential loss of zzso in zzso and zzso breast zzso our findings warrant assessment of zzso among candidate zzso zzso of response to zzso Overall, this study helps characterize genetic and functional zzso of cellular responses to zzso and contributes to the search for zzso to exploit zzso zzso in cancer zzso
