This paper focuses on the zzso characterization and biological activity of new zzso modified zzso zzso zzso zzso and their zzso zzso Both the zzso and complexes were characterized by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The possible correlation between the reduction zzso and the zzso of the complexes was zzso The potential zzso activity of all compounds was tested in zzso on human melanoma zzso human zzso zzso human prostate cancer zzso human colon cancer zzso mouse melanoma zzso and mouse colon cancer zzso cells, as well as primary zzso and zzso The results obtained revealed strong zzso potential of the newly zzso drugs with preserved efficacy against zzso resistant lines and less toxicity towards zzso zzso The mechanism found to be responsible for the observed zzso action of each zzso compound was induction of zzso generally accompanied with zzso zzso Taken together, the effective response to the treatment of a wide range of different cell lines, including zzso resistant zzso as well as induction of zzso as the mechanism suggested to be the most desirable way of eliminating zzso cells, represents a great advantage of this novel group of drugs in comparison to other members in this zzso zzso
