Ethanol has deleterious effects on zzso cells both in zzso and in zzso but the mechanisms are zzso Here, treatment with increasing doses of ethanol (from 20 up to zzso decreased the viability of a mouse zzso zzso cell line, zzso The zzso concentration decreased and zzso zzso oxygen species zzso increased in a zzso zzso manner, suggesting that the zzso was due to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso regulator and heat shock zzso increased with time after ethanol treatment, but zzso was expressed zzso The addition of zzso zinc zzso IX zzso zzso a competitive HO zzso with the ethanol further reduced cell viability and increased zzso zzso but these effects were reversed by zzso with zzso zzso a well-known zzso and a product of HO zzso These results suggest that HO has a protective role in zzso zzso as an intrinsic factor against zzso zzso stress and the protection depends on the degree of zzso zzso
