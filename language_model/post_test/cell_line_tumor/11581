zzso of zzso zzso zzso in human tumors often zzso with zzso and zzso We found that zzso is zzso in the majority of clinical breast cancer samples and in zzso of the examined breast cancer zzso zzso is activated by zzso zzso and other zzso including the widely used drug zzso zzso is frequently used to show a zzso role of zzso although this bacterial component is unlikely to be found in the breast cancer zzso We reasoned that zzso zzso of zzso is more relevant to breast cancer zzso that could be zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso leading to zzso of zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, we correlated zzso expression with resistance to zzso in two modified breast cancer lines with either depleted or zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in naturally zzso zzso cells zzso zzso genes zzso with zzso to zzso reduced zzso to zzso in zzso and a zzso decrease in recurrence rate in zzso zzso zzso zzso in a negative cell line zzso significantly increased expression of inflammatory and zzso genes along with a zzso increase of zzso to zzso in zzso and enhanced tumor resistance to zzso therapy in zzso zzso both tumor models showed that many zzso inflammatory zzso were zzso with their receptors suggesting that this therapy zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso these results show that zzso not only kills tumor cells but also enhances their survival by zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that blocking zzso could significantly improve response to zzso zzso
