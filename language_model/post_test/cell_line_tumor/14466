zzso zzso zzso zzso are emerging new class of zzso agents that act by zzso cell growth, inducing cell cycle arrest and zzso of various cancer zzso However, in some conditions, zzso can be blocked and non zzso cell death and irreversible growth arrest, namely zzso can be activated as potential zzso zzso Here we evaluated the dosage effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso in a series of human zzso cell zzso We investigated, what concentration of zzso and zzso can zzso induce zzso growth zzso or zzso premature zzso We have found that zzso inhibited proliferation and induced zzso in concentration zzso lower than zzso The zzso zzso was zzso induced by lower dosage of zzso and required longer incubation time (5 zzso while zzso was induced by higher dosage and appeared already after zzso The optimal doses for the induction of cell death are zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso These doses of zzso induce both zzso and zzso of studied leukemia cell zzso
