zzso III zzso belongs to the zzso family and is highly expressed in zzso and neural zzso The human zzso promoter has not yet been zzso We identified that a zzso DNA zzso upstream of the zzso gene can selectively drive zzso expression in zzso cell zzso The strength of zzso expression was further increased, with specificity zzso by addition of the human zzso complex zzso 1 zzso zzso We developed an zzso zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso promoter and zzso zzso drive zzso gene zzso The virus was further modified with a zzso zzso zzso in the viral zzso which we have previously shown results in increased zzso zzso efficiency of many zzso cell zzso The virus, zzso shows selective and efficient killing of zzso cell lines in zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, it delays tumor growth and thereby prolonged survival for nude mice harboring subcutaneous human zzso zzso In conclusion, we report a novel zzso zzso with potential use for zzso zzso
