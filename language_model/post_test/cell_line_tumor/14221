The zzso zzso zzso was identified as an independent predictor of poor prognosis in primary zzso The aim of the study was to investigate the role of zzso in human melanoma zzso 

zzso expression was evaluated in melanoma zzso and in zzso cell lines through zzso zzso zzso and reverse zzso The function of zzso was tested in the presence of the zzso zzso through induction of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and migration zzso 

zzso expression was detected in 33 out of 63 zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso melanoma cell lines expressed cell surface zzso zzso 43, zzso 40, and zzso cell lines showed the highest levels of zzso zzso of positive zzso zzso 41, zzso 39, zzso 47, zzso and zzso cell lines showed low to moderate degrees of expression zzso of positive zzso Other zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected on the melanoma cell zzso zzso activated zzso and zzso the whose induction was specifically inhibited by zzso zzso zzso increased the growth in zzso 41, zzso 43, and zzso 47 cells under zzso zzso zzso and zzso culture zzso zzso (1 zzso inhibited the spontaneous and zzso zzso No rescue from zzso was shown but zzso 41, zzso 43, and zzso 47 cells migrate toward zzso 

These findings indicate that zzso is expressed and active in human melanoma zzso suggesting that active zzso such as zzso may be experienced in human zzso
