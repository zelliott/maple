zzso zzso zzso systems zzso the high efficiency of zzso zzso to direct the in zzso production of zzso zzso In this study, we show that a zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso hybrid zzso zzso effectively turns these cells into zzso zzso cells, which in turn zzso the zzso of adjacent zzso 

We have adapted the zzso hybrid viral zzso system to enhance the zzso zzso killing of zzso cells following transfer of the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso To assess the effect of the in zzso production of zzso zzso on the zzso efficiency of zzso cells, zzso cells were zzso with zzso hybrid zzso that separately express a zzso zzso zzso or zzso and zzso packaging proteins zzso and zzso The generation of an integrated zzso zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso was verified by analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso established on zzso mice were injected with the viruses followed by zzso injections of either PBS or zzso We also estimated the copy numbers of the zzso zzso present in the tumors of the treated zzso To determine the expression pattern of the zzso transcripts within a zzso in zzso zzso analysis was performed using an zzso probe specific for zzso 

The zzso of rat zzso zzso cells with zzso together with zzso expressing packaging proteins of zzso increased the zzso zzso zzso with zzso together with packaging zzso increased the in zzso sensitivity of cells to the zzso zzso by one log compared with control cells that were incapable of generating zzso In zzso the injection of established subcutaneous zzso tumors on zzso mice with a combination of zzso and packaging zzso followed by zzso treatment resulted in complete tumor zzso in 50% of tumors at day 22, while no tumor zzso was observed in control zzso zzso sequences diagnostic of 3' zzso zzso in zzso were detected in zzso DNA extracted from the zzso tumors, indicating zzso integration of the zzso zzso derived from the zzso hybrid zzso Furthermore, the relative copy number of the zzso gene in tumors treated with the zzso zzso was up to approximately zzso higher than in control zzso In zzso zzso suggested zzso of the zzso product across a wider area of the tumor than in control tumors, which indicates the spread of the in zzso generated zzso 

Although the efficacy of this system has to be evaluated in zzso models, our observations suggest that this hybrid zzso zzso system could improve the suicide gene therapy of zzso
