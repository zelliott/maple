A major challenge in the development of specific and effective cancer treatments is the paradoxical situation that exploiting a molecular target that is accessible zzso membrane or zzso zzso is critical for achieving tumor selectivity whereas delivery of the therapeutic inside the cell, to the cell nucleus is generally required for maximizing the therapeutic zzso zzso zzso emitting zzso and foreign genetic material could be considered as such zzso if they possessed cellular and zzso zzso The author describes a novel approach of using modular zzso zzso to target the zzso to the nucleus of cancer cells, where their action is most pronounced or can only be zzso zzso zzso displayed up to zzso times greater efficacy than free zzso and acquired cell specificity in contrast to free zzso zzso zzso zzso with the modular zzso acquired similar zzso DNA zzso with analogous zzso efficiently zzso target zzso The different zzso of the zzso are zzso meaning that they can be tailored for particular zzso
