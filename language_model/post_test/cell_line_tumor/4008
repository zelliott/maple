The clinical application of zzso acid, a natural component with promising zzso activity, is limited due to its extremely poor zzso zzso short zzso in blood, and severe systemic zzso To solve these problems, an zzso zzso zzso was prepared by attachment of low molecular weight zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso acid zzso through an zzso linkage and characterized by zzso nuclear magnetic zzso The zzso zzso zzso to form zzso zzso with mean diameters of less than 50 zzso and a very narrow particle size zzso The properties of the zzso zzso including zzso stability, molecular zzso and drug release profile, were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tests demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso had obvious zzso to tumor cells and human zzso vein zzso zzso Further, zzso zzso were effective in zzso tumor growth and prolonged survival in subcutaneous zzso and zzso tumor zzso Our findings suggest that zzso zzso may have promising applications in tumor zzso
