The number of new cervical zzso zzso cases has risen slowly, however, its zzso similarity to other tumor types and the difficulty of identifying the site of the original tumor makes the diagnosis of cervical zzso particularly zzso We investigated a novel molecular zzso for cervical zzso through the integration of multiple methods of zzso zzso zzso samples in discovery set were obtained from 87 patients who underwent zzso including 31 cervical zzso zzso analysis and quantitative zzso chain reaction analysis were performed to screen a candidate diagnostic zzso for cervical zzso and its clinical significance was investigated by zzso analysis zzso We found a difference between biopsy samples of zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso in the expression and zzso copy number of zzso zzso which maps to zzso zzso revealed 14 zzso zzso 13 cervical zzso and one small cell zzso of zzso while none of SCC or zzso zzso was zzso zzso survival zzso revealed worse zzso survival in zzso zzso The marker was validated by newly enrolled 65 patients, and zzso positive zzso showed zzso of sensitivity and zzso of selectivity for cervical zzso In conclusion, we have identified zzso as a novel zzso of cervical zzso zzso a major structural component of the brush border zzso which was recently found to be an zzso zzso zzso zzso Our study suggests the existence of a zzso of cervical tumors which are zzso positive with poor zzso
