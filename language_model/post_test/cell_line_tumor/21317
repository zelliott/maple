zzso development involves complex zzso interactions between tumor cells and host zzso zzso zzso zzso has been identified as a highly zzso zzso zzso which is specifically expressed by tumor zzso zzso and zzso zzso of a wide range of human zzso Recent experiments in zzso mice have unraveled a critical role of zzso in zzso tumor progression and zzso To zzso understand the mechanisms of zzso function, we aimed to identify zzso zzso zzso and identified zzso zzso as a specific interaction zzso zzso zzso analyses identified a zzso zzso of zzso zzso which was shown to contain binding sites for zzso and zzso as the structures responsible for zzso zzso zzso expression analysis of zzso zzso in zzso revealed weak or no expression in most normal zzso and strong zzso in tumor cells of human zzso zzso zzso the expression patterns of zzso zzso and zzso were mutually exclusive in all human zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments of zzso zzso tumor cells on zzso zzso revealed a repulsive outcome of the zzso zzso zzso Taken together, the experiments identify a novel repulsive interaction between zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso on tumor zzso
