The effects of zzso a natural zzso compound, on the zzso and zzso of tamoxifen and its zzso zzso were investigated in zzso zzso and zzso interact with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the increase in the use of health supplements may result in zzso being taken zzso with tamoxifen as a combination therapy to treat or prevent zzso A single dose of tamoxifen was administered orally (9 zzso zzso zzso with or without zzso zzso zzso and 10 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with or without zzso zzso and 10 zzso zzso zzso to zzso The effects of zzso on zzso zzso and zzso activity were also zzso zzso inhibited zzso activity with 50% zzso concentration zzso values of zzso zzso In addition, zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso at 10 zzso enhanced the cellular zzso of zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso in a zzso zzso This result suggested that zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso Compared to the oral control group zzso tamoxifen zzso the area under the plasma zzso curve zzso and the peak plasma concentration zzso of tamoxifen were significantly zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso for 10 zzso zzso zzso increased by zzso and zzso respectively, by zzso zzso the absolute zzso of tamoxifen in the presence of zzso zzso and 10 zzso zzso zzso was zzso which was significantly enhanced zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso for 10 zzso zzso zzso compared to that in the oral control group zzso Moreover, the relative zzso of tamoxifen was zzso to zzso greater than that in the control zzso Furthermore, concurrent use of zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso for 10 zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso that zzso may inhibit the zzso metabolism of tamoxifen to its active zzso zzso The enhanced zzso of tamoxifen by zzso may be mainly due to zzso of the zzso metabolism of tamoxifen in the small zzso and/or in the liver and to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in the small zzso rather than to reduction of zzso elimination of zzso suggesting that zzso may reduce the zzso metabolism of tamoxifen in the small zzso and/or in the liver by zzso of zzso or zzso zzso
