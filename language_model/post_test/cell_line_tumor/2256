Loss of zzso type II zzso zzso zzso by zzso expression in the prostate zzso contributes to prostate cancer zzso zzso and zzso We evaluated whether zzso loss also affected prostate cancer bone zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso expression was lost in zzso zzso in human prostate cancer bone zzso zzso We zzso the human situation with a conditional zzso zzso knockout zzso mouse zzso zzso media from primary cultured zzso or control zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso were applied to zzso prostate cancer cells before zzso the cells zzso We found that zzso promoted prostate cancer cell growth in the bone and development of early mixed zzso bone zzso Furthermore, the zzso promoted greater zzso zzso to zzso zzso the major component of bone zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso array analysis revealed that zzso had more than zzso zzso in zzso zzso factor and zzso zzso and zzso expression relative to zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso of zzso or zzso were able to reduce zzso zzso zzso collagen zzso to that comparable with zzso zzso zzso our data indicate that loss of zzso responsiveness in zzso zzso results in zzso of zzso and zzso and that these zzso signals increase prostate cancer cell zzso in the bone zzso These zzso changes at the primary tumor site can mediate early establishment of prostate cancer cells in the bone and support subsequent tumor development at the zzso zzso
