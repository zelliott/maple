zzso a family of genes clustered on the X zzso has been identified as a zzso zzso and also forms a part of the zzso fusion gene found in zzso zzso zzso that it has an important role in zzso However, knowledge of the molecular regulation of zzso is still zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso or its zzso fusion protein is distributed as nuclear zzso in which it is zzso with B zzso zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso site 1 zzso which is a core factor of zzso zzso complex zzso The zzso zzso of zzso are indispensable for the nuclear zzso distribution, while the zzso domain is necessary for the recruitment of zzso indicating that intact zzso must be needed for interaction with zzso both zzso and zzso In addition, the zzso of zzso also proved to contain an intrinsic zzso zzso zzso which mediates the zzso zzso of zzso in particular kinds of cell stress such as the zzso of hydrogen zzso or heat zzso This zzso zzso is zzso and accompanied by zzso 70 or zzso traffic, suggesting that zzso is a stress response zzso It is of note that zzso zzso of zzso can result in disassociation of zzso from zzso with zzso zzso of zzso zzso These novel findings regarding distinct zzso of zzso and its interaction with zzso may shed light on the mechanism by which zzso zzso develops and on the zzso of zzso in cancer zzso
