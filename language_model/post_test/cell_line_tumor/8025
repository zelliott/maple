Certain zzso including receptors and signaling zzso are known to be enriched in zzso and zzso zzso zzso the major structural protein of zzso specifically interacts with many signaling molecules and, thus, zzso and zzso zzso are often seen as zzso signaling zzso A potential binding site for zzso is present in the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso and many downstream signaling components of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso The aim of this study was to investigate whether the zzso was localized in zzso raft zzso and, if so, what would be the significance of such zzso for zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso zzso within membrane zzso in close proximity to zzso in living cells, with potential interaction through a zzso sequence in the zzso C zzso zzso however, is not essential for zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso markedly reduced zzso zzso zzso production and zzso calcium zzso suggesting that zzso signaling through the zzso protein was critically dependent on integrity of zzso zzso and/or zzso Interestingly, whereas in zzso cells zzso raft disruption markedly decreased zzso zzso of the zzso pathway, in cells lacking zzso such as zzso zzso raft disruption had either the same zzso effect zzso B zzso or no effect zzso on zzso capacity to signal through the zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso appears to zzso within zzso or zzso zzso in different cell types, and this location may be important for specific signaling zzso
