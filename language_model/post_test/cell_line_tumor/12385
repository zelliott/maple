Members of the zzso gene family are well known for their role in the zzso of zzso zzso in humans and in mouse zzso A recent report that knockout mice deficient for the zzso zzso family member gene BAD frequently develop zzso zzso prompted us to analyze a large collection of human zzso zzso for zzso zzso in the BAD zzso All 3 zzso of the BAD gene were amplified and directly zzso The 81 zzso analyzed included 16 cases of zzso chronic zzso zzso 11 zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso 7 zzso zzso 8 zzso zzso cell lines, 3 cell lines of multiple zzso 15 cases and 4 cell lines of diffuse large zzso zzso and 7 Hodgkin's zzso zzso No zzso were found in any of the zzso We conclude that zzso in the BAD gene do not play a role in the zzso of the major zzso of human zzso zzso
