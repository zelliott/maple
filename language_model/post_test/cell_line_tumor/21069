It has been reported that chronic alcohol administration increases zzso zzso by enhancing zzso production of zzso oxide and zzso Several studies have shown the importance of zzso zzso zzso in protecting cells against zzso zzso zzso Recently, we demonstrated that the control of zzso and zzso zzso balance and the cellular defense against zzso damage is one of the primary functions of zzso zzso zzso zzso through to supply zzso for zzso zzso In this report, we demonstrate that ethanol zzso the zzso zzso in zzso cells through zzso of zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso Upon exposure to zzso ethanol for zzso to zzso cells, a significant decrease in the viability and activities of zzso and zzso was zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso resulted in the cellular zzso damage and zzso of zzso status as well as zzso dysfunction in zzso zzso The zzso of ethanol and zzso of zzso zzso were effectively protected by zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and zzso a zzso oxide zzso zzso These results indicate that ethanol toxicity is zzso by zzso and the zzso damage to zzso and zzso may be resulted in the zzso of the cellular zzso defense systems and subsequently lead to a zzso zzso
