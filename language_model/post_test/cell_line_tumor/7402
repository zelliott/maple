zzso plays an important role in the zzso zzso of most solid zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso and its zzso zzso play a key role in tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso may inhibit tumor zzso This study was to construct a DNA vaccine against zzso domain 1-3 of zzso test its zzso effect on growth of liver cancer cell line zzso 

zzso domain 1-3 of zzso was cloned by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso inserted into zzso zzso to construct vaccine zzso zzso The vaccine was zzso into zzso zzso protein expression of zzso 1-3 was detected by Western zzso Standard zzso zzso releasing test was used to detect specific zzso T zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso To test zzso preventive zzso were divided into zzso and S zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso into mice 10 days zzso The tumor size, tumor weight, mice survival time, tumor zzso period, and zzso density were recorded and zzso 

zzso domain 1-3 of zzso was zzso vaccine against it was zzso have been proved by DNA sequencing and comparing with data in zzso A protein of 44 zzso is consisted with zzso 1-3 zzso in zzso cells zzso with the DNA zzso zzso activity in these cells zzso After zzso with zzso zzso zzso time of V group was zzso zzso P group was zzso zzso S group was zzso zzso survival time of V group was zzso zzso P group was zzso zzso S group was zzso zzso zzso density of V group was zzso P group was zzso S group was zzso tumor weight of V group was zzso zzso P group was zzso zzso S group was zzso In comparison among zzso data in V group were significantly different from P group and S group zzso zzso significant difference existed between P group and S group zzso zzso 

The DNA vaccine against zzso may stimulate potent specific zzso activity, and inhibit growth of zzso cells by its zzso cell zzso
