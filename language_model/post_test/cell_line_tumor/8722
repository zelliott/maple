The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of zzso human zzso zzso on the proliferation of human gastric cancer zzso cells and its underlying zzso zzso was performed to identify the expression of zzso zzso zzso Cell proliferation was measured with zzso zzso DNA content and cell cycle were analyzed by flow zzso zzso was assessed by DNA zzso zzso and flow zzso analysis using zzso zzso double zzso zzso mechanisms of zzso zzso were evaluated by the activities of zzso zzso zzso and zzso c release from zzso Moreover, the zzso of zzso in zzso cells upon zzso administration was detected by Western zzso zzso Our results demonstrated that two zzso receptors zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso zzso zzso diminished the proliferation rate of zzso cells in a zzso and zzso manner and induced zzso cell zzso involving in the zzso of zzso and zzso but not zzso In addition, zzso failed to induce zzso c release from zzso and had no effect on the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso from these results, we concluded that zzso significantly inhibited cell proliferation via zzso phase cell cycle arrest and induced zzso through the zzso zzso zzso in human gastric cancer zzso zzso
