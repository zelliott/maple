Relatively little is known about the zzso or the pharmacological potential of zzso complexes of zzso compared to its lighter zzso iron and zzso We report the synthesis of seven new complexes, zzso containing different zzso nitrogen zzso zzso and a zzso complex, zzso The X-ray crystal structures of seven complexes are reported: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso where zzso zzso zzso en zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was found to play a crucial role in enhancing zzso zzso The rates of zzso at zzso zzso decreased when the primary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso h at zzso zzso are replaced with zzso zzso groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso h at zzso zzso The zzso complexes zzso up to 100 times more slowly than their zzso zzso The zzso of the aqua zzso decreased with a similar trend zzso zzso zzso and zzso for en and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso toward both the human zzso lung and zzso zzso cancer cell lines, with zzso values of 6-10 zzso comparable to the zzso drug zzso zzso binds to both the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso of zzso The formation constant for the zzso zzso zzso zzso was lower for zzso zzso K zzso zzso than zzso zzso K zzso zzso although the zzso zzso showed some kinetic zzso DNA zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso may play a role in its zzso This work demonstrates that the nature of the zzso zzso can play a crucial role in tuning the chemical and biological properties of zzso zzso
