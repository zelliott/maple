The present work was conducted to further examine the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso of zzso colon cancer cells induced by T cells and various zzso agents because reduced zzso to the zzso of an zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells has previously been reported by zzso As expected, zzso zzso were also more resistant to the killing effect of zzso zzso T zzso On the other hand, zzso these cells with an zzso inhibitor restored not only their zzso levels but also their sensitivity to zzso suggesting a pivotal role of zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso Interestingly, while the zzso of zzso zzso to zzso and zzso remained zzso they were more resistant to zzso and zzso which triggered zzso via a zzso zzso zzso zzso of both zzso 9 and 3 in zzso zzso by the two aforementioned zzso II zzso was dramatically zzso which could be accounted mainly by an increased expression of zzso a critical zzso zzso Finally, poor survival was found in stage III colon cancer patients whose tumors were stained positively by the zzso zzso Thus, advantages such as immune evasion and resistance to zzso drug-induced zzso acquired by colon cancer cells through zzso zzso might facilitate their survival during zzso and zzso
