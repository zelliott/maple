To observe the effect of containing drugs serum of zzso zzso zzso on expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, zzso and zzso in gastric cancer cell line zzso 

Total of 120 male zzso rats were divided into control group, high dose group, medium dose group and low dose group fed with natural zzso zzso and 5 zzso of zzso zzso The experimental animals were finally killed for the preparation of zzso zzso The gastric cancer cell zzso was cultured with the zzso serum drawn from the rats in different zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was detected with zzso zzso The expression of zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected with zzso 

In high, medium and low dose groups, the gray scales of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso values of zzso increased significantly, but the gray scales of zzso and the zzso values of zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso compared with that in control zzso 

The zzso of zzso can decrease the expression of zzso zzso zzso increases the expression of zzso This effect may be involved in mechanism of gastric cancer cell growth zzso induced by zzso
