We have zzso rigid zzso of zzso bearing a zzso ring in place of the zzso zzso These compounds are zzso at zzso zzso in zzso cells, display a similar zzso relationship compared to zzso zzso and inhibit zzso zzso We also show that the zzso ring can be further zzso Thus, it is possible that zzso could act as scaffolds for the development of zzso zzso zzso
