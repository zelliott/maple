In this study, we explore the therapeutic potential of zzso a selective inhibitor of both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso for the treatment of zzso zzso The effect of zzso on zzso cell growth and zzso zzso was studied in a panel of human zzso cancer cell zzso zzso molecular markers predicting sensitivity were assessed by baseline gene expression zzso zzso and western zzso zzso Multiple drug zzso index zzso zzso analysis was used to study the interactions between zzso drugs and zzso zzso zzso effects of zzso were seen in all zzso cancer cell lines tested, but varied significantly between individual cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or increased expression of zzso was significantly associated with in zzso sensitivity zzso or zzso zzso zzso exerts growth zzso in a zzso zzso Sensitive cell lines also exhibited increased expression of zzso zzso or zzso In contrast, zzso cell lines exhibited high zzso zzso zzso levels or zzso transition zzso zzso In zzso cancer cells, at a wide range of clinically achievable drug zzso additive and synergistic interactions were observed for zzso plus zzso zzso zzso and zzso These observations provide a clear zzso rational to test zzso as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy in zzso cancer with zzso zzso zzso of zzso its zzso zzso zzso and zzso markers warrant further evaluation to help define patients with zzso zzso cancer most likely to benefit from zzso
