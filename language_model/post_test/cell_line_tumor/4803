The mechanisms by which multiple myeloma zzso cells migrate and home to the bone zzso are not well zzso In this study, we sought to determine the effect of the zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso on the migration and zzso of zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso is zzso expressed at high levels in the peripheral blood and is zzso in the bone zzso in response to high levels of zzso zzso induced zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells evidenced by zzso zzso The specific zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso zzso zzso inhibited the migration of zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso migration was regulated by the zzso and zzso zzso pathways but not by zzso zzso In addition, we demonstrated that zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso cells to the bone zzso niches using in zzso flow zzso in zzso zzso zzso and whole body zzso zzso This study, therefore, demonstrates that zzso is a critical regulator of zzso zzso and that it provides the framework for zzso of this zzso to be used in future clinical trials to abrogate zzso zzso
