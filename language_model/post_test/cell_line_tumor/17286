Little is known about the zzso organization of lipids in biological zzso zzso zzso is a major plasma membrane zzso that forms zzso zzso together with cholesterol and zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we showed that in cultured zzso cells the accessibility of the toxin to zzso is different between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are highly enriched with zzso The zzso role of zzso in the binding of zzso to zzso was confirmed by comparing the zzso zzso melanoma cell line with its parent zzso Model membrane experiments indicated that zzso altered the local density of zzso so that the affinity of the zzso for zzso was zzso Our results indicate that zzso recognizes the zzso organization of zzso in zzso and that the organization of zzso differs between different cell types and between different membrane zzso within the same zzso zzso zzso zzso suggests that zzso binding to zzso is presumably the result of a zzso complex formation of specific zzso thus supporting the idea of the existence of small condensed zzso complexes consisting of just a few zzso molecules in living zzso
