The zzso zzso acid is a dietary constituent and a microbial zzso of zzso zzso administered to rats, zzso acid was very rapidly absorbed most probably by the gastric or zzso zzso and zzso in urine as free and zzso zzso zzso analysis of plasma and urine samples allowed confident identification of the zzso acid zzso The parent compound was zzso zzso or zzso on one of the zzso groups present on its zzso zzso All the zzso acid zzso peaked in plasma within the first zzso following zzso suggesting a metabolism possibly by the gastric or zzso cells and by the zzso Using in zzso and ex zzso models of the zzso zzso and the liver, the identity and source of the zzso detected in zzso were zzso The data obtained suggest that, in rats, zzso cells are more able to zzso zzso acid, whereas liver zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso and zzso seem to be zzso preferably on the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso acid, was shown to be oxidized into zzso acid by zzso and zzso cells, which were also able to perform the reverse reaction, the reduction of zzso acid into zzso zzso As a conclusion, the main form of zzso acid circulating in plasma after its zzso is a mixture of different primary and secondary zzso
