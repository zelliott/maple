zzso have evolved elaborate mechanisms to activate zzso in response to insults that lead to cancer, including the binding and zzso of zzso by the zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso This same mechanism appears to be activated upon impaired zzso zzso a risk factor for cancer zzso As loss of zzso abrogates zzso zzso and protein synthesis to the same extent as loss of other essential zzso zzso we reasoned the loss of zzso and zzso would induce a zzso cell cycle zzso zzso we found that their depletion in primary human lung zzso failed to induce cell cycle arrest but strongly suppressed cell cycle zzso We show that the effects on cell cycle progression stemmed from reduced zzso content and zzso capacity, which suppressed the zzso of zzso at the zzso zzso Thus, unlike other tumor zzso zzso play an essential role in normal cell zzso a function cells have evolved to rely on in lieu of a cell cycle zzso
