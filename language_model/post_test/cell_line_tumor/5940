In contrast to normal cells, cancer cells avidly take up zzso and metabolize it to zzso even when oxygen is abundant, a phenomenon referred to as the Warburg zzso This fundamental zzso in zzso metabolism in cancer cells enables their specific detection by zzso zzso zzso zzso following zzso injection of the zzso analogue zzso zzso However, this useful imaging technique is limited by the fact that not all zzso avidly take up zzso To identify molecular zzso of zzso zzso we interrogated the zzso of zzso cell lines and primary tumors for zzso pathways associated with zzso zzso zzso From zzso zzso pathways that were zzso the zzso and several zzso pathways zzso zzso carbon zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso showed the greatest zzso zzso This zzso zzso predicted zzso zzso in breast cancer cell lines and overlapped with established gene expression signatures for the zzso breast cancer zzso and zzso zzso in zzso Human breast zzso with nuclear zzso zzso and high zzso expression of zzso target genes showed high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso signature was similarly associated with zzso gene copy gain, increased zzso transcript levels, and elevated expression of zzso zzso target genes in a human breast cancer zzso zzso Together, our findings link clinical observations of zzso zzso with a zzso and molecular zzso of human breast zzso Furthermore, they suggest related approaches to derive molecular zzso of zzso retention for other zzso zzso
