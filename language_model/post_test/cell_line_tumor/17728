zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is widely used in the zzso of neuroendocrine tumors expressing zzso and zzso using zzso SS zzso has been introduced for treatment of patients with neuroendocrine zzso Previous zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso zzso can also be zzso using this zzso The question has been addressed whether zzso might also be possible targets for zzso using zzso SS zzso zzso we investigated in zzso the characteristics of zzso zzso and zzso cell lines to evaluate whether zzso can be targets for zzso 

Six zzso zzso 2 Hodgkin's zzso and 2 zzso zzso from the neck region were zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and quantitative zzso were performed to detect and zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso studies using zzso were performed to evaluate binding to zzso on zzso sections of zzso zzso was used to investigate expression of zzso and zzso zzso binding studies and in zzso zzso experiments using zzso were performed to study binding and zzso of zzso by zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and primary cells derived from a zzso chronic zzso zzso 

A selective expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso By quantitative zzso expression levels of zzso and zzso zzso were relatively zzso zzso studies revealed low binding of zzso whereas zzso could not be detected for zzso and zzso by zzso On the zzso cell lines only low numbers of zzso SS binding sites were zzso In zzso zzso of zzso by these cells was also very zzso 

On the basis of our findings, we conclude that zzso do not appear to be candidates for zzso using zzso SS zzso However, zzso are highly zzso tumors and further clinical studies should be performed to evaluate whether the low zzso density is sufficient for targeting treatment in these zzso
