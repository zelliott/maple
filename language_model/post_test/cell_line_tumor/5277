zzso cancer zzso is the second most common cancer in zzso Currently, no zzso zzso therapeutic targets exist for patients with invasive zzso and no zzso markers of risk assessment for progression of zzso zzso are zzso New molecular insights into zzso zzso are urgently zzso zzso this goal, we first determined the copy number zzso of zzso 4 and then examined the role of zzso mapped to zzso as a candidate tumor zzso zzso We identified zzso 4 in zzso of 81 invasive zzso studied by zzso array and found that zzso of 130 invasive zzso harboring zzso in the promoter region of the zzso zzso We then showed that zzso promoter zzso of zzso is associated with zzso of gene expression and cell lines exposed to zzso agent resulted in profound zzso gene zzso We also showed that the promoter zzso in the zzso gene occurs at an earliest identifiable stage of zzso zzso zzso zzso Our studies demonstrate that zzso of zzso may be a critical event in zzso progression and form a potentially useful therapeutic target for zzso
