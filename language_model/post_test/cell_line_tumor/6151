zzso disease results from the shedding of cancer cells from a solid primary zzso their transport through the cardiovascular system as circulating tumor cells zzso and their zzso and growth at distant zzso Little is known about the properties and fate of tumor cells as they leave their growth site and travel as single zzso We applied zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to study the membrane zzso density and zzso properties together with the size and zzso of cultured tumor cells after they were harvested and placed into single cell zzso After zzso the tumor cells exhibited zzso properties that changed with time through a process of zzso shedding zzso membrane and zzso were zzso This process appeared to be distinct from the cell death mechanisms of zzso zzso and necrosis and it may explain why multiple zzso are seen among zzso isolated from patients and among the tumor cells obtained from zzso fluid of zzso The implications of dynamic zzso properties and zzso loss for zzso migration into small blood vessels in the circulatory system, survival and gene expression are zzso Because the total zzso of tumor cells remained higher than blood cells even after they had shed zzso zzso offers a compelling, zzso technology for zzso viable zzso from blood even when they are no larger than peripheral blood zzso zzso
