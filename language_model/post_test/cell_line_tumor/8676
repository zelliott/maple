zzso cell zzso zzso factor zzso which belongs to transforming growth factor zzso zzso plays important roles in zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso increased in zzso cells, but the underlying zzso mechanism is zzso Here, we found that although the base sequence in the promoter region of the zzso gene was unchanged in zzso cells, there were significant changes in the zzso level of promoter region I zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso degree in promoter region II was notably decreased in zzso zzso tissue compared to normal brain tissue zzso zzso and the zzso sites were mainly located in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was markedly increased in high-grade zzso tissue zzso zzso and the sites with decreased zzso level were mainly located in the zzso zzso The binding capacities of several zzso factors, such as zzso protein 2, specificity protein 1, zzso gene 2, and zzso response element binding zzso which specifically bind to regions with altered zzso status decreased along with the pathological grade of zzso and the differences between high-grade zzso and normal brain tissue were significant zzso zzso The results suggest that changes in zzso factor binding capacity are due to changes in promoter region zzso and might be the underlying mechanism for zzso high zzso expression in zzso
