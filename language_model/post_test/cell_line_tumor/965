The zzso cellular zzso system is regulated by zzso zzso exchange factors zzso zzso of zzso on zzso zzso and a key member of the zzso gene family is activated by the zzso zzso the zzso product is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We document here the amplification of zzso in five of 18 primary zzso cell lung zzso examined and its increased expression in 18 of 28 tumors in comparison to corresponding zzso lung zzso zzso zzso revealed prominent zzso protein in the zzso of cancer cells, associated with faint zzso at the zzso zzso but zzso was not zzso in normal zzso zzso cells or in zzso cells of the zzso ducts or zzso These data indicate that amplification and increased expression of the zzso gene may play some role in human lung zzso through zzso of the zzso signaling zzso
