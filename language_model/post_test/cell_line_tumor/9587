zzso zzso zzso is one of the most common causes of cancer death in Western countries with an average survival after diagnosis of 3-6 months and a five-year survival rate under zzso Because of the lack of effective therapies, there is the need to characterize new molecular treatment zzso zzso regulation of the cell cycle is a hallmark of zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso a key regulator of zzso of the cell cycle, has been shown to be zzso in pancreatic zzso Until now, the contribution of zzso to tumor maintenance of pancreatic cancer has not been zzso In this study, we used the chemical zzso inhibitor zzso as well as zzso zzso to investigate the function of zzso in pancreatic cancer zzso Both approaches led to a reduction of pancreatic cancer cell proliferation due to zzso cell cycle arrest and zzso zzso Furthermore, we observed increased sensitivity of zzso pancreatic cancer cells towards zzso zzso zzso towards TRAIL was due to the zzso zzso of zzso These findings show that a combined zzso strategy may be a potential therapeutic strategy for pancreatic zzso zzso
