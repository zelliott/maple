zzso cancer is currently the most lethal zzso zzso in Europe and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso demonstrate high zzso rates, but zzso the efficacy of zzso agents is limited by the development of zzso resistance zzso Clinical zzso resistance is often associated with zzso zzso In a recent study, we introduced a highly specific quantitative real-time reverse zzso zzso chain reaction for the zzso of zzso zzso In the present study, we demonstrate that primary tumor cells from patients with zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso To evaluate zzso zzso we collected tumor cells from 77 zzso cancer patients (13 zzso zzso cancer, 64 zzso zzso zzso Cancer cells were zzso from 49 solid specimens zzso and 28 zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer cells were exposed in 221 short-term cultures either to blank medium zzso or to a single zzso drug, zzso zzso or zzso The drug zzso applied referred to clinical relevant zzso zzso zzso expression was significantly higher in specimens from zzso zzso cancer incubated in zzso than in specimens from zzso zzso zzso No significant differences were zzso between the mean value of zzso zzso expression in tumor specimens from zzso zzso cancer incubated in zzso or zzso zzso within the zzso patients group were also not statistically zzso The result of this study confirms clinical zzso as well as zzso studies based on tumor cell lines, that zzso resistance is correlated with zzso zzso
