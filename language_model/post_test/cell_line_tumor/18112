zzso factor zzso is a zzso protein that acts as a zzso for activated zzso factor zzso zzso initiating the zzso zzso Recent studies demonstrate that expression of zzso zzso also mediates zzso signaling relevant to tumor growth and zzso Our present study investigates the possible mechanism by which the interaction between zzso and zzso regulates chemotherapy resistance in zzso cell zzso 

Gene and zzso zzso was used to enforce zzso expression in a zzso zzso cell line and to silence zzso zzso expression in a zzso zzso line, zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as the zzso of zzso and zzso in gene zzso cells or cells treated with zzso inhibitor and zzso were determined by Western zzso zzso zzso cell growth was determined by a zzso zzso zzso and zzso effect of zzso on zzso cell lines was analyzed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso (by flow zzso zzso 

zzso expression of zzso in a zzso zzso cell line in the presence of zzso induced zzso of zzso leading to resistance to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression in a zzso zzso cell line using zzso resulted in zzso of zzso and zzso to zzso zzso Additionally, zzso cells expressing high levels of either zzso or zzso zzso treated with zzso readily zzso zzso and zzso Using selective zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso inhibitor I, but not the zzso inhibitor zzso blocked the zzso zzso of zzso 

This study shows that in zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso with zzso produced zzso of zzso expression through the zzso signaling pathway, resulting in resistance to zzso We zzso that this zzso zzso may zzso at least in part, to chemotherapy resistance in zzso
