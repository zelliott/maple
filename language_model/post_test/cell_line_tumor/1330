Four and a half zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso has been linked to zzso However, the role of zzso in lung cancer remains unclear and the detailed mechanism underlying its tumor zzso role is poorly zzso The purpose of this study was to examine zzso expression in lung cancer patients and to investigate how it was associated with lung cancer cell zzso zzso and zzso showed that zzso protein was zzso in over zzso of 80 lung cancer zzso zzso expression was strongly correlated with tumor zzso types zzso zzso zzso ) and the differentiation of the tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso and zzso growth of human lung cancer cell zzso The zzso effects of zzso on lung cancer cell growth were associated with both the zzso and the zzso cell cycle arrest zzso with a marked zzso of zzso A, zzso B1 and zzso D as well as the induction of the zzso dependent zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso injection of an zzso expressing zzso dramatically suppressed the growth of zzso lung cancer cells in nude zzso Our data suggest that reduced expression of zzso may play an important role in the development and progression of lung cancer and that zzso may be a useful target for lung cancer gene zzso
