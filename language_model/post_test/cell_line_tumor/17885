The objective of this study was to manufacture zzso zzso loaded zzso zzso that were surface zzso with zzso to vascular zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso for systemic targeting to zzso sites in prostate zzso 

zzso were manufactured in the 1-3 zzso size range from zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso by a modified zzso evaporation method using zzso homogenization followed by high speed zzso in zzso vinyl zzso zzso were zzso to the surface of these zzso using zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Cell zzso was determined using human zzso vein zzso cells zzso in zzso zzso zzso were made using human prostate tumors zzso grown zzso in zzso 

zzso were effectively bound to the surface of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bound strongly to zzso Pilot efficacy studies in mice showed zzso but demonstrated a significant zzso of tumor growth following the systemic administration of a single dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as compared to zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso may offer an effective way of administering a controlled release zzso of the drug to target prostate zzso
