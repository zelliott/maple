Liver cancer or zzso zzso is one of the leading causes of zzso zzso Conventional zzso are limited by the development of drug resistance and various side zzso Because of its zzso and potent zzso activity, zzso derived from mushrooms have received more attention in cancer zzso Our previous studies have demonstrated the zzso effects of zzso complexes derived from the zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the underlying molecular mechanism of the zzso activity of a hot water extract containing a zzso complex isolated from zzso zzso zzso in liver cancer zzso Our results indicated that exposure of liver cancer cells to zzso not only significantly reduced the in zzso cancer cell proliferation and invasion but also enhanced the zzso to the zzso drug zzso Both oral administration and zzso injection of zzso significantly inhibited the tumor growth in zzso zzso nude zzso zzso triggered a marked suppression of the zzso signaling zzso in liver cancer cells in zzso and in zzso and zzso of the zzso active form of zzso zzso zzso this effect and the inhibited proliferation and invasion by zzso Both western zzso and zzso results showed that zzso liver cancer cells had reduced expression and zzso of vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso of zzso human zzso attenuated the zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso and the cancer zzso Our results demonstrated that zzso suppressed the zzso invasion, and zzso of liver cancer cells in zzso and in zzso zzso by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso This study suggests the potential therapeutic implication of zzso in the treatment of human liver zzso
