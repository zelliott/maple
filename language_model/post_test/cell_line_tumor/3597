Group B zzso zzso are believed to trigger some cases of human type 1 diabetes zzso although the mechanism by which this may occur has not been zzso We demonstrated previously that zzso of young zzso diabetic zzso mice with any of several different zzso strains reduced zzso zzso We also observed no evidence of zzso replication within zzso of young zzso mice, suggesting no role for zzso in zzso induction in the zzso mouse zzso The failure to observe zzso replication within zzso of young zzso mice has been proposed to be due to zzso expression by zzso beta cells or lack of expression of the zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso protein is zzso within zzso of young and older zzso mice and that a zzso strain, which expresses zzso zzso can replicate in zzso Mice zzso with the zzso expressing zzso zzso strain were better protected from zzso onset than were zzso control mice despite zzso viral zzso Having demonstrated that zzso can replicate in healthy zzso of young zzso mice when the zzso environment is suitably altered, we asked whether zzso in old zzso mice were resistant to zzso zzso Unlike young mice in which zzso is not yet apparent, older zzso mice demonstrate severe zzso in all zzso zzso older zzso mice with different zzso zzso strains caused accelerated zzso onset relative to control mice, a phenomenon that was preceded by detection of virus within zzso Together, the results suggest a model for resolving conflicting data regarding the role of zzso in human zzso zzso
