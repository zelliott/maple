The purpose of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanism by which zzso and its target genes mediate radiation resistance of zzso zzso zzso zzso was employed to detect zzso expression in normal brain zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso or plasmids containing zzso or zzso zzso and zzso The survival curve was obtained to investigate the sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso Cell zzso was measured by using the zzso kit and cell cycle by flow zzso Western zzso was performed to detect the expression of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso The results showed that zzso expression in zzso cells and zzso was zzso associated with the radiation zzso zzso of zzso resulted in radiation resistance, while zzso of zzso led to higher sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso After zzso zzso the zzso of zzso cells was significantly increased and the zzso phase arrest was more zzso In addition, zzso zzso increased the expression of zzso zzso and zzso which contributed to the zzso and zzso arrest of zzso zzso The findings suggested that zzso may mediate the resistance of zzso cells against radiation via its target genes zzso and zzso zzso and its target genes may be used as potential molecular targets for clinical zzso zzso in the zzso
