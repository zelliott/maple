zzso effort in recent years has been devoted to constructing and analyzing large-scale gene and protein networks on the basis of zzso data and literature zzso These interaction zzso provide valuable insight into the zzso of complex biological networks but are rarely context specific and cannot be used to predict the responses of cell signaling proteins to specific zzso or zzso zzso traditional approaches to analyzing cell signaling are narrow in scope and cannot easily make use of zzso zzso Here, we combine network analysis and functional zzso by using a hybrid approach in which zzso are converted into simple mathematical models that can be trained against zzso zzso Specifically, we created zzso logic models of zzso signaling in liver cells by training a zzso prior knowledge network against zzso data obtained from primary human zzso and 4 zzso zzso cell lines exposed to combinations of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso families of models were recovered for each cell type, and these families clustered zzso into normal and diseased zzso
