zzso C virus zzso infection of zzso leads to zzso induction of the zzso zzso which is considered an zzso zzso zzso However, we have recently shown that zzso are not required for zzso induction in zzso during acute zzso zzso Since the zzso promoter contains binding sites for several zzso zzso factors, we investigated the contribution of these factors to zzso zzso induction during zzso infection in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso were used to identify critical sites of zzso zzso The zzso zzso response element zzso and zzso binding sites positively regulated zzso zzso during zzso infection as well as following exposure to zzso (a zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso (a zzso zzso gene I zzso zzso from two viral zzso zzso binding sites for zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso regulated zzso induction in response to zzso and zzso zzso while only zzso zzso regulated zzso during zzso zzso We also demonstrated that zzso factor 3 zzso is zzso recruited to the zzso zzso during zzso infection and zzso to the nucleus in zzso primary human zzso Furthermore, zzso activated the zzso promoter independently of type I or type III zzso zzso The data indicate that sensing of zzso infection by zzso and zzso leads to direct recruitment of zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso Our study expands upon current knowledge regarding the mechanisms of zzso induction in zzso and lays the foundation for additional zzso studies that further zzso the zzso and synergistic aspects of immune signaling zzso
