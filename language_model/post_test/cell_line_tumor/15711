Although one of the several chronic effects of zzso radiation is aging, there are no experimental data on zzso zzso zzso The most interesting change in aging was a helper T zzso zzso zzso We investigated chronic effect on immune responses after zzso radiation and its effects in zzso mice were compared with those of aged zzso The 2-month-old mice received a zzso zzso of zzso At zzso after zzso we compared the immune functions of the zzso mice with those of normal mice of the same age and with those of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso level were lower in the zzso mice than in normal mice of same age, showing similar levels to those of old normal zzso In contrast, zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso level were increased in zzso mice when compared with the same zzso zzso Next, we investigated the low expression of zzso zzso receptors and zzso receptors in zzso and old zzso Also, the decrease of natural killer cell activity was intensified in the zzso mice, showing lower than values to those of old zzso Interestingly, in zzso mice, the absolute numbers and the percentages of natural killer zzso cells was extremely zzso But the absolute numbers of zzso cells and zzso T zzso cells in old mice were significantly zzso In conclusion, an zzso imbalance by the zzso zzso of zzso zzso to persist in the long term, resulting in the similar results with zzso Our results suggest that the zzso of the zzso immune response shown in old mice rapidly occurred through exposure of zzso zzso
