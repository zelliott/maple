zzso zzso remains the most effective therapy for solid tumors zzso The most important zzso indicator for cure following cancer surgery is a complete zzso with no residual zzso However, zzso detection of retained cancer cells after surgery is challenging, and residual disease continues to be the most common cause of local zzso We hypothesized that visual enhancement of tumors using zzso imaging could potentially identify tumor deposits in the wound after zzso 

A small animal model of surgery and retained disease was zzso zzso tumor deposits in the wound were targeted using an zzso Food and Drug zzso imaging agent, zzso green, by the enhanced zzso and retention zzso A novel handheld zzso was used to zzso zzso retained disease after zzso 

We found residual disease using zzso imaging during surgery that was not visible to the naked eye or zzso Furthermore, examination of tumor zzso was remarkably precise in zzso margins from normal surrounding zzso This approach was most successful for tumors with increased zzso 

The results suggest that zzso examination of the surgical wound after zzso zzso can potentially enable the surgeon to locate residual zzso The data in this study is the basis of an ongoing Phase zzso clinical trial in patients who undergo zzso for lung and breast zzso
