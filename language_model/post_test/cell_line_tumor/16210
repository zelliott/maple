The zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso channel, is the main regulator of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso An emerging body of evidence suggests that specific regulatory control of the zzso signaling zzso is modulated by the zzso of additional signaling zzso In the present study, we investigated the influence of the zzso target of zzso zzso zzso on the activity of the zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso We used a zzso approach to show that zzso physically interacts with zzso in an zzso zzso zzso We also showed that zzso is zzso by zzso in zzso All the conditions known to zzso zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were shown to modify zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso Lastly, we used an zzso that directly measures the activity of zzso to show that zzso increases the apparent affinity of zzso Given that zzso controls cell proliferation and cell zzso and that zzso plays a key role in these two phenomena, it follows that zzso zzso zzso zzso release when the nutritional status of cells requires zzso
