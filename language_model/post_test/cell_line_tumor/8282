zzso milk contain zzso especially zzso depending on the composition of the feed zzso However, it is unknown whether milk differing in zzso exhibits different zzso in model systems and thereby potentially in humans as milk zzso 

The zzso of high and low zzso milk zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso was investigated in immature female mice including zzso expression of six zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were also tested for zzso in zzso in an zzso zzso zzso reporter gene zzso with zzso zzso 

The total content of zzso was approximately 10 times higher in zzso compared with zzso but levels of zzso milk zzso and zzso were similar in the two milk types zzso and zzso zzso There was no difference in zzso weight between mice receiving zzso and zzso and no difference from zzso zzso zzso times the concentration in zzso was not zzso The zzso zzso expression was zzso in the zzso of zzso mice compared with zzso and controls, but there was no difference between milk types for any of the other zzso zzso of zzso showed a higher zzso than extracts of zzso in zzso cells, and there was a zzso increase in zzso by zzso 

The higher in zzso zzso of zzso was not reflected as a higher zzso weight in zzso although the zzso of zzso in zzso tissue of zzso mice could suggest some zzso activity of zzso at the gene expression zzso
