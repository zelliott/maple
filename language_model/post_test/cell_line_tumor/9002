Though various targets have been proposed and zzso no agent has yet been investigated in a clinical setting for head and neck zzso The present study aimed to compare two zzso labeled zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso for detection of head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and in zzso imaging of the zzso labeled zzso zzso were zzso Next, zzso mice zzso bearing zzso zzso and zzso tongue tumors received systemic injections of zzso zzso or zzso (a zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso using two zzso imaging systems, zzso and zzso Fluorescent zzso zzso were also identified, and all zzso zzso were sent for zzso 

zzso and zzso had specific and high affinity binding for zzso (K zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a zzso increase in zzso intensity compared to zzso in zzso In zzso both zzso labeled zzso produced higher zzso ratios compared to zzso However, there was no significant difference between the two in either cell line or imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso paired zzso zzso 

There was no significant difference between the two zzso labeled zzso zzso zzso in zzso models of zzso Both zzso and zzso can be considered suitable targeting agents for fluorescent zzso detection of zzso
