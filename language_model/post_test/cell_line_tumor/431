zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression has been shown to correlate with poor prognosis in zzso cancer zzso The authors hypothesized that targeting zzso a zzso involved in cell zzso migration, invasion, zzso and zzso would impair the growth of zzso in the liver, the most common site of zzso 

Human zzso cell lines were examined for zzso expression by Western zzso zzso The in zzso effects of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were tested in proliferation and migration zzso For in zzso studies, human zzso zzso cells were injected directly into the zzso of mice in 2 separate studies, the first to determine the effect of therapy with zzso on zzso disease zzso begun on Day zzso and a second study to determine the effect of therapy on established disease zzso begun on Day zzso Mice were zzso to receive either zzso zzso G zzso zzso or zzso and were sacrificed 1 month after tumor zzso 

zzso was expressed by all zzso cell lines zzso In zzso zzso had minimal effect on zzso proliferation in zzso but significantly decreased zzso cell zzso In zzso zzso lead to significant reductions in tumor growth versus control when initiated either 4 or 12 days after tumor zzso zzso vs control zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso vs control zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited in zzso tumor cell proliferation in both zzso 

zzso zzso therapy impaired zzso tumor growth in the liver in both zzso and zzso disease zzso
