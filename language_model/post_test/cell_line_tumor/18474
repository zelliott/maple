Solid tumors with zzso insufficient blood supply contain hypoxic cells that are resistant to zzso and zzso Drug resistance, an obstacle to zzso treatment of solid tumors, can occur via suppression of zzso a process controlled by zzso and zzso members of the zzso protein zzso zzso deprivation of human colon cancer cells in zzso provoked decreased zzso and protein levels of zzso Bid and zzso zzso factor 1 zzso was zzso for the zzso of Bad but required for that of Bid, consistent with the binding of zzso to a zzso element zzso zzso to zzso in the bid zzso zzso deprivation resulted in zzso decreased expression of zzso in zzso consistent with a reduction in global translation zzso The zzso relevance of Bid and zzso zzso was confirmed in tumors in zzso zzso deprivation resulted in decreased drug-induced zzso and zzso resistance to agents with different mechanisms of zzso The contribution of Bid and/or zzso zzso to drug responsiveness was demonstrated by the relative resistance of zzso cells that had no or reduced expression of Bid and/or zzso and by the finding that forced expression of Bid in hypoxic cells resulted in increased sensitivity to the zzso II inhibitor zzso
