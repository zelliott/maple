The zzso zzso zzso activity of listed zzso so called zzso 98, by the Ministry of the zzso Japan, and structurally related chemicals was characterized using zzso human breast cancer cells zzso expressing an zzso zzso reporter zzso zzso Since our results suggested that chemicals with diverse chemical structures were capable of zzso the zzso systems zzso by zzso a comparative molecular field analysis zzso model was developed to analyze the structural requirements necessary to disrupt zzso zzso A significant zzso model with zzso and zzso was developed for zzso zzso activity of 35 pure zzso excluding zzso On the other hand, a good zzso model with zzso and zzso was obtained for zzso activity of 13 chemicals with both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso and zzso properties were sufficient to describe the structural requirements for zzso zzso zzso In addition, the structural difference of zzso zzso and zzso was explained based on zzso results and the zzso crystal zzso As several zzso zzso such as zzso zzso acted as zzso antagonists, the surface area of the zzso zzso domain zzso was compared with that of the zzso based on their reported crystal structures to analyze how those zzso interact with zzso The surface area of zzso was shown to be smaller than that of zzso and therefore compounds with both zzso and zzso activities can fit well into the zzso but may zzso from the zzso It is likely that this subtle difference of the surface areas of the zzso determines whether an zzso zzso acts as an zzso zzso or an zzso
