Two human breast zzso cell lines, zzso and its zzso zzso which displays aggressive zzso zzso were investigated for molecular zzso characteristics using zzso spectral zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso Both cell lines have multiple zzso zzso but differ in the types of zzso and their zzso The zzso zzso identified in the present study differs from that previously reported, which suggests that this cell line is zzso Neither cell line exhibited amplification of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso cells have a modal number of 60, with 42 types of zzso 11 zzso and 31 zzso zzso cells have a modal number of 55, with 37 types of zzso 10 zzso and 27 zzso The most common aberrations in zzso cells were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The most common aberrations in zzso cells were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso This zzso result is consistent with previous findings that showed differences in zzso and zzso capability of these two cell lines and indicates that zzso is a new cell line distinctive from zzso We zzso that the zzso changes in zzso may be related to its new biological zzso zzso of the zzso aberrations and zzso identified could be useful for further genetic and zzso studies of breast zzso
