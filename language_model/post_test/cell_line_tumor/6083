zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso is correlated with decreased survival in head and neck cancer zzso where the addition of zzso zzso to standard zzso approaches has improved treatment zzso However, the basis for the limited efficacy of zzso zzso in zzso is incompletely zzso zzso receptors zzso have been shown to be zzso in zzso where zzso zzso zzso zzso growth via both zzso and zzso zzso We hypothesized that targeting zzso zzso signaling would improve the efficacy of zzso zzso 

Using a zzso zzso zzso we identified proteins that were zzso in zzso cells where zzso expression was zzso by zzso interference zzso in the presence or absence of a zzso zzso We confirmed the findings from the array by Western zzso followed by in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was elevated approximately zzso in zzso zzso cells treated with a zzso zzso In addition to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was modestly increased by zzso inhibitor zzso approved by the Food and Drug zzso zzso from zzso patients also displayed increased zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso cells were growth inhibited by both genetic and zzso zzso targeting zzso Furthermore, zzso targeting in combination with zzso resulted in enhanced zzso effects in both in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso 

These results indicate that increased zzso of zzso in zzso patients may be due to increased zzso zzso zzso the addition of zzso targeting strategies may improve treatment responses to zzso zzso
