zzso complexes with zzso zzso and biologically significant zzso (2 and 3) were designed and zzso The structural zzso of complexes 1-3 was done using zzso and zzso zzso in addition, complex 1 was studied by single crystal X-ray zzso zzso The in zzso DNA binding profile of complexes 2 and 3 was carried out by employing different zzso methods to ascertain the feasibility of zzso zzso Further, the zzso ability of 2 and 3 was investigated by the zzso gel zzso mobility zzso with zzso zzso DNA, and demonstrated significantly good zzso zzso Furthermore, both the complexes exhibited significant zzso effects on the zzso activity of human zzso I at lower concentration than standard zzso zzso molecular zzso techniques were used to ascertain the mode and mechanism of action towards the molecular target DNA and zzso zzso The zzso of 2 and 3 against human zzso cancer cells zzso was zzso which revealed significant zzso in zzso cells as compared with the standard zzso The zzso activities of 2 and 3 were tested against human zzso cancer cells zzso and results showed significantly good zzso Additionally, to validate the remarkable zzso activity of complexes 2 and 3, specific regulatory gene expression zzso and zzso was obtained by real time zzso
