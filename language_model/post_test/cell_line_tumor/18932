Gene expression profiling identified zzso zzso zzso zzso an embryonic protein involved in zzso as a signature gene in zzso chronic zzso leukemia zzso To assess the suitability of zzso as a cell surface zzso for targeted therapy of zzso we carried out a comprehensive analysis of zzso protein zzso 

zzso blood zzso cells, zzso and other adult zzso from zzso patients and healthy donors were analyzed zzso and zzso for zzso protein expression by flow zzso cell surface zzso Western zzso and zzso 

zzso protein is selectively expressed on the surface of zzso cells, whereas normal B cells, other normal blood cells, and normal adult zzso do not express cell surface zzso Moreover, cell surface expression of zzso is uniform and zzso zzso independent of zzso zzso independent of biological and clinical zzso of zzso independent of zzso zzso and found at similar levels in all zzso samples zzso The zzso binding capacity of zzso cell surface zzso was determined to be in the range of zzso to zzso molecules per zzso A portion of zzso cell surface zzso was actively zzso upon zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was zzso in zzso of zzso of zzso patients and a similar fraction of healthy donors at zzso below 200 zzso 

The zzso uniform, and zzso cell surface expression of zzso protein in zzso provides a strong incentive for the development of targeted zzso such as zzso zzso
