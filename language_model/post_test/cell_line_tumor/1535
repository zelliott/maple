zzso zzso zzso is a cell zzso zzso responsible for incorporation of the iron bound to zzso through an zzso process from the circulating zzso Iron is believed to play a dual role as an active center of the electron transfer system in zzso and as an zzso zzso through promoted generation of zzso oxygen species in different zzso zzso In this study, we evaluated expression profiles of different genes related to iron zzso across plasma zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was seen for various zzso genes such as zzso in cultured mouse zzso zzso while zzso zzso levels were more than doubled during culture from 3 to zzso In mouse zzso zzso zzso cells endowed to differentiate into zzso and zzso zzso a transient increase was seen in both zzso and corresponding protein for zzso in association with zzso marker expression during culture with zzso zzso acid zzso In zzso zzso cells cultured with zzso moreover, zzso was zzso together with increased expression of both zzso and protein for zzso zzso of zzso significantly decreased the length of zzso zzso however, while significant promotion was invariably seen in the zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso as well as in zzso cells cultured with an iron zzso These results suggest that zzso would be highly expressed by zzso rather than zzso to play a negative role in the zzso outgrowth after the incorporation of circulating zzso in the zzso
