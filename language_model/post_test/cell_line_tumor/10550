Fluorescent derivatives of zzso high affinity zzso zzso 1 zzso were zzso zzso or zzso fluorescent tags were connected through a zzso or zzso zzso in two diverse positions of 1 zzso Good zzso affinities were obtained when the fluorescent tag was linked to zzso nucleus replacing the zzso zzso zzso compound 16 displayed high zzso affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso and optimal fluorescent zzso Its zzso in pancreatic tumor cells was evaluated by flow zzso showing that it partially occurs through zzso In zzso cells, the zzso was higher supporting that zzso receptors are markers of cell proliferation and that the higher the proliferation is, the stronger the zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso of 16 with zzso zzso was studied by zzso zzso the greatest was in zzso zzso and zzso Fluorescent zzso zzso show their potential in clarifying the mechanisms of action of zzso zzso
