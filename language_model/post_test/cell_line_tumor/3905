One zzso within the global zzso 19 zzso is to define zzso 19 gene and protein expression in zzso cancer stem cells zzso zzso 19 is notoriously linked to zzso by zzso zzso and clinical tests are established to detect that specific zzso zzso are zzso cells and are hypothesized to provide a zzso of cells in tumors that can zzso and be zzso to radiation and zzso agents developed for the treatment of zzso In this pilot study, we performed zzso zzso quantitative protein zzso in six zzso lines, and targeted zzso analysis using a zzso zzso zzso in an additional six zzso zzso The data have been deposited to the zzso with zzso zzso Here we present insights into differences in zzso gene and protein zzso including the identification of proteins listed as having no or low evidence at the protein level in the Human zzso Atlas, as correlated to zzso 19 and zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso of proteins downstream of zzso viral integration site 1 zzso in zzso in response to zzso zzso treatment was zzso Taken together, our results may indicate new roles for zzso 19, beyond the zzso zzso in the future of personalized medicine for zzso zzso
