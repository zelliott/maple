zzso and zzso members of the class III zzso zzso zzso family, are expressed on normal zzso cells and have important roles in normal zzso zzso is also a member of the class III zzso zzso zzso family and plays important role in zzso zzso cells, zzso and zzso zzso Recently, internal tandem zzso zzso zzso have been found in the zzso zzso region of zzso zzso expressed by patients with acute zzso leukemia zzso and zzso syndrome zzso The zzso result in the zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso contributing to zzso zzso zzso and zzso are also frequently expressed in zzso and are closely related to zzso Thus, similar zzso zzso could also occur in the zzso and/or zzso gene of patients with zzso To explore this possibility, 13 human zzso cell lines and 44 zzso patient samples were examined by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso for the presence of zzso zzso in the zzso region of the zzso or zzso zzso None of the 13 human zzso cell lines or 44 zzso primary bone zzso samples express zzso in either zzso or zzso in the zzso region that is involved in zzso zzso The 13 cell lines and 44 zzso samples were also examined for the possible zzso of zzso and/or zzso receptors with their respective zzso as we have seen for zzso and its zzso zzso This zzso could contribute to zzso transformation through zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso And zzso cell lines and zzso primary zzso samples exhibit zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso while zzso cell lines and zzso primary zzso samples exhibit zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso were not found, the findings of zzso of zzso and/or zzso with their respective zzso implies these receptors might contribute to zzso in some patients with zzso through zzso zzso or zzso interactive zzso
