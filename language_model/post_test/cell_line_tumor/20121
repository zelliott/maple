To screen and select the zzso zzso from zzso of northern Thailand for fermented zzso soybean meal zzso zzso 

After isolation of zzso zzso from zzso was carried out, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso production by isolated zzso zzso were zzso zzso isolate zzso showed the highest zzso zzso and zzso production at zzso 41 and zzso zzso respectively, while the highest zzso production was found in zzso at zzso zzso zzso produced by single starter and mixed starter of both zzso showed the better properties than those of zzso soybean meal zzso zzso higher in soluble sugar, protein and zzso content, smaller sugar molecules and better zzso and zzso than those of zzso Moreover, zzso had no toxicity effect on mouse zzso cell line zzso but had an zzso effect on lung cancer cell line zzso 

zzso isolate zzso and zzso were selected for zzso production because of their role as nutritional zzso for zzso and their zzso 

The results of this study were useful for zzso production process that can be applied as feed ingredient for zzso zzso
