It is believed that zzso is a terminal zzso and its role is to maintain the length of zzso However, the main zzso zzso of zzso human zzso reverse zzso zzso has been recently proved to have the ability to affect a variety of other genes such as zzso independently of the zzso of zzso To test whether this zzso effect could contribute to additional and immediate zzso in cellular proliferation and zzso three zzso zzso cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and their short-term effects were zzso A very fast growth zzso response to zzso of zzso was observed in all three cell lines with zzso arrest zzso But zzso appeared only in zzso and zzso cells with zzso zzso and elevated zzso In contrast, a decrease in expression of zzso was observed in zzso and cell death appeared to be zzso These results indicated for the first time that zzso of zzso could induce immediate growth arrest in human zzso zzso cells by blocking them in S phase, but zzso may only be induced via zzso effects on zzso of zzso and zzso
