zzso chronic zzso leukemia zzso is characterized by the zzso of zzso B cells that are resistant to zzso as a result of zzso zzso zzso Studies were done to determine the mechanism for the zzso of zzso protein observed in zzso zzso cells compared with zzso B cells from healthy zzso The zzso higher level of zzso protein in zzso cells was positively correlated with a zzso zzso in the zzso level of zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ratios and the rates of zzso zzso zzso in cell extracts indicated that the zzso higher zzso level of zzso zzso in zzso cells was the result of increased zzso zzso zzso zzso was present throughout the nucleus and zzso of zzso cells, whereas in normal B cells zzso was only detected in the zzso The addition of zzso human zzso to extracts of normal B cells markedly slowed the rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells resulted in decreased levels of zzso and protein but no change in zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso in zzso cells is related to stabilization of zzso zzso by zzso
