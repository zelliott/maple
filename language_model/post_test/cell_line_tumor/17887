zzso zzso are one of the many classes of breakdown products of zzso found in zzso such as broccoli and are thought to be partially responsible for the reduced risk of degenerative diseases associated with the consumption of zzso The production of zzso such as zzso is dependent on the zzso zzso of zzso localized both within vegetable zzso and within zzso of the human zzso zzso and is associated with important cancer zzso zzso We hypothesized that novel zzso with enhanced zzso properties relative to zzso could be identified and that their zzso precursors could be zzso From a library of 30 synthetic zzso we identified several with zzso equal or superior to those of zzso The corresponding zzso zzso precursors to these novel zzso were constructed and found to be zzso for zzso By utilizing a novel zzso zzso to monitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were shown to exhibit zzso and zzso zzso respectively, of the relative activity of zzso and produced their corresponding zzso in varying zzso These data support the notion that zzso zzso can act as zzso for novel zzso with a mechanism of action zzso on their zzso zzso by zzso Such zzso zzso may serve as very economical zzso agents for individuals at risk for zzso of and around the zzso zzso
