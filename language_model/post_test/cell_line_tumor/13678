The ability of cells to acquire resistance to multiple zzso namely zzso resistance zzso is often zzso by the zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso cassette (ABC) zzso for example zzso zzso or zzso breast cancer resistance protein zzso or zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso pump drug molecules out of cells against a concentration zzso reducing their zzso zzso The ability of zzso zzso to inhibit zzso as well as the cellular pathways involved in the zzso has been extensively zzso This work investigated for the first time the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso block zzso zzso on the levels of zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso in a human zzso cell line zzso zzso with a broad range of molecular weights and zzso balances were zzso zzso confirmed the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene was not zzso These findings further support the versatility of these zzso and zzso zzso to overcome drug resistance in cancer and infectious zzso
