We report zzso an unprecedented zzso green synthesis of gold zzso zzso using naturally occurring Korean red zzso root zzso zzso zzso zzso without any special zzso zzso The zzso generated through this zzso process did not zzso suggesting that the zzso present in them serve as excellent zzso on the zzso and thus, provide robust shielding from zzso The zzso zzso exhibit remarkable in zzso stability in various buffers zzso zzso zzso zzso sodium zzso and a host of pH zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso on the zzso rendered them nontoxic as demonstrated through detailed zzso zzso using zzso counting zzso performed on normal cervical cells zzso The present study opens up a new possibility of zzso zzso zzso using natural products which will be useful in zzso and biomedical zzso
