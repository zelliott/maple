Patients presenting with diffuse large B cell zzso zzso are treated with a standard zzso zzso mixture consisting of zzso zzso zzso and prednisone zzso Half of zzso patients will develop zzso tumors due to the emergence of zzso zzso zzso We isolated zzso cells that were resistant to zzso as a model system to investigate the molecular basis of zzso zzso zzso cells emerged from zzso zzso populations after repeated cycles of zzso exposure to zzso increased zzso of zzso A zzso analysis of zzso and zzso zzso cells identified the zzso zzso of the zzso family as a zzso expressed zzso zzso cells showed reduced expression of zzso protein in the presence of high-dose zzso relative to control zzso In contrast, zzso cells expressed markedly higher levels of zzso regardless the presence of high-dose zzso Because zzso is known to exert zzso influences and zzso in zzso zzso and prostate zzso we hypothesized that zzso promotes survival of zzso cells in zzso In support of our hypothesis, zzso of zzso by small interfering zzso restored the sensitivity of resistant zzso to zzso zzso In addition, zzso expression was highly zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso relative to a normal zzso zzso by Western zzso zzso Furthermore, more than half of 35 zzso zzso showed elevated zzso expression relative to normal zzso tissue by zzso zzso Our study implicates zzso in the zzso of zzso and suggests a promising combination strategy with a zzso inhibitor for the treatment of zzso zzso
