zzso play a central role in prostate development and prostate cancer zzso zzso of zzso is an early event in prostate zzso and is considered as a marker for both primary tumors and zzso Interestingly, several reports suggest that zzso activity is regulated by zzso in zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of the human zzso reverse zzso zzso and zzso activity via zzso of zzso promoter activity in the presence of zzso zzso zzso However, pure zzso zzso failed to repress zzso zzso The zzso repression of zzso is zzso in a human prostate cancer cell line exhibiting zzso growth, which expresses a zzso zzso zzso frequently occurring in prostate zzso We reveal that this single zzso acid exchange is sufficient for the lack of zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso data suggest that, in contrast to the zzso zzso the zzso zzso is recruited less efficiently to the zzso promoter in zzso indicating that loss of zzso results from reduced zzso zzso Thus, our findings suggest that the zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso which is indicative of a protective zzso whereas the zzso zzso of zzso not only zzso the zzso spectrum of the zzso but abrogates this zzso mechanism in prostate cancer zzso This novel role of zzso zzso in prostate cancer development suggests the benefit to a search for new zzso zzso that inhibit zzso but allow zzso
