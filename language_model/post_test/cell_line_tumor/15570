zzso expression of the desired gene product in the target tissue is central to the concept of gene zzso One approach is to use a zzso promoter to drive therapeutic zzso To investigate the feasibility of zzso gene therapy for zzso cancer using the mouse zzso II zzso promoter and its zzso control, the efficacy of this promoter as well as fragments in regulating gene expression were zzso and zzso analyzed in zzso and zzso tissue cell lines using DNA zzso Our results demonstrate that the mouse zzso promoter actively drives gene expression in zzso a zzso cancer cell zzso Little promoter activity was detected in the zzso tissue cell zzso Furthermore, deleting the zzso end zzso zzso of the zzso promoter by zzso the activity was significantly decreased but was zzso However, deleting the 3' end zzso of the zzso promoter, the activity was hardly detected in any tissue cell zzso The activity of the 3' end zzso of the zzso promoter was detected in both zzso cancer and stomach cancer cell zzso These data demonstrate that the mouse zzso promoter has a high activity in human zzso cells and a low zzso activity in human zzso zzso This suggests that targeting the gene expression of the mouse zzso promoter could be used to treat human zzso zzso The zzso was contained in the region of the zzso zzso of the zzso end of the mouse zzso zzso The core promoter was located in the region of the 143 zzso of the 3' zzso
