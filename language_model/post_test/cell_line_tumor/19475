The zzso adapter protein is an zzso zzso zzso containing signaling intermediate operating downstream of several zzso zzso zzso including vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso is zzso and zzso is one response that zzso zzso zzso of zzso can be used in cancer therapy, and one way to achieve this is by inducing zzso cell zzso The zzso cell line zzso is of zzso origin and can be used as a tool for studying in zzso zzso of zzso and we thus employed an zzso strategy using an zzso zzso system to reduce zzso levels in zzso cells and to study their zzso zzso zzso increases the zzso of zzso cells to the zzso agents, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso causes reduced focal zzso zzso zzso zzso monitored as zzso of the regulatory zzso zzso zzso No zzso effects on zzso or zzso zzso zzso activity were zzso The altered zzso activity coincided with an zzso cell zzso that was particularly noticeable in the presence of zzso In order to relate the effects of zzso zzso to in zzso zzso cells were exposed to the zzso inhibitor zzso and again the cells with reduced zzso content exhibited increased zzso zzso growth in zzso was strongly reduced in the zzso cells upon zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso regulates zzso and cell shape in tumor zzso cells via zzso and that zzso is a potential target for zzso of zzso
