The zzso domain of human zzso X zzso zzso is highly zzso and flexible, allowing zzso in accepting structurally diverse zzso However, little information is available regarding the critical zzso of compounds involved in the zzso of zzso The aim of this study was to determine the zzso relationships for zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Most of the zzso studied zzso zzso zzso zzso activated zzso However, zzso which has a low zzso zzso at the zzso and zzso which has no zzso zzso at the zzso did not activate zzso zzso a zzso zzso at the zzso and a zzso zzso being sufficiently separated from the zzso are responsible for zzso of zzso by zzso In the case of zzso only zzso and zzso which have an zzso at the zzso strongly activated zzso at 300 zzso zzso and zzso which contain a zzso or zzso group at both zzso and zzso also activated zzso whereas zzso did not activate the zzso These results suggest that the presence of an zzso at the zzso and the presence of bulky and zzso zzso at both zzso and zzso are important factors for zzso of zzso by zzso In the case of zzso zzso zzso but not zzso showed significant zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso might increase the zzso and enhance the zzso of zzso These findings suggest that zzso of the zzso and adequate distance between the zzso zzso and the zzso group are important for zzso zzso
