zzso agents zzso constitute the backbone of treatment for most human zzso Here we used the National Cancer Institute zzso Cell Line Panel (the zzso to identify zzso of cancer cell response to zzso I zzso zzso a widely used class of zzso We assessed the zzso zzso using zzso Human zzso zzso ST zzso and correlated the in zzso activity of four zzso zzso with gene expression in the 60 cell zzso A single zzso zzso zzso showed an extremely significant positive correlation with the response not only to zzso zzso but also to zzso zzso zzso agents, and DNA synthesis zzso Using cells with zzso high and low zzso expression and zzso zzso we show that zzso is zzso in determining cell death and cell cycle arrest in response to zzso in cancer cells from different zzso of zzso We next analyzed zzso expression in zzso and zzso zzso and normal corresponding zzso from The Cancer Genome zzso database and observed that zzso has a wide expression zzso We also observed that high zzso expression independently predicts overall survival in a group of zzso cancer patients treated with zzso zzso We conclude that zzso expression is zzso associated with the activity of zzso in cancer cells, has a broad expression range in colon and zzso zzso and may behave as a zzso for prediction of response to zzso in the clinical zzso
