zzso A, an inhibitor of electron transport in zzso has been used as zzso oxygen species zzso generator in the biological zzso Here, we investigated the in zzso effect of zzso A on zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso A efficiently induced zzso in zzso cells as evidenced by flow zzso detection of zzso DNA content, zzso V binding zzso and zzso zzso This zzso process was accompanied by loss of zzso zzso potential zzso zzso decrease, zzso zzso and zzso zzso All of zzso zzso tested in this experiment failed to rescue zzso cells from zzso zzso cell death at the time of 48 h in view of zzso cells and zzso V positive zzso zzso However, with regard to the zzso membrane potential zzso pan zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso inhibitor zzso at the concentration of 25 zzso noticeably decreased the loss of zzso membrane potential zzso in zzso zzso zzso Taken together, we have demonstrated that zzso A as an inhibitor of electron transport in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso
