The exact cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in melanoma zzso remain zzso Previous gene expression profiling analyses performed upon zzso and human melanoma samples identified zzso as one of the most frequently zzso zzso Here we further showed that zzso readily express zzso but expression is reduced or completely lost in zzso of the zzso melanoma cell lines and tissue samples zzso Furthermore, we show that promoter zzso accounts for the zzso of the zzso gene in zzso of the melanoma cell lines zzso The zzso of zzso in two zzso melanoma cell lines, zzso and zzso resulted in a significant delay of tumor growth in a zzso zzso model, despite a zzso difference in tumor cell growth in zzso Gene expression zzso analysis and further expression validation suggests that the zzso zzso gene is zzso in zzso zzso cell lines, suggesting that the tumor zzso function of zzso may be partially a result of zzso zzso gene zzso which is known to be a potent inhibitor of the zzso signaling zzso
