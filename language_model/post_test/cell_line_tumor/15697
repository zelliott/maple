zzso zzso tumors zzso are zzso tumors that account for about zzso of gastric zzso zzso zzso are zzso proteins associated with zzso and known to be coded by 10 functional zzso zzso This study evaluated zzso zzso and protein expression in zzso and compared the expression levels with gastric zzso An zzso study of zzso protein expression was performed in 15 zzso zzso located in the zzso and 38 early stage gastric zzso The percentage of cells stained and intensity of zzso were zzso zzso zzso expression was investigated in 6 zzso and 6 early stage gastric zzso zzso All zzso displayed positive nuclear zzso with most zzso having predominantly mildly stained zzso zzso On the other hand, 37 out of 38 gastric zzso cases were positively stained for nuclear zzso with 24 cases zzso exhibiting predominantly mild nuclear zzso 7 cases zzso moderate nuclear zzso and 6 cases zzso strong nuclear zzso Nuclear zzso expression was found to be significantly lower in zzso samples when compared with gastric zzso zzso based on the percentage stained and zzso zzso We then established that the zzso gene transcript was the most abundant zzso zzso in zzso gastric cancer cells and analyzed its expression in zzso and gastric zzso zzso We found that zzso had significantly lower zzso zzso levels than gastric zzso zzso Lower zzso gene expression and nuclear zzso protein expression in zzso when compared with gastric zzso may reflect their different underlying biology and divergent zzso
