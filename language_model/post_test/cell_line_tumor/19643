To assess the efficacy of self versus zzso zzso vaccines, the zzso to human and rat zzso zzso and zzso zzso DNA vaccines were tested in normal, zzso or zzso transgenic zzso When zzso with either zzso or zzso DNA, normal zzso and zzso mice produced zzso T cells, but only zzso specific zzso In zzso zzso mice, weak to no zzso response was induced by either self zzso or zzso zzso DNA, demonstrating profound tolerance to zzso and the inability to induce zzso immunity with either zzso In zzso mice, vaccination with self zzso but not zzso zzso DNA induced zzso zzso and delayed spontaneous zzso Both zzso and zzso DNA induced zzso T cell response, but depletion of zzso T cells did not change the delay in zzso zzso in zzso mice, both self and zzso DNA activated zzso T cells, although T cell response did not reach sufficient level to suppress spontaneous zzso Rather, induction of zzso zzso by self zzso DNA is associated with the delay in spontaneous tumor zzso Overall, zzso mice were more responsive to DNA vaccination than zzso zzso mice and this may be associated with the continuous production of zzso by the 10 zzso zzso undergoing tumor zzso
