Patients with zzso breast cancer zzso - defined by lack of zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression as well as lack of human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso amplification - have a poor zzso There is a need for targeted therapies to treat this zzso zzso frequently harbor zzso in zzso resulting in loss of the zzso checkpoint and reliance on checkpoint zzso 1 zzso to arrest cells in response to DNA zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso of zzso in a zzso background results in zzso zzso in response to DNA zzso We therefore tested whether zzso of zzso could zzso the zzso of the DNA damaging agent zzso in zzso using zzso tumor zzso zzso specimens from patients with zzso were zzso into humanized zzso fat pads of zzso mice to create 3 independent zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso and 2 zzso for zzso zzso and zzso These lines were tested for their response to zzso and a zzso inhibitor zzso zzso or zzso either as single agents or in zzso The combination therapy induced checkpoint bypass and zzso in zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso Moreover, combination therapy inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival of mice bearing the zzso line, but not the zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso zzso zzso tumors to the combination zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is a major zzso of how zzso respond to therapies that combine DNA damage with zzso zzso
