zzso the most used oral zzso drug for the treatment of type 2 zzso zzso has proved encouraging results when used in the treatment of various types of cancer such as zzso breast zzso Despite compelling evidence of a role of zzso as an zzso drug, the mechanisms by which zzso exerts its zzso actions are not fully understood zzso zzso we tried to bring new insights by analyzing the zzso effect of zzso for zzso zzso zzso cells treated with conventional combination zzso 

Cancer zzso cells zzso isolated from a zzso zzso biopsy were treated with zzso zzso chemotherapy regimen and the combination of these two zzso zzso of zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso and proliferation rates were determined, apart from the zzso zzso and zzso determination by chip flow zzso 

zzso alone and especially zzso in association with zzso increases zzso stress within the cells by increasing the levels of zzso zzso as well as decreasing the levels of reduced zzso The zzso cell proliferation zzso showed decreased zzso rates for the arm treated with zzso and with the combination of drugs in comparison with the control arm, proving high correlation with the zzso stress zzso The zzso zzso and determination of zzso by chip flow zzso confirmed the results obtained in the previous zzso 

zzso could be used in chemotherapy treatments to induce zzso oxygen species and increase the zzso effects within the tumor zzso Still, further experiments must be carried out on zzso models before we can move on and use this drugs in the zzso setting for zzso primary liver zzso
