A major challenge in cancer chemotherapy has been developing safe and clinically zzso zzso zzso With its low toxicity profile, zzso zzso a naturally occurring zzso derived from the zzso of zzso zzso has great zzso In zzso and in zzso zzso studies have shown its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The multiple mechanisms of the zzso effect of zzso zzso include zzso the expression of gene products such as nuclear zzso growth suppression, inducing zzso and modulating various signal zzso pathways and the expression of many zzso The mechanisms underlying the zzso activity of zzso have not, however, been completely zzso 

An zzso zzso chip was developed and used to profile zzso zzso expressions in pancreatic cells treated with zzso zzso with regulated expression patterns on the zzso were validated by real-time zzso Additionally, potential zzso targets were analyzed zzso and confirmed with flow zzso zzso 

zzso alters zzso expression in human pancreatic cells, zzso zzso and zzso zzso as confirmed by zzso real-time zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso or by zzso with zzso zzso in the zzso pancreatic cancer cell line suppressed expression of its target genes zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso while zzso zzso with zzso enhanced zzso and zzso zzso 

These observations suggest that zzso of zzso expression may be an important mechanism underlying the biological effects of zzso
