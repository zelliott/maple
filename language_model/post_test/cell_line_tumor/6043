zzso zzso is a zzso and zzso linear zzso which is of interest for tumor targeting through cell surface zzso zzso zzso binds with high affinity to zzso zzso which are zzso in many tumors and involved in cancer zzso In the present study, we investigated the impact of zzso molecular weight zzso zzso density, and zzso zzso density on zzso of zzso zzso zzso by cancer zzso Additionally, the zzso zzso of the zzso was zzso zzso of different zzso zzso zzso zzso and 1600 zzso were zzso to zzso with varying degrees of zzso zzso zzso surface density was zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso Cellular zzso and zzso zzso of zzso were evaluated by flow zzso and zzso zzso Mean particle sizes of zzso ranged from 120 to 180 zzso and increased with increasing size of zzso zzso zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso density, and zzso zzso density and exceeded that obtained with zzso plain zzso zzso were taken up into cells via zzso zzso zzso which is both zzso and zzso Once within cells, zzso localized primarily to zzso and zzso The results demonstrate that cellular targeting efficiency of zzso depends strongly upon zzso zzso zzso density, and cell surface zzso zzso zzso The results support a role of zzso for targeted drug zzso
