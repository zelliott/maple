The development of functional zzso that can enhance the cellular delivery of a variety of zzso acid agents is important in many biomedical applications such as zzso zzso We report the synthesis of large pore zzso zzso zzso zzso loaded with iron oxide and zzso modified by zzso zzso zzso as carriers for gene zzso The zzso have a particle size of zzso and a large pore size of zzso The large pore size is essential for the formation of large iron oxide zzso to increase the magnetic properties and the zzso capacity of zzso zzso The magnetic property zzso the cellular zzso of zzso under an external magnetic zzso zzso is zzso grafted on the zzso surface to enhance the zzso affinity against zzso molecules and to improve gene zzso zzso The zzso delivered zzso effectively into zzso cancer cells, leading to cell viability zzso of zzso higher compared to the 50% reduction when the same dose of zzso was delivered by a commercial product, zzso
