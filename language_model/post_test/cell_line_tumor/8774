Multiple myeloma zzso the second most common zzso zzso remains an incurable plasma cell zzso zzso While the zzso zzso zzso zzso has increased patient survival, resistance represents a major treatment obstacle as most patients ultimately zzso becoming zzso to additional zzso zzso Current tests fail to detect emerging zzso by the time patients acquire resistance, their prognosis is often zzso To establish zzso signatures that predict zzso sensitivity, we zzso zzso and zzso cell lines derived from tumors of the zzso mouse model of PC zzso We identified significantly reduced expression of two markers zzso zzso in zzso zzso resistant zzso Using this zzso signature, we isolated a zzso of cells from a zzso zzso culture that displayed zzso resistance to zzso Although these genes were identified as zzso they may indicate a mechanism for zzso through the loss of PC maturation which may be induced and/or selected by zzso zzso induction of PC maturation in both zzso and zzso resistant cells restored zzso sensitivity suggesting a novel therapeutic approach for reversing zzso resistance in zzso zzso
