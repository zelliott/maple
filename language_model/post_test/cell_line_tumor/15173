zzso is significantly zzso in many zzso However, its expression and biological role in gastric cancer remain poorly zzso We investigated zzso zzso expression in gastric cancer and determined its effects on cancer cell behavior and its clinical significance in the development and progression of gastric zzso 

We determined zzso expression in gastric tumors and gastric cancer cell lines by reverse zzso chain zzso The effects of zzso on cell clone formation, migration, and invasion of zzso and zzso cells were detected following zzso of an zzso zzso zzso expression in a zzso gastric cancer zzso was determined by in zzso zzso and its role in progression and prognosis was zzso 

zzso was zzso in gastric tumor zzso and cell zzso zzso of zzso significantly inhibited cell clone formation, migration, and invasion of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in primary gastric cancer zzso was associated with tumor size, invasion depth, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso correlated with zzso stage and zzso suggesting that zzso is involved in cellular clone formation, migration, and invasion in zzso and may play an important role in the clinical progression and prognosis of gastric zzso
