zzso deprivation zzso cell proliferation more strong in cancer than in normal zzso thus, it has been proposed that such an effect could be exploited for cancer zzso We have compared the effect of zzso deprivation on normal and cancer cells, studying growth rate, zzso and protein expression patterns in immortalized human zzso cells and in zzso zzso zzso deprivation forces zzso cells into irreversible zzso while the vast majority of zzso cells become zzso and resume normal growth following zzso zzso zzso deprivation induced a significant burst of zzso in both cell lines that were zzso in zzso and irreversible in zzso zzso In the latter cells, zzso increase was accompanied by a zzso increase of zzso Similar effects could be obtained by treating both cell types with zzso but not with zzso drugs that interfere specifically but differently with the major pathways of zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso in zzso synthesis is the main consequence of zzso zzso
