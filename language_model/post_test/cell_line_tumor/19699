We describe a new approach to investigate zzso in the human zzso mismatch repair zzso zzso This is based on zzso of the zzso of a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso cells by zzso of zzso zzso altered zzso zzso zzso of resistance zzso to zzso agents, zzso rate at zzso zzso instability zzso and zzso levels of DNA zzso were used to define the zzso status of zzso zzso The approach was validated by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso bearing two previously identified zzso zzso and zzso and two with confirmed zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso syndrome zzso zzso and zzso A low-level expression of two zzso zzso partially reversed zzso tolerance and the zzso zzso including zzso Higher levels of zzso resulted in full restoration of these properties to zzso Increased expression of zzso did not fully complement the zzso zzso because there was a simultaneous escalation in the level of zzso DNA zzso The findings confirmed the important relationship between deficient zzso and increased levels of zzso DNA zzso zzso from Italian zzso families zzso zzso zzso and zzso were all ineffective at reversing the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso One zzso was identified as a low zzso zzso based on clinical and genetic zzso
