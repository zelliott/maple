The zzso interference effect is an alternative to zzso DNA as an experimental method of zzso a specific target zzso Although the zzso interference effect, which is zzso by small interfering zzso zzso or zzso has potential application to human therapy, the zzso method usually used for rapid administration of zzso is zzso for use in zzso In this study, we have investigated the zzso activity of a synthetic zzso zzso which is sequence specific for the human zzso zzso zzso with a novel zzso zzso zzso 

In a mouse model of liver zzso we administered zzso by zzso intravenous injection, adjusting the rate and volume of administration to what is feasible in human zzso In a mouse model bearing prostate cancer in which the cells were zzso under the skin, zzso was administered zzso around the zzso 

The zzso complex inhibited the expression of zzso protein and the growth of tumor cell lines in zzso in a zzso manner in the concentration range of 3 to 100 zzso Furthermore, the complex had a strong zzso activity when administered zzso in the mouse model of liver zzso zzso zzso was shown to be delivered to tumor cells in the mouse liver, but only when zzso with zzso The complex also inhibited tumor cell growth in the mouse model bearing prostate zzso 

By combining zzso with our zzso zzso we overcame the difficulty of administering zzso to animals in ways that can be applied in human zzso Although our zzso complex is not yet in clinical trials, it is expected to provide a novel zzso therapy for cancer zzso
