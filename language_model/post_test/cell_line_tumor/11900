zzso is zzso produced by many zzso cell lung zzso zzso and its zzso effects have been linked to altered immune responses in lung zzso We asked whether elevated levels of plasma zzso correlated with zzso zzso production in the zzso zzso Looking for correlation in zzso patient blood we zzso plasma from zzso patients for zzso and zzso we further evaluated production of zzso by adherent zzso cells from a subset of these patients looking for an altered zzso zzso 

Our initial in zzso experiments show that zzso zzso induction zzso with tumor cell zzso production, confirming similar reports in the zzso Data show plasma zzso levels in 38 zzso patients are elevated compared to normal zzso Plasma zzso levels were not significantly zzso however, adherent zzso derived from zzso patient blood did produce significantly more zzso in 24 zzso primary culture than those from normal controls zzso zzso zzso The association of elevated plasma zzso and zzso derived zzso was not zzso 

zzso plasma zzso and zzso zzso production are associated with zzso The biological significance to elevated zzso levels in zzso are zzso Further investigation of each as a zzso marker for zzso tumor is zzso
