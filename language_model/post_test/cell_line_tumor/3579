Although the usefulness of the zzso peptides known as zzso has been suggested against oral and skin infections, possible adverse effects of the zzso on the host should be understood before clinical applications can be zzso 

In the present study, we investigated how zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso affect cells including primary zzso cells, zzso and zzso cell zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso 

Cell proliferation was assessed by the direct cell counting and zzso zzso 

We found that zzso promotes proliferation of the zzso cells at low concentration but has a zzso effect at high zzso In contrast, zzso have little effect on these cells at any zzso suggesting that zzso may have no adverse effects on the zzso 

zzso in terms of host response zzso may be more suitable zzso agents for clinical applications than zzso
