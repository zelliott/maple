zzso zzso zzso factor zzso is a novel type of zzso zzso Recent studies indicate that the zzso gene is induced in response to zzso zzso zzso stress through zzso stress response element II zzso in its zzso zzso In this study, we evaluated the roles of six zzso stress response zzso factors in the regulation of the promoter activities of the mouse zzso gene via zzso using various types of zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso Treatment with zzso zzso induced zzso zzso generation in parallel with the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso Of the six zzso factors, zzso most strongly increased the zzso promoter activity via zzso while the effects of zzso and zzso were zzso However, zzso of zzso or zzso did not enhance zzso zzso promoter activity in zzso zzso To evaluate the relationships between zzso factors in the regulation of zzso zzso promoter activity, we zzso two effective zzso factor zzso chosen from zzso zzso zzso and zzso into zzso cells with the zzso reporter zzso The zzso promoter activity induced by zzso of zzso with zzso was significantly lower than that induced by zzso alone, while other combinations did not show any effect on the zzso zzso promoter activity in zzso zzso Our study is the first to show the efficiency of zzso stress-related zzso factors for zzso in zzso the zzso of the mouse zzso gene in zzso zzso
