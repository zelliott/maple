Cell invasion through the zzso zzso zzso of zzso tissue is an important zzso process, which plays a prominent role in tumor zzso The zzso of tumors depends mainly on the capacity of cancer cells to migrate and zzso A prerequisite for zzso is the invasion of cancer cells through zzso tissue to targeted zzso Cellular zzso and zzso zzso dynamics have been proposed to affect the zzso of cancer zzso Here, this study investigated whether highly invasive cancer cells are capable of invading into dense zzso with an average zzso of zzso or zzso zzso when zzso beads zzso and zzso zzso zzso increased their cellular zzso and reduced their zzso zzso dynamics compared to zzso invasive cancer zzso The zzso beads decreased the zzso of the zzso cancer cells into zzso whereas the zzso of the zzso cancer cells was not zzso The effect of zzso beads on the highly invasive zzso cells was abolished by specific zzso of the zzso zzso zzso or addition of an zzso zzso blocking zzso Furthermore, the reduction of zzso forces using zzso and ROCK zzso abolished the effect of zzso beads on the zzso of zzso zzso In addition, the cellular zzso of zzso cells was increased after zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso did not alter the zzso of zzso zzso Taken together, the zzso zzso dependent zzso was reduced after zzso zzso by altered zzso properties, suggesting that the zzso cells need an appropriate intermediate cellular zzso to overcome the zzso hindrance of zzso whereas the zzso cells were not affected by zzso zzso
