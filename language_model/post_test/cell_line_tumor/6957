The zzso gene encodes the key zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso eliminate total body zzso production and are highly effective zzso for zzso breast zzso A zzso promoter zzso regulates low levels of zzso expression in zzso breast zzso zzso Two zzso promoters zzso zzso induce in zzso zzso expression in breast zzso surrounding zzso zzso Treatment of breast zzso with medium zzso with zzso breast zzso cells zzso or a surrogate hormonal mixture zzso zzso plus zzso zzso zzso zzso promoters zzso The mechanism of zzso zzso however, is not zzso Here we reported that sodium zzso profoundly decreased zzso or zzso + zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso or sodium zzso regulated zzso zzso or activity only via promoters zzso but not promoters zzso or zzso in breast, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso recruitment of zzso zzso by a zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso by zzso or zzso + zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicated that zzso or zzso + zzso stabilized a complex composed of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso protein in the common regulatory region of promoters zzso Overall, zzso zzso patterns of promoters zzso did not correlate with sodium zzso zzso of promoters zzso zzso zzso however, consistently disrupted the zzso complex composed of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This was zzso in part, by decreased zzso zzso Together, these findings represent a novel mechanism of sodium zzso action and provide evidence that zzso activity can be zzso in a signaling zzso and zzso zzso
