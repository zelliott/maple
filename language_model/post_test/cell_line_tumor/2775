zzso sodium channels zzso are functionally expressed in highly zzso cancer cells derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso breast cancer cells express functional sodium channel complexes, consisting of zzso and associated auxiliary zzso that are responsible for a sustained inward sodium current at the membrane zzso Although these channels do not regulate cellular zzso or migration, their zzso by the specific blocker zzso zzso both the zzso zzso activity zzso with zzso and cell zzso leading to the zzso of colony growth and cell spreading in three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso cells express functional zzso zzso which we found play a zzso role ( approximately zzso in cancer zzso zzso invasion is significantly decreased in the presence of specific zzso of zzso B and S zzso and zzso respectively), and zzso of zzso does not further reduce cell zzso This suggests that zzso B and S are involved in zzso and that their zzso activity partly depends on zzso zzso zzso zzso has no consequence for zzso at the transcription, translation, and zzso zzso However, zzso activity leads to an zzso zzso and a zzso zzso favorable for the zzso activity of these zzso zzso We propose that zzso enhance the zzso of cancer cells by favoring the zzso activity of zzso zzso This general mechanism could lead to the identification of new targets allowing the therapeutic prevention of zzso
