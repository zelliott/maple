zzso generated using zzso zzso zzso ultrasound and other methods, is often zzso as an zzso technique to zzso cancer zzso to radiation therapy and zzso In the current research, zzso zzso efficacy in zzso with chemotherapy was investigated in the presence and absence of gold zzso zzso 

zzso cell line derived from human zzso zzso was used in the zzso Various experiments were performed on the cells in the presence of zzso and zzso with zzso zzso All required control groups were also zzso The in zzso experiments were conducted for zzso of 20 and 40 zzso each at two zzso of zzso and zzso zzso After 48 hours, zzso zzso was performed in order to evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic parameters on cell zzso 

In groups with zzso cells, the cell survival was more than zzso After chemotherapy, survival was determined as zzso and zzso with and without 40 zzso zzso zzso Following the combined treatment of zzso and chemotherapy, survival declined to zzso and zzso in the presence of 20 and 40 zzso zzso zzso zzso of 40 zzso diameter and zzso zzso concentration showed the highest synergistic effect on zzso zzso combination of zzso zzso and chemotherapy, and chemotherapy, zzso zzso with 40 zzso zzso had a higher cell destruction rate in comparison to chemotherapy zzso 

Although no zzso was observed from zzso incubation alone, their presence along with zzso led to a decrease in survival rate, such that the lethal effects of zzso zzso with zzso were comparable with that of zzso All combined treatments in the presence of 40 zzso zzso produced a higher efficiency in comparison to similar groups without zzso and with 20 zzso zzso
