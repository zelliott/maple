Brain tumors are highly zzso zzso The cell zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso in zzso and activated zzso cells and plays an important role in brain tumor growth, spread and zzso zzso labeled zzso zzso may therefore be useful for imaging brain tumor associated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was labeled with zzso via zzso through the zzso zzso group of the zzso zzso The zzso was evaluated in zzso for its tumor targeting efficacy and zzso in zzso implanted zzso and zzso implanted zzso zzso nude mouse models by means of zzso quantitative zzso and direct tissue zzso The zzso zzso was produced in less than 2 h with zzso zzso yields and specific activity of 230 zzso at end of zzso The zzso showed very rapid blood clearance and both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio at 30 zzso was approximately 5 in the subcutaneous zzso tumor zzso zzso imaging with the zzso zzso brain tumor model revealed very high zzso ratio, with virtually no zzso in the normal zzso zzso blocking of tumor zzso of zzso in the presence of excess amount of zzso revealed zzso specific activity zzso zzso zzso labeled zzso zzso zzso zzso is a potential zzso for imaging zzso positive tumors in brain and other zzso zzso
