zzso continue to carry poor zzso for patients despite advances in zzso zzso and radiation zzso One feature of zzso associated with poor prognosis is the degree of zzso and expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression allows zzso adaptation to low oxygen zzso partly through zzso of zzso and increased tumor zzso Here, we demonstrate an induced level of zzso zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso zzso has the capacity to promote zzso growth and zzso with zzso in zzso zzso In addition, zzso was recently demonstrated to serve as an zzso and can induce zzso in zzso zzso from in zzso studies show that hypoxic induction of zzso is dependent on zzso stabilization during zzso and that zzso zzso abrogates zzso induction during zzso through loss of zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso is induced by zzso deprivation and that prevention of zzso zzso oxygen species zzso production prevents this zzso Additionally, zzso zzso results in increased zzso production and increased zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso prevents zzso production and decreases zzso zzso zzso indicating that zzso induction is necessary for cells to survive this type of cell zzso These observations link zzso zzso in zzso with zzso and zzso zzso and targeting these zzso pathways may lead to therapeutic advances in the treatment of zzso in the zzso
