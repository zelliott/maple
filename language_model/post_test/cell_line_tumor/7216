zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso complex, has an important role in the zzso of nuclear zzso zzso a key regulator of normal and tumor cell zzso zzso and response to zzso However, little is known about the zzso regulation of the zzso gene zzso The present study revealed that the zzso induction of the zzso gene is positively regulated by binding zzso the protein product of the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso of zzso is zzso regulated by zzso binding to zzso By analyzing the zzso DNA zzso we identified the putative zzso promoter sequence in the zzso untranslated region of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso an acute zzso leukemia zzso cell line, with plasmids containing the zzso zzso region sequence upstream of the zzso reporter showed that this region possessed major promoter zzso zzso or enforced zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein expression as well as zzso promoter zzso zzso and zzso analyses as well as zzso zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso indicated that zzso binds to the core zzso promoter and strongly zzso its zzso Although zzso does not directly bind to the zzso promoter, it physically interacts with zzso and specifically zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso region of the zzso gene contains a functional promoter zzso regulated by zzso and zzso Furthermore, loss of zzso control over zzso zzso of zzso may represent a novel zzso for the zzso zzso of zzso gene expression and therapy resistance in zzso
