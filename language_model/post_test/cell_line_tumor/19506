It is important to overcome gene therapy resistance caused by zzso in zzso cell lung cancer zzso zzso The zzso family member zzso is a zzso zzso This study was to observe the zzso and zzso effect of zzso human lung zzso cell line zzso following zzso zzso gene zzso alone or combined with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso or zzso were zzso into zzso cells with zzso Positive cell clones were selected using zzso The zzso zzso or zzso gene expressions were examined by Western zzso zzso zzso was used to analyze the response of zzso cells to zzso zzso or zzso zzso The drug-induced zzso of zzso cells was measured by flow zzso zzso technique and DNA zzso The biological behavior change of zzso cells was investigated by colony formation zzso 

zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso or zzso Low concentration of zzso agents zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso which had no obvious effects on zzso cells, suppressed zzso cell growth zzso the 50% zzso concentration zzso of zzso for zzso cells decreased from zzso zzso to zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso decreased from zzso zzso to zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso and zzso zzso zzso rate was increased from zzso to zzso ( zzso zzso zzso rate was increased from zzso to zzso ( zzso after zzso zzso zzso and zzso significantly suppressed colony formation of zzso cells compared with parental cells ( zzso The sensitive enhancement ratios for zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso gene enhances the sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso agents by inducing zzso through zzso zzso zzso gene could be used to treat zzso zzso
