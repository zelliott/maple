The zzso nature ascribed to the zzso zzso relies mostly on zzso of zzso that act as zzso zzso Nevertheless, zzso effects can also result from zzso DNA repair mechanisms following zzso In this study, we addressed the possibility that zzso plays a role in the cellular response to zzso damage, an issue that has never been addressed zzso We found that in zzso cells, zzso expression and activity increased upon exposure to zzso radiation zzso zzso and zzso cells were significantly more sensitive to zzso zzso zzso of zzso accelerated removal of zzso DNA zzso over time, reduced zzso zzso in damaged cells, and rendered these cells significantly more viable following zzso zzso The protective effect of zzso was zzso by increased zzso and activated zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced the protective effect of zzso whereas zzso zzso activity zzso this protective effect, irrespective of zzso zzso The results obtained in this study place zzso upstream to zzso and zzso in the zzso DNA damage zzso
