Human prostate tumor vaccine and gene therapy trials using ex zzso methods to prime zzso cells zzso with prostate specific membrane zzso zzso have been somewhat successful, but to date the lengthy ex zzso manipulation of zzso has limited the widespread clinical utility of this zzso Our goal was to improve upon cancer vaccination with tumor zzso by delivering zzso via a zzso zzso zzso directly to zzso as an efficient means for zzso and zzso presentation to zzso To test this approach, we developed a mouse model of prostate cancer by generating zzso derivatives of the mouse zzso prostate cancer cell line expressing human zzso zzso zzso To maximize zzso presentation in target cells, both zzso class I and TAP protein expression was induced in zzso cells by zzso with an Ad zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso infected ex zzso with zzso zzso as well as direct zzso injection of the zzso resulted in high levels of zzso zzso responses against zzso cells zzso with zzso as target zzso zzso targeting significantly improved the therapeutic zzso efficacy of zzso zzso zzso when combined with zzso in the zzso zzso These results suggest that a zzso zzso delivering zzso may be effective clinically for prostate cancer zzso
