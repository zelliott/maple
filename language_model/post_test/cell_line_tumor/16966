The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso towards zzso human lung cancer cells was examined using the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso value obtained following exposure of zzso cells to zzso for 4 h was approximately three times smaller than that obtained when zzso was administered under the same conditions, indicating that the former complex displayed greater zzso Both zzso values were greater than that obtained after exposure of zzso cells to zzso demonstrating that the latter compound was the most zzso of the three zzso zzso zzso radiation X-ray zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso cells showed that platinum became zzso in zzso regions of the zzso In contrast, when the same cells were treated with zzso the metal became distributed throughout the zzso zzso of the maximum concentration of platinum present inside the cells using zzso furnace atomic zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells suggested that there was greater zzso of zzso compared to zzso by the zzso cells, and that platinum zzso did not account for the greater toxicity of zzso as assessed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso and circular zzso zzso zzso studies of solutions containing either zzso or zzso and a duplex zzso zzso showed the two zzso displayed very similar affinity towards the zzso zzso zzso these results indicate that the difference in zzso of the two platinum zzso is probably the result of variations in their interactions with other cellular zzso
