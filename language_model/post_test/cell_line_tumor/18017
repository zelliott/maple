To evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of zzso with 131 zzso humanized zzso zzso (131 zzso zzso combined with 131 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (131 zzso in nude mice bearing human zzso zzso 

zzso mice bearing subcutaneous human zzso zzso zzso were treated by zzso injection of 131 zzso zzso and/or 131 zzso and the changes in the tumor size and zzso in the zzso concentration in the tumor and zzso zzso were zzso 

The tumor zzso rate in mice treated with 131 zzso zzso combined with 131 zzso zzso was significantly higher than that in mice treated with 131 zzso zzso zzso or 131 zzso zzso zzso Combined treatment also resulted in significantly higher zzso zzso concentration ratios than the treatment with the single zzso 

zzso injection with 131 zzso zzso zzso can increase the zzso concentration in the tumor and enhance the efficacy of the zzso in nude mice bearing human zzso zzso
