There is growing evidence that chronic stress is associated with cancer zzso and zzso but the mechanisms involved in this association are poorly zzso This study aims to examine the effect of stress hormone zzso zzso on zzso migration and invasion of human pancreatic cancer cells and the molecular zzso zzso 

zzso cells were examined for the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso and western zzso zzso The zzso cells zzso cell cycle distribution, cell migration and invasion were assessed by zzso flow zzso scratch wound healing and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso 1 cells expressed both zzso and zzso zzso Exposure of zzso cells to increasing zzso of zzso zzso cell proliferation in a zzso zzso In addition, zzso increased zzso population and decreased zzso and zzso population of zzso 1 zzso Furthermore, zzso significantly enhanced migration and invasion of zzso zzso More zzso we observed that zzso elevated zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso effects were completely abolished by zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso inhibitor zzso 

zzso could stimulate pancreatic cancer cell zzso migration and invasion through a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso
