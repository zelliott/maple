The goal of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of chemically modified human zzso zzso zzso for tumor zzso 

zzso and zzso Ad zzso carrying zzso zzso reporter gene under zzso promoter zzso was zzso with zzso zzso acid zzso peptides through a zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso specific zzso The zzso and zzso viral zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression in various tumor cell lines was determined by reverse zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso imaging was performed in zzso and in zzso to evaluate zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso the native zzso zzso and exhibited significantly enhanced zzso efficiency of zzso tumors than zzso through intravenous zzso 

This approach provides a robust platform for zzso gene delivery and zzso monitoring of the zzso delivery efficacy and zzso
