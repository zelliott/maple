To understand the mechanisms behind platinum zzso zzso of cancer cell growth, we compared the effects of zzso and zzso when combined with zzso on the induction of zzso zzso activity, zzso and cell growth in zzso human zzso zzso cells and their zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso cells were treated with platinum agent alone, zzso alone or combination (10 zzso each, 20 zzso zzso radioactive product measurement and zzso were used for zzso activity and zzso pools, zzso drug interaction on cell growth was by zzso and zzso zzso 

Both platinum agents induced zzso zzso in parental zzso cells, but not in resistant zzso Platinum zzso combinations produced high levels of zzso activity in parental cells with significant depletion of zzso and zzso but not in resistant zzso zzso with platinum agents increased the levels of zzso in all cell zzso zzso combination was superior to zzso in the zzso of cell growth in parental zzso No zzso was observed in the resistant zzso 

Increased zzso levels following zzso with Pt agents enhances the translation and stability of zzso protein leading to zzso pool zzso zzso more zzso zzso formation in parental zzso zzso combination is superior to zzso in cell growth zzso as zzso DNA zzso are zzso even at relatively fewer zzso zzso platinum zzso in zzso cells contributes to reduced zzso zzso induction and absence of zzso when combined with zzso
