zzso initiation factor zzso zzso an important regulator of translation, plays important roles in tumor zzso progression and zzso However, the clinical significance of zzso expression in lung zzso zzso remains zzso The aim of this study was to explore the expression of zzso gene in lung zzso cell lines and zzso and to investigate its relationship with clinical characteristics and prognosis of patients with lung zzso in combination with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso were performed to detect the expression of zzso zzso and protein in normal human lung zzso cell line, immortalized lung zzso cell line and lung zzso cell zzso Additionally, the expression of zzso gene was also detected in 32 cases of lung zzso zzso tumor adjacent zzso and tumor surrounding normal zzso by the same zzso Moreover, expression of zzso and the status of zzso in specimens from 76 patients with lung zzso were examined by zzso zzso zzso between zzso expression and zzso features, and the effect of zzso on prognosis of patients with lung zzso were evaluated by statistical zzso 

The levels of zzso zzso and protein expression were higher in lung zzso cell lines and in zzso lung zzso cell line than in the normal lung zzso cell zzso The expression of zzso gene showed statistical difference between tumor zzso tumor adjacent zzso and tumor surrounding normal zzso ( zzso Moreover, the higher levels of zzso expression were correlated with poorer differentiation zzso higher pathological stage ( zzso and clinical stage zzso a higher zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso death zzso The zzso survival rate of patients with higher zzso expression was significantly lower than that of patients with lower zzso expression zzso Furthermore, in a zzso analysis by Cox zzso model, high zzso expression was confirmed to be an independent zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were also significant zzso zzso 

High zzso expression was correlated with poorer overall survival in lung zzso zzso zzso might be a better clinical marker predicting the prognosis for lung zzso patients in combination with zzso zzso
