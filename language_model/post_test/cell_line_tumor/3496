Drug resistance to zzso zzso would represent a major obstacle for cancer zzso The zzso zzso zzso binding cassette (ABC) family of transport zzso such as the 170 zzso zzso zzso resistance zzso zzso and the 190 zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso are associated with zzso resistance, including resistance to zzso The purpose of the present study was to investigate the relationship between zzso zzso expression and the level of zzso to zzso We established the zzso colon cancer cell line zzso from zzso zzso We zzso the expression of zzso for zzso and zzso by a real-time zzso method, determining that the values of each zzso zzso in zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso in zzso ( zzso and zzso and zzso in zzso zzso With respect to zzso survival rates for 3 zzso and 10 zzso of zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso respectively, thus zzso showed higher resistance to zzso than zzso did with statistical zzso We also demonstrated a successful zzso to zzso toxicity in zzso by means of the zzso selective inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso which markedly decreased the zzso of zzso for zzso (from zzso zzso to zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso induced increased zzso expression in a colon cancer cell line, zzso resulting in zzso to zzso that was approximately triple the level of zzso observed in the original zzso cells line, as measured by calculation of the zzso We also confirmed the efficacy of zzso of zzso cells with the zzso selective inhibitor zzso in restoring zzso of these cells to zzso suggesting a strategy for overcoming drug resistance to zzso
