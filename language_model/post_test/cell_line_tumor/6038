zzso zzso zzso is the most popular zzso for protein zzso but its potential as carrier of low molecular weight drugs has been limited by the intrinsic low zzso zzso to its chemical zzso In fact, only the two end chain groups of zzso can be modified and exploited for drug zzso We have demonstrated that by zzso a zzso structure at the zzso end zzso it is possible to increase the drug payload and overcome this zzso Furthermore, this approach can be improved by using zzso zzso These zzso allow the precise linking of two different drugs, or a drug and a targeting agent, on the same zzso zzso zzso zzso have been obtained with defined chemical structures leading to their attractive use as drug delivery zzso In fact, they offer a double zzso first, the possibility to choose the best zzso agent ratio, and second, the separation of the two functions, activity and zzso which are coupled at the opposite zzso end zzso In this study, we investigated the role of a zzso zzso as carrier for a combination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a potent zzso drug that is affected by severe side effects originating from both the drug itself and its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso used for the treatment of osteoporosis and bone zzso as well as a zzso zzso The zzso zzso was designed to exploit active targeting by the zzso zzso and passive targeting through the enhanced zzso and retention zzso zzso Our zzso demonstrated a great binding affinity to the bone mineral zzso in zzso and an zzso comparable to that of the free drugs combination in human zzso of the prostate zzso zzso The zzso zzso exhibited an improved zzso profile compared with the free drugs owed to the marked increase in their zzso In addition, zzso could be zzso directly in zzso solutions without the need for zzso zzso The data presented in this manuscript encourage further investigations on the potential of zzso as treatment for cancer bone zzso
