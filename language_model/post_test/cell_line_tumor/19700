A zzso and zzso zzso molecules are known for their unique potential to combine zzso zzso and zzso To understand the role of zzso necrosis zzso zzso converting zzso zzso in pancreatic zzso zzso zzso we investigated its zzso function, and in zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in 3 of 10 normal pancreatic zzso 6 of 8 samples from patients with chronic zzso 10 of 10 zzso zzso and 9 of 9 pancreatic cancer cell lines, but it was absent in primary duct zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed positive cancer cells in 8 of 10 zzso but no zzso of ducts in normal zzso zzso was found in 0 of 16 pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 of 30 zzso zzso 2 of 13 zzso zzso but, in 13 of 15 zzso zzso associated with zzso Western zzso flow zzso and zzso zzso analyses showed the zzso expression of zzso protein in pancreatic cancer cell zzso The zzso activity of zzso assessed by the release of zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso using small interfering zzso technique in zzso reduced invasion behavior dramatically, whereas proliferation was zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso expression was zzso in pancreatic cancer cells arrested in zzso phase as well as in a zzso manner after zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, our findings provide evidence of zzso expression of the zzso active zzso in advanced precursor zzso zzso and zzso while identifying its critical involvement in the invasion zzso
