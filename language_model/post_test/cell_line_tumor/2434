zzso and tumor progression are associated with dysfunction of the nuclear transport machinery at the level of import and export receptors zzso Recent studies have shown that the nuclear import factor zzso zzso is a novel zzso marker for poor prognosis in human breast zzso Based on the zzso hallmarks of cancer zzso we performed a detailed in zzso characterization of the zzso effects caused by zzso zzso and zzso zzso in benign and zzso human breast zzso zzso zzso clearly increased proliferation of zzso tumor cells and further led to a reduction of zzso zzso in benign zzso cells, whereas cell migration was significantly increased ( zzso in both tumor zzso zzso these individual effects of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso and migration resulted in an increased colony spreading of benign zzso breast cells and zzso zzso tumor cells ( zzso which is a hallmark of cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso caused a complete zzso of zzso tumor cell proliferation and migration ( zzso In addition, in these experiments zzso was increased ( zzso and formation of tumor cell colonies was reduced ( zzso Thus, zzso zzso provoked increased aggressiveness of zzso zzso breast tumor cells and induced a shift in benign zzso breast cells toward a zzso breast cancer zzso In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time in experimental tumor models that forced zzso expression drives zzso features relevant for breast cancer zzso while its zzso is required for the zzso of those progressive zzso This study gives clear evidence that zzso acts as a novel zzso factor in human breast cancer, in zzso
