zzso domain death zzso zzso is a crucial element in death signaling pathways and is recognized as an zzso link connecting the intrinsic zzso zzso and zzso death zzso zzso zzso zzso we describe experiments conducted with a fusion zzso which was generated by fusing a human zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso with domain II of zzso zzso A and the truncated active zzso zzso These experiments extend our previous work on several other zzso zzso Specifically, by excluding cells with zzso zzso we showed that the zzso zzso zzso selectively recognized and killed zzso tumor cells in zzso by attacking their zzso and inducing their zzso zzso This zzso could only be inhibited partially by zzso zzso zzso and zzso protector zzso zzso we transferred the zzso gene into zzso zzso mice bearing zzso tumors together with other zzso proteins using zzso injections of zzso zzso The expression of the zzso gene suppressed tumor growth and prolonged animal survival zzso We also shortened the zzso domain of zzso zzso A II to only zzso acid zzso which were crucial for zzso zzso The new zzso zzso retained the zzso efficiency and the ability of specific killing zzso tumor zzso Our data showed that, compared with the toxins employed before, the zzso zzso zzso can not only specifically recognize zzso tumor cells but also certainly induce zzso even in the presence of zzso and zzso thereby suggesting an alternative approach to treating zzso zzso
