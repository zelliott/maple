zzso acid zzso zzso is a central zzso in zzso and zzso activated in response to feeding and insulin zzso The zzso factor zzso is required for the zzso of zzso transcription, and we show here that zzso zzso by zzso which is zzso by zzso in response to zzso triggers a zzso zzso Under zzso conditions, zzso is zzso by zzso causing promoter zzso In contrast, feeding zzso the recruitment of zzso to zzso and its zzso which then allows recruitment of zzso resulting in zzso zzso and zzso promoter zzso DNA zzso components associated with zzso induce transient DNA breaks during zzso zzso In zzso zzso mice, zzso zzso zzso DNA breaks, and zzso zzso leading to zzso are impaired, resulting in decreased zzso zzso Our study demonstrates that a zzso central to the DNA damage response mediates zzso gene zzso
