zzso zzso tumors are the most common zzso zzso in zzso In this investigation, we show that myostatin, a skeletal zzso inhibitor of growth and differentiation is expressed and translated in the cultured zzso cell line, zzso The addition of zzso zzso myostatin zzso the proliferation of zzso cells cultured in growth media, consistent with the role of myostatin in normal zzso proliferation zzso However, unlike normal zzso zzso of zzso was not zzso Rather, myostatin zzso resulted in the specific zzso of both zzso and its zzso partner, zzso The analysis of zzso reveals that there was no change in its zzso status with myostatin treatment, consistent with zzso complexes being active in the absence of zzso Moreover, the activity of zzso appeared to be unchanged between treated and zzso zzso cells, as determined by the ability of zzso to bind zzso The examination of zzso a zzso of zzso involved in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso gene zzso revealed that it zzso a loss of zzso with myostatin zzso Supporting this, a zzso in zzso gene expression was zzso These results suggest that myostatin could potentially be used as an inhibitor of zzso proliferation and define a previously zzso zzso mechanism for the zzso of muscle precursor cell proliferation by zzso
