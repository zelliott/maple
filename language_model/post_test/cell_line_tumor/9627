In a poisonous incident in zzso Japan, it is understood that zzso acid zzso was a critical contaminant of ground zzso Most patients showed dysfunction of the central nervous zzso To understand the overall mechanism of zzso toxicity and to gain some insight into the application of a remedy specific for zzso the molecular target must be zzso As an approach, a high zzso analysis of cell proteins in cultured human zzso zzso exposed to zzso was performed by two-dimensional zzso zzso Four zzso which were zzso and zzso by exposure of cultured zzso cells to zzso were zzso They were zzso containing zzso zzso beta zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso C zzso Of these, zzso was the only protein that was zzso by zzso exposure, and cellular expression levels were reduced by zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso in cellular zzso levels was accompanied by decreased activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso by zzso was also observed in human cervical zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso By contrast, no significant changes in zzso protein expression were observed when cells were incubated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso zzso In the central nervous system, zzso plays a role in the production of the neurotransmitter zzso zzso Selective zzso of zzso expression by zzso may be a cause of dysfunction of zzso zzso transmission and the zzso neurological zzso
