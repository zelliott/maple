There is a need to develop novel targeted imaging and therapeutic agents that can aid in early diagnosis, detection of zzso and treatment of zzso zzso zzso is zzso in zzso of zzso zzso in humans and may be a potential target for zzso zzso carrying therapeutic zzso Five melanoma cell lines were generated from canine primary oral and zzso canine tumors, grown in mice, and validated with melanoma markers zzso A, zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso and zzso The melanoma cell lines were tested for binding affinity to previously published zzso zzso peptides containing the zzso zzso Fluorescent zzso of the zzso zzso binding zzso zzso were used to zzso zzso affinity in the cell lines, a zzso of canine primary oral melanoma, and melanoma zzso zzso zzso was expressed by all 5 canine melanoma cell zzso Four of the 5 lines as well as the primary canine tumor showed affinity to zzso zzso binding peptides with the zzso zzso zzso imaging of canine melanoma zzso in nude mice indicates zzso strong zzso of the optical zzso in the tumor with an average persistence of approximately 48 zzso zzso zzso images showed high zzso ratio, with tumor signals more than twice that of the kidney and other vital zzso We propose that zzso zzso zzso binding zzso could potentially become useful zzso for imaging and delivery of zzso agents for the treatment of zzso
