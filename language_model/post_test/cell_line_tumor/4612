Ewing zzso gene zzso encodes a putative zzso protein with proposed roles in zzso and zzso but its zzso role in zzso remains zzso Here, we have generated zzso mice and demonstrated that zzso is required for the completion of B cell development and zzso Analysis of zzso zzso revealed a zzso zzso in precursor B zzso zzso zzso zzso During zzso zzso zzso were deficient in zzso zzso formation and showed reduced zzso zzso resulting in massive zzso and complete arrest in zzso zzso zzso of zzso in mouse embryonic zzso resulted in premature cellular zzso and the zzso animals showed hypersensitivity to zzso zzso Finally, we showed that zzso interacts with zzso zzso and that loss of zzso results in a reduced zzso zzso zzso Our findings reveal essential functions for zzso in zzso cell development and zzso with proposed roles in DNA pairing and zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate a novel role of zzso in cellular zzso possibly through its interaction and zzso of zzso zzso
