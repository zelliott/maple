The zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso regulated genes in zzso zzso zzso As zzso links inflammatory and zzso pathways in zzso we investigated whether IGF-1 affects zzso to regulate inflammatory response in zzso cells under zzso IGF-1 induced Ras and zzso zzso II zzso regulated zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso in zzso was concurrent with decreased zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression and elevated zzso of zzso signaling zzso zzso Interestingly, while synthetic zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased IGF-1 zzso increase in zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso of zzso decreased zzso zzso This suggested that IGF-1 induced zzso axis is regulated by both positive and negative feedback zzso zzso zzso zzso reversed the effect of IGF-1 on zzso and zzso zzso While zzso of zzso zzso IGF-1 zzso increase in zzso it elevated IGF-1 induced decrease in zzso zzso Thus zzso positively and zzso regulates zzso and zzso expression respectively, in zzso zzso Though zzso zzso had no additive effect on IGF-1 zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso treatment with zzso zzso alone elevated expression of these zzso zzso Our studies indicate that a complex zzso zzso sustains a zzso cycle of inflammatory response through intrinsic negative and positive feedback zzso
