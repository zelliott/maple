zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is an zzso protein that is expressed highly in zzso where it contributes to resistance to zzso zzso The zzso activity and elevated expression of zzso family proteins in many human zzso makes zzso proteins attractive targets for zzso by cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso that bind with high affinities to select zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been shown to stimulate zzso and rapid zzso degradation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In the present paper, we report zzso zzso degradation in response to zzso but not zzso zzso zzso This degradation required zzso zzso zzso activity and was independent of zzso or zzso Although zzso is best characterized in melanoma cells, we show that zzso expression in normal zzso zzso is restricted largely to the eye, being most abundant in zzso body zzso and retinal zzso zzso Surprisingly, given this pattern of zzso zzso mice lacking zzso exhibited normal zzso pressure as well as normal retinal structure and zzso The results of the present study indicate that zzso is zzso for both normal mouse development and zzso zzso
