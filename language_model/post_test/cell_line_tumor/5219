zzso zzso zzso signaling plays a critical role in the development and progression of prostate zzso It has been reported previously that zzso zzso a member of a novel family of zzso interacts physically with zzso to enhance zzso zzso of target zzso In the present study, we evaluated the biological significance of zzso in modulating zzso zzso growth and zzso target gene expression of prostate cancer zzso We also investigated the mechanism by which zzso might zzso zzso zzso The contribution of zzso was assessed mainly by using the approach of stable zzso zzso The major observations are as zzso zzso A low level of zzso zzso cells to growth stimulation and zzso target gene induction by zzso such that exposure to a higher level of zzso is required to reach the same magnitude of response when zzso is depressed; zzso zzso increases the affinity of zzso to zzso and decreases the rate of zzso zzso from the occupied zzso zzso zzso enhances the zzso zzso and zzso zzso interaction of zzso a stronger zzso interaction is consistent with a more robust zzso zzso signal by keeping zzso tight in the zzso zzso zzso the zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso binding affinity and zzso zzso interaction are zzso regardless of a zzso or zzso zzso The above findings led us to believe that zzso may be a therapeutic target in blocking the transition of prostate cancer from an zzso to an zzso zzso
