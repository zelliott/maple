zzso zzso exert zzso effects against various types of brain zzso In the present study, we investigated the effects of zzso a new zzso zzso and zzso on the zzso cell death induced by chemical zzso in zzso cells and their underlying molecular zzso Both zzso inhibited chemical zzso cell death, and the effects were associated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso suppressed NO and zzso formation, and zzso an NO zzso reversed the protective effects of the zzso on cell zzso In the zzso zzso process, zzso expression was suppressed in parallel with increased zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso (an zzso zzso or zzso (a zzso zzso abolished the cell survival by zzso and zzso All of the effects of zzso and zzso appeared to be zzso because the effects were reversed by zzso A zzso zzso a zzso zzso or by zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that two zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited chemical zzso zzso cell death by zzso zzso and zzso mechanisms related to zzso suppression and zzso zzso
