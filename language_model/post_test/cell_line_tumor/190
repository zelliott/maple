This work aimed to investigate the role of the zzso domain of the human zzso zzso on the zzso of breast tumor cells and zzso to collagen I, in a dynamic flow zzso to simulate in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to support tumor cell zzso through binding to the zzso zzso zzso and also to inhibit the invasion through zzso in zzso In a dynamic flow zzso zzso inhibited about zzso and zzso of zzso tumor cells and zzso zzso to collagen I, zzso In addition, it was demonstrated that zzso zzso is new interacting partner for zzso In conclusion, these results suggest a role for the zzso domain of zzso in the zzso zzso Also, zzso may be a tool for investigating the role of zzso in zzso and cancer progression and for the design of selective zzso against the zzso and zzso of cancer zzso
