Bone is the most common site of breast cancer zzso zzso zzso resulting from breast cancer are most often zzso and contribute to the morbidity and mortality associated with this zzso Over the past several years, significant effort has been focused on zzso the molecular mechanisms that govern this zzso To accomplish this task, animal model systems have been generated to study the process of breast cancer zzso to zzso These include: zzso injection that models tumor growth in the bone zzso cardiac injections that permit cancer cell dissemination to the bone zzso from the zzso and spontaneous bone zzso originating from the zzso zzso zzso these various model systems have been combined with gene expression profiling to compare breast cancer populations with distinct bone zzso zzso in the hopes of finding the genes that facilitate this zzso The result has been the zzso of an impressive body of evidence detailing a complex web of interactions between breast cancer cells, the zzso bone zzso and host cells resident in zzso such as zzso zzso and bone zzso zzso In this review we will address new developments that underscore the importance of zzso proteins and cell surface receptors expressed on breast cancer cells that play key roles in promoting bone zzso and tumor zzso Recent results from both basic and clinical research reveal that similar zzso functions, such as zzso and invasion, are zzso across a variety of bone zzso breast cancer cells and different sets of genes can fulfill these zzso
