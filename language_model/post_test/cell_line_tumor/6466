zzso is a novel zzso zzso DNA zzso in clinical zzso zzso is structurally similar to zzso zzso zzso except for the C zzso and this modification is accompanied by different zzso in cancer zzso We here characterize the interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso repair zzso zzso in comparison with zzso Our results show for the first time that although neither zzso nor zzso is repaired by zzso both compounds are able to interfere with the zzso machinery thereby attenuating the repair of specific zzso zzso We further show that the zzso activity is increased in 3 of 4 cellular models with acquired resistance to zzso or zzso confirming the involvement of zzso in the resistance to platinum zzso zzso both zzso and zzso show unchanged or even enhanced activity toward all 4 zzso and zzso cell zzso We finally show that combinations of zzso and zzso were mostly synergistic toward both parental and zzso zzso zzso cells as indicated by zzso and zzso zzso These data show that the C zzso of zzso can be subjected to at least some structural modifications without loss of activity or zzso zzso While zzso and zzso appear functionally similar in cellular models, it is likely that the differences in zzso may allow different dosing and scheduling of zzso in the clinic that could lead to novel and/or increased zzso zzso Taken together, our results provide a zzso basis to support clinical trials of zzso alone or in combination with zzso
