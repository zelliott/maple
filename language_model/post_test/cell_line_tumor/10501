The low stability and fast clearance of tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso are the main obstacles to its zzso as an zzso zzso Here, we attempted to improve its zzso and zzso profiles by using zzso zzso zzso TRAIL zzso was zzso using 2, 5, 10, 20, and 30 zzso zzso zzso effect assessments in zzso tumor bearing nude mice showed that all zzso zzso efficiently suppressed mean tumor growth, with mean tumor growth zzso zzso values zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso In particular, zzso was found to have zzso efficacy for five days after a single administration (1 zzso zzso The different zzso effects of these zzso zzso were attributed to zzso zzso and zzso zzso All zzso were found to have higher zzso zzso in rat zzso extended zzso profiles, and greater circulating zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso h for 2, 5, 10, 20, and zzso respectively, versus zzso h for zzso zzso in zzso zzso Our findings suggest that TRAIL zzso with zzso of an appropriate zzso might be useful zzso agent with protracted zzso
