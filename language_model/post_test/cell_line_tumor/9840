A variety of zzso including zzso zzso zzso transforming growth zzso zzso which helps tumors evade effective immune surveillance through a variety of mechanisms, including zzso of zzso zzso and enhancing the generation of regulatory T zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso of zzso would improve the efficacy of vaccines targeting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by reversal of zzso 

Mice bearing zzso zzso zzso were treated zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso with or without zzso zzso of synthetic peptides for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in incomplete zzso zzso 

Mice receiving the combination regimen exhibited significantly prolonged survival compared with mice receiving either zzso alone, zzso vaccines alone, or mock treatments zzso zzso zzso enhanced the systemic induction of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso revealed that zzso treatment suppressed zzso of zzso increased zzso zzso T cells, and reduced zzso zzso cells in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso also zzso plasma levels of zzso zzso inflammatory zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting a systemic promotion of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso treatment zzso plasma zzso levels and promoted the persistence of zzso zzso T cells in zzso zzso 

These data suggest that systemic zzso of zzso by zzso can reverse the zzso zzso environment of zzso zzso mice both zzso and locally, thereby enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of zzso zzso
