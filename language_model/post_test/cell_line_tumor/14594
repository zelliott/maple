zzso zzso zzso is the most zzso highly zzso invasive and zzso primary brain tumor in zzso At the genetic level, it is characterized by a high degree of zzso instability and zzso It has been shown that defects in the zzso zzso checkpoint could lead to the development of zzso as well as zzso Additional proteins regulating sister zzso cohesion could also be involved in maintaining the zzso of zzso zzso One such protein is the precocious zzso of sisters zzso zzso also known as sister zzso cohesion protein zzso It is a nuclear zzso expressed from the S right through to the zzso zzso It is highly zzso from zzso to man and plays a role in the establishment, maintenance and dissolution of sister zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso in lower organisms results in zzso zzso zzso and DNA repair zzso It is considered that such defects can cause either cell death or contribute to the development of cancer zzso Indeed, altered expression levels of zzso have been observed in tumors of the breast, zzso zzso stomach, liver and zzso zzso zzso however, have not been zzso so zzso zzso we report on the cloning of zzso zzso zzso and on the analysis of its expression pattern in rat zzso We also show that zzso is significantly zzso at both the zzso and protein level and that this zzso zzso positively with the WHO grade of human zzso However, functional zzso show that the zzso zzso of zzso affects sister zzso cohesion but does not influence zzso checkpoint function or the proliferation and survival of zzso zzso Although the mechanism by which zzso functions in zzso cells remains zzso its zzso in high grade zzso implies that it could play a pivotal role during the development and progression of zzso zzso
