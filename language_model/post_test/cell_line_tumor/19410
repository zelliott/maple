zzso movements of zzso are strongly limited by its zzso nature, and the mechanisms involved in zzso transport can represent a crucial aspect of zzso metabolism and zzso The recent identification of the zzso specific carrier protein zzso has revealed a novel zzso for the delivery of zzso to the zzso apparatus for zzso zzso In this study we investigated the zzso and functional role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso These cells were found to zzso express zzso the protein being mainly associated with the zzso zzso zzso experiments performed with different radioactive zzso precursors of zzso demonstrated that the down regulation of zzso by zzso technology resulted in a significant but not complete reduction of zzso metabolism to zzso without affecting its zzso for zzso zzso Since zzso oxide is an inhibitor of zzso zzso traffic and metabolism in zzso zzso cells, we evaluated the possibility that the zzso transport of zzso might represent a target for zzso zzso The data obtained demonstrate that zzso down regulation does not affect the zzso activity of zzso oxide on zzso zzso and the effects of zzso oxide and zzso zzso on zzso zzso were zzso These results strongly suggest that a zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso transport coexist in zzso zzso cells and can separately contribute to the control of zzso metabolism and zzso levels in these zzso
