A novel fluorescent zzso for the imaging of zzso A receptors zzso was zzso Based on the zzso zzso and selective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a modification of the lead structure with a zzso containing an zzso zzso was zzso zzso of this precursor with the fluorescent marker Cy zzso zzso was accomplished by zzso of common zzso labeling zzso The affinity of the Cy zzso zzso zzso was evaluated using human zzso cell lines with different degrees of zzso zzso Fluorescence zzso revealed that zzso zzso human breast zzso and zzso human zzso cells effectively bind the zzso at very low doses zzso while zzso zzso human breast cancer cells showed no zzso zzso zzso specificity of the probe could be demonstrated by zzso with a specific zzso zzso or the parent zzso zzso zzso as a competing zzso The results suggest that the modified zzso tightly binds to zzso receptors and thus may be a possible candidate for the imaging of zzso zzso in zzso
