zzso zzso are involved in cancer development and zzso acting as tumor zzso or zzso Our previous studies have revealed that zzso and zzso are significantly zzso in gastrointestinal zzso Interestingly, zzso has the same zzso zzso as zzso and zzso Although zzso expression of zzso has been observed in several types of cancer, its zzso role and relevance to zzso are still largely zzso The purpose of this study was to zzso the molecular mechanisms by which zzso acts as a tumor zzso in gastric zzso 

We showed significant zzso of zzso in 106 gastric cancer zzso and four gastric cancer cell lines, compared with their zzso counterparts by real-time zzso In zzso zzso of ten cases confirmed an overt decrease in the level of zzso in gastric cancer zzso Moreover, the expression of zzso was demonstrated to be associated with tumor size zzso zzso zzso by a zzso U zzso We also found that zzso could inhibit cell proliferation in zzso by zzso zzso growth zzso and an zzso growth zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso An experiment in nude mice revealed that zzso could suppress zzso in zzso Using a zzso activity zzso and western zzso zzso was identified as a target of zzso in zzso Moreover, an obvious inverse correlation was observed between the expression of zzso protein and zzso in 49 pairs of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These findings provide important evidence that zzso targets zzso and is significant in suppressing gastric cancer cell zzso Maybe zzso would become a potential zzso and therapeutic target against gastric zzso
