zzso of zzso proteins by zzso is initiated by their zzso zzso 2 zzso association with zzso zzso from the zzso domain of a zzso Here, we show that the C zzso of the zzso zzso zzso recruits in a zzso manner the zzso domain of zzso zzso of all zzso zzso zzso did not abolish zzso of zzso in contrast to that of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that the zzso domain of zzso is zzso associated with the zzso part of zzso and a zzso zzso protein containing the zzso domain of zzso could be activated by this zzso zzso zzso of the zzso part of zzso dramatically decreased its ability to activate zzso and to mediate zzso activity in cell lines, demonstrating that zzso of zzso with this zzso zzso independent from the interaction between the zzso zzso 2 domain and zzso is required for its full zzso
