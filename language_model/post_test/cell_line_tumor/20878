zzso receptors are the largest family of zzso zzso zzso Together with their zzso the zzso they fulfill multiple biological zzso zzso expression of zzso leading to increased zzso zzso to zzso zzso ratios is a critical factor in zzso indicating that tight regulation of zzso and zzso expression is essential for normal cell zzso The zzso regions zzso of transcripts play an important yet widely underappreciated role in the control of protein zzso Based on the assumption that zzso of large gene families might exhibit a zzso organization of regulatory elements in their zzso we applied a novel zzso biology approach to the zzso sequences of zzso zzso We identified clusters of motifs consisting of zzso zzso elements zzso zzso elements zzso and zzso binding zzso These clusters bind multiple zzso and zzso factors, including zzso Surprisingly, despite its widely accepted role as an zzso zzso we further show that binding of zzso to these clusters actually zzso zzso transcripts in tumor cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso greatly zzso expression of multiple zzso at both the zzso and protein zzso Together our studies suggest that zzso of zzso as found in many progressive tumors could be zzso for zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso ratios leading to a higher degree of tissue zzso
