zzso is one of the most effective and widely used zzso zzso However, one of the most salient limitations to the clinical application of zzso is the acquired or intrinsic drug resistance exhibited by some zzso In the present study, we have assessed the potential of an zzso energy balancing system as a target for zzso of zzso sensitivity in zzso zzso protein zzso zzso regulates the energy balance system by monitoring zzso energy zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso is rapidly activated by zzso in zzso and zzso cancer zzso The zzso of zzso in those cells and in zzso of zzso resulted in a remarkable increase in zzso zzso which was associated with zzso of the tumor zzso zzso We further showed that zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso was involved in the zzso of zzso by the zzso of zzso zzso By way of contrast, zzso did not induce zzso zzso in zzso cells, which appear to have a relatively high sensitivity to zzso zzso but expression of the zzso active form of zzso in zzso cells resulted in a significant increase of cell viability after zzso zzso zzso our data suggest that zzso performs a pivotal function for protection against the zzso effect of zzso thereby zzso that zzso is one of the cellular factors determining the cellular sensitivity to zzso On the basis of these zzso we propose that a strategy combining zzso and zzso zzso could be developed into a novel zzso zzso
