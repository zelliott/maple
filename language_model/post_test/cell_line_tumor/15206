By using zzso zzso analysis, we identified zzso zzso gene was frequently zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated the role of zzso in zzso zzso The results showed that zzso was frequently zzso in primary zzso in both zzso level zzso zzso and protein level zzso zzso which was significantly associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso advanced clinical stage zzso and overall survival rate ( zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso zzso was an independent zzso factor for zzso zzso studies with both in zzso and in zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso had strong tumor zzso ability in zzso zzso The zzso mechanism of zzso was associated with its role in cell cycle arrest at zzso checkpoint by zzso expressions of zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression by zzso interference could effectively inhibit its tumor zzso zzso In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that zzso is a tumor zzso gene that plays a critical tumor zzso role in zzso
