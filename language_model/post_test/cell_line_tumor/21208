zzso cells respond to DNA zzso breaks zzso by recruiting DNA repair and zzso checkpoint proteins to such zzso Central to these DNA damage response zzso events is the DNA damage zzso protein zzso zzso interacts with several zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso is zzso on a cluster of zzso repeat motifs by zzso zzso 2 zzso Moreover, we establish that this zzso of zzso promotes zzso zzso interactions with zzso in a manner that requires the closely zzso zzso and twin zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso Finally, we show that these zzso motifs in zzso are required to mediate zzso association with zzso sites of zzso zzso These findings provide a molecular explanation for the zzso interaction and yield insights into how zzso coordinates the focal assembly and zzso of several zzso factors in response to DNA zzso
