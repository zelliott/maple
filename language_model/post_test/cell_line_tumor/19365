zzso porous scaffolds can be used for tissue engineering applications since they can serve as templates for cell zzso proliferation and ultimately for tissue zzso One way to address this issue is to evaluate the cell zzso using several characterization techniques zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso On the other hand, when using highly zzso scaffolds some techniques may not be adequate for zzso such as zzso In this work, zzso zzso zzso scanning electron zzso zzso and zzso laser scanning zzso zzso were used to evaluate cell zzso in highly zzso zzso zzso It was possible to observe that some techniques were not suitable to evaluate cell zzso In addition, it was shown that for this kind of zzso zzso laser scanning zzso is a powerful tool for cell zzso and proliferation zzso
