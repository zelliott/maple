The zzso factor zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso plays a key role in the regulation of zzso and zzso metabolism in zzso by regulating their zzso zzso and zzso The zzso activity of zzso is dictated by the set of proteins with which this nuclear zzso interacts under specific zzso Here we identify the zzso zzso protein 60 zzso as a novel positive regulator of zzso zzso zzso Using tandem mass zzso we found that zzso and the zzso zzso interact in cells, and through use of zzso zzso we established that zzso by zzso critically depends on the zzso zzso function 1 of zzso a domain involved in zzso gene expression and zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that the zzso zzso protein is recruited to zzso target genes in mature zzso zzso but not in zzso indicating that zzso requires zzso for its recruitment to zzso target zzso zzso we show that in common with disruption of zzso function, small interfering zzso reduction of zzso protein zzso differentiation of zzso zzso Taken together, these findings qualify the zzso zzso as a novel zzso zzso
