We have previously demonstrated that protein zzso B zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso for human breast cancer zzso To investigate the therapeutic potential of zzso the function of this important survival zzso a novel zzso zzso was constructed, wherein a zzso zzso zzso gene zzso was inserted downstream of the zzso zzso Two human breast cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso were treated, along with the zzso serving as a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was increased with zzso zzso zzso infection alone, but was significantly enhanced with the addition of heat zzso zzso survival was observed with the zzso cancer cells being more sensitive than the zzso zzso The zzso cells, in contrast, were most resistant to these zzso zzso from the zzso zzso reflected the zzso data, with an apparent additive interaction between zzso and zzso treatments, again with greater differential sensitivity of the zzso compared to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Heat or zzso treatments led to zzso of zzso and zzso but this zzso was reduced with zzso zzso In zzso the combination of zzso and heat treatment reduced zzso zzso activity more so than with either heat or zzso zzso In conclusion, our results demonstrate that zzso of the zzso survival zzso will promote zzso and zzso in zzso breast cancer cells, with relative sparing of their normal counterpart, suggesting that a therapeutic gain could be achievable using this therapeutic zzso
