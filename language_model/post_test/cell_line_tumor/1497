To develop a simple, zzso and widely zzso in zzso human zzso model that zzso zzso zzso attachment to human zzso zzso zzso 

Experimental study to establish and validate the zzso 

Cell zzso zzso Lines zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso zzso with green fluorescence, selecting zzso of size similar to zzso zzso by use of cell zzso and assessing zzso attachment by use of an automated zzso zzso 

zzso of a simple, reliable, and zzso in zzso model to study human zzso zzso 

The zzso enabled rapid zzso assessment of zzso attachment to human zzso zzso cells zzso and zzso under different experimental zzso The zzso zzso was confirmed by conventional counting method to be highly zzso and zzso 

The described methodology provides for the first time a zzso zzso for the study of human zzso zzso and a promising tool for screening potential zzso or enhancers of zzso zzso
