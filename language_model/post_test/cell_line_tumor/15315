zzso zzso imaging is continuing to be applied for zzso imaging and more recently for molecular imaging of living zzso zzso to its high spatial resolution in deep zzso PA imaging holds great potential for biomedical applications and molecular zzso There is however a lack of zzso for targeted PA imaging, especially in the area of zzso zzso Here we introduce a molecular probe, which upon zzso processing is retained at the site of zzso activity and provides PA zzso The probe zzso via a zzso reaction and accumulates in cells and tumors that express the zzso We demonstrate that this probe reports zzso and zzso activity in cells and tumor models by generating a significantly higher PA signal relative to zzso and zzso zzso This probe could report zzso activity in living subjects at depths significantly greater than zzso imaging zzso and has potential for molecular imaging in deep zzso
