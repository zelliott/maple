Natural killer zzso cells trigger zzso and zzso zzso zzso on engagement of the zzso group zzso zzso or members of the natural zzso zzso zzso family, such as zzso by zzso expressed on zzso zzso However, it remains unknown whether T cells can regulate zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we investigated the early events occurring during T zzso cell zzso and their impact on zzso cell zzso We observed that on zzso with some zzso activated zzso T cells promoted zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso cells, probably zzso to the capture of zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso surface zzso This effect was observed in zzso zzso and resting T cells, which showed substantial amounts of cell surface major zzso complex class I zzso protein A on zzso with zzso zzso Our findings identify a new, so far, zzso mechanism by which zzso T cells support zzso cell function through the capture of specific zzso zzso with profound implications at the zzso of innate and zzso zzso
