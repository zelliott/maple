Despite significant clinical improvements, conventional therapies for bone cancer treatment are limited by significant systemic toxicity and lack of specific zzso In this study, we considered zzso a natural zzso derived from zzso root with high affinity to calcium and remarkable zzso features, as a novel approach for bone cancer zzso Due to its zzso properties, as zzso in colon cancer cells, and to its zzso to bone, zzso may be an ideal drug to reduce bone tumor zzso We demonstrated that low zzso of zzso strongly inhibited the zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso and zzso zzso and breast zzso zzso for zzso cells, zzso cell proliferation in zzso zzso zzso had a significantly lower zzso activity on normal cells zzso for zzso zzso thereby revealing a selective activity towards zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso acted through the zzso of zzso zzso and cell cycle arrest in the zzso Finally, zzso significantly and strongly impaired both zzso and breast cancer zzso Our results highlight a selective and effective zzso activity of zzso towards zzso cells, laying the basis for further studies to investigate its application in bone cancer zzso
