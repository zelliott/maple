The objective of the present study was to examine the consequences of a mild zzso in human zzso cell lines deficient and zzso in the DNA mismatch repair system zzso to advance our understanding on the relationship between zzso and heat shock proteins zzso 

The human colon zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso were incubated at zzso and zzso for zzso and then at zzso for 4 and zzso The expression of zzso and zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels were assessed by western zzso in nuclear and zzso zzso The alkaline comet zzso was used to evaluate the DNA zzso 

The mild zzso significantly increased the protein expression levels of zzso and zzso in all cell lines, which was higher in the zzso and nucleus of zzso zzso We also observed that heat induced zzso of zzso and zzso proteins from the nucleus to the zzso in zzso zzso The comet zzso revealed that zzso parent cells were more resistant to zzso DNA zzso However, the zzso and deficient cell lines repaired the DNA damage at the same zzso 

The present study demonstrates that zzso induced the nuclear zzso of zzso and zzso and affected the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Our findings suggest that the zzso system is not a direct determining factor for the different heat shock response in zzso zzso
