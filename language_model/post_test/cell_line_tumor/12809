To prevent protein zzso some proteins are usually expressed as fusion proteins from which target proteins can be released by zzso or chemical zzso In this report, small zzso modifier zzso linked with a zzso tag was used as a fusion partner for the zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso scorpion zzso The optimal expression level of the soluble fusion zzso zzso was up to zzso of the total cellular zzso The fusion protein was zzso by zzso affinity zzso and zzso by a zzso zzso zzso to obtain the zzso zzso zzso which was further zzso by zzso affinity zzso The zzso final product was zzso pure by zzso stained with zzso brilliant blue zzso Mass zzso analysis indicated the protein to be zzso Dalton, which equaled the theoretically expected zzso zzso sequencing of zzso showed the sequence corresponded to the native zzso zzso zzso indicated the zzso could significantly inhibit the proliferation of zzso and zzso 78 T zzso cell zzso The further writhing experiment showed that the zzso had an intensive zzso zzso The expression strategy presented in this study allows convenient high yield and easy zzso of the zzso with native zzso
