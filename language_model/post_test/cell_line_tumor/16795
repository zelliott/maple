zzso is a process that introduces zzso zzso acids into the zzso of an zzso to produce desired traits or evaluate zzso zzso of transgenic technologies are always important pursuit in the last zzso Recently, zzso peptides zzso were studied as zzso that can zzso into cells directly and serve as carriers to deliver different zzso into zzso In the present study, we evaluate whether zzso zzso can be used for gene delivery into human cells in a zzso zzso We demonstrate that three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are able to transport zzso DNA into human zzso zzso For the functional gene zzso the zzso zzso DNA containing the enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso coding sequence could be actively expressed in zzso The treatment of calcium zzso did not facilitate the zzso zzso efficiency, but enhance the gene expression zzso zzso studies further revealed that zzso complexes mediate the direct membrane zzso zzso for gene zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso especially zzso appear to be a high efficient and promising tool for gene zzso
