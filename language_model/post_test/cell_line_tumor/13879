zzso is a key zzso that controls tumor zzso and zzso progression by regulating the expression of several zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso play crucial roles in the signaling mechanism of various cellular zzso The enhanced expression of zzso in normal breast tissue but not in zzso breast zzso has prompted us to investigate its potential role in zzso zzso zzso we hypothesized that zzso zzso may play an important role in regulating zzso zzso and zzso may be involved in this zzso In this study, we have demonstrated that zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso and its subsequent interaction and zzso with zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso play differential roles in regulating zzso zzso and expressions of melanoma cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso in response to zzso zzso of wild type zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression but zzso zzso zzso Our data also indicated that zzso acts as a tumor zzso by zzso regulating zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The mice zzso study showed the zzso between zzso and zzso regulated zzso breast tumor progression and further correlated with the expressions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Human clinical zzso analysis supported the in zzso and in zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is first report that the zzso between zzso and zzso regulates zzso breast cancer progression and further suggests that zzso may act as potential therapeutic target for the treatment of breast zzso
