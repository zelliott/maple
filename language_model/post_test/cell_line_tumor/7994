zzso have long been associated with tumor zzso given their ability to degrade zzso zzso components and facilitate invasion and zzso However, recent findings indicate that different zzso can also act as zzso zzso We have recently reported that lung zzso cells expressing the zzso zzso show a remarkable impairment of growth in zzso mice as compared with parental zzso Here, we show that zzso promoter is zzso in cancer cell lines and tumor zzso Interestingly, zzso expression in the zzso cells surrounding zzso zzso cells is higher than in the paired normal zzso Moreover, the expression of this zzso in colon zzso zzso with colon cancer cell lines is higher than in those cultured zzso Furthermore, the expression of zzso by these zzso is linked with an zzso effect on tumor zzso Based on these findings, we zzso that zzso is a novel zzso zzso that can reduce the zzso properties of tumor zzso This function is lost by zzso zzso in tumor cells, but zzso induced in zzso cells, probably as part of a response of the normal tissue aimed at controlling the progression of zzso
