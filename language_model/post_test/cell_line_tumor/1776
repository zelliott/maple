zzso and zzso zzso have been shown to act as either direct or secondary zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso However, little is known about the role of protein zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso acts as a zzso for zzso zzso zzso of the zzso response element zzso promoter by zzso zzso was suppressed by zzso of zzso and enhanced by zzso of zzso zzso However, the zzso promoter activity was resistant to zzso stimulation in cells zzso a zzso inactive zzso zzso zzso zzso with these results, the expression of the zzso zzso response gene zzso factor 1 zzso by zzso was completely zzso by zzso depletion and decreased to approximately 50% when zzso zzso zzso was zzso In addition, zzso of zzso significantly increased the levels of zzso zzso in the presence or absence of zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso with zzso and was distributed to the zzso and the zzso The zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso was recruited to the promoter of zzso gene together with zzso in an zzso manner, which was accompanied by uploading of zzso zzso II on the zzso Taken together, the results suggest that zzso may act as a zzso in zzso zzso through its recruitment to the promoter via interacting with zzso
