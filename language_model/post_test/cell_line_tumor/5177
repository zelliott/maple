The mechanisms of protective effect of zzso zzso zzso stimulation on zzso of zzso at their early stage of development are poorly zzso In the present study, we investigated the effects of zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell death in primary zzso zzso cell zzso cultures at 7 days in zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso attenuated the St zzso zzso and LP (5 zzso zzso zzso cell death in 7 but not 12 zzso zzso as confirmed by zzso release and zzso reduction zzso Moreover, zzso attenuated zzso zzso DNA fragmentation and zzso zzso inducing factor zzso protein level but not zzso zzso induced by both zzso zzso zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso in zzso were attenuated by zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not by zzso zzso antagonists, zzso zzso zzso and zzso (1 zzso or by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In contrast to zzso model of zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso of zzso and zzso prevented the zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso In separate experiments, we observed also the zzso action of zzso on St zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell death in human zzso zzso cells without its influence on zzso activity, induced by these zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso evoked by zzso in zzso strongly depends on used zzso agent and could engage zzso channel function or be connected with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso It is also suggested that zzso effects of zzso is connected with zzso of fragmentation of DNA via zzso zzso
