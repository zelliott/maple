zzso signaling is critically involved in zzso development, stem cell maintenance and human zzso Using zzso zzso egg extract to screen for compounds that both stabilize zzso and promote zzso zzso we identified an zzso drug, zzso as a potent inhibitor of zzso signaling zzso of zzso zzso We show zzso binds all zzso zzso 1 zzso family members in zzso at low zzso zzso and zzso selectively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso abrogates the effects of zzso on the zzso zzso In addition to its effects on zzso and zzso levels, zzso promotes degradation of zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment of colon cancer cells with zzso of the gene for zzso zzso coli zzso or zzso zzso both zzso signaling and zzso Our findings reveal zzso zzso of zzso as an effective mechanism to inhibit zzso signaling and highlight a new strategy for targeted zzso directed against the zzso zzso
