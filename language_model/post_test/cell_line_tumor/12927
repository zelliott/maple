A straightforward method for the simultaneous preparation of zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso precursors and zzso zzso of zzso fatty acids zzso is zzso The obtained zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso pairs of zzso were characterized thoroughly by zzso zzso zzso and optical zzso Dynamic and zzso zzso studies provided evidence that polar zzso of zzso are extended and more rigid than observed for the corresponding zzso zzso zzso profile on growth suppression of zzso cells was observed for zzso and zzso and their zzso zzso The zzso were more active than the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively), zzso activity of the ordinary zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Neither zzso of zzso and zzso was zzso to their cellular long chain zzso Surprisingly, the most active zzso did not influence the levels of the cellular zzso nor zzso zzso to this, the zzso generated cellular zzso and zzso zzso In comparison, the ordinary zzso and zzso also significantly increased the levels of their cellular long chain zzso These peculiar anabolic responses and zzso data suggest that zzso may interact with some distinct cellular regulatory targets in a specific and more effective manner than their zzso zzso Thus, zzso of zzso can be potentially zzso as novel molecular tools to study zzso zzso cell signaling phenomena and to understand the role of zzso zzso in cancer biology, zzso and zzso
