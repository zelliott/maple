zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso have shown promise in the treatment of patients with zzso brain tumors although few complete responses have zzso zzso to effective therapy include limited zzso distribution on delivery, a consequence of injected zzso particle zzso in the tumor zzso zzso zzso To enhance virus delivery and spread, we investigated the use of the zzso zzso zzso as a means to degrade collagen type IV, a major component of the zzso and basement zzso of zzso that is absent in normal brain zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso for zzso elevated expression of zzso which did not enhance tumor cell migration in zzso or tumor progression in a zzso zzso brain tumor zzso zzso expression improved the distribution and infection of zzso zzso in zzso model in zzso Furthermore, zzso induced a zzso infection over larger areas of brain tumors in zzso These results suggest that zzso delivery and distribution in zzso can be improved by compromising the zzso potentially enhancing zzso zzso
