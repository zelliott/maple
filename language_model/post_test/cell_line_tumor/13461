zzso activities have been described in zzso a zzso mixture of molecules containing zzso in their structure, and also in zzso magnetic zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso were zzso within zzso zzso zzso zzso for therapeutic zzso The zzso loaded with zzso and zzso were labeled zzso and characterized by transmission and scanning electron zzso zzso mobility, zzso correlation zzso presenting a zzso profile, and positive zzso The zzso effect of zzso was evaluated using normal zzso and zzso zzso and zzso breast cell zzso zzso containing only zzso or zzso were used as zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso induced by zzso was dose and time zzso zzso cells were less affected than tumor zzso Cell death occurred mainly by zzso Further exposure of zzso treated zzso breast cells to an alternating magnetic field increased the zzso effect of zzso It was concluded that zzso magnetic zzso zzso represent an effective magnetic material platform to promote zzso and thus a potential system for zzso zzso
