zzso acid B zzso the zzso component in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was reported to possess zzso activities and zzso zzso zzso This study was performed to investigate the effects of zzso on zzso and gastric zzso The zzso zzso activity was determined by gastric zzso zzso Compared to the normal control group, zzso zzso 20, 40 and 80 zzso inhibited the zzso activity by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In the study, 36 zzso mice were randomly divided into six groups: control, model, zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso 40 zzso zzso and zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso All mice except the control group were zzso with zzso alcohol zzso zzso zzso for induced zzso zzso after the 5th zzso At the same time, the control mice were given the same volume of zzso zzso After zzso zzso was evaluated for zzso zzso activities of zzso zzso gastric zzso index and zzso zzso In zzso the zzso effect of zzso to gastric cancer cell zzso in acid environment was detected by zzso and the zzso zzso changes were also observed by zzso zzso dye zzso The results indicated that zzso inhibited moderately zzso activity in zzso Compared to the model group, zzso showed zzso effects in gastric tissue with the zzso of 20 and 5 zzso in zzso Apart from that, zzso could selectively inhibit gastric cancer cell viability and reduce cell zzso against zzso cells at low doses in acid zzso
