Nowadays zzso loosening is the most common cause of zzso implant zzso Some of its reasons have already been described up to now; however, others remain still zzso Besides the inflammatory response to wear particles originating at different sources, the role of zzso oxygen species as products of cellular reactions and/or as a result of the process of zzso of an implant leading to implant failure has recently been discussed zzso In the present study, we used a zzso polarization to simulate the zzso partial reaction of the zzso process at a titanium zzso zzso With respect to cells occurring at the interface of a metal zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso was zzso It has been found that zzso polarization of zzso zzso an increase in the level of zzso zzso oxygen species as well as suppressing the zzso activity of cells in a zzso zzso This is in agreement with the results obtained with cells after external addition of hydrogen zzso as another kind of zzso zzso In both approaches, zzso show a higher tolerance to zzso stress than zzso It could be concluded that the zzso setup developed induced zzso changes occurring during zzso stress and it could be used for future detailed analysis of the consequences of zzso processes for cellular zzso
