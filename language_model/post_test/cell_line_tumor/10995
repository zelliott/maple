To investigate the effect and mechanism of action of the zzso oxide zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso on invasion and zzso of human zzso cancer cell line zzso 

Human zzso cancer cell line zzso was cultured and treated separately with four different zzso of zzso for 72 zzso zzso oxide zzso production was measured with zzso zzso The effect of zzso on invasion and migration of zzso cells were evaluated by using zzso chambers attached with zzso filters and zzso basement membrane zzso zzso was performed to determine the zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso and tissue inhibitor zzso zzso 

zzso could significantly inhibit NO production of zzso in a zzso zzso After being treated for 72 h with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, the ability of the zzso treated zzso cells to invade the zzso basement membrane decreased significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso rates were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso could inhibit migration of zzso cells, and the zzso rates were zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso at zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, after treatment with zzso expression of zzso zzso was significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and that of zzso zzso was markedly increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso exerts zzso and zzso effects on zzso cell line via zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso
