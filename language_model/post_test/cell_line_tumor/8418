Nearly zzso of patients with zzso zzso cancer will progress to invasive disease despite zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso barrier zzso is a challenge for zzso drug zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso we zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which were surface modified with a novel cell penetrating zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso surface improved tissue penetration by zzso in zzso mouse zzso and ex zzso human zzso In addition, zzso significantly enhanced zzso zzso of zzso compared to zzso without zzso To examine biological activity, we zzso zzso that were loaded with the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso exhibited a significantly lower zzso in cultured zzso cancer cells, and sustained zzso when compared to zzso zzso zzso tumors treated with zzso showed a zzso reduction in volume, and a zzso higher zzso zzso when compared to tumors treated with unloaded zzso 

These authors demonstrate that zzso zzso with zzso surface zzso result in greatly enhanced cell penetrating capabilities, and present convincing data from a mouse model of zzso cancer for increased chemotherapy zzso
