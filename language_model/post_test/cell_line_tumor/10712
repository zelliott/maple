zzso zzso zzso are determined, among other reasons, to identify samples which need a second test to detect the associated zzso Our aim was to evaluate the clinical and economic impact generated by using an initial dilution for zzso of zzso We analyzed all samples for which zzso zzso and zzso were requested over a zzso zzso zzso were detected by indirect zzso zzso were analyzed with a combination of zzso zzso were detected by zzso Cost analysis was performed by calculating the difference between two zzso zzso 1:40 and zzso A total of zzso samples were processed for zzso of which zzso were positive with the 1:40 zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso At zzso zzso zzso zzso of the samples were zzso and zzso were zzso zzso Only zzso zzso of zzso and higher showed significantly increased positive zzso value for zzso zzso versus zzso zzso and zzso zzso versus zzso zzso compared to the 1:40 zzso With the zzso zzso zzso fewer zzso tests, zzso fewer zzso zzso and zzso fewer zzso tests would have been zzso The average saving was zzso zzso per sample (1 zzso We conclude that setting the starting dilution for zzso at zzso avoids unnecessary studies, increases the positive zzso values of zzso for zzso and zzso and generates clinical and economic zzso
