The zzso zzso zzso is a seven zzso G zzso zzso present on the surface of various cells including cancer zzso The zzso zzso contributes to the induction of several zzso zzso pathways that enhance survival, zzso and migration of zzso zzso We observed that tamoxifen zzso reduced the zzso transcript and protein levels in zzso breast cancer zzso However, we did not see a zzso effect on zzso transcript and protein levels in zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso of zzso We also observed that zzso significantly increased, for several hours, the expression of zzso active zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso However, there was no zzso effect on these zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso sequencing suggests that zzso may reduce zzso expression via increased zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso island of the zzso promoter of zzso breast cancer zzso Our findings suggest that zzso zzso an increase in zzso expression that is associated with the increase of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso promoter and significant reduction of zzso gene expression in zzso zzso
