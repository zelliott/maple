zzso arc deposition technique was used to deposit zzso zzso films and zzso zzso films on titanium zzso disks zzso The surface topography was characterized by scanning electron zzso and atomic force zzso The element composition of the films was detected by X-ray zzso zzso The phase of films was identified by thin film X-ray zzso The biological behavior of zzso zzso cells cultured on zzso zzso and zzso was investigated and the possible signaling molecules involved was studied by the gene expressions of zzso zzso zzso related zzso 1/2 zzso and zzso The results indicated that both the zzso and zzso films were zzso zzso electron zzso study showed that the zzso of zzso cells on zzso and zzso films was significantly enhanced compared to zzso The zzso zzso indicated that the zzso and zzso films promoted the proliferation of zzso zzso The alkaline zzso zzso activity test and the production of type collagen I zzso by zzso showed that both the zzso and zzso films can enhance zzso activity and zzso expression of zzso zzso In addition, the zzso activity on zzso films was higher than on zzso films at day 4, which indicate zzso films may lead to promotion of a more zzso zzso of zzso cells than zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analysis demonstrated that The gene expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was higher on zzso and zzso films than on zzso The present work suggests that the zzso zzso films produced by zzso arc deposition may be favorable for orthopedic implant applications and worth further zzso
