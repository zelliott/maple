zzso A zzso which is one of well-known zzso zzso efficiently zzso zzso zzso at the 3' end of zzso sequences in the zzso The addition of a minor groove zzso zzso A zzso not only zzso the zzso of Duo with zzso duplex but also switches the zzso site to zzso in zzso zzso Here we examined zzso effect of Duo in the coexistence of Dist using human lung zzso zzso zzso The zzso of Duo to zzso cells was enhanced 10 times by the addition of zzso zzso which was much lower than the zzso value of zzso zzso of Duo alone to zzso cells resulted in typically zzso changes, including zzso zzso zzso zzso in DNA zzso pattern, and decrease in zzso and 9 zzso Interestingly, these zzso characteristics in zzso cells were suppressed by the addition of zzso zzso and the zzso population in the cell cycle progression of zzso cells was largely unchanged in the coexistence of Dist along with the extremely low zzso of zzso and higher induction of zzso In contrast, the treatment of zzso cells with Dist zzso alone was observed to induce the zzso of zzso and cell cycle arrest at the zzso zzso These results indicate that Dist suppresses zzso induced by Duo as well as enhances zzso zzso in living cells, and may contribute to chemotherapy for tumors resistant to inducing zzso cell zzso
