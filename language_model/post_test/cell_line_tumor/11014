zzso zzso 4 zzso has been shown to be important for bacterial infection, especially to zzso zzso Its possible role in zzso infection is studied in the present zzso 

zzso zzso containing full-length zzso zzso was used in the zzso model of acute zzso expression by zzso in zzso zzso zzso normal or zzso mouse strain was compared to investigate the possible role of zzso in acute zzso zzso 

After zzso injection, the zzso zzso expressed zzso were observed nearby the zzso zzso The zzso zzso as well as the replication and zzso were higher in zzso zzso mice than in normal zzso zzso The zzso immune responses were impaired in the liver or zzso of the zzso zzso Their zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso expression on the zzso zzso cells was also zzso When zzso transferring zzso from zzso mice to zzso mice, the zzso replication was inhibited to the level as that of zzso 

These results suggest that zzso plays an zzso role in zzso through the induction of zzso expression and zzso immune responses after zzso zzso
