zzso cancer is one of the leading zzso causes of death due to high zzso and fast zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso has recently been identified as a promising zzso zzso Here, we examine its zzso effects on pancreatic cancer zzso Based on zzso zzso a molecular mode of action is zzso 

zzso zzso was assessed by the zzso proliferation zzso on pancreatic cancer cells and zzso zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso c and zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso dye zzso and zzso zzso were used to detect effects on zzso membrane zzso Total zzso was isolated from treated cell lines and subjected to zzso analysis, subsequent zzso identification and zzso Gene expression data were validated by quantitative zzso chain reaction and zzso gene zzso 

zzso significantly inhibited cancer cell growth, induced zzso c release and subsequent zzso zzso rapidly abolished zzso membrane potential and elevated zzso calcium levels, while zzso were largely zzso zzso profiling revealed 336 genes to be affected by zzso A total of 75 genes were altered in all three cell lines, many of which were within the unfolded protein response zzso zzso DNA damage zzso transcript 3 was identified as a key regulator in zzso cell zzso 

zzso could be a lead compound for the development of novel zzso drugs amplifying the already elevated zzso level in solid zzso thus driving them into zzso This study forms the basis for further investigations identifying zzso direct molecular zzso
