Growth hormone releasing hormone zzso zzso have been developed for the treatment of various zzso We investigated the effects of a novel zzso zzso zzso on nine breast cancer cell lines, differing in their expression for zzso zzso and zzso zzso We detected the presence of zzso zzso receptors zzso on 6 of the 9 breast cancer cell zzso The main zzso zzso of zzso zzso was found on all 9 cell zzso zzso zzso showed that following treatment with zzso cell viability decreased significantly in all 9 cell zzso The reduction in cell viability was greater in cells positive for both zzso and zzso than in cells positive for only zzso but the difference was not zzso Using Western zzso we demonstrated that the levels of zzso zzso and zzso decreased significantly following exposure to zzso and the level of zzso increased after zzso The reduction of the zzso zzso proteins was significantly greater in cells where both zzso and zzso were present, than where only zzso was zzso In conclusion, our study shows that zzso is effective against a wide range of breast cancer cells zzso independently of their zzso zzso suggesting the potential use of zzso zzso also in the treatment of zzso breast zzso The effect of zzso was zzso nearly as well in tumors that expressed only the zzso zzso compared to those in which both zzso and zzso were present, although a difference could be detected at the level of cell zzso
