Up to zzso of cancer patients undergoing zzso surgery develop local zzso due to positive zzso Patients typically receive zzso chemotherapy, zzso and/or radiation to prevent such zzso Interestingly, evidence supporting these therapies is traditionally derived in animal models of primary tumors, thus failing to consider surgically induced tumor zzso changes that may influence zzso therapy zzso To address this consideration, we characterized a zzso model of local cancer zzso This model was zzso and generated a zzso inflammatory tumor zzso that resembles those observed following human cancer zzso To further validate this model, zzso of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were tested and found to be effective in decreasing the growth of zzso zzso We appreciated that zzso zzso zzso led to wound zzso while zzso initiation of zzso zzso resulted in a loss of zzso In zzso although not an exact replica of all human cancer zzso our proposed local recurrence approach provides a biologically relevant and reliable model useful for zzso evaluation of novel zzso zzso The use of this model yields results that may be overlooked using traditional zzso cancer models that fail to incorporate a surgical zzso
