The targeting protein for zzso zzso has recently gained attention as a putative zzso possibly amplified in several human zzso including pancreatic zzso In this work, we sought to evaluate the copy number and expression of zzso in pancreatic cancer cell lines and tumor zzso and to further explore the potential of zzso as a therapeutic zzso 

The DNA copy number and expression of the zzso gene were surveyed in pancreatic cancer cell lines and tumor zzso and compared with those of immortalized normal pancreatic zzso cells and normal pancreatic zzso The cellular effects of zzso zzso using small interfering zzso zzso in pancreatic cancer cells, such as growth in tissue culture, in soft zzso and in nude zzso zzso and sensitivity to zzso were also investigated using various zzso 

zzso zzso amplification was found in pancreatic cancer cell lines and zzso pancreatic cancer tumor zzso zzso expression was zzso in pancreatic cancer cell lines at both the zzso and protein levels relative to the immortalized pancreatic zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso of a tissue zzso showed that zzso expression was higher in pancreatic tumors compared with their normal zzso Treatment with zzso targeting small interfering zzso effectively reduced pancreatic cancer cell growth in tissue culture, induced zzso and inhibited growth in soft zzso and in nude zzso zzso of zzso also zzso pancreatic cancer cells to zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso might be an attractive target for pancreatic cancer zzso
