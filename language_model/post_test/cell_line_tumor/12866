zzso is a common childhood tumor and accounts for zzso of pediatric cancer zzso To investigate the zzso zzso profile and role of zzso and zzso in zzso we assessed the expression of 162 human zzso zzso and zzso in 66 zzso tumors by using real-time zzso zzso We found global zzso of zzso expression in advanced zzso and identified 27 zzso that can clearly distinguish low- from high-risk zzso Furthermore, expression levels of zzso or zzso were low in high-risk zzso tumors, which accounted for global zzso of zzso in advanced disease and correlated with poor zzso zzso for patients with zzso tumors, low expression of zzso can serve as a significant and independent predictor of poor outcome zzso ratio, zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using plausible neural networks to select a combination of 15 zzso that consist of 12 zzso signature, expression levels of zzso and zzso and age at diagnosis, we were able to segregate all patients into four distinct patterns that were highly zzso of clinical zzso In zzso studies also showed that zzso of either zzso or zzso promoted the growth of zzso cell zzso Our results reveal that a combination of 15 zzso can delineate risk groups of zzso and serve as a powerful predictor of clinical zzso Moreover, our findings of growth promotion by zzso zzso implied their potential use as therapeutic targets for zzso
