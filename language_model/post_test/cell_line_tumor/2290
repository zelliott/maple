zzso receptors zzso signaling has dual effect of promoting tumor progression and zzso zzso This study was designed to determine the effect of zzso acid zzso zzso a zzso zzso on the proliferation of oral cancer zzso 

Human oral zzso cell zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso were zzso zzso expression was examined by zzso and zzso production by zzso zzso was examined by zzso Cell proliferation was determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis were performed to determine the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso cell zzso 

zzso was functionally expressed in zzso and zzso zzso Treatment of zzso zzso inhibited the cell growth in a zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso induced zzso via a zzso zzso In addition, combination treatment with zzso zzso and zzso more significantly inhibited cell proliferation compared with zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

Poly zzso effectively zzso oral cancer cell proliferation and can be considered as a candidate to improve the zzso effect of zzso zzso
