zzso oxide zzso is an active free radical gas that plays crucial roles in a broad range of biological zzso Extremely short zzso makes it difficult to use NO directly in zzso It has been suggested that different zzso of NO may lead to quite opposite results on zzso However, the net effect of zzso NO on tumor cell death has been controversial, partly because it is hard to precisely control the amount of NO generated exclusively within the target zzso zzso we have developed a zzso NO zzso zzso zzso zzso in hopes of simulating the actual effects of zzso derived NO on the patterns of cell death as well as investigating its underlying zzso In this study, by using three different tumor cell models, we showed that zzso could steadily transport NO into the target cells with similar delivery efficiencies and exerted a zzso effect on cell zzso In addition, zzso zzso NO could provoke both zzso and necrosis in a zzso zzso While lower NO concentration primarily induced zzso higher NO concentration mainly triggered zzso Moreover, the intrinsic zzso pathway, characterized by rapid zzso overload and subsequent zzso damage, was the collective mechanism responsible for the zzso death in all the three tumor cell zzso Taken together, since this zzso derived NO is cheap to use and easy to zzso zzso might be used as a novel and ideal tool to zzso zzso NO generation and evaluate its net effects in different cellular and experimental settings in the coming zzso
