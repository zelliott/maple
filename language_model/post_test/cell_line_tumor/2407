The zzso controlled tumor protein zzso is essential for survival by mechanisms that as yet are incompletely zzso Here we describe an important role of zzso in response to DNA zzso Upon exposure of normal human cells to zzso zzso rays, the zzso protein level was greatly increased, with a significant enrichment in zzso zzso zzso occurred in a manner dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso and was associated with protective effects against DNA zzso In zzso of zzso cells, zzso experiments showed that zzso forms a complex with zzso and zzso in agreement with its distinct zzso with the zzso of the DNA zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso In cells lacking zzso repair of zzso damage induced by zzso rays was compromised zzso zzso also was shown to interact with zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso led to decreased levels of zzso and zzso in zzso of zzso cells and attenuated their zzso zzso It also attenuated the zzso zzso delay but prolonged the zzso zzso zzso therefore may play a critical role in maintaining zzso integrity in response to zzso zzso
