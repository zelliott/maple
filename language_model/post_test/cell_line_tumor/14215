The pharmacological actions of zzso and zzso drugs, such as heroin, mediate primarily through the zzso zzso zzso It has been proposed that the functional diversity of zzso may be related to alternative zzso of the zzso zzso Although a number of zzso zzso zzso zzso have been reported, their biological function has been zzso In this study, two novel zzso zzso of the human zzso gene were zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 (here called the zzso and zzso retain different portions of zzso zzso In zzso translation of zzso and zzso produced proteins with the predicted molecular zzso The zzso zzso proteins were identical to the zzso zzso up to the first zzso zzso but were different after the first zzso loop zzso zzso and zzso of zzso were present in human zzso zzso cells and human whole brain confirmed by zzso In a zzso binding zzso cells expressing the zzso and zzso do not exhibit binding to zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were demonstrated by zzso and zzso resonance energy transfer between zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso gene showed that zzso and zzso protein zzso at the zzso zzso In zzso cells expressing human zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso reduced binding activity of the zzso zzso These data support a potential role of zzso and zzso proteins as possible biological zzso of human zzso zzso
