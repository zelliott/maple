In order to investigate whether zzso could reverse drug resistance and its possible mechanisms, we treated zzso cells with zzso or zzso in combination with zzso Then cell growth, zzso zzso zzso changes, and expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were assessed by zzso zzso flow zzso electron zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were insensitive to zzso zzso zzso but when zzso with zzso their proliferation was inhibited by zzso zzso significantly, the zzso rate increasing with time and zzso The zzso rate was also significantly zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was decreased significantly, zzso correlation analysis showing significant correlation between the two zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was decreased significantly, while that of zzso was increased, compared to the control zzso There were significant correlations between zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso All these data indicated that zzso could reverse drug resistance of zzso to zzso by zzso expression of zzso and zzso zzso through zzso of zzso The increased zzso sensitivity of zzso zzso to zzso was due to the decreasing proportion of zzso via zzso zzso
