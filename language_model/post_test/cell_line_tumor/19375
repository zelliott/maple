zzso zzso zzso is well known for poor prognosis and short survival because of high recurrence rate even after zzso zzso Today there is no available zzso or zzso test to indicate zzso zzso and this study aims to identify protein markers that can discriminate zzso patients with early recurrence zzso zzso disease relapsed within the first zzso In this study, 103 zzso zzso zzso patients were zzso and 68 of them were used for zzso zzso discovery zzso zzso expression patterns of matched tumor and adjacent zzso zzso from these patients plus 16 normal liver zzso were delineated by the two-dimensional gel zzso differential profiling zzso zzso protein spots were evaluated by zzso zzso zzso zzso that yielded the highest receiver operating characteristic zzso curve value for the zzso zzso of zzso was subsequently identified by tandem mass zzso and the corresponding expression patterns were further confirmed by quantitative zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso analysis with zzso data was also zzso zzso profiling analysis revealed zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso when compared with the zzso and normal liver zzso zzso under the curve zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, elevated zzso level was also detected in the zzso zzso of zzso versus the recurrence-free state (where no cancer zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sensitivity zzso zzso specificity zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines also exhibited higher levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso was closely associated with advanced tumor stages and zzso zzso having implications for increased zzso and aggressive zzso zzso zzso is associated with zzso zzso and thus suggested as a tumor marker for predicting early zzso which may have immediate clinical applications for cancer surveillance after zzso zzso
