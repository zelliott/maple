zzso has been shown to induce a set of complex zzso signaling events known as the unfolded protein response, which is zzso by zzso zzso sensing zzso We have studied the expression of several zzso and zzso zzso genes which participate in the control of cell cycle and proliferation under zzso conditions zzso or zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso It was shown that blockade of zzso zzso signaling zzso the key zzso zzso stress zzso leads to an increase of the expression levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes but suppresses zzso zzso Moreover, the expression level of zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso D3 and zzso zzso is significantly decreased under zzso or zzso deprivation conditions both in control and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso and -5 zzso expressions is increased, but in zzso deprivation conditions zzso zzso of this study have shown that the expression of most tested genes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso is dependent on zzso zzso signaling zzso function both in normal and zzso and zzso deprivation conditions and possibly zzso in cell zzso response to zzso zzso stress associated with zzso
