zzso occurring zzso compounds have long been used as zzso zzso and zzso zzso It has become evident that some of the natural or synthetic zzso have promising clinical potential as both a therapeutic and zzso agent for zzso However, the molecular basis for the zzso activity of zzso has yet to be zzso In this study, we show that zzso a natural zzso zzso zzso cell death in human cervical cancer cells and that zzso oxygen species zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso is critically required for the zzso zzso We also showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso Treatment of zzso induced an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso change, and zzso zzso of zzso zzso membrane potential loss, and cell zzso The zzso was also found to be activated by zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso cell zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso clearly suppressed zzso change and zzso zzso of zzso and subsequent zzso cell death but did not affect zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso zzso or with small interfering zzso of zzso significantly attenuated zzso zzso membrane potential loss and cell death but did not affect zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results indicate that the natural zzso zzso zzso zzso cell death through zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso in human cervical cancer cells and that zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso
