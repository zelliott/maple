Five zzso derivatives from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were evaluated for their zzso zzso zzso effects in a zzso zzso zzso resistant zzso human breast cancer cell line, zzso As a result, a zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited highly potent zzso zzso activity, decreasing the zzso value of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso in the cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The positive control, zzso decreased the zzso value of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso Three zzso zzso 2-4 from this plant, also resulted in a significant decrease in the zzso values of zzso compared with the zzso In particular, compound 1 markedly enhanced zzso zzso and significantly reduced zzso zzso compared with the control, and this effect was more potent than that of zzso a well-known zzso zzso These results suggest that compound 1 of zzso zzso can be developed as a potent zzso agent that reverses zzso zzso in human cancer zzso
