zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso gene located on zzso is a nuclear zzso zzso Since it was reported in 2007 that more than zzso of breast zzso show zzso gene amplification, there has been considerable controversy about its frequency and clinical zzso We set out to assess the frequency and levels of zzso amplification in breast zzso In a total of 106 breast needle biopsy specimens examined by zzso 78 zzso contained more than zzso zzso cancer zzso In zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis with an zzso probe, variously extended zzso signals were found in zzso zzso Some of these were indistinguishable from large clustered signals generally accepted to mean high-level gene amplification in zzso zzso regions zzso and could be considered to represent gene zzso However, with zzso treatment, the zzso signals changed to small compact signals, and are thus thought to represent concentrated zzso FISH using two differently zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso and zzso portions of the zzso gene on touch zzso showed a preserved spatial relationship of the 3' to zzso sequence of zzso therefore strongly suggesting that the zzso consisted of primary zzso Using touch zzso obtained from 51 fresh zzso precise zzso of zzso signals with a correction by the number of zzso 6 on FISH after zzso A treatment revealed that three zzso zzso had zzso cells with one to three additional copies of zzso as zzso zzso This zzso and low level of gene amplification of zzso was also detected as a zzso of the gene by analysis with multiplex zzso probe amplification zzso The consistent results from zzso zzso and zzso in the present study settle the long-standing debate concerning gene amplification of zzso in breast zzso
