The present study was undertaken to determine whether zzso zzso oxygen species zzso might cause growth arrest and zzso in human zzso cancer zzso zzso Our results show that the reduced viability of zzso cells by zzso is due to zzso arrest, but not the zzso zzso The zzso zzso arrest correlated with an induction of zzso B1 and zzso of zzso as well as a zzso increased complex between zzso B1 and zzso zzso zzso was associated with the zzso of zzso and zzso the initiators zzso of the zzso and intrinsic zzso zzso respectively, and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso zzso inhibited zzso and zzso growth zzso in zzso zzso zzso This study further investigated the roles of zzso with respect to zzso arrest and the zzso effect of zzso and the maximum level of zzso zzso was observed zzso after zzso zzso However, a zzso scavenger, zzso notably attenuated zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso Overall, these results suggest that zzso zzso zzso arrest and zzso of zzso cells via a zzso zzso
