zzso spectrum disorders zzso are common, zzso but genetically zzso zzso zzso We recently defined a zzso locus for zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso across the zzso zzso region, followed by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso association study in 276 families with zzso from the zzso zzso Research Exchange, showed that several zzso within the zzso gene were significantly associated with zzso by transmission zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso with a relative risk for zzso of zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso the level of zzso of zzso We found that zzso was zzso in the prefrontal zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso cells, on zzso brain zzso from zzso zzso displayed an accelerated evolution along the lineage leading to humans, suggesting possible involvement of this gene in zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso transport in zzso and zzso Both zzso and zzso of zzso resulted in significantly shorter zzso length in mouse zzso zzso and modified zzso transport zzso As expected for a gene zzso a key polarity zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso in humans may be responsible for subtle changes in zzso zzso
