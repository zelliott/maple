zzso zzso zzso inhibited the growth of human breast zzso and enhanced the effectiveness of tamoxifen zzso in zzso mice with low zzso zzso zzso The present study determined whether the zzso fatty zzso zzso fraction of zzso zzso alone or in combination with zzso has a similar effect and thus can substitute for zzso In a 2 zzso 2 zzso design, zzso mice with established zzso zzso zzso breast zzso zzso were treated as zzso groups 1 and 2 were fed the zzso diet zzso zzso and zzso diet (82 g zzso zzso Groups 3 and 4 with zzso implants (5 zzso were fed the BD and zzso diet, zzso At 8 weeks zzso mice were zzso and zzso were zzso by zzso and real-time zzso zzso zzso and zzso groups significantly decreased zzso area, but the zzso group did zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group was greater compared to the zzso zzso zzso lowered cell proliferation but had no effect on zzso the opposite was observed with zzso zzso suppressed zzso expressions of zzso and zzso growth factor 1 zzso zzso and protein expressions of zzso zzso zzso human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso and amplified in breast 1 zzso while zzso zzso zzso expressions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and protein expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso modulated the effect of zzso on zzso growth zzso In conclusion, zzso reduced the growth of zzso human breast zzso at low circulating zzso alone and combined with zzso in part through zzso of zzso and growth zzso zzso zzso it may substitute for zzso in increasing the effectiveness of zzso
