zzso agents zzso are indispensable for cancer zzso We here report zzso zzso as a new zzso that already has been appreciated for its zzso zzso zzso induced zzso cell cycle arrest in human zzso lung zzso cells zzso and majority of arrested cells were in zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso network and disrupted zzso zzso organization of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso was followed by zzso and subsequent loss in cell viability zzso value of zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso didn't affect the zzso network of normal zzso cells at and below the zzso concentration for zzso zzso zzso also inhibited zzso zzso in zzso system with an zzso of 27 zzso and bound to zzso zzso at a single site with a zzso constant of zzso zzso at 25 zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso the zzso zzso of protein in a zzso zzso The zzso binding zzso was zzso in nature and zzso in 30 zzso zzso zzso with zzso for zzso binding with a Ki of zzso zzso as determined by modified Dixon plot analysis, this suggests zzso may bind zzso at or near the zzso binding site and in zzso modeling study supported zzso Our results establish a novel zzso mechanism of zzso by its direct binding to zzso network in zzso zzso
