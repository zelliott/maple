zzso zzso zzso is a ubiquitous zzso zzso zzso that regulates tumor growth and proliferation in various cancer zzso zzso zzso a novel zzso agent, is designed to target zzso zzso with the aims of cancer growth zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrated that zzso significantly zzso cell growth in the poorly differentiated zzso zzso cell line, and simultaneously zzso zzso zzso zzso transcript levels, protein expression and zzso activity, which differs from its actions in moderately differentiated zzso zzso zzso zzso significant abatement of the zzso cell zzso signaling zzso was also observed in zzso zzso this apparently leads to its strong zzso effect on cell growth and zzso activity in this cell zzso These results suggest that zzso has a novel mechanism affecting cell growth in the poorly differentiated zzso zzso cell zzso
