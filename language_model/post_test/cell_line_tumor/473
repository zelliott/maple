To effectively image living cells with quantum dots zzso particularly for those cells containing high content of native zzso the zzso zzso zzso with a zzso 800 zzso laser was employed and compared with the zzso zzso zzso of 405 zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso The 405 zzso zzso produced the bright zzso zzso signals of cellular zzso but also induced a strong zzso from the native zzso like zzso in zzso The zzso occupied about zzso and zzso of the total signals detected in zzso imaging channel in the zzso and zzso cells, zzso With the zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso signals were lower than those excited with the 405 zzso zzso although the zzso signals were also zzso The 800 zzso zzso generated the best zzso images of zzso zzso with the highest signal ratio of zzso to zzso because the zzso zzso cross section of zzso is much higher than that of the native zzso By means of the zzso the reliable cellular imaging with zzso even for the cells having the high zzso background, can be zzso
