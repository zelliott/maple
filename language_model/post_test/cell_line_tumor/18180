During zzso zzso the production of zzso zzso is strictly and selectively regulated by zzso with a zzso peak at the zzso zzso This study was conducted to clarify the effects of zzso on expression and activity of zzso gene 2 zzso a potent zzso factor for zzso differentiation in zzso zzso zzso zzso from an zzso cell line were cultured and differentiated in zzso zzso with zzso zzso Using real-time zzso the gene expressions of type II zzso zzso zzso and zzso in cultured zzso were zzso from days 0 to 18 of cell zzso The activity and expression of zzso in zzso zzso were zzso after the treatment with zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso real-time zzso and Western zzso zzso The effects of zzso of zzso zzso on zzso expression were also zzso zzso of type X collagen and zzso zzso reached a maximum at the terminal differentiation of zzso The activity and expression of zzso was significantly inhibited in zzso zzso treated with zzso compared to the zzso zzso High molecular zzso did not affect the expression or activity of zzso The expression of zzso zzso was significantly decreased in zzso zzso treated with zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may affect the terminal differentiation of zzso during the zzso zzso by zzso the expression and activity of zzso
