Cell death occurring during zzso or zzso catastrophe, often takes place in conjunction with zzso but the conditions in which zzso catastrophe may exhibit features of programmed cell death are still zzso In the work presented here, we studied zzso cell death by making use of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that has been shown to induce a DNA damage response and subsequent death of zzso cells in zzso without affecting the integrity of the host zzso zzso cells zzso that are deficient in zzso and lack the zzso cell cycle checkpoint respond to zzso infection through a transient zzso zzso We found that the infected zzso cells died through zzso catastrophe with no signs of zzso zzso or DNA zzso Moreover, cell death was independent of zzso zzso factor zzso zzso and zzso These findings were confirmed by zzso zzso of cellular zzso following zzso zzso The zzso used readily revealed zzso in other cell types when it was indeed zzso Taken together the results indicate that in the absence of the zzso checkpoint, zzso catastrophe occurs in these zzso cells predominantly as a result of mechanical disruption induced by zzso zzso and not as a consequence of a suicide zzso
