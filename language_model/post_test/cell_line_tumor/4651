zzso fluorescent molecular imaging zzso may provide an optimal means of detecting zzso zzso organic zzso can be repeatedly excited in zzso by zzso light and zzso can provide large zzso ratios zzso for image detection of target zzso In the literature, many small animal imaging studies are performed with a red excitable zzso zzso zzso to the targeting zzso We report the comparison of the in zzso fluorescent imaging performance of a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso was zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for imaging zzso zzso zzso positive zzso and/or negative zzso human breast cancer cell lines in subcutaneous zzso zzso The zzso were injected zzso at zzso equivalent with and without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 24 h prior as a competitive zzso to zzso Our images show that while both agents target zzso the zzso zzso evidenced a significantly reduced background and enhanced the zzso ratio zzso compared to the zzso zzso shows that zzso causes zzso of the zzso signaling pathway, suggesting that prior to use as a zzso diagnostic agent, potential deleterious effects should be zzso
