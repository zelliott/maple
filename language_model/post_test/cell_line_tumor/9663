We reported previously that zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso of acute zzso leukemia zzso cells through zzso zzso of protein zzso C delta zzso By zzso zzso analysis, zzso nuclear zzso K zzso zzso was identified as being significantly zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso K, a zzso protein for DNA, zzso and zzso or zzso zzso is implicated in a host of processes involving the regulation of gene zzso However, the molecular mechanisms of zzso K reduction and its roles during zzso are still not zzso In the present study, we found that, following the appearance of the zzso zzso K protein was significantly zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We further provided evidence that zzso zzso the zzso of zzso K protein during zzso zzso inhibitor could rescue the reduction of zzso zzso zzso K failed to be decreased in zzso zzso zzso zzso conditional induction of zzso in zzso cells directly zzso zzso K zzso Moreover, the zzso inhibitor also inhibited the zzso of zzso K protein by zzso zzso and the conditional expression of zzso More zzso the suppression of zzso K with zzso zzso significantly induced zzso To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration that zzso activated zzso zzso zzso K protein in a zzso manner, which plays an important role in zzso zzso
