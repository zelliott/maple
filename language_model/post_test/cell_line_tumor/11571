The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso commonly zzso in several zzso including zzso cell lung zzso zzso and, thus, is targeted for treatment using zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso However, despite the efficacy observed in patients with zzso harboring zzso zzso of the zzso general ineffectiveness of zzso in patients with zzso who are current and former smokers zzso identification of novel mechanisms to overcome this zzso Previously, we showed that zzso cells harboring either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso become resistant to the effects of zzso when exposed to cigarette smoke, evidenced by their zzso and prolonged downstream zzso Here, we present zzso as a target zzso cigarette zzso resistance to zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso First, we show that cigarette smoke exposure of zzso cells leads to zzso zzso of zzso which then zzso binds to the zzso zzso causing zzso resistance, contrasting previous observations of zzso binding between inactive zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Next, we show that zzso zzso restores zzso sensitivity in cigarette zzso zzso cells, preventing zzso zzso in the presence of zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso of a zzso zzso zzso restores zzso sensitivity to zzso exposed to cigarette zzso zzso the zzso resistance that emerges even in cigarette zzso zzso zzso zzso cells could be eliminated with zzso zzso Together, these findings offer new rationale for using zzso zzso for treating zzso zzso commonly observed in zzso
