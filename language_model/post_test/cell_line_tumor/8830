The mechanism of the zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso on human zzso cells survival was studied in zzso It was recently shown in zzso cells that death induced by this zzso exhibited several characteristics typical of zzso In this study we used zzso zzso zzso and zzso to evaluate the response of several human zzso cell lines to the zzso zzso zzso We showed that the zzso decreases all three aurora zzso expression and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Most importantly, we show, that zzso specific aurora A zzso inhibitor decreases zzso cell survival, and when used in combination with the zzso significantly zzso zzso against zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells in zzso It was shown that zzso of aurora A zzso by the therapeutic zzso is associated with decreased levels of zzso protein in zzso and induced expression of zzso and zzso zzso
