zzso cell zzso zzso zzso is a rare and peculiar zzso zzso zzso that occurs mainly in the upper zzso zzso It consists of zzso proliferation of zzso zzso cells and zzso cell zzso 

Here, we established a zzso cell line from a zzso arisen in zzso We characterized the feature of a zzso cell line by zzso To know the biological feature, we examined the cell growth, zzso and zzso transition markers of a zzso cell line in comparison with oral zzso cell zzso zzso cell zzso 

By zzso zzso the primary zzso expressed zzso and zzso indicating zzso zzso This zzso also showed zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells resulted in bypass of crisis and maintenance over passage zzso The established zzso cell line was zzso and showed identical zzso characters to those of primary zzso zzso Similar to the primary zzso the cell line showed zzso zzso and had zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso cell line grew slower than two other zzso cell lines zzso and zzso whereas zzso cells had remarkable zzso in comparison with these cell zzso Moreover, zzso cells expressed zzso and zzso zzso at high levels, but did not express zzso zzso This expression pattern of the markers was similar to that of zzso cells, not of zzso zzso 

In the present study, we newly established a zzso cell line with strong zzso This is the first report on the establishment of zzso cell zzso The zzso cell line can be a useful cell model for the study to know the zzso and nature of zzso
