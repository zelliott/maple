A new series of zzso has been zzso and evaluated in both zzso and zzso zzso as potential zzso zzso Interestingly, a selected group of compounds identified from this series exhibited low zzso zzso against critical components of the zzso pathway, targeting zzso zzso and zzso zzso A combination of zzso modeling and zzso relationship studies reveals a possible novel mode for zzso zzso resulting in a zzso zzso zzso zzso by targeting the most zzso zzso zzso of zzso the compound displays zzso activity both in zzso human cancer cell cultures and in three-dimensional tumor zzso Because of its favorable zzso in zzso zzso and zzso properties, we propose that this novel zzso zzso scaffold could prove useful in zzso novel selecting and zzso zzso for clinical zzso
