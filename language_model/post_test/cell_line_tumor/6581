The potential of short interfering zzso zzso to be developed for therapeutic use against cancer depends on the availability of an efficient zzso delivery zzso We have previously shown that a zzso zzso zzso complex that includes an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the targeting zzso can, when zzso zzso specifically and efficiently target primary and zzso tumors and deliver molecules useful in gene medicine, including zzso DNA and zzso zzso Here we explore the ability of this complex to deliver a zzso zzso to tumor cells in zzso and examine the zzso zzso in zzso by zzso zzso We show that the zzso complex maintains its zzso size and, using three separate tumor models, can efficiently and specifically deliver zzso to both primary and zzso disease after systemic delivery, thus increasing the possibility for translating the potent effects of zzso observed in zzso into clinically useful zzso
