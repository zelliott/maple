Human zzso zzso has been shown to be involved in metabolism of zzso important zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This zzso was cloned and expressed in zzso coli, and mass zzso analysis followed by zzso acid sequence analyses indicated that the protein was zzso zzso protein zzso 1 zzso An extensive zzso relationship study showed that zzso was able to catalyze removal of different zzso groups not only from zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso but also from zzso zzso The zzso activity was susceptible to modifications in the zzso zzso but not to changes in the sugar zzso Overall, our data indicated that zzso specifically acts at the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our results may help designing of new therapeutic zzso zzso with desired zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso acid sequence analysis in conjunction with zzso data and metal analysis suggested that zzso contains a zzso zinc zzso Finally, a potential zzso role of zzso is zzso
