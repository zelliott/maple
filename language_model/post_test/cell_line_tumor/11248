zzso delivery has become an important strategy to advance zzso and zzso zzso into clinical zzso However, limited zzso of zzso and the toxicity of some zzso restrict the wider application of this zzso To address these issues we aimed to construct zzso delivery systems which are zzso and smaller than typical zzso Thus, a zzso zzso was zzso to a zzso zzso zzso and then, multiple zzso zzso were linked to a single zzso of human serum zzso via a zzso responsive zzso The zzso zzso showed uniform and zzso size distribution with a diameter of 13 zzso A single zzso zzso contains 15 zzso as well as 15 targeting zzso on the surface of zzso The zzso demonstrated zzso enhancement in zzso cellular delivery of zzso in zzso tumor cells compared to the zzso control zzso and were able to robustly enhance functional activity of the zzso at low zzso zzso without causing zzso Due to their small size, the targeted zzso could penetrate deeply and distribute throughout 3-D tumor zzso whereas the conventional zzso with sizes over 300 zzso could only deliver to the cells on the surface of the tumor zzso As a result of their greater cellular delivery, smaller size, and lack of zzso compared to conventional zzso the zzso zzso may provide an effective tool for targeting zzso to tumors and other diseased zzso
