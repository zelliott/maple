A three-dimensional zzso zzso is a device for generating zzso G force, resulting in an environment with an average of zzso We cultured human zzso zzso cell lines in a zzso zzso zzso and examined the growth properties and zzso of the cells compared to cells cultured under normal zzso conditions zzso zzso The growth rate was significantly inhibited in the zzso group, but without cell cycle zzso zzso activity was also inhibited in the zzso zzso Thus, zzso of zzso zzso proliferation occurred that could be attributed to zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group was significantly enhanced compared to the C zzso This method has significant potential as a treatment of zzso zzso and a tool for understanding zzso zzso
