We have identified tens of thousands of short zzso circular zzso zzso in mouse zzso as well as mouse and human cell zzso These zzso are 200 to 400 base pairs long, are derived from unique zzso zzso and are enriched in the zzso regions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso that are enriched sources of zzso in the adult brain are zzso mosaic for zzso that appear to arise from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso identified by the zzso zzso project may also arise from the zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso We have thus identified a previously unknown DNA entity in zzso cells and provide evidence that their generation leaves behind deletions in different zzso zzso
