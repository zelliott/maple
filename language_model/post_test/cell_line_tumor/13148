zzso cell zzso zzso is a rare but aggressive form of B cell zzso zzso in which therapy resistance is zzso New therapeutic options have extended survival in zzso zzso but have not provided durable zzso zzso are needed to assess the molecular and genetic changes associated with therapy zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines were established from the liver, kidney and lungs of human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso combined zzso mice following treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chemotherapy in combination with zzso The zzso zzso growth patterns in zzso zzso zzso profiles and gene expression differences between these cell lines were characterized to identify major changes associated with therapy zzso zzso cell lines exhibit more aggressive growth patterns and markedly different gene expression profiles compared to parental zzso zzso zzso Thus, these stable zzso cell lines are useful models to further study the molecular basis of drug resistance and to identify clinically relevant molecular targets in zzso
