We attempted to identify zzso that would predict responsiveness of zzso zzso to induction zzso zzso zzso obtained by open biopsy before induction chemotherapy were zzso On the basis of zzso observations at the time of surgery and the zzso grading system, 7 patients were classified as good zzso and the other 6 as poor zzso zzso expression profiling was performed by two-dimensional difference gel zzso Among zzso protein spots observed, the intensity of 33 spots was found to differ significantly between the two patient zzso The proteins for these 33 protein spots were identified by mass zzso The higher expression of zzso 2 zzso in poor zzso was confirmed by Western zzso Gene zzso zzso demonstrated that reduced expression of zzso was associated with increased sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso drugs such as methotrexate, zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of zzso resulted in a decrease of cell zzso invasion and zzso These findings indicated that zzso would be a candidate zzso of response to induction zzso zzso of zzso in open biopsy samples before treatment may contribute to risk zzso therapy for zzso 

The response of zzso patients to induction chemotherapy is critical because the prognosis of zzso is quite zzso whereas that of zzso is zzso Although there are many therapeutic options for zzso no zzso for predicting the response to induction chemotherapy has been zzso We conducted a zzso study aimed at developing a zzso that would predict the response of zzso to induction zzso Using open biopsy samples obtained before chemotherapy, we conducted zzso with our originally devised zzso zzso apparatus and identified zzso 2 zzso as a novel zzso zzso The diagnostic performance of zzso was confirmed by zzso analysis, and its functional properties were investigated in a series of in zzso functional zzso Our findings indicate the possible application of zzso as a zzso zzso in patients with zzso
