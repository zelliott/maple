zzso imaging allows clinicians to zzso the progression of zzso and obtain relevant information for patient diagnosis and zzso zzso to their intrinsic zzso electrical and magnetic properties, zzso are promising contrast agents for imaging dynamic molecular and cellular processes such as zzso zzso zzso activity or gene zzso Until now, zzso have been engineered with targeting zzso such as zzso and peptides to improve zzso specificity and zzso However, excessive loading of zzso can reduce the targeting capabilities of the zzso and reduce the ability of the zzso to bind to a finite number of receptors on zzso zzso the number of zzso delivered to cells by each targeting zzso would lead to higher zzso ratios and would improve image zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso can be used as a scaffold to display targeting zzso and multiple zzso for magnetic resonance imaging of cancer cells and zzso in zzso zzso iron oxide magnetic zzso assemble along the zzso coat, and its zzso end is engineered to display a zzso that targets zzso zzso which is zzso in various zzso Compared with zzso that are directly zzso with targeting zzso our approach improves contrast because each zzso zzso delivers a large number of zzso into the zzso Moreover, the targeting zzso and zzso could be easily exchanged for others, making this platform attractive for in zzso zzso screening and molecular zzso
