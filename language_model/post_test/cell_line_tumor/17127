Lung cancer is the most common visceral zzso in zzso with rapidly increasing zzso in zzso and a zzso poor zzso zzso growth factor zzso has been shown to induce zzso in zzso lung cancer cells, and both zzso and bone zzso protein zzso 2 can suppress the transformed zzso of zzso cells in zzso We examined the effects of zzso another member of the zzso zzso on specific zzso properties of zzso cancer zzso When zzso cancer cells were treated continuously with 100 zzso of zzso a zzso zzso was observed after 2 zzso of zzso The zzso cells appeared larger than zzso cells, grew more slowly, had more zzso zzso activity, and had less zzso activity, as measured by the zzso repeat amplification protocol zzso Invasion through zzso zzso zzso was inhibited in the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso cells had lower zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression than zzso cells, consistent with a less zzso less zzso zzso with increased zzso to death by zzso zzso treatment also resulted in sustained zzso of zzso In zzso zzso studies in the zzso of nude mice confirmed that the zzso cells were significantly less zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso using zzso zzso resulted in cell death within 5 zzso These studies suggest that zzso zzso signaling can induce zzso and thus zzso regulate the growth of zzso lung cancer zzso
