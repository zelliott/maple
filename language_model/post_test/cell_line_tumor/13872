We report evidence of a zzso in the promoter region of zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) that has opposite functional effects in different cellular zzso It is a zzso zzso that is found in Africans but not Europeans or zzso and has been associated with resistance to severe zzso We find that the zzso zzso acts to suppress binding of nuclear proteins to the zzso promoter region in a manner that is specific for cell zzso In zzso the zzso zzso suppresses the binding of a approximately 35 zzso nuclear protein and acts to increase reporter gene zzso In zzso cells, the same zzso acts to decrease gene expression and suppresses the binding of approximately 90 zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso this zzso causes only subtle differences in nuclear protein binding and has no significant effect on gene zzso These findings suggest a mechanism by which a single genetic zzso may cause a broad range of zzso zzso
