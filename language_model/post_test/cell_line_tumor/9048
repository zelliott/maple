zzso belongs to a group of compounds produced by zzso all of them having a bridged zzso zzso ring in their chemical zzso This internal zzso bridge enables them to carry out various zzso but so far, the toxicity of these compounds limited them to be used as medicines in zzso However, the zzso of these compounds are quite different and determined by their different part of chemical zzso zzso it is still possible to find a suitable low toxic compound for drug zzso As for zzso drug developing, the first need is to confirm the zzso activity in zzso 

The zzso changes of human breast cancer zzso cells affected by zzso in culture, and the structural damages of human cancer zzso tissue in zzso mice after zzso injection of zzso were observed after zzso stain and transmission zzso zzso The DNA changes of the human colon cancer zzso were observed in zzso zzso gel zzso 

zzso 1 or 5 zzso in medium for 24 hours induced typical zzso structural changes to zzso cells, the cell surface membrane showed zzso zzso zzso of 1 zzso zzso into the tumor tissue directly did not induce noticeable zzso to the host mice but induced complete damage of the cell structure, the cell surface zzso broken down and the components of the zzso zzso The whole cancer tissue zzso and finally formed a dark color zzso which came off from the skin few days zzso The cured mice showed no tumor recurrence in the six months following zzso The zzso DNA damage was also found in human colon cancer zzso zzso zzso after zzso was injected inside the tumor zzso 

The zzso activity of zzso is confirmed in zzso
