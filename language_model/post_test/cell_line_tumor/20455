zzso tumor cells zzso are shed in peripheral blood at advanced zzso stages of solid zzso zzso detection of zzso predicts recurrence and survival in zzso breast, and prostate zzso However, zzso and variation in size, zzso expression profile, and zzso exposure zzso reliable detection and characterization of zzso We have developed a zzso zzso zzso zzso method to separate prostate cancer cells from white blood cells zzso through forces generated by zzso zzso in zzso zzso Implementation of cell zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dramatically enhanced the zzso capacity and enabled the separation of 5 zzso zzso from 7 zzso zzso with zzso zzso Next, we determined the feasibility of employing zzso zzso zzso to discriminate and divert tumor cells from zzso using zzso blood from healthy volunteers spiked with tumor cells from three prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso For cells fixed with zzso cancer cell recovery ranged from zzso to zzso with purity ranging from zzso to zzso There was no zzso loss of cell viability or cell proliferation subsequent to the exposure of viable tumor cells to zzso For zzso viable cells, tumor cell recovery ranged from zzso to zzso with purity ranging from zzso to zzso These data contribute zzso that zzso zzso zzso can be used to enrich both viable and fixed cancer cells from zzso with very high recovery and zzso
