zzso intravenous zzso zzso is a well-established standard therapy for zzso disease zzso that reduces the risk of developing coronary artery zzso On the other hand, some reports have recommended an alternative therapy with steroids for zzso zzso In this study we investigated the zzso effect of zzso in comparison with zzso at clinical doses in zzso zzso zzso inhibited tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso of nuclear zzso zzso to a greater degree than zzso in human zzso zzso cells and human coronary zzso zzso cells zzso but not in human T zzso zzso zzso zzso was more potent than zzso in reducing the expression of zzso zzso in human zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso and in zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso In zzso exposed to zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso production to a similar degree, whereas the expression of zzso was inhibited more strongly by zzso Our results show that high-dose zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and coronary zzso zzso cells more strongly than that of T cells, whereas zzso zzso the zzso of all three cell zzso These findings suggest that zzso or zzso therapy should be chosen to match the types of cells that are activated during acute zzso
