zzso cells with an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso represent a highly zzso and unique subset of T zzso having properties of innate and zzso immune zzso They have been reported to regulate a variety of immune responses, including the response to zzso and the development of zzso The development and zzso of zzso cells is dependent on zzso presented by the zzso zzso zzso It is widely believed that these zzso are zzso zzso molecules that contain zzso as the zzso zzso In this study, we used a variety of methods to show that zzso zzso for mouse zzso cells need not be zzso including the use of cell lines deficient in zzso zzso and an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso of these zzso required the expression of zzso molecules that could traffic to late zzso the site where zzso is zzso zzso of zzso contain a zzso that could stimulate zzso cells when added to plates coated with zzso zzso zzso The zzso in these extracts are resistant to zzso zzso zzso consistent with the results using live zzso zzso a potential zzso that activated human zzso cell lines, did not activate mouse zzso cell zzso Our data indicate that there may be more than one type of zzso for zzso cells, that the zzso comparing mouse and human may not be zzso and that the search to identify these molecules should not be confined to zzso
