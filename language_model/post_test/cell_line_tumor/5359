zzso zzso zzso which occur naturally in zzso are endowed with many characteristics that make them attractive candidates as building blocks to create new zzso therapeutic zzso In this study, we isolated from an zzso zzso several zzso zzso directed against human zzso zzso zzso a heavily zzso zzso zzso expressed in a variety of zzso These zzso zzso bind a different zzso from those defined by current zzso zzso as shown by binding competition experiments using zzso and surface zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that they bind strongly to zzso tumor cells but show no zzso toward zzso zzso zzso a highly zzso zzso expressed on human zzso When injected into mice zzso with a human zzso zzso up to zzso of the injected dose of one of these zzso was found in the zzso despite rapid clearance of this 15 zzso zzso demonstrating its high potential as a targeting zzso The zzso nature of these new zzso zzso fragments should facilitate the design of new molecules for zzso or diagnosis of zzso zzso
