zzso a zzso in red wine, possesses many pharmacological activities including zzso zzso zzso effects, and nuclear zzso B zzso zzso The present study was designed to evaluate the effects and possible mechanism of zzso in enhancing zzso of lung cancer zzso Human zzso cell lung cancer zzso cells were zzso with or without zzso zzso The surviving fraction and zzso enhancement ratio zzso were estimated by using a colony formation zzso and zzso zzso The zzso distribution was evaluated by using zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso An zzso zzso with immobilized zzso was performed to assess the DNA binding activity of zzso zzso had no direct zzso effect on zzso cells treated for 24 hours with doses up to 25 zzso zzso with zzso significantly enhanced cell killing by radiation, with an zzso up to zzso zzso activated zzso an effect reversed by zzso zzso zzso resulted in a decrease of cells in the zzso phase and an increase in the S zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso enhances the zzso of zzso cells accompanied by zzso zzso and zzso zzso
