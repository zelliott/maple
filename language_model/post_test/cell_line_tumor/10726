zzso an zzso agent isolated from zzso zzso leaves which has been traditionally used for producing natural sleep, has been described as toxic to zzso 

The aim of current study was to investigate the molecular mechanism of zzso toxicity in mouse zzso zzso zzso cell zzso 

zzso zzso was used to determine cell viability in zzso cells treated with zzso zzso cells were detected by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso oxygen species zzso generation was analyzed by flow zzso using a fluorescent zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein expression in zzso cells was performed by Western zzso zzso zzso activity was measured using a fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Treatment with zzso decreased cell viability in a zzso and zzso manner with an zzso value of zzso in zzso treated zzso A zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso was due to a significant increase in the number of zzso zzso Different zzso to characterize zzso were zzso and revealed that zzso zzso played a major role in zzso zzso in zzso zzso Western zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso zzso was zzso by the increase in expression ratio of zzso Furthermore, increase in zzso activity after exposure to zzso for zzso was also zzso zzso of cells with zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso generation, the zzso protein zzso and zzso 

The mechanism of zzso toxicity in zzso cells is mainly associated with the zzso generation, followed by the imbalance of the zzso ratio, and zzso zzso leading to zzso cell zzso zzso of cells with zzso could antagonize the toxicity produced by zzso
