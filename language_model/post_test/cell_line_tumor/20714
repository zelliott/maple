zzso is a typical member of the zzso zzso mobility group zzso zzso family which may function as a zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso has been observed in several human tumors but its role in zzso has not been fully zzso To investigate its significance for human lung cancer zzso we successfully constructed a zzso expression zzso zzso in which sense and zzso sequences targeting the human zzso were linked with a zzso zzso zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso gene expression and protein synthesis were demonstrated via real-time zzso and western zzso We found zzso zzso to significantly inhibit zzso and zzso cell proliferation assessed by zzso zzso incorporation and colony formation zzso Furthermore, flow zzso analysis showed that specific zzso of zzso slowed down the cell cycle at the zzso phase and decreased the populations of zzso and zzso cells at the S and zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso is directly involved in regulation cell proliferation in zzso and zzso cells by influencing signaling pathways involved in cell cycle zzso Thus, our finding suggests that targeting zzso may be an effective strategy for human lung cancer zzso
