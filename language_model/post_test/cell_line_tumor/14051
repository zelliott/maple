The zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with the development of diabetic vascular zzso neurodegenerative disorders and zzso Recently, we isolated a human zzso zzso zzso which can work as a decoy zzso for zzso zzso and named it zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we have isolated the zzso equivalent of zzso from brain zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was generated by alternative zzso and it zzso a zzso protein with a signal zzso but lacking the zzso zzso A zzso experiment revealed that the zzso was actually translated as deduced to yield the zzso protein working as a decoy in zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso detected zzso zzso and protein in the brain, zzso kidney and small zzso of zzso mice, but not of zzso zzso The zzso expression was increased in the kidney of diabetic zzso zzso The present study has thus provided an animal zzso of zzso for clarification of its roles in health and zzso
