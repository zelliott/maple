zzso molecular zzso offer the potential for greater specificity in cancer imaging with zzso zzso zzso zzso We investigate a zzso zzso zzso zzso loaded with zzso zzso zzso in a proof of concept study of targeted zzso zzso zzso are targeted to the LDL cell surface zzso zzso which is zzso in several tumor zzso The zzso zzso presents a zzso and zzso transport system for molecular imaging in zzso 

ITG was zzso and loaded into the core of LDL particles to form a zzso zzso zzso referred to as zzso zzso size was measured by dynamic light zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso solution was measured with CT imaging and signal enhancement was zzso for equivalent zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso cells, which zzso zzso were incubated with zzso with or without native zzso The cells were zzso with CT to characterize particle zzso 

zzso of LDL with ITG was successful and did not compromise the targeting function of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso properties of the zzso solution revealed an effective zzso concentration of zzso zzso In zzso studies of zzso cells demonstrated a significant increase in CT image intensity over control cells when incubated with zzso 

The in zzso results of this study suggest that zzso can provide adequate image enhancement for CT molecular zzso Potential applications include breast imaging and small animal imaging at low zzso zzso In zzso experiments will be required to verify that tumor zzso of zzso is sufficient for enhanced zzso Use at higher zzso zzso as used in conventional CT, will require a further increase in zzso zzso
