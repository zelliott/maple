zzso zzso zzso is a frequent event in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In these zzso zzso activates the zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso Here, we tested the efficacy of a zzso zzso zzso in the in zzso and in zzso growth of zzso cancer cell lines expressing zzso zzso zzso cancer cell lines harboring zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso were treated with zzso zzso zzso This inhibitor led to growth zzso and/or zzso of the zzso cancer cell lines in zzso as well as to tumor zzso of zzso zzso where it efficiently blocked zzso zzso in tumor and zzso zzso This zzso was associated with decreased zzso decreased blood vessel density, coupled with increased zzso However, zzso zzso the growth of zzso deficient zzso cells in zzso and in zzso demonstrating that its effects in this cell line were independent of zzso in the tumor zzso In all cell lines, the zzso inhibitor reduced zzso zzso levels, and zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso by zzso did not affect cell growth nor zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso effectively blocks proliferation and tumor growth of activated zzso zzso cancer cell lines, likely through direct zzso zzso in cancer cells as well as by zzso of the zzso zzso via zzso zzso in zzso zzso Thus, zzso should be considered as a therapeutic agent for the treatment of zzso activated zzso zzso
