The improvement of zzso factor zzso in patients with zzso arthritis is one of the significant clinical effects of zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the effects of zzso an active zzso of zzso and zzso zzso on zzso zzso production using mouse zzso lymphoma, zzso zzso significantly attenuated zzso zzso production in a zzso manner, but zzso affected cell zzso In contrast, zzso did not zzso zzso zzso production until it had strongly inhibited cell proliferation at a concentration of 100 zzso zzso signaling induced protein zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso at a concentration of 30 zzso attenuated zzso zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso zzso at a concentration of 100 zzso did not affect zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso available zzso inhibitor VIII significantly attenuated zzso zzso production at a concentration of 100 zzso without significant zzso of cell zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso production in mouse zzso lymphoma, at least in part, by zzso of zzso zzso
