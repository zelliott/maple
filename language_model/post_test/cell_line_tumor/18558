The zzso of zzso represents a critical step in the pathways leading to the zzso and zzso changes that zzso zzso Upon induction of zzso the large zzso and small zzso zzso zzso active zzso are generated via zzso processing of a zzso zzso zzso Two copies of each individual zzso are generated to form an active zzso The zzso form of zzso zzso specific protein zzso within the cell, thereby producing the zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso once activated in zzso cells, zzso is difficult to detect due to its rapid zzso Interestingly, however, zzso stability and therefore detection of active zzso by zzso analysis can be restored by treatment of cells with a zzso zzso selective zzso suggesting that the active form can be stabilized through zzso zzso The zzso active zzso complex is necessary for its stabilization by zzso as expression of the large zzso alone is not stabilized by the presence of zzso Our results show for the first time, that synthetic zzso zzso not only block zzso activity, but may also increase the stability of otherwise rapidly zzso mature zzso zzso zzso with these findings, experiments with a zzso inactive zzso of zzso show that rapid turnover is dependent on the activity of the mature zzso Furthermore, turnover of otherwise stable active site zzso of zzso is rescued by the presence of the active zzso suggesting that turnover can be zzso in zzso
