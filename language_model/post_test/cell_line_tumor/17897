Spring zzso of carp virus zzso is a zzso associated with systemic illness and mortality in zzso Several diagnostic tests are available for detection of zzso However, most of these tests are time consuming and are not well adapted for zzso zzso In this study, a diagnostic tool for zzso detection based on reverse zzso zzso zzso amplification zzso has been zzso Based on the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso gene of zzso North Carolina zzso zzso four sets (each set containing two outer and two zzso of zzso were zzso zzso and time conditions were zzso to 65 degrees C and 60 zzso respectively, for zzso and zzso using one primer zzso In zzso specificity was evaluated using four different strains of fish zzso and zzso was found to be specific to zzso zzso zzso of zzso NC isolate was used to evaluate the in zzso sensitivity of zzso zzso of the zzso was similar to zzso and detected zzso even at the lowest dilution of zzso zzso zzso The ability of zzso to detect zzso from infected carp was also tested and the zzso detected zzso from all infected zzso The zzso temperature requirements, high specificity and sensitivity, and short incubation time of the zzso zzso make it an excellent choice as a field diagnostic test for zzso
