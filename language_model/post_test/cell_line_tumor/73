To evaluate the effects of zzso stem cell zzso transplantation on the growth of liver zzso 

zzso were isolated from the bone zzso of zzso zzso zzso cancer cells were isolated from the zzso zzso of rat and zzso zzso zzso rats were randomly divided into 3 equal groups: mixed transplantation group undergoing zzso and transplantation of cancer cells mixed with zzso into the liver, zzso IV transplantation group undergoing injection of zzso into the zzso zzso and control group undergoing only zzso transplantation into the zzso MR imaging was performed s at days 3, 6, 9 and 12 after modeling to measure the maximum cross section area of the zzso At day 12 the rats were killed after MR imaging with their zzso taken out to undergo HE zzso and pathological zzso zzso was used to detect the expression of vascular zzso cell growth factors zzso zzso zzso a tumor zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso a nuclear zzso necessary in the DNA zzso 

No significant evidence of tumor formation was detected by zzso at days 3 and 6 after modeling in all rats and tumor zzso were observed since day zzso The maximum cross section areas of tumor of the mixed transplantation group and zzso IV transplantation group were significantly larger than that of the control group at days 9 and 12 zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso F zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso expression levels of the two study groups were both significantly higher than that of the control group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso while the zzso gene expression levels of the 2 study groups were both significantly lower than that of the control group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso expression level of the mixed transplantation group was significantly higher than that of the control group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso however, there was no significant difference in the zzso expression level between the zzso IV transplantation group and the control group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso There was no significant difference in the tumor zzso index between the 2 study groups and the control group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso transplantation increases the expression of zzso and zzso while decreases the expression of zzso gene in cancer cells, thus favoring the tumor zzso
