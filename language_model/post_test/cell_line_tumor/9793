zzso tumor zzso is the most frequent zzso zzso of zzso a zzso component is observed in zzso to zzso of zzso We demonstrate for the first time that zzso zzso are associated with expression of zzso a zzso factor known to specify zzso cell fate during muscle zzso In a panel of 20 zzso zzso was identified in 13 of 13 tumor samples with zzso zzso but was absent in 7 of 7 tumors lacking a zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso is expressed in the zzso zzso and zzso compartment of developing mouse zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression in human embryonic kidney zzso cells influenced cell migration in in zzso zzso zzso of zzso were consistently associated with zzso expression in zzso and zzso of zzso expression in zzso cells was zzso correlated with the level of zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate abundant zzso and absence of zzso expression in a novel cell line zzso isolated from the zzso portion of a zzso bearing a zzso deletion of the zzso zzso We zzso that zzso sets zzso cell fate in developing kidney but is normally suppressed by zzso during the zzso transition leading to zzso Loss of zzso permits zzso zzso expression in a subset of zzso with zzso zzso
