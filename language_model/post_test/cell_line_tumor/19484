In the present study, optimum culture conditions for the production of zzso zzso zzso in submerged culture of an edible zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and their zzso effects on zzso cell zzso proliferation and insulin zzso were zzso The maximum zzso growth zzso g zzso and zzso production zzso g zzso in submerged flask culture were achieved in a medium containing 30 g zzso zzso 2 g zzso soy zzso and 2 zzso zzso at an initial pH zzso and temperature 25 degrees zzso In the zzso zzso under zzso zzso the zzso of zzso biomass and zzso reached a maximum level of zzso and zzso g zzso zzso Interestingly, supplementation of deep sea water zzso into the culture medium significantly increased both zzso biomass and zzso production by zzso and zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso were proved to be zzso zzso and were able to increase proliferation and insulin secretary function of rat zzso zzso cells, in a zzso zzso In addition, zzso also zzso reduced the zzso zzso in zzso cells indicating the mode of the zzso role of zzso on zzso zzso
