The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were isolated from the healthy leaves and bark of the Japanese zzso tree, zzso zzso The zzso species were identified by their characteristic culture zzso and molecular zzso For the first time, the test zzso were screened for the production of zzso in modified liquid zzso The presence of zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso methods of zzso The maximum amount of zzso production in zzso zzso was recorded as zzso zzso The production rate was increased to zzso than that found in the culture broth of earlier reported zzso zzso zzso The extracted zzso zzso showed a strong zzso activity in the in zzso culture of tested human cancer cells by zzso zzso indicating that the increase in zzso concentration zzso increased cell zzso A zzso screening for zzso a unique gene in the formation of the zzso zzso confirmed the molecular blueprint for zzso zzso The results designate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso is an excellent candidate for an alternate source of zzso supply and can also serve as a potential species for genetic engineering to enhance the production of zzso to a higher zzso
