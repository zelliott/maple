zzso similarity analysis has been instrumental in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Genes with correlated expression profiles tend to be functionally zzso However, the majority of functionally associated genes turn out to be zzso One conceivable reason is that the expression of a gene can be sensitively dependent on the zzso cellular zzso The intrinsic state change has to be zzso zzso by zzso zzso To capture such dynamic zzso between zzso a concept termed zzso zzso zzso has been introduced zzso LA offers a scoring system to guide a zzso search for critical cellular players that may interfere with the zzso of a pair of zzso thereby weakening their overall zzso Although the LA method works in many cases, a direct extension to more than two genes is hindered by the zzso of zzso Here we introduce a strategy of finding an zzso zzso projection to zzso LA for multiple zzso A web site is constructed that performs zzso LA zzso for any zzso group of zzso We apply this scoring system to study zzso protein complexes by using the zzso zzso protein complexes database of the Munich Information Center for zzso zzso Human genes are also investigated by profiling of 60 cancer cell lines of the National Cancer zzso In particular, our system links the expression of the Alzheimer's disease hallmark gene zzso zzso precursor zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2, zzso zzso and other Alzheimer's zzso zzso
