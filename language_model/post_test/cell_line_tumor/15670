zzso peptides constitute a zzso among the zzso peptides analyzed in zzso based shotgun zzso zzso For larger zzso including the human zzso the zzso zzso pool is very large, which zzso some form of sample zzso By carefully choosing the sample zzso and separation methods applied as shown here for the combination of zzso immobilized pH zzso zzso focusing zzso and zzso significantly increased information content can be zzso Relatively low standard zzso were obtained for such zzso zzso in terms of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and retention time zzso zzso for a 350 zzso zzso for a selection of highly complex zzso zzso Using zzso zzso experimental and predicted zzso were in relative good zzso However, based on our data, retention time prediction zzso need further improvements in accuracy to match state-of-the-art zzso zzso zzso General trends of zzso zzso shifts induced by common modifications including zzso and zzso modifications are zzso zzso of zzso and zzso shift zzso zzso by approximately zzso zzso units, making the peptides more zzso Additionally, a novel zzso shift zzso zzso zzso was found associated with zzso Met zzso Further, the effects of these modifications as well as zzso zzso were investigated in terms of zzso observed retention time shifts in the zzso separation zzso Clearly, zzso zzso influences on zzso zzso and retention time can be accurately and zzso measured using zzso zzso and zzso zzso Even at modest mass accuracy zzso zzso the inclusion of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or retention time zzso zzso criteria are highly zzso for human zzso zzso The applications of using this information to identify zzso modified peptides and improve data analysis zzso are zzso
