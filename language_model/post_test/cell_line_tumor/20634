To test the activity of novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on normal and zzso zzso in comparison to zzso 

Human zzso zzso and human and zzso melanoma cells were used to measure effects on proliferation and colony formation in zzso and soft zzso Cell zzso and zzso were also zzso zzso was used to measure gene zzso 

Novel zzso inhibited proliferation and colony formation by melanoma cells in a similar fashion to zzso having no effect on zzso These effects were accompanied by zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso In normal zzso zzso zzso and zzso had stronger zzso effects than zzso and zzso and inhibited zzso zzso The cells tested expressed genes zzso zzso and zzso that activate or zzso vitamin zzso 

Novel zzso show potent zzso activity in zzso with zzso and zzso being excellent candidates for zzso zzso
