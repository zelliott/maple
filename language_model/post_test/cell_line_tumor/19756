zzso and its zzso are being tested as new zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso and this complex zzso the activity of zzso target of zzso which leads to zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso resulting in blockade of translation zzso We have found that zzso zzso the growth of zzso breast cancer zzso The zzso of zzso target of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is inhibited by zzso and cells are arrested in the zzso phase, as determined by growth zzso zzso cell sorting analysis, and zzso incorporation zzso zzso causes zzso of zzso D3 zzso zzso zzso loss of zzso zzso zzso 4, zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso D3 protein decreases after zzso treatment, but not its zzso whereas the synthesis or zzso of zzso D1 protein is not affected by the zzso Additionally, zzso caused zzso of zzso forms of zzso D3 zzso zzso zzso blocked the effect of zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso the activity of the zzso showing that the effect of zzso on zzso D3 is zzso zzso zzso This effect depends on the activity of zzso because zzso a zzso zzso against zzso is able to block both the induction of zzso activity and the zzso D3 zzso due to zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso gene expression by using small interfering zzso blocked the zzso effects on zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso causes a zzso arrest in zzso breast cancer cells that is associated with a differential zzso and subsequent zzso of zzso D3 zzso
