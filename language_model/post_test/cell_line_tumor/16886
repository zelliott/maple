For targeted imaging and therapy of zzso zzso zzso we established a zzso promoter zzso containing zzso zzso promoter and zzso B virus zzso II zzso to control downstream expression of reporter and therapeutic zzso 

We combined zzso promoter and zzso to establish a zzso zzso promoter, then developed a zzso zzso zzso containing zzso and zzso genes controlled by zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso The selective zzso activity of zzso was zzso by zzso imaging zzso and the function of zzso was determined by in zzso zzso and zzso 

The zzso expression driven by zzso was higher than that driven by zzso promoter in zzso cell zzso zzso induced zzso was observed only in zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso signal were detected on zzso tumors but not in parental zzso The zzso tumors derived from zzso zzso expressing cells accumulated zzso whereas the zzso tumors did zzso The zzso zzso tumors expressed adequate zzso zzso and the tumor zzso after zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso is a potential candidate promoter for targeted imaging and gene therapy of zzso
