zzso zzso zzso were designed on the basis of an analogue of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and evaluated against 11 zzso zzso zzso zzso The identification of critical zzso acid zzso highly zzso in the cap region of zzso guided the design of the zzso zzso which were expected to bear a maximum common zzso required to target the whole zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso profile was observed for several compounds, which was comparable, if not superior, to that of zzso A promising zzso activity was found for selected zzso against lung and colon cancer cell zzso Further zzso of selected candidates led to compounds with an improved selectivity against zzso over the other zzso zzso analysis was used to compare one of the best candidates with the natural zzso zzso in an effort to define a general zzso that might be useful in the design of surrogates of zzso zzso as potent and zzso zzso
