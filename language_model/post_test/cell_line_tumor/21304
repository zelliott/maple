zzso zzso signaling controls pancreatic development and zzso zzso zzso signaling is associated with several pancreatic zzso Here we investigated the link between zzso signaling and primary zzso in the human developing pancreatic ducts and in cultures of human pancreatic duct zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso We show that the onset of zzso signaling from human zzso to fetal development is associated with zzso of zzso signaling components zzso and zzso in duct primary zzso and a reduction of zzso in the duct zzso zzso zzso and zzso localized to primary zzso of zzso and zzso cells, which may maintain high levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings indicate that primary zzso are involved in pancreatic development and zzso tissue zzso
