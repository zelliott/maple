The objective of this study is to develop an effective zzso zzso involving zzso zzso with enhanced efficacy and lessened systemic zzso for cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso which consisted of zzso and zzso bearing zzso acid, were zzso characterized for zzso properties, in zzso degradation and zzso release behaviors from the zzso and evaluated their zzso zzso The zzso solutions of all these zzso showed a zzso zzso transition behavior for zzso application near room zzso The zzso incorporated into the zzso was proven to be stable in zzso over 15 zzso The in zzso zzso of the zzso was verified to be effective against four kinds of human cancer cell zzso The in zzso zzso activity study with zzso colon cancer cell zzso mice showed that the zzso injected zzso zzso inhibited the tumor growth more effectively relative to zzso alone zzso zzso zzso in tumor zzso
