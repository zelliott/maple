Cancer stem cells zzso drive tumor zzso zzso and zzso The zzso is critical to the fate of zzso We have found that a normal stem cell zzso line from human prostate zzso is recruited into zzso cells by nearby, but zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso 

It is unknown whether this recruitment of zzso into zzso by zzso zzso is specific to zzso zzso Thus, we used zzso to examine the effects of neighboring zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso on zzso 

After 2 weeks of zzso zzso zzso zzso showed elevated zzso zzso and zzso zzso increased zzso increased colony formation, decreased zzso zzso and formation of aggressive, highly zzso zzso structures from single cells in zzso all characteristics typical of cancer zzso These zzso characteristics did not occur in zzso zzso with zzso The zzso zzso with zzso retained zzso capacity, as evidenced by multiple passages zzso 3) of structures formed in zzso zzso zzso also showed molecular zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso and zzso evidence of zzso transition typical for conversion to zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso also occurred in zzso during zzso transformation induced by zzso zzso with zzso 

These data indicate that zzso can recruit nearby zzso into a zzso zzso but zzso do zzso Thus, the recruitment of zzso into zzso by nearby zzso is dependent on the zzso originally used to zzso transform the zzso
