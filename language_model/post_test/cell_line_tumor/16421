The molecular zzso of natural zzso zzso zzso is not well zzso We conducted zzso sequencing and identified zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in 2 of 4 patients with zzso Further validation of the prevalence of zzso zzso was determined by zzso sequencing and high-resolution melt zzso analysis in an additional 61 zzso In total, 23 of 65 zzso cases zzso zzso zzso zzso characterization of the zzso zzso support its involvement in zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to increased cell zzso Moreover, treatment of both zzso and zzso zzso cell lines with a novel zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso reduction of zzso zzso reduced cell zzso and increased zzso zzso targeting the zzso zzso zzso could be a promising therapy for patients with zzso 

Gene zzso causing zzso have not been fully zzso Through zzso sequencing, we identified zzso zzso of zzso that may play a significant role in the zzso of zzso Our findings have important implications for the management of patients with zzso
