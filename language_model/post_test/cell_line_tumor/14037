A mathematical model for describing the cancer growth dynamics in response to zzso agents administration in zzso models is zzso The model consists of a system of ordinary differential equations involving five parameters (three for describing the zzso growth and two for describing the drug zzso zzso growth in zzso animals is zzso by an exponential growth followed by a linear zzso In treated animals, tumor growth rate is decreased by an additional factor zzso to both drug concentration and zzso zzso The mathematical analysis conducted in this paper highlights several interesting properties of this tumor growth zzso It suggests also effective strategies to design in zzso experiments in animals with potential saving of time and zzso For example, the drug concentration threshold for the tumor zzso the delay between drug administration and tumor regression, and a time index that measures the efficacy of a treatment are derived and zzso The model has already been employed in several drug discovery zzso Its application on a data set coming from one of these projects is discussed in this zzso
