zzso cell zzso zzso is an aggressive zzso zzso with few patients achieving long-term survival with current treatment zzso zzso therapy is effective in reducing the tumor zzso however, patients eventually zzso due to minimal residual zzso Having demonstrated efficacy in other zzso the effectiveness of zzso zzso zzso for minimal residual zzso was zzso We demonstrated that zzso cells zzso primed with zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso T cells that recognized and destroyed both zzso cell lines and primary zzso in zzso In addition, in zzso studies demonstrated that zzso transferred zzso T cells were able to significantly inhibit tumor growth in mice with minimal residual zzso zzso when combined with zzso chemotherapy, adoptive zzso therapy was able to significantly extend the survival of the mice by further reducing the tumor zzso These results clearly show that zzso cellular zzso is effective in treating minimal residual zzso paving the way for future clinical zzso
