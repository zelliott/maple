zzso specific patterns of zzso zzso zzso vary with age, can be altered by environmental factors, and are often abnormal in human disease yet the cellular consequences of DNA zzso are incompletely zzso Although the bodies of highly expressed genes are often extensively zzso in plants, the relationship between zzso zzso and expression is less clear in zzso zzso We performed zzso analyses of DNA zzso and gene expression to determine how the pattern of zzso zzso zzso with zzso and to assess the relationship between zzso of zzso and zzso portions of the gene zzso We found that dense zzso zzso is far more common than previously recognized or expected zzso yet first zzso are relatively spared compared to more downstream zzso and zzso zzso zzso surrounding the zzso start site zzso is zzso from zzso within more downstream regions suggesting that there are at least two classes of zzso zzso Whereas zzso surrounding the zzso is tightly linked to zzso zzso zzso of more downstream regions is zzso with the magnitude of gene zzso zzso we found that DNA zzso downstream of the zzso in the region of the first zzso is much more tightly linked to zzso zzso than is zzso in the upstream promoter zzso These data provide direct evidence that DNA zzso is interpreted zzso in different regions of the gene body and suggest that first zzso zzso blocks transcript zzso or vice zzso Our data also show that once zzso downstream zzso is not a significant impediment to zzso zzso Thus, the consequences of most zzso DNA zzso must extend beyond the zzso of zzso zzso data and gene expression zzso data have been submitted to the zzso online database zzso number zzso Supporting information including expanded methods and ten additional figures in support of the manuscript is zzso
