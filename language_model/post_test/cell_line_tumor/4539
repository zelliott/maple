Taking into consideration the key role of the complement system in zzso diseases, we investigated molecular and cellular properties of the human complement zzso zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso looking at its expression in several human zzso pathological zzso 

Several zzso were generated and used for zzso and Western zzso analyses to address zzso expression and its regulation in zzso on cell lines of zzso cells and zzso cell zzso Furthermore, zzso distribution was investigated in control zzso zzso and 116 biopsy specimens from patients with zzso diseases, including lupus zzso zzso 

zzso is a highly zzso protein with an apparent molecular mass of 65 to 95 zzso expressed by zzso and zzso zzso zzso is particularly zzso in response to zzso gamma treatment, but was unaffected by the other inflammatory zzso such as tumor necrosis factor alpha and transforming growth factor zzso In normal human zzso zzso zzso was not zzso However, zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso of zzso specimens in association with zzso G zzso zzso zzso intensity correlated with disease zzso zzso was found in the zzso area of zzso of samples classified as World Health Organization class IV with active zzso zzso zzso was not detected by means of zzso in zzso from patients with other zzso zzso 

Our data indicate that zzso expression is tightly regulated and altered in certain disease zzso zzso may be used as a unique zzso of diagnosis and disease activity in patients with zzso
