zzso zzso is a powerful approach to study selective cell killing based on zzso We show that loss of zzso function is zzso lethal with breast cancer 2, early onset zzso zzso whereas there was no impact on cell growth and viability in zzso zzso The frequency of both spontaneous and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased by zzso times when zzso was depleted in zzso cells, with little to no effect in zzso zzso The absence of both zzso and zzso resulted in extensive zzso zzso especially zzso zzso zzso zzso and S zzso zzso zzso form equally well in the presence or absence of zzso indicating that zzso can respond to DNA zzso breaks and replication zzso independently of zzso zzso thus is an independent and alternative repair zzso of zzso zzso and a target for therapy in zzso zzso
