zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso are zzso components of zzso zzso for zzso of cancer and other human zzso zzso belongs to a family of zzso zzso sharing sequence and structure zzso In a preliminary attempt to define an active zzso zzso of minimum size we have generated proteins with deletions at the zzso and at the zzso An zzso zzso deletion zzso of zzso displayed defective zzso activity, drastically reduced zzso but increased ability to interact with zzso inducing their zzso at low zzso A zzso zzso deletion zzso showed instead a moderate reduction in zzso zzso A substantial zzso of secondary structure was evidenced by zzso transformed infrared zzso zzso in the zzso zzso It can be hypothesized that the defective functions of zzso are due to zzso of its spatial zzso
