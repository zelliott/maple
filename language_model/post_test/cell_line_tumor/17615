zzso that lead to the emergence of resistance to zzso are commonly observed among tumor zzso Some of the proteins affected are integral parts of the zzso cascade such as zzso and zzso members of the zzso zzso zzso is a small zzso that accumulates in zzso of a variety of tumor cells and interferes with their zzso zzso Because this interference ultimately triggers zzso in many affected cell lines, we examined the effect of zzso zzso zzso on the response of cells to zzso Our results showed that high levels of zzso did not block the ability of zzso to induce cell zzso However, unlike the zzso response that followed zzso treatment of cells with moderate zzso levels, cells resistant to a variety of zzso stimuli by virtue of zzso zzso succumbed to zzso by zzso Thus, this dual ability of the zzso compound zzso to induce zzso and necrosis may represent an added advantage by expanding its spectrum of action toward genetically altered tumor cells incapable of zzso
