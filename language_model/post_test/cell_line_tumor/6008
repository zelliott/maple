zzso zzso is an integral membrane protein comprised of three species as zzso an zzso zzso a high zzso and a complex zzso zzso zzso Although zzso channels mediate several cellular responses, the domain regulating its zzso and cell surface trafficking and the mechanisms governing its zzso and degradation have not been zzso This study characterizes the role of the zzso zzso domain by zzso the zzso at zzso 307 and expressing the zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed that the zzso was zzso primarily to the high zzso species consistent with its retention in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso followed by zzso zzso revealed that the zzso and zzso could zzso whereas zzso zzso showed that this interaction inhibited zzso from maturing into the zzso species and reaching the cell zzso Additional inhibitor studies indicated that the degradation of the zzso was via zzso whereas zzso was zzso by zzso Analysis of the pathways important in zzso zzso revealed partial zzso of zzso with many molecular constituents of the zzso machinery that include zzso zzso zzso II, zzso and zzso However, zzso zzso together with the disruption of zzso zzso by zzso suggest that zzso does not engage this zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and pharmacological studies revealed that zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso these results indicate that the zzso and trafficking of zzso are regulated by the zzso domain, whereas zzso of long lived zzso channels occurs in a manner that is distinct from classical zzso zzso
