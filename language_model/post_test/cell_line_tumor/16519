zzso in zzso zzso zzso is emerging as a zzso protein that affects several cellular processes and zzso Although the zzso gene is rarely zzso in zzso cancer, it is frequently silenced through promoter zzso Previous studies have reported loss of zzso zzso of the closely linked zzso and zzso zzso in both zzso and lung zzso zzso promoter zzso is a marker of poor survival in zzso cell lung cancer zzso However, zzso zzso has not been previously studied in lung zzso zzso we wanted to determine if zzso is silenced through promoter zzso in lung cancer and whether this zzso is associated with zzso of the zzso locus or zzso of the zzso zzso Three zzso markers for the zzso locus were zzso for zzso in 64 zzso specimens and matching normal zzso zzso zzso of both genes was determined using zzso specific zzso in primary zzso zzso of the three markers was found in zzso of the zzso zzso within the zzso locus was less common in zzso zzso zzso than in zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso or large cell zzso zzso zzso zzso However, this zzso was not accompanied by zzso promoter zzso which was found in only two zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of the specimens showed zzso zzso which was more common in zzso zzso than in SCC zzso Western zzso revealed that zzso was expressed in a subset of lung tissue specimens but there was marked variation between patients rather than between cancer and matching zzso tissue zzso In conclusion, we have shown that promoter zzso of the zzso gene does not extend to the zzso zzso gene in lung cancer, but zzso is found at both zzso The variable levels of zzso expression were not associated with promoter zzso and may be regulated through other cellular zzso
