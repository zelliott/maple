zzso zzso has been widely used in tumor gene zzso zzso is a member of growth zzso factors and a potent zzso gene which could induce zzso of many tumor zzso This study was to investigate the zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso gene on the proliferation of human prostate cancer zzso cells in zzso and in zzso and to explore its zzso 

zzso was obtained by zzso zzso After zzso of zzso zzso into zzso cells, the expression of zzso was detected by reverse zzso chain zzso the influence of zzso zzso on cell proliferation was evaluated using zzso zzso Cell zzso was assessed using zzso zzso and flow zzso zzso was performed to detect the zzso levels of the zzso of zzso genes such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso nude mice bearing zzso tumors were zzso injected with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth was zzso All nude mice were killed at the end of the experiment to observe the growth of zzso The expressions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins in tumor zzso were detected by zzso 

Human zzso gene was successfully transcribed in zzso cells and induced zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso of cell proliferation was significant in zzso zzso zzso growth was significantly inhibited in the zzso group as compared with that in the zzso group and the PBS group ( zzso The weight zzso rate was zzso in the zzso zzso The expressions of zzso and zzso were zzso and the expressions of zzso and zzso were zzso in the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso gene exhibits zzso ability in human prostate cancer zzso cells in zzso and in zzso and zzso zzso This may be related to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso
