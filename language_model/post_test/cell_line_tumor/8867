The stem and root of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been traditionally used in Thailand to treat fever, alcoholic zzso zzso and zzso An zzso extract of zzso zzso showed good zzso activity against several cancer cell lines including zzso zzso zzso and zzso As there has been no previous reports on chemical constituents of zzso zzso this study is aimed to isolate the pure compounds with zzso zzso 

Five pure compounds were isolated from zzso extract of zzso zzso stem using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso column zzso and were tested for their zzso effects against zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines using the zzso B zzso zzso 

Among five compounds, zzso zzso possessed very potent activity against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso also showed good activity against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The activity of 2 zzso zzso against zzso cell was ten times higher than that of the positive control, zzso zzso drug, zzso zzso All compounds did not show any zzso with normal cells at the concentration of 1 zzso 

This is the first report of compounds 2 and 3 on zzso activity and based on the zzso activity of extracts and pure compounds isolated from zzso zzso zzso it might be suggested that this plant could be useful for treatment of zzso
