A key molecular feature of zzso zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso of the nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso We investigated in zzso the effects on zzso survival and zzso of a specific zzso of zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso 

Selective zzso zzso was carried out by zzso of zzso and zzso zzso lines with an inactive form of zzso and by exposing these lines and tumor cells from 10 patients with zzso syndrome zzso to zzso a new zzso zzso The zzso nuclear zzso of zzso was analyzed by zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso zzso zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso potential zzso as well as zzso zzso The expression of zzso family zzso and zzso was studied by zzso 

zzso zzso zzso resulting from zzso or from incubation with zzso allowed a zzso of zzso zzso zzso As shown by zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the nuclear zzso of zzso and induced a potent zzso response in zzso lines and in tumor cells from patients with SS while preserving the viability of both peripheral blood zzso from healthy donors and of zzso T cells from SS zzso Moreover, zzso death induction by conventional zzso agents zzso and zzso was zzso by zzso Finally, zzso zzso of zzso cells was associated with an zzso of zzso zzso and a decrease of zzso 

These results indicate that zzso zzso represents a promising strategy for the treatment of advanced stages of zzso
