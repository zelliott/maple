zzso zzso zzso strains cause diphtheria in zzso The zzso zzso zzso isolate zzso produces three distinct zzso zzso that contain zzso zzso and zzso making up the zzso zzso The zzso zzso are known to mediate bacterial adherence to zzso zzso zzso However, to date little is known about the expression of different zzso in various clinical zzso and their importance in bacterial zzso Here, we characterized a large collection of zzso zzso clinical zzso for their zzso gene pool by zzso and for the expression of the respective zzso by zzso with zzso against Spa zzso zzso with the role of a zzso factor, the zzso zzso were found to be prevalent among the zzso and most significantly, zzso adherence to zzso zzso cells was strictly correlated with zzso that were positive for the zzso zzso By comparison, the zzso were zzso for the presence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso as a model host for infection, we show here that strain zzso rapidly killed the zzso the zzso similar to zzso that were positive for toxin and all zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso of zzso lacking zzso zzso or devoid of toxin and zzso zzso exhibited delayed killing of zzso with similar zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso that lack one, two, or all three zzso types were also attenuated in zzso This work zzso the important role of zzso in zzso zzso and provides a simple host model to identify additional zzso zzso
