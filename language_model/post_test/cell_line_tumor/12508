The aim of this study was to evaluate the zzso value of the zzso expression in patients with head and neck zzso and to examine the possible role of the zzso signaling in zzso 

zzso zzso was performed on 59 zzso zzso head and neck zzso surgical specimens for zzso and zzso zzso The head and neck cancer cell line, zzso with or without zzso expression of the zzso domain of zzso zzso was also used for examining the zzso capacity in zzso and in zzso 

The study included 59 patients with a median age of zzso zzso zzso Patients harboring tumors with both high-level zzso zzso and high-level zzso zzso had a worse overall survival than the patients only with zzso or zzso as well as the patients with low-level zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso survival rate and the median survival time were zzso and zzso for zzso patients, while they were zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso expression of the active zzso zzso in zzso cells greatly enhanced cell migration and zzso in zzso and zzso capacity in zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso and zzso is associated with poor overall survival in patients with head and neck zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso which is possibly initiated by the direct interaction between zzso and zzso in head and neck cancer, zzso tumor cells with a more aggressive zzso
