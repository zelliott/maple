zzso zzso zzso the growth and proliferation of a wide range of human cancer cells, but the underlying mechanism is largely zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso zzso and zzso proliferation of zzso pancreatic cancer cells by zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso Cell viability and zzso were measured by zzso zzso and flow zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso were used to examine the expression of zzso and zzso The zzso zzso and zzso migration were employed to assess tube formation and cell zzso zzso cancer mouse zzso were established to investigate the in zzso zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used to detect the zzso rate and protein expression in tumor zzso zzso inhibited the proliferation of pancreatic cancer cells in a time and zzso manner and decreased the expression of zzso and zzso in zzso Furthermore, medium from zzso zzso cells inhibited the zzso migration, and tube formation of zzso zzso significantly reduced the growth of pancreatic cancer mouse zzso accompanied by an induction of zzso zzso of zzso and reduction of zzso and zzso Our data indicate that suppressing the expression of zzso and zzso may be one of the molecular mechanisms by which zzso zzso zzso and zzso the growth and zzso of human pancreatic cancer zzso
