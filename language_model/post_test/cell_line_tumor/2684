A series of zzso and zzso zzso derivatives were zzso and evaluated for their potential as zzso zzso The designed molecules were zzso from either fully protected zzso or the corresponding zzso zzso The zzso derivatives were used for zzso zzso investigations against zzso zzso activities of all the zzso derivatives were evaluated using the zzso forms of the zzso zzso was a very weak inhibitor of zzso zzso and zzso derivatives are zzso zzso of zzso and the active site zzso zzso zzso binds to the zzso after the elimination of the zzso Among the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso derivatives showed potent zzso activities in zzso zzso against various leukemia cell zzso On the basis of the overall profile, zzso and zzso zzso derivatives exhibited potential for further zzso
