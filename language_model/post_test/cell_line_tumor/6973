Regulators of G protein signaling zzso are proteins that bind specifically to activated zzso zzso of zzso G proteins to terminate signaling by both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may affect their activity in G zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso and the cell permeable zzso analog zzso zzso which lead to protein zzso C zzso zzso enhanced zzso distribution of zzso and zzso in prostate zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso specific zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso and examined the effects of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on their zzso zzso zzso and zzso were predominantly localized in the nucleus and zzso regions whereas zzso was mostly zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and the cell permeable zzso analog zzso zzso previously found to activate zzso in the zzso cells, enhanced zzso zzso of zzso and zzso but induced nuclear zzso of zzso The zzso specific zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso negated the effects of zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso a downstream zzso of the zzso zzso zzso affects zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso specific zzso zzso These observations provide further insight into zzso ability to fine-tune multiple membrane zzso signaling in zzso
