zzso is an aromatic zzso isolated from zzso cellular slime zzso We found that zzso has a potent zzso growth effect measured by zzso zzso in zzso human zzso zzso The zzso was associated with reduced zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso growth factor zzso zzso of zzso in a zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso diminished zzso zzso of zzso zzso at zzso a zzso binding site that leads to an zzso of the zzso zzso zzso also reduced the expression level of the zzso zzso These results suggest that one of the mechanisms of action of zzso is assumed to be zzso of zzso of zzso through a reduction of zzso zzso activity in zzso human zzso zzso
