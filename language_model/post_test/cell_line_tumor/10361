zzso zzso represent a class of zzso with high zzso and poor zzso We previously generated the zzso zzso zzso which contains an zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso A zzso domain zzso zzso and a zzso active zzso zzso and demonstrated its potent selective zzso zzso In this study, we generated a zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso II domain was replaced with the zzso zzso sequence from diphtheria toxin zzso and explored its zzso zzso and specific killing zzso We found that zzso zzso following their zzso zzso in zzso gastric cancer cells, underwent zzso zzso in zzso and engaged in direct zzso of the released zzso zzso zzso zzso instead of via the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso The active zzso zzso its well-documented zzso zzso A, and subsequently triggered the zzso of cancer zzso The zzso proteins produced from genetically modified cells showed a selective zzso to cultured zzso gastric cancer zzso Similar to the results of our previous research on zzso zzso the delivery of zzso zzso zzso in zzso muscles also inhibited tumor growth and prolonged animal survival in a nude mouse zzso tumor zzso Moreover, zzso proteins were also zzso to zzso gastric cancer cells characterized by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso provides a promising therapeutic alternative for zzso and zzso gastric zzso
