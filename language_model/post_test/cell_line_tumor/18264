zzso zzso is a form of zzso zzso immunity against viruses in plants and zzso zzso zzso viral infection requires evasion or suppression of gene zzso Here, we report that the core protein of zzso C virus zzso acts as a potent zzso of zzso zzso zzso We have found that the zzso core protein zzso zzso zzso induced by short hairpin zzso zzso but not by synthetic small interfering zzso zzso in various zzso zzso We have further demonstrated that zzso core protein directly interacts with zzso an zzso zzso that generates zzso in host zzso The zzso core protein has been shown to inhibit the function of zzso to process zzso zzso zzso into zzso Through deletion analysis, we have found that the zzso domain is required for core protein to antagonize zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso Thus, our results suggest that zzso core protein may abrogate host cell zzso zzso defense by suppressing the ability of zzso to process precursor zzso into zzso This zzso ability of core protein may contribute to the persistent viral infection and zzso of zzso
