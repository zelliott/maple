zzso is the leading cause of death in patients with breast, zzso and head and neck zzso However, the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso in these zzso remain zzso We found that the zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso response zzso protein zzso zzso is commonly activated in diverse zzso human cancer cells, leading to zzso of a zzso zzso target zzso We also observed that the protein expression patterns of zzso and zzso correlate in primary human tumor tissue samples from head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso zzso zzso formation and bundling in highly invasive cancer cells, leading to attenuated cancer cell invasion in zzso and tumor zzso in zzso whereas expression of zzso significantly zzso these zzso Furthermore, targeting zzso with the small zzso zzso inhibitor zzso effectively attenuated the invasive and zzso potential of cancer cells in zzso and in zzso zzso Taken together, our findings for the first time link zzso signaling to zzso formation and bundling through the zzso of zzso providing a zzso and zzso advantage to human zzso zzso protein zzso of the zzso zzso represent promising zzso and therapeutic targets in the clinical prognosis and treatment of zzso human zzso
