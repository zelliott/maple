zzso tumor cells are responsible for the zzso propagation and recurrence of tumors, which raises the question of how to effectively target zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso has considerable efficacy in treating solid tumors with induction of zzso Here, we found that zzso zzso gallbladder zzso cells are highly resistant to conventional zzso However, zzso effectively zzso zzso gallbladder zzso cells zzso Treatment with zzso reduces zzso expression at zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso expression of zzso attenuated the zzso effect of zzso on cells through zzso of zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso effectively targets zzso in gallbladder zzso providing a new mechanism of zzso cell zzso and a better understanding of drug resistance in gallbladder zzso
