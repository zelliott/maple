A zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso structure of zzso units was used as a novel zzso for protein zzso zzso reaction with a zzso human zzso stimulating factor zzso zzso was carried out successfully in zzso conditions to obtain a coupled form, zzso zzso of the modified zzso suggests that two types of products were obtained by controlling the zzso one was zzso a highly modified version coupled with zzso molecules of zzso units on average, and the other was zzso a moderately modified version coupled with zzso molecules of zzso units on average, zzso The properties of these products were compared to the known zzso zzso zzso zzso In the cell proliferation zzso unlike zzso modification with zzso did not produce a significant loss of biological activity even when the modification extent was zzso Under such conditions, zzso of the activity was in fact maintained for zzso while zzso zzso retained only zzso of biological activity in zzso even though the extent of modification was zzso In addition, zzso showed comparable zzso to a 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso will be a useful alternative as a protein modification zzso where zzso is not zzso
