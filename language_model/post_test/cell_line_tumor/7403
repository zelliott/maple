Both zzso zzso inhibitor and zzso can inhibit growth of tumor zzso This study was to investigate zzso effects of zzso inhibitor zzso alone, and zzso combined with zzso on growth of zzso resistant human gastric cancer cell line zzso 

Experimental zzso (1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso (1 zzso 10-6 zzso group zzso medium without zzso The effects of all treatments on zzso cells, and zzso cells were zzso Cell proliferation was measured by zzso incorporation into zzso The expression of zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso was detected by zzso Cell zzso was measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso 

zzso incorporation into zzso cells treated with zzso zzso zzso was significantly lower than that of control group zzso zzso zzso When combined with zzso zzso presented lower zzso incorporation zzso than it alone with a zzso zzso The concentration of zzso in combination group zzso related to synthesis of DNA in zzso cells zzso zzso The expression of zzso in either zzso group or combination group markedly zzso The zzso rates of zzso cells induced by zzso alone, and combination treatment were zzso and zzso 

zzso combined with zzso may enhance zzso of growth of zzso resistant human gastric cancer zzso The mechanism may be related with zzso DNA zzso and inducing zzso
