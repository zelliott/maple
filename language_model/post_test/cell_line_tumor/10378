zzso is a critical step during cancer zzso The zzso is a major zzso for zzso and is predominantly contributed by cancer cells in zzso zzso of the zzso signaling zzso has shown promising therapeutic benefits for cancer patients, but zzso tumor responses are often observed, indicating the need for further understanding of zzso zzso We report that a novel G zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso production from the melanoma cell lines and zzso melanoma zzso and growth, through the zzso zzso zzso segment in its zzso and a signaling zzso involving protein zzso zzso We also present evidence that the two fragments of zzso which are generated by zzso zzso played distinct roles in regulating zzso production and melanoma zzso Finally, consistent with its zzso roles in melanoma zzso the expression levels of zzso are zzso correlated with the zzso of zzso in human zzso We propose that components of the zzso signaling zzso may serve as new targets for zzso treatment of zzso
