zzso zzso of zzso signaling is common in most sporadic and inherited zzso cancer zzso cells leading to elevated zzso zzso We previously identified the neural cell zzso zzso zzso as a target gene of zzso in zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso increased cell zzso invasion, and zzso and the induction of human zzso cell zzso to the zzso In human zzso zzso zzso is exclusively localized at the invasive front of such tumors in a zzso of cells displaying nuclear zzso We determined whether zzso expression zzso zzso capacities by inducing an zzso to zzso transition zzso and whether zzso zzso with cancer stem cell zzso zzso We found that changes in zzso levels do not affect the organization or expression of zzso in cell lines, or in invading zzso tissue cells, and no changes in other zzso or zzso markers were detected after zzso zzso The introduction of major zzso regulators zzso and zzso into zzso cell lines reduced the levels of zzso and induced zzso and zzso but unlike zzso zzso and Twist expression was insufficient for zzso zzso In zzso cells zzso did not specifically zzso with zzso markers including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso required zzso signaling in cells harboring either high or low levels of zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso of zzso cells does not require changes in zzso and zzso markers and operates by zzso zzso zzso
