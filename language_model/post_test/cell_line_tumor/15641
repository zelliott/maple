zzso a member of the inhibitor of zzso zzso protein family, has been demonstrated as a potential new target for zzso therapy in cancer and zzso The aim of this study is to investigate effects and mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso on lung zzso cell lines zzso and zzso 

A zzso zzso expression zzso and zzso scrambled against zzso were constructed and zzso into zzso and zzso cells with zzso zzso The zzso of lung zzso zzso and zzso cells were detected by zzso The zzso rate and cell cycle were detected by flow zzso The activity of zzso zzso and protein expression were analyzed with zzso and Western zzso 

zzso zzso reduced the proliferation of zzso and zzso zzso Cell cycle was inhibited in zzso Expressions of zzso zzso zzso and protein were reduced in zzso cells compared with the control zzso 

zzso targeted against zzso can effectively suppress zzso and zzso cells proliferation and significantly induce zzso and zzso cells zzso
