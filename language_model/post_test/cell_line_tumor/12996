zzso zzso a potent zzso zzso plays an active role in inflammation and zzso Recently, we found that increased zzso cells correlate with poor survival and increased zzso in zzso lung cancer zzso but the mechanism is zzso Here, we show that zzso promotes zzso via inducing vascular zzso growth zzso zzso production by lung cancer zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso is expressed on the surface of Lewis lung zzso zzso cells but not on zzso zzso cells zzso Moreover, zzso zzso and tube formation zzso of net zzso zzso were increased by zzso medium from zzso mouse zzso zzso LLC but not by zzso zzso increased production of zzso in lung cancer cell zzso The enhanced zzso and zzso zzso formation in the presence of zzso was inhibited by addition of zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso Treatment of the zzso cells with zzso significantly increased zzso zzso which was zzso zzso protein zzso 1/2 zzso zzso zzso zzso we found significant correlations between zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso vascular density zzso in zzso We conclude that zzso is involved in zzso in zzso by enhancing production of zzso and zzso may be an important target for the treatment of zzso
