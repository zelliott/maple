The zzso of zzso into zzso is the zzso mechanism to terminate zzso zzso and to prevent zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso cultured cortical zzso with the gap junction blocker, zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso the major zzso zzso zzso in the zzso The dependence of zzso expression on gap junctions was further confirmed by the use of zzso in which either the expression of zzso the major zzso gap junction zzso was inhibited by zzso interference or which were derived from animals carrying an zzso deletion of the zzso zzso In both cases, reduced zzso zzso was associated with a pronounced decline in zzso zzso Finally, a zzso reporter gene zzso demonstrated that blockade of gap zzso suppressed zzso activity of zzso zzso These observations unravel a previously zzso role of gap junctions in the control of zzso zzso zzso
