Our recent report indicated that zzso zzso is more common in zzso cell zzso zzso in zzso and smokers than in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso More interestingly, zzso zzso in SCC and zzso was zzso influenced by gender factor, not by smoking zzso We questioned whether zzso could zzso the machinery of promoter zzso to cause the gender difference of zzso zzso in lung zzso 

Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso lung cancer cell lines were treated with or without zzso and the status of zzso was examined by zzso specific zzso zzso as compared with both cells treated with zzso agents, zzso zzso or zzso 

Our data showed that zzso similar to zzso diminished the zzso zzso and restored zzso zzso zzso which was not observed in the case of zzso Western zzso showed that zzso markedly reduced zzso expression in zzso and zzso cells, but slightly reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels were slightly increased by zzso in both cell zzso In addition, zzso analysis revealed that zzso simultaneously diminished the binding activity of both proteins on the zzso promoter of both cell zzso 

zzso decreased zzso and zzso protein expressions and their binding activity on zzso promoter, and this may partially contribute to the gender difference of zzso zzso in lung zzso
