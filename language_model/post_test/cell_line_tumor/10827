Various studies in zzso suggest that low electric and magnetic fields may modify cancer cell growth and recent studies in zzso have revealed zzso zzso After screening different tumor cell lines, we identified specific sequences of localized magnetic and electric fields zzso that reduce cancer cell survival in zzso This finding led us to design an experiment to determine the actual efficacy of above sequences in selectively zzso tumor cells and their effect on healthy zzso 

We exposed the zzso cancer cell line and normal zzso to zzso for 1, 2, 3 and 6 hours, evaluating cell survival and induction of zzso 

Exposure to zzso reduced zzso survival, inducing zzso in a zzso way, whereas zzso were completely zzso 

These results have promising implications for the treatment of cancer and warrant further zzso
