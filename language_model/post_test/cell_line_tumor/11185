zzso zzso in the gene zzso which encodes zzso one of the most important tumor zzso are common in human zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins are known to actively contribute to tumor development and zzso Thus, promoting the removal of zzso zzso proteins in cancer cells may have therapeutic zzso Here we investigated the mechanisms that govern the turnover of zzso zzso in zzso tumor cells using a combination of pharmacological and genetic zzso We show that suppression of zzso by multiple means promotes the degradation of zzso zzso through zzso zzso in a zzso zzso In addition, depletion of zzso zzso expression due to zzso zzso zzso the death of dormant cancer cells under zzso zzso Taken together, our results delineate a novel strategy for killing tumor cells that depend on zzso zzso expression by the zzso of zzso zzso and potential pharmacological means to reduce the levels of accumulated zzso zzso without the restriction of zzso zzso zzso in zzso tumor zzso
