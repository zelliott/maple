To investigate the mechanism of zzso on the zzso of the zzso zzso in human gastric cancer cells zzso 

zzso were divided into the control group and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used to detect the expression of vascular zzso growth factor C zzso and zzso of human gastric cancer cells zzso in response to zzso 

Que significantly decreased the expression of zzso and zzso at 40 zzso compared with the control group after 48 h ( zzso 

Que can zzso the expression of zzso and zzso in human gastric cancer cells zzso
