zzso agents are commonly used chemotherapy drugs for the treatment of breast and other zzso However, these agents have variable activity partly because of zzso regulatory zzso zzso an zzso zzso that promotes zzso zzso was found to be frequently zzso in breast zzso We previously identified zzso mechanisms of resistance to zzso agents, including altered drug binding and delayed transit from zzso into M phase, where these agents are effective in zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that by reversing zzso zzso of zzso or by promoting entry into zzso this could increase sensitivity to zzso agents in human breast cancer cells zzso zzso We found that targeting zzso or zzso expression with zzso interference can induce zzso zzso and promote zzso zzso respectively, and sensitize zzso breast cancer cells to zzso and zzso Furthermore, targeting zzso led to the zzso of zzso which is known to zzso its zzso zzso these data suggest a novel approach to improving the efficacy of certain zzso agents against breast cancer by regulating the function of zzso
