zzso zzso and zzso regulate many aspects of cell behavior and are often involved in disease processes such as zzso zzso zzso with laser induced zzso detection zzso is emerging as an important tool for zzso zzso of the metabolism of these zzso particularly in zzso zzso Previous zzso of zzso lipids by zzso required a complex buffer with zzso zzso which had the disadvantages of high cost and/or short shelf zzso Further a simultaneous separation of these classes of lipids has not been demonstrated in a robust buffer zzso In the current work, a simple separation buffer based on zzso and zzso was zzso to separate two zzso and multiple zzso by zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso additive to the buffer were individually zzso to achieve simultaneous separation of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were separated zzso and in combination to demonstrate the zzso of the zzso zzso plate numbers achieved were as high as zzso in separating zzso zzso and zzso zzso limits for the 6 zzso were in the range of zzso The method also showed high zzso as the relative standard zzso of the zzso migration time for each zzso in the simultaneous separation of all 6 compounds was less than zzso The separation of a mixture composed of zzso zzso and multiple zzso was also zzso As a final test, fluorescent zzso zzso formed within cells loaded with zzso were separated from a cell zzso as well as a single zzso This simple and robust separation method for zzso and zzso and various zzso of zzso signal zzso is expected to enable improved zzso zzso for biological and clinical zzso
