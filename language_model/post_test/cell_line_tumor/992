We have previously demonstrated that an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the function of the zzso zzso pump in a zzso zzso zzso cell line, zzso and that this effect is not due to the recognition of a zzso zzso on zzso In this study, we have used the same cell line to define the mechanisms responsible for the effect of zzso on the zzso zzso Using zzso resonance energy transfer zzso we show that zzso and zzso are zzso associated in zzso In the absence of treatment with zzso zzso of zzso molecules expressed by zzso cells reside in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Following treatment of the cells with zzso and disruption of the interactions between zzso and zzso zzso zzso out of zzso zzso and zzso zzso into zzso zzso The effect of zzso on zzso cells was specific for zzso an zzso zzso had no such effect, although the cells express zzso These results suggest that zzso might zzso zzso cells by interfering with interactions between zzso and zzso rapidly resulting in the zzso of zzso into a compartment on the plasma membrane where it is no longer zzso
