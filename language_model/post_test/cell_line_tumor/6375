Lung cancer is the leading cause of zzso death zzso The efficacy of current systemic treatments is zzso with major side effects and only modest survival zzso zzso routinely used to deliver drugs into the lung for treating infectious and inflammatory lung diseases have never been used to deliver zzso zzso to treat lung zzso We have shown that zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso is suitable for airway delivery as it resists the physical constraints of zzso and have evaluated the zzso delivery of zzso in zzso 

We developed an animal model of lung tumor sensitive to zzso by injecting zzso zzso mice zzso with zzso cells plus 10 zzso zzso and analyzed the distribution, zzso and zzso efficacy of zzso zzso into the respiratory zzso 

zzso zzso accumulated zzso in the lungs and the zzso but passed poorly and slowly into the systemic zzso zzso zzso also limited the growth of the mouse zzso Thus, administering zzso zzso via the airways is effective and may limit systemic side zzso 

zzso of zzso via the airways deserves further evaluation for treating lung zzso
