In glioblastoma, zzso zzso zzso signaling is frequently activated by loss of the tumor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, it is not known whether zzso zzso represents a selective and effective approach for zzso We interrogated large databases and found that sonic zzso zzso signaling is activated in zzso zzso We demonstrate that the zzso and zzso pathways zzso to promote tumor growth and viability in human zzso zzso A combination of zzso and zzso signaling zzso not only suppressed the zzso of both pathways but also zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting both pathways simultaneously resulted in zzso catastrophe and tumor zzso and markedly reduced the growth of zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso The drugs tested here appear to be safe in zzso therefore, this combination may provide a new targeted treatment for zzso
