We investigated the mechanisms responsible for severe factor IX zzso zzso in two zzso material zzso zzso B patients with a zzso in the first and second zzso growth factor zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have determined the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in comparison with zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso was retrieved as two zzso molecular forms, rapidly zzso into the culture zzso One appeared to be correctly zzso and corresponded to a form trafficking between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The other corresponded to the mature form, ready to be zzso exhibiting correct zzso and zzso In contrast, the two zzso zzso and zzso were not zzso from the cells and did not accumulate zzso Relative to zzso they were retained longer in the zzso and were only zzso In addition, the zzso concentration of the zzso zzso increased when zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso and of the zzso degradation pathway, was added to the culture zzso Both the zzso zzso and zzso were associated in the zzso with the zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso though the amount of zzso associated with the two zzso was twice as strong as with zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso and zzso molecules act in concert to ensure both proper folding of zzso and the retention of zzso zzso
