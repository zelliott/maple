zzso a disease caused by zzso zzso affects animals and zzso Because the zzso spore is the infectious form of the zzso that first contacts the potential host, the interaction between the host and spore zzso is vital to the initiation of zzso Here, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso is essential for the recognition of the major zzso protein zzso by zzso zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso in zzso cells markedly enhanced infection with zzso strain of zzso zzso spores zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a significant decrease in spore zzso when compared with zzso from normal zzso zzso However, when zzso zzso were infected with zzso spores, spore zzso was no different from their zzso zzso zzso spores were also efficiently zzso by all zzso cell lines tested, independently of zzso zzso Taken together, these results show that there is an alternative zzso zzso involved in spore zzso that is unmasked only in the absence of zzso Survival studies, using zzso and zzso mice, revealed that zzso mice are more resistant to infection with zzso but not zzso zzso Our experiments also show that zzso spores are more virulent than zzso spores in zzso and zzso zzso Overall, our data indicate that the zzso interaction may play a major role in zzso zzso zzso by promoting spore zzso by professional zzso and subsequent access to a favorable niche for zzso zzso and outgrowth in zzso zzso
