zzso play an important role in growth and maintenance of prostate zzso The actions of zzso are zzso by the zzso zzso zzso a zzso factor member of the zzso of nuclear hormone zzso zzso regulated genes zzso are potential markers for early diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer zzso In the present study, we used zzso zzso display reverse zzso zzso chain zzso technique in order to investigate zzso expressed genes in the prostate cancer cell line zzso after treatment with zzso and zzso for 6, 24, and 48 zzso Fifty-five zzso expressed fragments were isolated, zzso and zzso zzso analysis of these fragments revealed 56 different transcripts that showed zzso to zzso factors, cell cycle regulators, zzso zzso and hypothetical zzso Among the zzso expressed zzso zzso and zzso were further validated using quantitative real time zzso zzso in a series of 25 prostate tumor zzso The zzso gene is involved in zzso and cell migration of zzso and the zzso gene might be involved in cellular signal zzso The transcripts of both, zzso and zzso zzso showed altered pattern of expression in the group of prostate tumors analyzed by zzso The zzso expressed genes identified in this study might provide new insights into the zzso signaling pathways in prostate zzso
