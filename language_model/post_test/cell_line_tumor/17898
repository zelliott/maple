zzso zzso before adoptive cell transfer can improve the zzso effect of donor immune zzso It was recently reported that zzso conditions can initiate the differentiation of zzso T cells into zzso zzso Although T cells require a specific zzso signal via zzso as well as zzso signals during zzso zzso there has been little evidence to suggest any requirement for zzso signaling for the differentiation of zzso T cells in a zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso zzso T cells are indispensable for induction of zzso effect, and, in addition to zzso zzso zzso signaling is essential for the differentiation of zzso zzso T cells into functional zzso zzso during zzso proliferation zzso The systemic administration of zzso did not restore the zzso effect induced by zzso in the absence of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso enable zzso T cells to expand and survive, and that zzso and the zzso signal initiate the differentiation of zzso zzso A deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying enhanced induction of the zzso immune response with accompanying zzso may allow us to more precisely induce enhanced immunity with zzso signaling and the administration of common zzso zzso
