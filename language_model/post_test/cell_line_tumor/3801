zzso and characterization of circulating tumor cells zzso can provide information on patient prognosis and treatment zzso However, zzso are rare, making their isolation a major technological zzso We developed a technique for enrichment, and subsequent characterization of zzso based on efficient depletion of human zzso 

The technique zzso zzso zzso we developed is based on red blood cell zzso to remove zzso followed by depletion of zzso zzso using a magnetic zzso separation method, and subsequent isolation of zzso by virtue of their larger size, compared with zzso We also demonstrated that zzso in zzso zzso zzso and genetic abnormalities analysis could be performed on the isolated zzso 

The zzso experiments showed that the average efficacy of zzso depletion was zzso and the average tumor cells recovery was not lower than zzso FISH could be used to perform zzso gene zzso analysis on the collected zzso cells, and zzso zzso 19 deletion was detected by zzso analysis in isolated zzso zzso The in zzso feasibility of this technique had been demonstrated in patients with zzso cell lung cancer, breast, zzso and zzso zzso zzso were detected in 13 of 59 blood zzso zzso zzso was also detected in three breast cancer zzso 

The technique we developed allowed isolation and characterization of circulating zzso tumor cells that do not express classical zzso zzso This potentially leads to a more accurate zzso of the number of zzso and is suitable for application to a broad range of zzso
