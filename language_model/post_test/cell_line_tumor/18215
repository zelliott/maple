zzso zzso domain zzso zzso is an zzso zzso protein domain often found in zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso transfer protein zzso and in zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso exchange factors, and zzso We have cloned a novel human zzso cellular zzso zzso zzso containing zzso domain from the zzso library of human fetal zzso The zzso expression pattern of 16 adult human zzso indicated that zzso was only expressed in brain, while it was expressed in all of seven human zzso cell lines we used, especially in human gastric zzso cell line, human zzso cell line, human zzso zzso zzso cell line, and human zzso zzso cell zzso Further, we found that zzso has a remarkably more abundant zzso expression pattern in human zzso cell lines than in normal human liver cell line, and the same result was gained when zzso expression patterns between human zzso specimens and normal human liver specimens were zzso We also found that zzso is located mainly in zzso in human liver cell line zzso which is consistent with the common function of zzso domain zzso Our results show that zzso may be used as a marker for human zzso
