zzso zzso are often zzso toward zzso drugs that are zzso for zzso zzso resistance zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is frequently observed in zzso zzso This study investigates the impact of zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso 

The effect of zzso zzso zzso on zzso expression and promoter activity was examined using zzso human colon cancer cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and patients' zzso zzso towards 24 zzso drugs was determined by high zzso zzso 

Cell lines with zzso zzso showed high zzso promoter activity and zzso zzso and zzso studies demonstrated a dominant role for the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso primary colon cancer zzso shown to express the same zzso zzso zzso also expressed high zzso zzso However, cell line zzso towards 24 zzso and zzso zzso drugs did not differ despite different zzso zzso 

Although zzso is zzso regulated by zzso zzso this did not lead to drug resistance in the zzso cell line model zzso In patient samples, the same zzso zzso was zzso The functional significance of the zzso for predicting patients' therapy response or for zzso of chemotherapy regimens remains to be zzso
