zzso zzso IX zzso plays an important role in pH regulation processes critical for tumor cell growth and zzso We zzso that a dual targeting zzso zzso based zzso zzso drug zzso will reduce tumor growth and sensitize tumors to zzso in a zzso dependent zzso 

The effect of the dual targeting zzso zzso and its single targeting control drugs on zzso zzso and zzso was examined in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth and time to reach zzso start volume zzso was monitored for animals receiving zzso (10 zzso combined with tumor single dose zzso (10 zzso 

In zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso but did not change hypoxic zzso In zzso zzso zzso decreased tumor growth rate and zzso tumors to radiation zzso ratio zzso without systemic toxicity only for zzso expressing zzso 

A newly designed zzso and zzso dual targeting drug reduces hypoxic zzso zzso slows down tumor growth at nontoxic doses and zzso tumors to zzso all in a zzso dependent manner, suggesting no zzso zzso Our data therefore indicate the potential utility of a dual drug approach as a new strategy for zzso zzso
