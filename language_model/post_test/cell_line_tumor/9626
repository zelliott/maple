In this study we present two novel zzso zzso zzso zzso lines zzso 104 and zzso zzso and further characterize six frequently used zzso lines zzso 7, zzso 74, zzso 83, C zzso zzso and SW zzso Three of the lines carried a zzso zzso zzso zzso which is in line with reports of zzso zzso in primary zzso and zzso zzso zzso Several zzso zzso were identified by spectral zzso zzso and zzso in these lines including the novel zzso and zzso as well as zzso and zzso that are also implicated in zzso zzso zzso Comparative zzso zzso showed frequent gain of zzso including the zzso gene in zzso which was further confirmed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso Our results zzso with previous studies in both primary tumors and cell lines, indicating that gain of zzso 20 is important in the zzso of zzso and/or progression of differentiated zzso zzso to zzso
