It is well-established that the zzso zzso is the major site of zzso zzso zzso The zzso synthetic ability of other zzso such as plasma membrane and nucleus, remains zzso In the present study, we re-examine this question by comparing zzso synthesis in isolated zzso zzso zzso with that in corresponding zzso zzso surrounded by plasma membrane but lacking most zzso zzso We report that zzso are competent to carry out both zzso and zzso zzso synthesis as well as zzso zzso while zzso can neither zzso zzso nor zzso zzso in response to zzso The zzso are, however, capable of zzso zzso zzso as previously zzso From these data, we conclude that zzso synthesis is limited to zzso zzso and cannot be sustained by either plasma membrane or nucleus under conditions that permit robust zzso zzso
