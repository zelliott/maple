The zzso zzso plays an important role in cell shape determination, zzso and cell cycle zzso zzso zzso zzso 50 zzso also known as zzso zzso regulatory factor 1 zzso associates with zzso zzso and is related to cell cycle zzso Its zzso and zzso zzso are zzso by zzso zzso 2 zzso B during the zzso zzso However, the biological significance of zzso zzso zzso by zzso B is not zzso In the present study, zzso cells with low levels of zzso zzso protein were zzso zzso with zzso of zzso wild type zzso zzso zzso 279 and zzso 301 zzso to zzso or zzso zzso 279 and zzso 301 zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso multiple zzso of these cells were zzso Failure of zzso zzso zzso zzso in cells expressing zzso zzso zzso significantly increased zzso content, enhanced the adherence of cells to the zzso zzso altered cell zzso and caused defects in zzso as reflected in the formation of giant cells with zzso DNA and zzso or giant zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso expression in AA cells rescued cell defects such as the zzso failure and abnormal cell zzso zzso zzso zzso had a weaker binding affinity with zzso than zzso zzso which might explain the increase of zzso content in the AA zzso The present results suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso may play a role in the regulation of various cell functions by affecting zzso zzso zzso
