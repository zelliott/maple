The zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso that is required for zzso center zzso formation and whose deregulation by zzso zzso is implicated in the zzso of zzso diffuse large B cell zzso zzso and, less zzso zzso zzso zzso The biological function of zzso is only partially understood because no more than a few genes have been functionally characterized as direct targets of zzso zzso zzso Here we report that the zzso zzso zzso is a direct target of zzso in zzso B zzso zzso binds to the zzso promoter region by interacting with the zzso zzso zzso and suppresses zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso suppression of zzso is lost in FL and zzso where the 2 proteins are zzso zzso because of zzso zzso zzso and other mechanisms, including zzso deregulation and zzso zzso in the zzso promoter zzso These results identify an important function for zzso in zzso zzso of zzso B cells via suppression of zzso and suggest that blocking this zzso is critical for zzso
