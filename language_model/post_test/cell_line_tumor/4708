zzso drug resistance is a major obstacle in cancer zzso As for many other drugs, this is also the case for zzso a zzso analogue with activity against zzso cell lung cancer zzso Here, we evaluate the ability of zzso to zzso the acquisition and maintenance of zzso resistance in zzso zzso zzso In the prevention model, zzso cells treated repeatedly with zzso alone gradually developed zzso However, with inclusion of zzso the cells remained zzso zzso analysis showed a strong increase of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in the resistant cells zzso a gene known to be involved in zzso zzso In addition, the expression of genes surrounding the zzso location of zzso was increased, suggesting that resistance was due to gene amplification at the zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso DNA confirmed that the zzso gene copy number was increased over zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso showed an zzso amplification of the zzso zzso In the therapeutic model, zzso gradually zzso zzso cells to zzso reaching parental drug sensitivity after 10 treatment zzso This was associated with a loss in zzso zzso zzso with the in zzso data, zzso tumors generated from the resistant cells did not respond to zzso but were growth inhibited when zzso was added to the zzso zzso The data indicate that zzso can zzso zzso tumor cells by reversing gene zzso This suggests that zzso may have clinical utility in zzso where drug resistance by gene amplification is a major obstacle to successful zzso
