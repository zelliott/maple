In the present study we aimed to investigate the zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso on zzso damage examined in an adopted in zzso inflammatory zzso model and the involvement of zzso zzso signal zzso 

The zzso from zzso zzso zzso was used as culture medium for zzso zzso cells which was used as target zzso zzso The cell viability of zzso cells was assessed by detecting zzso zzso zzso zzso the content of zzso zzso was measured by zzso the expressions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were evaluated by western zzso zzso The zzso associated zzso zzso expression was confirmed by zzso 

Our results showed that incubation of the zzso from zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso cells for zzso significantly increased zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells with increased zzso zzso release into the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso zzso 100 and zzso for zzso before zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso towards zzso zzso and also decreased zzso release into zzso zzso zzso An inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso had the same zzso 

These results suggested that zzso of the zzso cell signal zzso may be involved in zzso zzso zzso towards zzso zzso Data obtained from this study demonstrated that zzso represented a potential treatment strategy for Alzheimer's disease zzso
