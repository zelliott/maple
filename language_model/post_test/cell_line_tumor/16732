zzso is not only an zzso treating pain for patients with cancer but also a potential zzso drug zzso tumor growth and zzso To gain better insight into the involvement of zzso in the biological characteristics of gastric cancer, we investigated effects on progression of gastric zzso cells and the expression of some zzso genes including zzso zzso zzso and zzso using the zzso human gastric cancer cell zzso The viability of cells was assessed by zzso zzso proliferation by colony formation zzso cell cycle progression and zzso by flow zzso and zzso zzso by transmission electron zzso The influences of zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso were evaluated by zzso zzso and Western zzso Our data showed that zzso could significantly inhibit cell growth and proliferation and cause cell cycle arrest in the zzso zzso zzso cells which were incubated with zzso also had a higher zzso rate than control zzso zzso also led to zzso changes of gastric cancer zzso The mechanism of zzso zzso gastric cancer progression in zzso might be associated with zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso
