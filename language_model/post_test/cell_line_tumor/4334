zzso clinical diagnoses require invasive core zzso and use a limited number of protein zzso to identify and zzso zzso We introduce a technology that allows analysis of hundreds of proteins from minimally invasive zzso zzso zzso which contain much smaller numbers of cells than core zzso The method zzso on zzso zzso zzso where zzso can be zzso and digitally detected without any amplification zzso After extensive zzso in cell lines, this method showed high zzso and achieved zzso zzso We used this approach to profile zzso proteins in cells from zzso and subsequently map patient zzso at the protein zzso Additionally, we demonstrate how the method could be used as a clinical tool to identify zzso responses to zzso targeted drugs and to predict drug response in patient zzso This technique combines specificity with ease of use to offer a new tool for understanding human zzso and designing future clinical zzso
