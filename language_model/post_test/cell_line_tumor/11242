To enhance zzso efficacy of the zzso zzso zzso the combination of zzso and zzso zzso with convergence zzso activity, were examined on acute zzso leukemia zzso cell line, zzso In spite of an induction of zzso by both drugs separately and a synergistic effect of them on zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso zzso was reduced when it was used in combination with zzso zzso attenuated the zzso effects on zzso zzso activity, DNA zzso and zzso These zzso despite the zzso from the main goal of this study, dedicate an zzso opportunity to zzso the importance of some of the mechanisms that have been suggested by which zzso zzso zzso Cell cycle distribution, zzso level, and zzso zzso analyses suggest that zzso reduced the zzso zzso effect possibly via relative induction and diminution of cells accumulated in zzso zzso and zzso phase, respectively, as well as through zzso of zzso generation and subsequent zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that induction of zzso by the combined zzso compared to zzso alone could be a reason for the relative decline of cells zzso in zzso and the increase of cells in zzso and S zzso zzso the zzso arrest and zzso generation are likely principle zzso for the zzso zzso and can be used as a guide to design rational zzso strategies involving zzso and agents with zzso arrest or zzso generation capacity to intensify zzso zzso
