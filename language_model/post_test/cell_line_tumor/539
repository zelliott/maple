The traditional belief that prostate cancer zzso growth is dependent on serum testosterone zzso level has been challenged by recent negative studies in zzso zzso 

To provide an improved framework for understanding the relationship of zzso to serum T level that is consistent with current evidence and is based on established zzso principles of zzso action within the zzso 

A literature search was performed of publications dating from 1941 to 2008 that addressed experimental and clinical effects of zzso on prostate zzso Review of studies investigating the zzso effects of manipulation of zzso zzso in human and animal studies, and in zzso cell zzso 

zzso growth is exquisitely sensitive to variations in zzso zzso at very low zzso but becomes insensitive to changes in zzso zzso at higher zzso This pattern is consistent with the observation that zzso exert their zzso effects primarily via binding to the zzso zzso zzso and that zzso zzso binding is achieved at serum T zzso well below the zzso zzso A zzso Model is proposed that accounts for the seemingly contradictory results in human zzso zzso Changes in serum T zzso below the point of zzso zzso binding will elicit substantial changes in zzso growth, as seen with zzso or with T administration to previously zzso zzso In contrast, once zzso zzso binding is reached the presence of additional zzso produces little further zzso 

The evidence clearly indicates that there is a limit to the ability of zzso to stimulate zzso zzso A zzso Model based on zzso binding provides a satisfactory conceptual framework to account for the dramatic effects seen with zzso as well as the minor impact of T administration in zzso zzso
