To determine the efficacy of zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso clinical response with effect on plasma zzso and in zzso activity in primary zzso 

Patients received zzso zzso zzso on days 1, 4, 8, and 11 of a zzso zzso Plasma tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso and zzso were measured before each treatment, and zzso activity was examined in patient samples grown in primary zzso 

Fifty-one patients received a total of 193 cycles of zzso zzso patients had mantle cell zzso zzso 13 had zzso zzso zzso six had zzso lymphoma, six had Hodgkin's disease zzso and one each had diffuse large zzso zzso and adult zzso zzso Patients were heavily zzso with a median of four previous zzso zzso grade 3 to 4 zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso fatigue zzso zzso 10), and peripheral zzso zzso zzso zzso Seven patients with zzso responded to treatment (one complete response, six partial responses zzso overall response rate, zzso Two patients with FL achieved a late zzso 3 months after zzso zzso Two patients with zzso zzso and one patient with HD achieved a zzso zzso primary cultures demonstrated greater sensitivity to zzso than FL zzso 50% effective concentration for zzso 209 zzso v zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso which correlated with clinical zzso A median reduction in plasma zzso of zzso was observed in six patients with zzso who responded to zzso compared with a reduction of 38% in six zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso demonstrates encouraging efficacy in zzso in heavily zzso zzso Response was associated with a reduction in plasma zzso and in zzso sensitivity in a small number of zzso
