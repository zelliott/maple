zzso a human zzso zzso cell line was zzso zzso with normal human zzso and zzso without a zzso targeting signal zzso zzso zzso oxygen species zzso zzso zzso and zzso were examined as a function of time following zzso zzso X-ray zzso Our results showed that the level of zzso zzso increased and reached a maximum level 2 hours after X-ray zzso zzso zzso but not zzso lacking zzso protected against zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, the levels of zzso zzso were consistently found to always correlate with the levels of authentic zzso in zzso These results suggest that only when zzso is located in zzso is it efficient in protecting against cellular injuries by X-ray zzso and that zzso are the critical sites of zzso cellular zzso zzso
