In this study, we investigated the zzso of altered expression of zzso zzso in zzso melanoma and its clinical relevance in patients with zzso zzso The zzso status of zzso was assessed in cell lines by sequencing, single zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Copy number status was then evaluated for zzso with zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso protein was further evaluated by zzso in 93 human zzso zzso No zzso were identified in zzso Increased copy number at the zzso locus was observed in zzso zzso zzso cell lines and in zzso zzso human zzso zzso which was associated with zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein in human zzso was associated with worse survival in a zzso model controlling for the site of zzso Copy number gain is a major contributing mechanism of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso may have implications for the development of zzso that target zzso
