zzso cancer is obstinate and resistant to zzso a standard zzso agent for the zzso We previously showed a therapeutic effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso against gastrointestinal cancer and zzso Here, we investigated the effect of zzso zzso on pancreatic cancer cell sensitivity to zzso and the underlying molecular zzso 

zzso zzso and activity of zzso in pancreatic cancer cells zzso were examined by Western zzso and in zzso zzso zzso The combined effect of zzso and a zzso inhibitor zzso against zzso cells was examined by zzso and zzso zzso in zzso Changes in gene expression in zzso cells following zzso zzso were studied by zzso zzso and reverse zzso zzso 

zzso cells showed increased zzso zzso zzso at zzso 216 zzso zzso and activity compared with zzso zzso zzso Administration of zzso at pharmacological doses attenuated proliferation of zzso cells and zzso and significantly zzso them to zzso zzso analysis determined that the combined effect was zzso DNA zzso analysis detected zzso zzso changes in gene expression in zzso zzso zzso Among these changes, zzso and Western zzso showed that expression of tumor protein zzso nuclear protein 1, a gene regulating cell death and DNA repair, was increased by zzso treatment and substantially decreased by zzso zzso 

The results indicate that zzso zzso zzso pancreatic cancer cells to zzso with altered expression of genes involved in DNA zzso This study provides insight into the molecular mechanism of zzso resistance and thus a new strategy for pancreatic cancer zzso
