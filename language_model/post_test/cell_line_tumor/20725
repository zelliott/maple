zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso one plant used traditionally for the treatment of zzso on zzso potential of highly zzso zzso melanoma cells were investigated in zzso Cell proliferation was assessed using the zzso zzso zzso Details of zzso capabilities including invasion, migration and zzso of zzso melanoma cells were examined by zzso Chamber invasion and migration, scratch zzso and cell attachment zzso zzso The results demonstrated that zzso and zzso extracts exhibited potent zzso effects ( zzso whereas the methanol and zzso extracts had less pronounced effects after 24 h zzso zzso zzso zzso of both active zzso and zzso extracts led to the isolation of two main zzso zzso and characterization as zzso and zzso respectively, their structures being identified by comparison with the spectral zzso Interestingly, both exhibited potent effective zzso At zzso effective doses, zzso and zzso extracts (10 and 30 zzso as well as zzso and zzso (3 and 10 zzso significantly inhibited zzso cell invasion, to a greater extent than 10 zzso zzso while reducing migration of cancer cells without cellular zzso Moreover, exposure of zzso melanoma cells to high zzso of zzso (30 zzso and zzso (20 zzso for 24 h resulted in delayed zzso and retarded zzso As insights into mechanisms of action, typical zzso changes of zzso cells zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso bodies and loss of zzso as well as cell cycle arrest in the zzso phase with increase of zzso cell proportions, detected by zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso were observed, suggesting DNA damage and subsequent zzso cell zzso Taken together, our findings indicate for the first time that active zzso and zzso extracts as well as zzso and zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso roots affect zzso of cancer zzso processes including zzso zzso invasion and migration, possibly through induction of zzso of highly zzso zzso melanoma zzso Based on these data, zzso zzso zzso represents a potential candidate novel zzso and/or zzso zzso Additionally, they also support its zzso usage for cancer prevention and/or zzso
