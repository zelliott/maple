zzso infection by high-risk types of human zzso zzso is a necessary cause of cervical cancer, with zzso the most zzso accounting for more than 50% of reported zzso The virus encodes the E6 and zzso zzso whose expression is essential for maintenance of the zzso zzso To select zzso zzso zzso to zzso therapy for patients with zzso cervical cancer, E6 and zzso zzso were designed using zzso computer software, after which 10 compatible with all zzso zzso were selected, and then extensively examined for zzso activity and specificity using zzso and zzso Three zzso with the highest zzso activities toward E6 and zzso zzso as well as specific and potent growth suppression of zzso cancer cells as low as 1 zzso were zzso Growth suppression was accompanied by zzso of zzso and zzso as well as zzso and zzso changes characteristic of cellular zzso zzso activity of one of the selected zzso was confirmed by retarded tumor growth of zzso cells in zzso mice when locally injected in a complex with zzso Our results demonstrate that these E6 and zzso zzso are promising therapeutic agents for treatment of zzso zzso
