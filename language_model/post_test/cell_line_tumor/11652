Our pilot study using zzso zzso found that zzso zzso is zzso expressed in the paired zzso lung cancer cell line zzso compared to the zzso lung cancer cell line zzso zzso analysis shows that zzso zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso could be important target genes of zzso zzso we hypothesized that zzso suppresses lung cancer cell zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso by targeting zzso zzso and zzso The zzso studies that raised zzso expression in zzso cells by using its mimics showed reductions in cell zzso zzso to zzso invasion and zzso In zzso zzso studies that reduced zzso by using its inhibitor in zzso cells promoted zzso zzso to zzso invasion and zzso Furthermore, the zzso reporter zzso demonstrated that zzso inhibited the expression of the zzso gene containing the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Western zzso indicated that zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso and zzso at the protein zzso zzso zzso analysis further confirmed that zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso mice with zzso models of lung cancer cells confirmed that zzso inhibited lung cancer zzso in zzso including bone and liver zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that zzso serves as a tumor zzso zzso which suppresses lung cancer cell zzso to zzso and zzso by directly zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression and by further reducing zzso zzso zzso The results show that zzso may be a novel therapeutic candidate target to slow lung cancer zzso
