zzso mechanisms are present for induction of DNA zzso as shown by zzso of specific zzso islands zzso by specific zzso and in specific zzso However, zzso factors involved are poorly zzso except for involvement of low zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso 27 zzso Here, we used zzso DNA zzso zzso combined with a CGI zzso zzso analysis, and identified zzso and 521 genes with promoter zzso resistant and zzso respectively, to DNA zzso in prostate cancer cell zzso zzso analysis revealed that the susceptible genes had low zzso in a normal zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso II zzso zzso and zzso modifications showed that, even among the genes with low transcription, the presence of Pol II was associated with marked resistance to DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was associated with increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The same was true in normal human zzso zzso cells for zzso and zzso genes resistant and zzso respectively, to DNA zzso in breast cancer cell zzso These results showed that the presence of Pol II, active or zzso and zzso can predict the zzso fate of promoter zzso independently of zzso zzso
