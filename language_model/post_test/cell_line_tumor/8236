A putative role for prion protein zzso in zzso has been zzso This function was investigated to test whether zzso to zzso could induce zzso and be zzso in the treatment of zzso Various zzso to zzso were screened in zzso proliferation zzso with zzso 116 colon cancer zzso zzso were shown to have varying degrees of zzso activity, with zzso and zzso essentially zzso compared to other highly active zzso Surprisingly, zzso and zzso zzso were particularly potent and afforded zzso reduction in proliferation at 50 zzso In combination therapy experiments, zzso to zzso enhanced the effect of zzso zzso zzso and zzso to varying zzso Use of zzso zzso in zzso resulted in increased zzso as measured by reduced zzso zzso In different colon cancer cell lines, zzso effectiveness correlated with zzso zzso zzso in an in zzso nude mouse bearing human zzso 116 zzso zzso growth was inhibited by treatment with zzso zzso zzso days after treatment, at 9 zzso zzso in combination with zzso zzso sizes were approximately zzso smaller compared to animals receiving zzso zzso The data suggest a potential pharmacological application for zzso zzso in combination zzso
