zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in normal zzso seems to be restricted to zzso zzso The aim of the study was to evaluate the expression of zzso in normal human zzso tissue and to study its zzso in the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso tissue samples were obtained form 11 patients with zzso zzso who underwent surgical zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso was evaluated by zzso and western zzso zzso of zzso in each zzso zzso cell lineage was evaluated by double zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso served as zzso 

zzso was highly expressed in all zzso samples with a zzso zzso zzso 81 zzso zzso of stained zzso expression of zzso was confirmed by western zzso zzso zzso zzso had 74 zzso zzso zzso positive zzso zzso of zzso was either in zzso or zzso In addition, treatment of zzso cells, with a zzso zzso was associated with zzso of the zzso from zzso into the zzso Double zzso revealed that every zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had zzso zzso 

The present study demonstrated that zzso is highly expressed in every normal zzso zzso cell zzso It can zzso into the nucleus by zzso zzso however, its role in zzso hormone regulation remains to be zzso
