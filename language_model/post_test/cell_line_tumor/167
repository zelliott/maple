zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly expressed in the skin by zzso the developing and zzso nervous system and a number of other normal human zzso In zzso cells, zzso of zzso mediates irreversible zzso to zzso transition zzso with loss of zzso from the cell surface and an increase in active transforming growth factor zzso We recently reported the expression of zzso in both cartilage and zzso where expression is increased in patients with zzso In human zzso cells zzso was activated by zzso zzso and the active form of the zzso zzso associated with the zzso zzso in a zzso independent zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells led to altered cell zzso with increased zzso of zzso zzso to type II collagen and zzso was increased, and migration across the former was zzso zzso was zzso to the cell surface, at least zzso in a zzso dependent zzso zzso prevented both zzso zzso association and cell surface binding of zzso suggesting that both are via zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso but not zzso inactive zzso zzso increased the expression and activity of zzso and all forms of zzso tested increased expression of zzso and zzso zzso These data demonstrate that expression of zzso alters cell zzso towards a more zzso less migratory zzso Further, zzso activity may reside predominantly in the zzso zzso and we are currently searching for zzso in this zzso
