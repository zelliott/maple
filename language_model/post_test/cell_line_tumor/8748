The zzso growth factor zzso zzso is a central regulator of tumor progression in a variety of human zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso that has been approved for head and neck and zzso cancer treatment, but many patients treated with zzso don't respond or eventually acquire zzso To determine how tumor cells acquire resistance to zzso we previously developed a model of acquired resistance using the zzso cell lung cancer line zzso These zzso zzso cells exhibit increased zzso zzso expression secondary to zzso in zzso trafficking and degradation and, further, retained dependence on zzso signaling for enhanced growth zzso Here, we examined zzso a novel mixture of zzso directed against distinct zzso on the zzso domain of zzso as an alternative therapy for zzso tumor zzso zzso treatment of zzso clones resulted in rapid zzso degradation, followed by robust zzso of cell proliferation and zzso of several zzso protein zzso zzso To determine whether zzso could have therapeutic benefit in zzso we established de zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso and subsequently treated zzso tumors with zzso zzso treatment of mice harboring zzso tumors resulted in growth delay compared to mice continued on zzso zzso of total and zzso were robustly decreased in zzso tumors treated with zzso zzso analysis of these zzso zzso tumors further demonstrated decreased expression of zzso and zzso as well as a modest increase in zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso may be an effective targeted therapy for zzso zzso
