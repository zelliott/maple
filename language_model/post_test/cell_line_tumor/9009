zzso zzso by the activated zzso is suggested to play a pivotal role in the zzso of hypoxic brain zzso however, the underlying mechanism of zzso zzso remains zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso after hypoxic exposure which is closely associated with multiple pathological situations of the zzso zzso and zzso expression in primary zzso and zzso zzso cells was significantly elevated after zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling was further confirmed by the zzso increase in the expression and zzso of zzso zzso zzso domain zzso together with zzso and target gene zzso zzso Chemical zzso of zzso signaling with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso effectively reduced zzso zzso expression of most inflammatory zzso zzso zzso also reduced zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed expression of zzso zzso In zzso zzso signaling expression and zzso in zzso were observed in the zzso of zzso rats after hypoxic zzso Most interestingly, zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso was prevented when the rats were given zzso zzso zzso the zzso between zzso signaling and zzso zzso Taken together, we conclude that zzso signaling is involved in regulating zzso zzso after zzso partly through the cross talk between zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling may serve as a prospective target for zzso of zzso zzso known to be implicated in brain damage in the developing zzso
