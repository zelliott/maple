The zzso protein plays a critical role in inducing cell cycle arrest or zzso Because zzso is zzso in human zzso restoring zzso function is a major focus of zzso zzso The most clinically tested strategy for replacing zzso has been zzso zzso gene therapy zzso In addition to their therapeutic zzso investigations into zzso provide model systems for understanding zzso ability to induce cell cycle arrest versus zzso particularly because zzso zzso cells are resistant to zzso zzso Here we use zzso zzso to test the hypothesis that simultaneous zzso of zzso at zzso 18 zzso and zzso 20 zzso is zzso associated with zzso zzso Studies using zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso with zzso of zzso at zzso and zzso but not with zzso zzso zzso To prove a zzso relationship between zzso and zzso and zzso zzso of zzso the effects of an zzso zzso construct that was not zzso zzso was compared with a zzso zzso construct zzso in zzso zzso zzso Whereas treatment with zzso resulted only in cell cycle arrest, treatment with zzso induced dramatic zzso zzso and Western zzso analyses showed that only zzso was capable of inducing expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that the protein product of zzso but not zzso was capable of binding to zzso zzso We thus conclude that zzso of zzso and zzso is sufficient for inducing zzso zzso in zzso zzso These results have implications for zzso gene therapy and inform other strategies that aim to restore zzso zzso
