It has been shown that the human acute zzso leukemia zzso T cell line zzso zzso selected with zzso zzso is transformed to a zzso resistant zzso zzso zzso with zzso to zzso zzso Since zzso is a well-documented zzso for the zzso zzso breast cancer resistant protein zzso we assessed the contribution of drug zzso to zzso resistance in zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso cells had markedly higher expression levels of zzso negligible expression of zzso and zzso and lower zzso retention of zzso as compared to zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso resistance in zzso cells was not reversed by the zzso chemical zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso although zzso zzso zzso were significantly increased when zzso was functionally knocked zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso plays a minimal role in zzso zzso resistance to zzso cells, highlighting the existence of zzso redundant mechanisms of drug zzso The current results support the concept of zzso zzso zzso a zzso phenomenon that ascribes zzso resistance to many possible cellular mechanisms, not only by zzso drug zzso
