Group I zzso zzso zzso are important zzso of the small zzso zzso and zzso which regulate cell zzso survival, zzso and gene zzso zzso of these zzso have been reported in many tumor types, making zzso attractive targets for therapeutic zzso zzso are activated by growth zzso signaling and are zzso regulated by the tumor zzso zzso type 2 zzso Thus, tumors characterized by zzso zzso would be expected to show zzso zzso zzso On the basis of this zzso we evaluated the status of zzso signaling in zzso zzso an aggressive zzso that is resistant to current therapies and shows frequent zzso of zzso We show that group I zzso are activated in most zzso and zzso cell lines and that genetic or zzso zzso of zzso is sufficient to inhibit zzso cell proliferation and zzso We also identify downstream zzso and signaling pathways that may contribute mechanistically to zzso zzso Specifically, we show that zzso of zzso results in zzso of zzso and zzso signaling and decreased tumor cell zzso zzso these data suggest that zzso zzso of group I zzso may have therapeutic efficacy in tumors characterized by zzso zzso
