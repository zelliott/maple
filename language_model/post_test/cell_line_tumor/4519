zzso is a candidate tumor zzso gene localized in zzso a region commonly zzso by deletion and zzso in various human zzso To zzso the role of zzso in transforming growth factor zzso signaling in zzso tract cancer, we zzso zzso cells, which do not express zzso but have intact zzso type II zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso expression zzso zzso or with the zzso zzso as a zzso Four zzso clones and one control clone were zzso Although zzso only slightly inhibited growth of the control cells, growth zzso and zzso zzso arrest were significantly enhanced in the zzso zzso None of the zzso however, exhibited zzso The slightly increased zzso zzso expression in the control clone was strongly enhanced in the zzso zzso and was accompanied by zzso decreases in the expression of zzso D1 and zzso When zzso small interfering zzso was added, zzso induction of zzso was reduced in the zzso zzso zzso of the clones in nude mice demonstrated that zzso was significantly decreased in the zzso clones in inverse proportion to the expression levels of zzso Based on these results, zzso is involved in zzso expression of zzso and the resulting induction of zzso zzso zzso
