We investigated the effect of modeled zzso zzso on normal vascular smooth muscle cells zzso and zzso human breast cancer cells zzso In both cell types, zzso induced partial arrest in zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso synchronized by zzso zzso zzso the normal cycle within zzso if released in complete medium and exposed to normal gravity, but not if exposed to zzso Similarly, zzso prevented zzso and zzso cells from overcoming growth arrest and zzso zzso This study shows that cells adjust their zzso rate in response to zzso
