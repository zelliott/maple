zzso breast cancer cells frequently and zzso express the zzso factor zzso which normally zzso proliferation and promotes maturation of zzso zzso expression is zzso regulated with respect to cell growth in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso 

Here, we addressed whether the functional relationship between cell growth and zzso gene expression is maintained in breast cancer zzso We also investigated whether the zzso expression of zzso is linked to zzso parameters that could provide a selective advantage to cells during breast cancer zzso 

We find that, similar to its regulation in zzso zzso expression in zzso breast zzso cells is enhanced upon growth factor zzso as well as upon zzso of the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Reduction of zzso levels by zzso has only marginal effects on cell growth and expression of proliferation markers in zzso breast cancer zzso Thus, zzso is not a critical regulator of cell proliferation in this cell zzso However, zzso depletion of zzso in zzso cells reduces cell zzso while forced zzso expression of zzso in zzso cells increases cell zzso 

Our results support the emerging concept that the zzso zzso factor zzso functions as a zzso zzso in zzso cancer zzso
