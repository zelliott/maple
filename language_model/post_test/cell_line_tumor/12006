Type I zzso zzso are capable of suppressing zzso zzso expression by modulating zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanism of this phenomenon is poorly zzso We previously established that human zzso zzso zzso a type I zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso degradation, zzso zzso cell cycle arrest and eventually zzso by specifically degrading zzso zzso We now demonstrate a close association between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in human melanoma zzso zzso stable melanoma cell clones expressing zzso small zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso is a key zzso coupled with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso of zzso protects melanoma cells from zzso growth zzso emphasizing the importance of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso growth zzso and zzso zzso In these zzso targeted zzso of zzso might be a novel therapeutic strategy for zzso and zzso tumors, such as zzso
