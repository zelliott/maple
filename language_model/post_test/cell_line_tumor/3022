The fully humanized zzso zzso specific zzso zzso zzso zzso is currently tested in a passive zzso approach in a clinical phase I trail and therefore regulatory requirements demand qualified zzso for product zzso To demonstrate the functionality of its zzso the capacity of zzso to mediate complement dependent zzso zzso against human breast cancer cells was zzso The zzso radioactive method using zzso and a zzso zzso were established and qualified according to zzso zzso zzso evaluated were zzso response function, bias, zzso zzso zzso intermediate precision zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In the course of a fully zzso design, a zzso zzso equation was identified as appropriate zzso model for both zzso For the radioactive zzso the bias ranged from zzso to zzso The intermediate precision for future means of duplicate zzso revealed values from zzso to zzso and the total error zzso tolerance zzso of the method was found to be zzso For the zzso zzso the bias ranged from zzso to zzso and the intermediate precision for future means of duplicate zzso revealed values from zzso to zzso The total error of the method was found to be zzso The presented data demonstrate that the zzso zzso is more accurate than the radioactive zzso Also, the elimination of zzso and the zzso counting of zzso cells further justifies the zzso of this method which was subsequently applied for testing the influence of storage at 4 degrees C and 25 degrees C zzso zzso on the potency of zzso drug zzso The obtained results demonstrate that the qualified functional zzso represents a stability indicating test zzso
