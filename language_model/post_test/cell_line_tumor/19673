zzso has been previously associated with the zzso potential, zzso and zzso of tumor zzso zzso activity has been detected by means of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso migration, and zzso zzso affinity zzso However, those methods have proven to be somewhat problematic with regards to application to actual biological samples, the accessibility of the immobilized zzso experimental sensitivity, and the separation of zzso zzso Rather than focusing on zzso activity, then, we have developed a zzso alternative zzso zzso zzso on the basis of the recent finding that zzso zzso generated from zzso by bacterial zzso exhibit biological properties comparable to those from zzso zzso by zzso zzso In this study, the zzso of zzso zzso and bacterial zzso I were determined using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was selected as a candidate through this zzso system, and an zzso zzso was zzso from its methanol zzso Its zzso effects on the pulmonary zzso of zzso zzso melanoma cells were also zzso Our findings suggest that this zzso may prove useful as a diagnostic tool for zzso zzso as an alternative zzso zzso
