zzso of zzso for promotion of zzso zzso zzso has long been supported by clinical and experimental zzso However, mechanisms involved in the zzso have not yet been fully zzso Moreover, unbalanced expression of zzso during tumor progression results in zzso rather than growth zzso To investigate the effect of zzso on zzso regulation of zzso we isolated rat zzso promoter, based on our previous report zzso zzso and examined regulation of its promoter activity by zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Several putative zzso zzso sites were found, but no zzso zzso When the full-length zzso to zzso and variously deleted promoter zzso were zzso the promoter region spanning from zzso to zzso showed the highest activity towards zzso in a zzso manner in both zzso and zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso response sequence half site zzso was identified to be located within zzso to zzso proved by zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression was confirmed by zzso developed in nude mice with zzso zzso This work presents in zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso of zzso expression by zzso and zzso and implicates the zzso of zzso by zzso through the regulation of zzso zzso
