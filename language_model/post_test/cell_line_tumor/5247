zzso zzso such as tumor necrosis factor zzso and zzso zzso trigger the zzso of zzso factor zzso that zzso the expression of a variety of zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso was found to inhibit the zzso expression of zzso induced by zzso and zzso at comparable zzso in human lung zzso zzso zzso In this study, the molecular mechanism underlying the zzso of zzso zzso zzso expression by zzso A together with the specific zzso inhibitor zzso was further zzso zzso A and zzso neither prevented zzso degradation nor zzso zzso to the nucleus upon zzso zzso While zzso A and zzso had no zzso effect on the induction of zzso zzso they inhibited the zzso zzso expression at the protein zzso zzso with these results, zzso A and zzso zzso reduced de zzso protein zzso largely due to its ability to block zzso transport of zzso acids across the plasma zzso but not to interfering with the translation zzso As a direct molecular target, zzso A was found to inhibit the zzso activity of zzso as zzso as zzso These results clearly demonstrate that zzso A and zzso prevent zzso protein expression by blocking the zzso zzso acid zzso
