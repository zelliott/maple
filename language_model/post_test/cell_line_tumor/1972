zzso growth zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso cell growth and survival of cancer zzso We studied responses to zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso combined with conventional systemic drugs in breast cancer cell lines of different clinical zzso 

zzso to zzso single treatment and combinations with zzso zzso zzso or zzso was tested in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso for zzso cell death, cell cycle distribution and zzso of proteins downstream of zzso 

Treatment of zzso resulted in reduced zzso zzso cell cycle arrest and reduced zzso of protein zzso B zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso was low in zzso cells, despite their high zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso had synergistic zzso effects in zzso cells, and additive effects were shown in zzso and zzso zzso Also, combination with zzso had zzso effects in zzso zzso zzso caused zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells, which was not inhibited by zzso 

zzso effects should be anticipated when zzso zzso are combined with conventional systemic drugs in a subset of breast zzso Development of functional zzso predicting tumor response to tailored zzso therapy is zzso
