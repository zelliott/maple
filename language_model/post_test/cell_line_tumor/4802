The zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is an integral plasma membrane protein involved in the zzso resistance zzso It actively zzso a number of zzso molecules from zzso To gain insight into the zzso of the functional properties of this integral membrane protein by cholesterol, a main component of the zzso zzso we used zzso zzso cells, which zzso zzso Upon altering the plasma membrane cholesterol content of these cells, membrane zzso and the activity of zzso were zzso A zzso methodology was used to separate zzso and zzso plasma membrane zzso Our data show that zzso was exclusively found in zzso zzso known as zzso phase membrane zzso together with zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso of the membrane cholesterol level to zzso by treatment with the zzso agent zzso did not modify zzso activity, as evidenced either by the rate of zzso of zzso or that of zzso Further cholesterol depletion below zzso yielded both a partial shift of zzso to the zzso fraction and a decrease of its zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso functionality depends on its zzso in zzso membrane zzso
