A recent study reported that zzso can induce zzso by directly binding to the putative zzso responsive element in the zzso zzso In this study, we report that zzso a small zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso of zzso in a zzso manner of zzso zzso induced zzso expression at the level of zzso in human cancer cells such as zzso and zzso zzso This induction of zzso did not occur in zzso cells in which zzso was zzso and was prevented by knocking down the zzso protein using zzso zzso zzso but not by zzso an inhibitor of the zzso activity of zzso Accompanying zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and the zzso of zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression was suppressed by zzso a zzso scavenger, and chemical zzso of zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso In addition, zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso the levels of zzso zzso were correlated with the zzso zzso of zzso and this induction was prevented by zzso an inhibitor of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso with the effect of the zzso scavenger and zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso expression and the zzso of zzso induced by zzso In the experiments of analyzing cell death, the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso zzso zzso expression via the zzso of both zzso which is dependent on zzso generated by zzso zzso to the zzso and zzso zzso which appears to be zzso by a zzso zzso and this zzso induction may inhibit zzso zzso zzso a negative feedback loop of zzso zzso
