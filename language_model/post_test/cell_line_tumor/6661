zzso zzso virus zzso lacking the zzso gene are not destructive to normal zzso but are potent zzso agents in human tumor cells in which the zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is zzso Thus, replication of a zzso zzso zzso in 12 genetically defined cancer cell lines zzso with suppression of zzso but not with the zzso of zzso zzso analyses of two cell lines zzso with either dominant negative zzso zzso or zzso active zzso zzso indicated that in zzso zzso cells zzso enabled zzso zzso and decreased virus yields, whereas zzso suppressed zzso and enabled better viral replication and cell destruction in zzso cells in zzso or in mouse zzso The results indicate that activated zzso mediates the suppression of zzso and that the status of zzso predicts the ability of zzso zzso viruses to replicate in and destroy tumor zzso
