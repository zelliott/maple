zzso studies suggest that precursor steroids are implicated in the zzso of breast zzso However, our understanding of the role of precursor steroids in breast cancer is complicated by fact that there are many precursor steroids, which are metabolically zzso and have divergent zzso activities on the growth of breast cancer cell zzso In this study the zzso affects of 5 zzso and zzso zzso zzso which may be considered true zzso acting at a tissue level, on zzso zzso and zzso breast cancer cell lines have been examined by a flow zzso zzso DNA cell cycle analysis demonstrates that zzso zzso zzso stimulates the proliferation of zzso cell lines at zzso levels by an zzso zzso zzso mechanism whereas 5 zzso does not affect the proliferation of zzso and zzso cell lines at zzso levels over short zzso zzso zzso Both 5 zzso and zzso zzso zzso stimulate proliferation of zzso cell lines at pharmacological levels via and interaction with the zzso zzso In long zzso zzso zzso both 5 zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibit the 17 zzso induced proliferation of zzso and zzso cell lines, however, 5 zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso stimulates zzso zzso These cell line studies suggest a model for the role of precursor steroids in zzso and zzso breast zzso
