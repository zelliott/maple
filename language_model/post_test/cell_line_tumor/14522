zzso factor zzso is a key nuclear zzso factor that regulates the cellular response to zzso and is important for solid tumor growth and zzso However, the underlying role of zzso in human zzso has not been well zzso This study aims to investigate the expression patterns of zzso in zzso and its association with zzso features, zzso zzso zzso index zzso and overall survival of patients with zzso Our results shown that the protein levels of zzso were increased, and the zzso and protein levels of zzso were also increased in zzso cells under hypoxic zzso In eight patients with zzso increased expression of zzso and zzso was detected in zzso zzso compared with the paired adjacent normal zzso Of 34 archival specimens of zzso 20 zzso showed high zzso protein expression as compared to benign cartilage zzso Increased zzso expression was correlated with a higher pathological grade and zzso stage of zzso Moreover, zzso expression was significantly associated with zzso expression and zzso More significantly, the survival rate of patients with zzso high tumors was significantly lower than that of patients with zzso low zzso These findings suggest that increased zzso levels zzso zzso of zzso play a prominent role in evasion of zzso and tumor zzso and can be zzso for the prognosis in human zzso
