zzso cells express the high affinity zzso for zzso zzso zzso of this zzso by zzso and zzso leads to a signaling cascade resulting in the zzso of zzso in the synthesis of other zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso and in the production of various zzso all of which participate in the development of the allergic zzso In the last years, growing evidence accumulated that binding of zzso to zzso in itself zzso active signals leading to mast cell survival, increased expression of zzso transient induction of zzso zzso zzso and increased cell zzso The mechanisms underlying zzso zzso signaling in the absence of zzso zzso are still poorly zzso Here, we show that a protein of 28 zzso zzso is physically and zzso associated with zzso in mast zzso zzso studies from zzso zzso cells demonstrated that this association involves at least 50% of zzso zzso After the addition of zzso zzso to the cells, the zzso complex zzso almost completely in less than 2 zzso This zzso is zzso and is not due to the recruitment of additional proteins to the zzso zzso bound zzso from the cells by zzso treatment promotes a rapid zzso between zzso and zzso Altogether, these data are consistent with a zzso regulation of the zzso Thus, zzso is a sensor for zzso occupation by zzso on mast cells, and its zzso from the zzso could represent an early step of zzso zzso zzso
