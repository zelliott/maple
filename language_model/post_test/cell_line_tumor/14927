zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso transformation and promotes viral replication through interaction with zzso zzso zzso complex and the zzso zzso family proteins through distinct zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso region of zzso suppresses zzso zzso and interacts with zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso To specifically dissect the role of zzso interaction with zzso we engineered a zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso and investigated the effect of the zzso on zzso and Ras cooperative transformation of primary cells and viral zzso Our results suggest that zzso interaction suppresses zzso and Ras zzso transformation of primary zzso zzso cells without significantly influencing the zzso activities of transformed cells in zzso and zzso zzso During productive infection, zzso interaction enhances viral replication in human zzso Between the two zzso family zzso zzso appears to restrict viral replication more than zzso in human zzso
