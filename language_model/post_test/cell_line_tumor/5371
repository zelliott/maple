A number of recent observations have suggested a potential role for zzso zzso zzso in tumor progression and appearance of more aggressive and resistant zzso through zzso interactions leading to production of zzso oxygen zzso The present study was aimed to evaluate whether such zzso activity of zzso can promote zzso DNA damage, thus contributing to cancer zzso zzso Human zzso melanoma cells were zzso and DNA damage was measured by using the alkaline comet zzso Our results indicate that higher levels of zzso activity are associated with higher levels of background DNA damage and oxidized zzso This association cannot be explained by differences in cell cycle distribution or zzso zzso zzso cells also presented with a markedly higher zzso zzso a phenomenon potentially leading to higher zzso rate and zzso DNA zzso Anyway, when zzso cells were incubated in the presence of zzso zzso and a source of zzso iron, increased levels of DNA damage and oxidized bases were observed, an effect completely prevented in the presence of zzso zzso or various zzso findings reported indicate that zzso activity is able to promote zzso DNA zzso damage, thus potentially representing an important mechanism in zzso of zzso zzso
