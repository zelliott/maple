zzso is a novel zzso zzso capable of zzso zzso zzso II activity with a high degree of zzso We examined the effects of zzso on pancreatic zzso cellular migration, invasion, zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibited cellular migration and zzso zzso by modified zzso chamber zzso zzso zzso 2 and 9 activities were unaffected by zzso and cellular proliferation was inhibited only by zzso of zzso exceeding those required to inhibit zzso II activity and to interfere with migration and zzso While zzso treatment did not affect cell zzso to the zzso zzso component zzso it markedly impaired cell spreading on this zzso Cell surface expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was unaffected by zzso Our observations illustrate the critical role of zzso zzso II in pancreatic zzso cellular zzso and zzso zzso interaction and suggest that therapeutic strategies targeting zzso II warrant further zzso
