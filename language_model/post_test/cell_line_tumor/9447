zzso zzso zzso is an important factor of innate immunity contributing to the clearance of zzso Recently, an zzso role of zzso has been zzso We investigated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso complex activity in patients with zzso zzso The expression of both zzso and zzso genes were investigated in zzso tissue zzso Additionally, samples from patients with other zzso and benign zzso of the zzso tract were zzso A significantly higher zzso of zzso zzso zzso was found among patients with zzso disease compared to zzso zzso zzso no differences in median zzso level or zzso complex activity were found between the zzso This was partly a reflection of higher zzso zzso and zzso activity in cancer patients compared with healthy women carrying corresponding zzso zzso zzso expression was detected in several normal and zzso zzso zzso as well as in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso demonstrated the presence of zzso in zzso cell lines, and in normal as well as zzso zzso tissue zzso In contrast, zzso zzso expression was detected only in the zzso zzso of patients with zzso zzso No significant changes in zzso concentration during 3 months of chemotherapy were zzso zzso was detected in zzso and in the fluid of benign zzso zzso Our findings may reflect zzso activity of zzso protein which might suggest potential therapeutic zzso However, it cannot be excluded that zzso zzso zzso may be in linkage zzso with an unidentified zzso zzso zzso
