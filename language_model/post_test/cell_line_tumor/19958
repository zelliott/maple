zzso cancer usually zzso to zzso zzso after an initial zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is a pivotal factor for the zzso growth and maintenance of the zzso zzso of the zzso such as zzso has been zzso to be related to the hormone independent growth of the zzso Although we previously demonstrated that the zzso expression could be modulated by zzso which are natural constituents of zzso vegetables, the zzso however, remained to be zzso We have since investigated the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

A human zzso dependent prostate cancer cell line zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso independent but zzso zzso were exposed to zzso The effects of zzso on cell growth and zzso zzso were analyzed with zzso zzso real-time zzso and western zzso The zzso promoter activity was analyzed with the reporter activity after zzso with zzso The effects on zzso the major zzso factor of the zzso were tested with zzso activity, western zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso 

zzso induced a significant growth zzso with equal zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso present in both cells was zzso as demonstrated with real-time zzso and western zzso zzso mediates dual effects at zzso and zzso levels to regulate the zzso At zzso level the zzso level was reduced via zzso of the zzso factor zzso and at zzso level by accelerating protein zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and mediates growth arrest in zzso dependent and independent prostate cancer zzso With the zzso zzso and growth zzso zzso and possibly other zzso may prevent and inhibit hormone sensitive and zzso prostate zzso
