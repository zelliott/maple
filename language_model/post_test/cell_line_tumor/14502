Recently, it was shown that the resistance of breast cancer cells to zzso zzso action may be accompanied with the paradoxical zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso In the present paper, we studied the influence of zzso on the sensitivity of resistant breast zzso to zzso drugs, and to evaluate the role of zzso zzso factor zzso zzso in the regulation of the zzso response of the resistant zzso The experiments were carried out on the zzso zzso breast cancer cells and resistant zzso zzso generated through long-term zzso of the parental cells in the absence of zzso The cell treatment with the combination of zzso and zzso zzso was found to enhance the zzso action of zzso in zzso cells but not in the parent zzso zzso cells were characterized by the increased level of zzso zzso oxygen zzso and decreased zzso zzso zzso in combination with zzso leads to significant zzso stimulation and its zzso in the nucleus of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso with zzso zzso interfering zzso increased the zzso response of the zzso cells to both zzso and zzso demonstrating the important role of zzso in the protection of the zzso cells against zzso In general, the results obtained show that: zzso zzso enhances the zzso action of zzso in the resistant breast cancer zzso and zzso suppression of zzso zzso zzso the zzso response of the resistant cells to both zzso and zzso demonstrating that zzso may serve as a potential target in the therapy of the resistant breast zzso
