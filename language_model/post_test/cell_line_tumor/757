zzso zzso zzso zzso is essential in the maintenance of cellular energetic economy in cells of fully differentiated zzso with highly variable energy demand, such as muscle and zzso To investigate if AK zzso have a comparable function in the zzso management of zzso cells, zzso and zzso were expressed in mouse zzso zzso cells and in human colon zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibitor tests revealed a differential energy dependency for these two cell zzso zzso cells showed a faster proliferation rate and strongest zzso to zzso activity, zzso proliferation was more dependent on zzso Despite these differences, zzso expression of zzso or zzso did not affect their growth characteristics under normal zzso Also, no differential effects were seen under zzso stress upon treatment with zzso and zzso zzso in in zzso culture or in solid tumors grown in zzso Although many intimate connections have been revealed between cell death and zzso our results suggest that zzso or zzso zzso zzso transfer is not a modulating factor in the survival of tumor cells during episodes of zzso zzso
