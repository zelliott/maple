zzso zzso zzso has already entered clinical trials of solid tumors over ten zzso However, the limited zzso activity and zzso toxicity restrict its clinical zzso Here, we offered convincing evidence that zzso induced zzso in various cancer cells, which was demonstrated by zzso orange zzso of zzso zzso zzso the degradation of zzso the conversion of zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso cell death was further zzso by zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or small interfering zzso against the zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso The enhanced zzso activity of zzso and zzso was further confirmed in the zzso zzso tumor zzso These findings suggested that zzso zzso response played a protective role that zzso the eventual cell death while zzso zzso was expected to improve zzso efficacy of zzso Meanwhile, zzso treatment led to zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso inhibitor or zzso zzso inhibited zzso but promoted zzso zzso indicating a key requirement of zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso by zzso We also identified that zzso of zzso inhibitor zzso could significantly enhance zzso activity of zzso due to zzso of zzso Taken together, our data suggested that the zzso zzso was considered as the critical regulator of zzso protective zzso and a potential drug target for zzso zzso
