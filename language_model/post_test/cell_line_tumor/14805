To observe the effects of small interfering zzso zzso bone zzso protein zzso on the abilities of migration and invasion of human liver cancer zzso cells and its zzso Three zzso zzso gene were zzso There were six groups including group I zzso zzso group II zzso zzso zzso group III zzso zzso zzso and groups zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso using zzso zzso The levels of zzso and protein of zzso in cells were determined with reverse zzso and western zzso The abilities of migration and invasion of zzso cells were assessed using scratch test and in zzso invasion zzso zzso The protein levels of zzso zzso and zzso and the protein levels of zzso and zzso were evaluated with western zzso zzso after zzso zzso was zzso into liver cancer zzso zzso zzso of zzso and protein of zzso in groups zzso were significantly zzso especially in group zzso Cell scratch zzso was significantly greater in group V than in group I and III ( zzso In zzso invasion zzso suggested that the number of invasion of cells was significantly lower in group V than in group I and III ( zzso Western zzso indicated that the level of zzso was significantly decreased ( zzso the levels of zzso and zzso were not significantly changed and the levels of zzso and zzso were significantly zzso ( zzso zzso zzso can markedly inhibited the expression of zzso in liver cancer zzso cells, and decrease the abilities of migration and invasion of liver cancer cells, especially zzso The zzso effects of zzso zzso on the abilities of migration and invasion of human liver cancer zzso cells may be caused by the zzso of zzso and zzso through zzso pathway, whereas is not related to zzso and zzso zzso
