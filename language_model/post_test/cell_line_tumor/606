To investigate the effects of zzso zzso cells on the zzso zzso and function of the zzso cells zzso 

Human zzso zzso zzso cells were isolated from specimens of zzso zzso from 12 patients obtained during operation, and zzso zzso blood samples were collected from these zzso DC were isolated and zzso with zzso human tumor necrosis factor zzso to promote their zzso zzso and flow zzso zzso were used to detect the DC specific marker zzso maturation marker zzso zzso factors zzso and human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was added and zzso was used to detect the zzso zzso T cells were zzso with immature and mature DC of different zzso respectively for 96 zzso 18 h before the end of culture zzso was added, liquid zzso counter was used to measure the level of count per minute zzso zzso zzso cells and peripheral zzso cells were put into zzso to contact each other directly or zzso zzso was add to promote the zzso and then zzso was used to detect the zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels, and the zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to detect the levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and Western zzso was used to detect the zzso protein and zzso zzso protein in the zzso 

After stimulation of zzso the zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso were remarkably zzso zzso zzso showed a strong ability at zzso of zzso and this ability was decreased by the stimulation of zzso The zzso function of mature zzso on zzso T zzso was significantly increased zzso ( zzso zzso with zzso zzso cells decreased the expression levels of zzso zzso and zzso increased the expression level of zzso and decreased the ability in up taking zzso by zzso The zzso function of the DC cultured in direct contact with zzso zzso cells was decreased by zzso and such zzso function of the zzso cultured not in direct contact with zzso zzso cells was weaker, and the levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso expressed by the DC cultured not in direct contact with zzso zzso cells was between those of the DC cultured in direct contact with zzso zzso cells and those of the DC undergoing routine zzso The levels of zzso and zzso zzso protein were decreased in the zzso of the DC zzso with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso cells suppress the differentiation of zzso into DC, zzso regulates the zzso and zzso managing functions of DC, thus the DC can not effectively stimulate the proliferation of T zzso and inhibit the activity of zzso T zzso That may be one of the underlying mechanisms of immune escape of tumor and immune tolerance of T zzso
