zzso has been implicated in a plethora of important cellular processes related to cell growth, cell cycle zzso zzso transformation and zzso of zzso In addition to these zzso functions, zzso has zzso functions and plays an important role in immune zzso zzso expression was previously shown to be zzso in prostate cancer, but its function in prostate cancer cells is largely zzso Here we show that zzso expression is regulated by zzso in zzso prostate cancer cells in zzso as well as human prostate cancer zzso in zzso zzso of zzso reduced colony formation and increased zzso in zzso cells, implicating it as an important factor for prostate cancer cell zzso Global gene expression profiling in zzso zzso zzso cells showed that several zzso regulated genes are regulated by zzso suggesting that it may have a role in regulating immune function in prostate zzso In addition, zzso zzso treatment increased colony formation in zzso cells suggesting that zzso zzso may function as a zzso factor in prostate zzso These results suggest that zzso may have a role in prostate cancer zzso
