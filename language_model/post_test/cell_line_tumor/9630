zzso and other zzso metals were shown to stimulate zzso of zzso bound iron and zzso bound iron in zzso and zzso zzso Because of the association between aluminum and Alzheimer's zzso and findings of higher levels of iron in Alzheimer's disease zzso the effects of aluminum on iron zzso were examined in a human zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso bound iron and iron bound to zzso A zzso was likely involved in the zzso of zzso iron because zzso reached zzso was zzso and attenuated by zzso of protein zzso Interestingly, the effects of aluminum were not blocked by zzso of zzso zzso zzso also decreased the amount of iron bound to zzso though it did not affect levels of zzso metal zzso zzso These results suggest that aluminum zzso iron zzso in the brain by several mechanisms including the zzso zzso a zzso iron zzso and zzso
