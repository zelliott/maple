The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso integrate zzso and zzso signaling zzso with the cell zzso Their zzso requires binding to a zzso zzso and then zzso zzso at zzso and zzso zzso by the only zzso zzso identified in animal cells, zzso zzso At odds with the existing data showing the zzso activity of zzso we have recently identified the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso as a crucial cell cycle regulatory zzso Here we show that zzso zzso of zzso is zzso by its unique zzso 173 zzso In contrast to zzso zzso does not contain such a zzso and, unexpectedly, remained poorly zzso and active in a variety of zzso zzso of zzso 173 did not adversely affect zzso zzso by zzso but in cells they abolished zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso substituting a zzso for the corresponding zzso of zzso enforced its complete, apparently zzso zzso zzso and dramatically increased its zzso These results lead us to propose that zzso might not be zzso by zzso in intact cells but is more likely zzso by another, presumably zzso zzso Moreover, they provide a new model of a potentially zzso zzso zzso of a zzso
