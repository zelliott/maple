A new zzso zzso complex, zzso where zzso and zzso stand for zzso and zzso respectively, has been zzso and characterized by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso infrared and electronic zzso studies, and X-ray single crystal zzso In the crystal structure, the zzso zzso bridges two zzso zzso as zzso zzso The inner zzso zzso has a zzso zzso coordination zzso while the zzso one is in a zzso zzso zzso There are two sets of zzso two-dimensional hydrogen bonding networks parallel to the planes (2 1 zzso and zzso respectively, to form a three-dimensional zzso zzso The zzso complex exhibits zzso activity against the zzso and zzso cell zzso The zzso toward zzso zzso DNA and bovine serum zzso revealed that the zzso complex can interact with the DNA by zzso mode, and the complex binds to protein zzso responsible for zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso
