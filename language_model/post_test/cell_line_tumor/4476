In the course of a screening program for the zzso of zzso from marine sources, zzso a zzso zzso zzso was selected for its zzso zzso zzso inhibited the growth of zzso and tumor cells in culture in the zzso zzso Our results show that zzso doses of this compound inhibit certain functions of zzso cells, zzso zzso migration and zzso zzso zzso of the mentioned essential steps of in zzso zzso is in agreement with the observed zzso activity, substantiated by using two in zzso zzso models, the zzso membrane and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and by the ex zzso mouse zzso ring zzso Our data indicate that zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells through zzso zzso DNA zzso increases in the zzso peak and zzso zzso The data shown here altogether indicate for the first time that zzso displays zzso effects, both in zzso and in zzso that are exerted partly by targeting the zzso signaling zzso in activated zzso zzso The fact that these effects are carried out at lower zzso than those required for other zzso of zzso makes zzso a new promising drug candidate for further evaluation in the treatment of cancer and other zzso zzso
