Clinical trials have shown that zzso supplementation increased the risk of lung and skin zzso but the underlying molecular mechanism is zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso as an exemplary zzso induced significant death and DNA damage in human lung and skin normal cells through a reductive zzso Our results show direct evidence of reductive DNA damage in the zzso We found that zzso was much more toxic against normal cells than zzso and zzso as toxic and zzso agents, while zzso at low zzso zzso zzso increased slightly the lung cancer cell zzso zzso induced DNA zzso breaks and zzso in normal cells and enhanced the zzso zzso These results provide a compelling explanation for the clinical results and unravel a new reductive damaging mechanism in cellular zzso This study therefore provides a fresh understanding of aging and diseases, and may lead to effective prevention and zzso
