Although accumulating evidence has confirmed the important roles of zzso hormone zzso and its receptors zzso in tumor zzso the specific functions of zzso in zzso remain zzso In the present study, tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso was directly zzso by zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso TRAIL is an zzso zzso but it can nonetheless trigger zzso signals favoring zzso in zzso cancer zzso We found that zzso zzso cells treated with zzso were zzso zzso even when TRAIL was zzso This zzso resistance may be attributable to simultaneous zzso of zzso by zzso because zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression suppressed zzso protection against zzso and zzso zzso of zzso further protected zzso cells from zzso zzso death, consequently leading to zzso zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso in zzso was zzso by the treatment of zzso zzso zzso TRAIL was highly expressed in a subset of zzso zzso zzso patients, and this high-level expression was significantly correlated with that of zzso in these zzso zzso Together, our findings provide evidence for the existence of a novel zzso link between increased zzso and TRAIL levels in zzso Thus, zzso induce TRAIL zzso and TRAIL thus zzso acts in concert with simultaneously zzso zzso to promote zzso but not zzso
