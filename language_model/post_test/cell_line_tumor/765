zzso attachment zzso zzso is a nuclear zzso protein that has been proposed to couple zzso structure, transcription, and zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso can repress zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we present a zzso study showing that zzso is zzso via an intrinsic and zzso zzso repression domain zzso A similar zzso zzso was found in the family member zzso zzso of the zzso from zzso resulted in a zzso zzso protein that increased zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso repression was partly blocked by zzso zzso zzso however, no zzso zzso zzso were identified in a zzso zzso screen using the zzso as zzso Instead, zzso was found to interact with zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso We propose a model in which zzso zzso zzso activity via indirect association with zzso zzso and interaction with the zzso zzso zzso
