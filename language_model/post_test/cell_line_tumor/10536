zzso is a zzso zzso factor that possesses both zzso and DNA zzso zzso Although zzso is frequently zzso in human zzso of various types and implicated in zzso functions, the upstream signaling network leading to the regulation of zzso that in turn affects zzso of downstream target genes has not been extensively zzso Here, we identify zzso is zzso by zzso zzso in hypoxic condition and zzso zzso zzso by increasing the recruitment of zzso zzso to a subset of zzso target zzso zzso zzso zzso results in the increased invasive and migratory properties by zzso downstream target zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso results in the suppression of zzso and zzso zzso Together, our data provide new approaches by targeting zzso zzso and its downstream targets for the development of therapeutic agents for human zzso
