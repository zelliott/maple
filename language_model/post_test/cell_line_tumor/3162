The zzso human zzso also named zzso zzso and zzso encodes for a single 205 zzso zzso which interacts with nuclear receptors and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on locus zzso suggests its involvement in human zzso We zzso analyzed zzso expression in human melanoma cell zzso We found that zzso is either highly or zzso expressed in melanoma cells, depending on their respectively non or zzso zzso We therefore investigated the possible existence of a relationship between the zzso expression level and melanoma cell zzso For this purpose, we zzso zzso expression by zzso melanoma cells with a zzso small interfering zzso zzso specific to the zzso region of native zzso zzso already demonstrated to inhibit specifically zzso protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso was used as zzso This zzso zzso did not modify the expression of zzso L forms or zzso zzso nor the zzso of zzso L and zzso in zzso zzso Analysis using a zzso membrane with 113 zzso zzso western zzso and specific tests, demonstrated that zzso zzso significantly zzso tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso and increases zzso zzso two genes well known to be involved in melanoma cell invasion, through modifications of the tumor zzso Indeed, zzso zzso in melanoma cells in zzso increased their invasive properties, without modification of cell zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso in zzso switched melanoma zzso from non to zzso in nude zzso Our data thus demonstrated for the first time that a decrease of zzso expression in human melanoma cells increases their zzso zzso
