zzso cancer is one of the most common zzso in zzso Several lines of evidence have suggested that bone zzso protein zzso signals play important roles in the generation and progression of prostate zzso In the present study, we show that zzso zzso the proliferation of zzso zzso and zzso prostate cancer cells in a medium containing zzso fetal bovine serum, observed as decreased incorporation of zzso and decreased cell zzso Cell cycle analysis by flow zzso showed an increased fraction of cells in the zzso phase and subsequent decrease in both S and zzso phase after zzso zzso zzso caused an zzso of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and decreased the activity of zzso leading to zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, in order to evaluate the impact of zzso signals on prostate tumor growth, we generated the zzso cell lines expressing a zzso active zzso type I zzso zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso resulted in the zzso of in zzso cell proliferation and reduction of the size of tumors derived from the zzso cells zzso injected into zzso zzso zzso these findings suggest that zzso signals inhibit growth and proliferation of prostate tumor cells through induction of zzso Furthermore, this is the first report of a role for zzso signaling in reducing growth zzso of zzso prostate zzso
