An zzso zzso cell line was subjected to zzso using zzso fluid from a mouse growing a zzso zzso an anti zzso zzso hundred random clones were picked from the surviving population and screened by direct zzso using the zzso zzso or zzso against zzso and zzso zzso clones were resistant to all three zzso indicating that they no longer expressed the entire zzso zzso zzso were resistant to the zzso and to the anti zzso zzso but sensitive to the anti zzso serum, indicating that they had lost zzso zzso but retained zzso Nine clones were sensitive to the zzso but resistant to the zzso indicating that, though they retained the zzso recognized by the zzso against zzso they had lost the zzso that bound the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso cells from young zzso zzso mice as targets show that one representative clone from the last group absorbs the anti zzso activity in the zzso This implies that the sensitivity of the zzso clone to the zzso is not due to zzso anti zzso virus zzso in the zzso The possible implications of these data are zzso
