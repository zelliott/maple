The properties of zzso zzso zzso zzso as gene carries and its gene transfer efficiency in zzso with zzso zzso were presented in this zzso zzso zzso was zzso by linking cholesterol zzso to the zzso groups of zzso zzso zzso of 1 zzso The structure and molecular weight of zzso were confirmed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso laser zzso zzso tandem mass zzso zzso The average molecular weight of zzso was approximately 2 zzso The gene delivery system of zzso was constructed by mixed zzso zzso zzso complexes with zzso zzso zzso zzso which were prepared by zzso zzso and zzso with the reverse phase evaporation zzso zzso zzso green fluorescent zzso was used as report gene to investigate the DNA condensing ability of zzso zzso by zzso gel zzso And their zzso and in zzso transfer efficiency of different complexes were compared with each other in zzso and zzso The results indicated zzso zzso can zzso zzso DNA when zzso ratio zzso 4, zzso complexes and zzso complexes were nontoxic to zzso and zzso when formulated at the zzso ratio of zzso as determined by zzso zzso This zzso delivery system provided good transfer efficiency with other desirable characteristics such as zzso of plasma zzso In conclusion, zzso complex is a novel zzso gene delivery zzso
