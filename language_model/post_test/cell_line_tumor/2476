zzso have emerged as promising carriers for the delivery of a wide variety of zzso including therapeutic drugs, imaging agents and zzso acid materials into biological zzso The current work aimed to develop a novel zzso generation 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso To achieve this goal, a known zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso on the surface of the zzso A fraction of the zzso surface charge of zzso was neutralized by partial zzso of the primary zzso zzso Next, the zzso zzso was zzso via the zzso zzso reaction between the acid group of zzso zzso and the primary zzso of the zzso zzso zzso These zzso were zzso labeled with zzso zzso zzso to zzso cell association by flow zzso and for zzso under zzso laser scanning zzso to assess the zzso targeting in zzso The newly developed zzso zzso zzso was efficiently taken up by the cells and demonstrated good zzso zzso In zzso zzso experiments carried out on normal mouse zzso cells zzso had greater cell viability in the presence of the zzso compared to the parent unmodified zzso This zzso zzso zzso could be useful for imaging as well as for selective delivery of zzso to the zzso for the treatment of diseases associated with zzso zzso
