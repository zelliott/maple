zzso therapy with tamoxifen zzso significantly improves outcomes for patients with zzso zzso breast zzso However, intrinsic zzso zzso or acquired resistance to zzso occurs in a significant proportion of treated zzso To identify genes involved in resistance to zzso we introduced full-length zzso expression library into zzso zzso zzso cells and exposed them to a zzso dose of zzso zzso Four different library zzso were isolated from surviving zzso zzso of the genes individually into zzso zzso cells made them resistant to zzso zzso zzso these genes had an increase in zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso suggesting their role in zzso One of them, zzso zzso was investigated zzso zzso of zzso increased cell zzso zzso several established markers of zzso including expression of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso in an zzso dependent manner, and increased resistance to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells increased cell sensitivity to zzso and at the same time decreased cell proliferation and expression of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso of zzso activity of zzso enhanced zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso with acquired resistance to zzso exhibited increased zzso activity, although zzso of zzso prevented development of zzso resistance in parental zzso cells and restored response to zzso in zzso cells with acquired resistance to zzso Thus, we have for the first time identified zzso as a resistance factor for zzso resistance in zzso zzso breast cancer zzso
