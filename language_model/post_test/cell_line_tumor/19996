The generation, survival, and differentiation of breast cancer stem cells zzso in zzso hosts remain zzso Some investigators have shown that zzso can be induced from zzso tumor cells by the zzso zzso to zzso transition zzso Emerging evidence suggests that the induction of zzso among zzso tumor cells originates from signals produced by the zzso cells that constitute the tumor zzso including the immune zzso that zzso the zzso Thus, this suggests that the immune system not only has zzso function, but also paradoxically zzso tumors, zzso tumor escape and zzso Indeed, many studies in human breast zzso show both positive and negative associations between the zzso of various immune zzso zzso zzso and zzso T zzso and the propensity to zzso with zzso zzso These observations suggest that distinct types of immune zzso cells may induce or inhibit tumor zzso This review focuses on recent advances in identifying components of the immune system that may directly induce tumor escape and zzso We propose that levels of zzso zzso production or levels of the expression of zzso zzso zzso on tumor cells may determine whether tumor zzso or zzso effect of zzso may zzso
