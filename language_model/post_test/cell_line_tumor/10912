We investigated in zzso whether zzso and zzso affect pancreatic cancer cell growth, zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso to zzso zzso and type I zzso and zzso invasion after stimulation with zzso zzso and zzso were evaluated using three primary and three zzso pancreatic cancer cell zzso 

zzso zzso zzso of control cells varied independently of the zzso characteristics of the studied cell lines, whereas zzso invasion of control cells was partly correlated with the in zzso zzso zzso zzso did not influence zzso zzso zzso whereas it significantly enhanced the zzso of three of the six cell zzso zzso affected the zzso of one cell line, and exerted contrasting effects on zzso invasion of different cell zzso 

zzso enhances the invasive capacity of pancreatic cancer cells, whereas zzso has paradoxical effects on pancreatic cancer zzso this makes it difficult to interfere with zzso signaling in pancreatic cancer zzso
