The invasion process is a crucial step for pancreatic zzso zzso zzso however, the genes related to invasion remain zzso To identify specific genes for the invasion process, we compared zzso data for zzso cancer and zzso which were harvested from an individual zzso patient by zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso and invasion analyses were performed to confirm the zzso significance of molecules identified by expression zzso In the present study, we focused on zzso and zzso among 87 genes that were significantly zzso in zzso components compared to zzso in all zzso patients, because zzso was the most differently expressed between two regions, and zzso was reported as the zzso for zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso and zzso were expressed simultaneously only in zzso components and increased at the invasion front, and binding of zzso and zzso was found in zzso by zzso zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso and the zzso of zzso binding to zzso by zzso inhibited both invasion and migration of pancreatic cancer cell zzso zzso zzso high expression was an independent zzso factor for poor survival in zzso zzso In conclusion, we identified two specific zzso zzso and zzso associated with the invasion process in patients with zzso
