Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer and the second leading cause of cancer deaths in women zzso A number of zzso derivatives have been found to possess significant pharmacological effects associated with marked zzso and zzso zzso In the present study, the in zzso effect of zzso zzso was evaluated on zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso human breast cancer cell zzso Moreover, the in zzso activity of this compound on cell cycle regulation and zzso were zzso 

zzso methods of cell zzso cell cycle, Western zzso and zzso were zzso 

The effect of zzso on zzso zzso and zzso cells revealed significant zzso activities with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell cycle analysis showed that zzso inhibited progression through the cell cycle in zzso and zzso cell lines in a zzso zzso zzso arrested cells in the zzso of the cell cycle with the greatest proportion of cells in the zzso by day zzso This zzso arrest was zzso by zzso of zzso I induced by zzso These findings were further validated using Western zzso analysis of zzso protein zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso induced zzso in both zzso and zzso cell lines in a zzso zzso However, the highest percentages of zzso cells were observed in the zzso cell zzso 

Although the mechanism of action of zzso has not been completely zzso it appears that this compound can inhibit zzso I in a zzso zzso These promising results to explore novel zzso zzso as potential breast cancer zzso This study suggests that zzso may have an impact on treatment of zzso and zzso breast cancer while protecting the bone zzso
