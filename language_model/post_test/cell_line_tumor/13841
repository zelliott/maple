zzso zzso the most common solid zzso cancer of childhood, displays a remarkable low expression of Major zzso Complex class I zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and poorly presents tumor zzso to zzso T zzso zzso We have previously shown that this is due to low expression of the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso we show that not only zzso zzso but also the zzso Regulatory Factor 1 zzso and certain zzso components are low in a subset of zzso cell lines with aggressive zzso Whereas single zzso with either zzso or zzso zzso is zzso zzso results in strong zzso and substantial zzso of the zzso zzso in all zzso cell lines zzso zzso linked zzso expression patterns between nuclear zzso and zzso on the one hand, and zzso on the other hand, were observed in zzso zzso and presence of the three molecules neatly zzso between high-grade and zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso by double zzso zzso rendered a zzso cell line susceptible to killing by anti zzso zzso zzso efficiency comparable to those seen upon zzso zzso This is the first demonstration that a complex immune escape zzso can be rescued by zzso of a limited number of master regulatory zzso These findings provide molecular insight into defective zzso expression in zzso cells and provide the rational for T zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso to conventional zzso
