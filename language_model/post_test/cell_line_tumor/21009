Pulmonary zzso zzso zzso is a multifunctional, pattern recognition zzso involved in resistance to zzso challenge and pulmonary zzso In view of therapeutic effects of zzso zzso or zzso zzso of human zzso zzso zzso zzso of eight zzso collagen repeat zzso zzso neck and zzso zzso in zzso models of lung zzso and zzso zzso zzso mice, we investigated the possibility of a direct interaction of zzso zzso with human zzso derived from allergic patients and healthy zzso zzso showed a zzso and zzso binding to human zzso suggesting involvement of its zzso recognition zzso While zzso from allergic patients showed a significant increase in zzso zzso burst and zzso expression in presence of zzso zzso from healthy donors showed no significant zzso However, these zzso from healthy donors when primed with zzso exhibited increase in zzso on incubation with zzso zzso zzso by zzso in primed zzso was not affected by the zzso zzso There was a zzso increase in binding of zzso to zzso zzso than the normal zzso and zzso induced a significant increase in zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso The study suggests that zzso zzso preferential increase of zzso of primed zzso while not affecting the normal zzso and increased zzso of zzso zzso may be important mechanisms of zzso and zzso zzso resolution of allergic zzso inflammation in zzso
