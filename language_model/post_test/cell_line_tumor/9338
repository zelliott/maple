zzso receptors zzso are potential targets for zzso zzso and zzso of zzso are discussed as possible modes of action for zzso We have investigated the effects of zzso and zzso compounds with potentially zzso activity from zzso John's zzso on the binding behavior and dynamics of zzso in living rat zzso zzso cells, compared to zzso zzso zzso by means of zzso correlation zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies with the zzso labeled zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso of zzso cells showed a significant reduction in total zzso binding after zzso with zzso and zzso for 3 days, respectively, which was also found for zzso This was mainly observed in zzso zzso complexes with hindered lateral mobility zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso However, zzso of zzso was found neither in zzso of these zzso cells nor in zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso zzso receptors zzso after incubation up to 6 days with either zzso zzso or zzso Thus, under these conditions reduction of zzso binding was not zzso by zzso zzso Additionally, zzso of zzso cells with zzso zzso and zzso led to a loss of second zzso zzso after zzso stimulating conditions with zzso Our current results indicate that zzso and zzso from zzso John's zzso as well as zzso reduce zzso sensitivity in zzso cells, emphasizing the potential usefulness of zzso John's zzso dry extracts in clinical treatment of depressive zzso
