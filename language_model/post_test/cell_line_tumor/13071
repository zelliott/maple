Two new zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso together with 15 known compounds zzso were isolated from the whole plants of zzso zzso Their structures were established on the basis of extensive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso data analysis and by the comparison with zzso data reported in the zzso zzso capacities of the isolated substances were determined using the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso radical in zzso zzso and their zzso activities were also tested on zzso zzso toxicity in zzso zzso Among all the tested compounds, zzso zzso exhibited both strong zzso effect and high protective activity against zzso zzso Further investigation found 7 could decrease zzso death of zzso cell, reduce zzso and zzso level, and inhibit the elevated zzso concentration of zzso and zzso The preliminary zzso relationships zzso of these compounds revealed the zzso double bond on zzso and zzso on zzso with a zzso skeleton such as zzso and its zzso were necessary for their zzso zzso
