zzso zzso zzso a zzso inhibitor of the human zzso zzso has been evaluated as an zzso zzso The synthesis of four structural variations zzso of zzso is zzso The zzso zzso zzso were obtained by reaction of suitable zzso blocks with zzso zzso or with zzso zzso and zzso zzso The evaluation of 2-4 for zzso activity against a panel of 60 human cancer cell lines showed zzso effects on the growth of the cell zzso These data are supported by molecular modeling and zzso studies, which show that compounds 2-4 share the same binding mode within the zzso active zzso Moreover, the estimated zzso binding energies are in good agreement with the experimental activity zzso
