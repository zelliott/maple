zzso prostate cancer eventually develops zzso and radical treatment may not be possible for patients at this zzso In this study, we examined the zzso profiles of two prostate cancer cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso zzso using zzso zzso We focused on the expression of zzso zzso zzso whose expression is much higher in zzso than in zzso and investigated its biological role in acquisition of zzso cancer zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis of zzso zzso revealed that zzso expression was much stronger in zzso than in zzso zzso of zzso expression using zzso induced an increase in the expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene 1, along with a decrease in the expression of genes associated with cancer zzso including zzso growth factor I and zzso growth factor zzso in zzso with compared to zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso induced a significant decrease of cell viability in zzso when cultured in zzso serum, becoming consistent with that of zzso suggesting that zzso zzso may induce an increase in the expression of zzso and characteristic conversion of prostate cancer cells from hormone zzso to hormone zzso We suggest that zzso zzso may be a new strategy for treatment of patients with zzso prostate zzso
