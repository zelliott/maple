zzso liquids are widely studied as alternative zzso in organic synthesis and zzso in zzso and the separation zzso with their many applications they will soon be produced on an industrial zzso Available zzso data of zzso liquids have already suggested initial guidelines for the conscious design of safer zzso In this study a new group of such redesigned zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with respect to their zzso activity towards zzso and their cellular toxicity towards the zzso rat zzso zzso cell zzso the acute biological activity of these compounds is very zzso zzso zzso lie in the zzso range, which is well above possible zzso zzso Only the compounds with the longest zzso chain inhibit the zzso at effective zzso that are one order of magnitude zzso No significant differences are observed when the zzso compartment in the zzso zzso is zzso However, the zzso data show zzso for zzso and zzso to be higher than the values for the zzso zzso Also, a slight zzso chain length effect on the overall zzso is zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso varies from zzso to zzso and depends on the type of zzso the zzso is linked zzso It improves with lengthening zzso chain, but only in the range from 4 to 11 carbon zzso
