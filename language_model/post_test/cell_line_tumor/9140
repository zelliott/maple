Several studies have shown how zzso zzso can inhibit proliferation and induce zzso of some tumor cell zzso however, its effect on zzso tumors, one of the most zzso forms of cancer, has rarely been zzso The aim of this study was to examine how the zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso acid, isolated from olive juice, affected zzso cell zzso and zzso Cell proliferation was inhibited in zzso zzso cells by using 1 to 50 zzso of either zzso acid or zzso acid, with an average zzso of 25 zzso Growth zzso led to zzso and zzso zzso associated with the loss of zzso zzso and characterized by a zzso of the zzso and collapse of zzso stress zzso Using zzso and zzso zzso we showed that zzso cell death induced by zzso acid or zzso acid were mainly due to zzso zzso Furthermore, we showed that zzso is activated as a consequence of zzso zzso Finally, we found that exposure of the cells to zzso acid or zzso acid resulted in a significant increase of zzso zzso oxygen species, followed by loss of zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso or zzso zzso such as zzso zzso rescued cells from the zzso zzso suggesting that the potential therapeutic effect of these zzso zzso is dependent on zzso zzso Our data show that zzso zzso play a major role in zzso zzso zzso and viability and support the conclusion that zzso acid and zzso acid may thus be promising new agents in the management of zzso
