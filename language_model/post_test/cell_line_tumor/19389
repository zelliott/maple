The expression of the zzso for advanced zzso end products zzso has an impact on the mechanisms giving rise to characteristic features of various cancer zzso The purpose of this study was to zzso the zzso relevance of the level of zzso expression in patients with zzso zzso zzso and to explore the effect of zzso expression on the characteristic features of zzso 

The expression of zzso was assessed in paired cancer and zzso zzso with zzso using zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso The quantitative zzso data were analyzed in association with the zzso factors of the patients with zzso In in zzso experiments, the survival of zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells was compared under hypoxic zzso In addition, after reducing zzso levels in zzso zzso cells by zzso similar experiments were zzso 

The expression of zzso zzso was lower in normal liver than in zzso and highest in zzso Furthermore, in zzso it was high in zzso and moderately differentiated tumors but declined as tumors zzso to poorly differentiated zzso Furthermore, zzso lines resistant to zzso were found to have higher levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso also showed significantly prolonged survival under zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso during the early stage of zzso with less blood supply may acquire resistance to stringent hypoxic milieu by zzso zzso zzso
