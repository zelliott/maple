zzso melanoma is an aggressive form of skin cancer that is highly resistant to conventional zzso The melanoma inhibitor of zzso protein is a potent inhibitor of zzso and is zzso in melanoma cells, but zzso in most normal zzso including zzso We designed zzso zzso zzso zzso complementary to five zzso zzso sites on the melanoma inhibitor of zzso protein zzso and investigated their ability to sensitize zzso melanoma cells to zzso zzso of melanoma inhibitor of zzso protein zzso and protein expression were measured by real-time zzso chain reaction and zzso Cell viability and zzso were zzso by zzso viability zzso and by zzso V zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified as the most efficient zzso sequence which zzso melanoma inhibitor of zzso protein zzso and protein levels in zzso cells by 68 and zzso zzso The specificity of target zzso was confirmed using scrambled sequence control zzso that only marginally decreased melanoma inhibitor of zzso protein zzso Whereas zzso of melanoma inhibitor of zzso protein moderately inhibited cell growth by zzso in combination with zzso this resulted in a zzso effect with almost 57% reduction in zzso cell viability compared with zzso alone zzso ( zzso Cell death was mainly due to zzso as demonstrated by a 3- to zzso increase in zzso zzso cells and typical zzso changes compared with zzso In zzso we describe a new zzso zzso that efficiently zzso melanoma inhibitor of zzso protein expression and zzso melanoma cells to zzso
