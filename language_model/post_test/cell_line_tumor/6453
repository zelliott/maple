The limited availability and potential to culture primary human brain cells means that there is still a need for cell lines that reliably model human zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso cell line is a promising tool from which both zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells can be derived in zzso Here we have investigated the potential to use this cell model to investigate the zzso system in the zzso Through zzso characterization with a range of zzso and zzso zzso we found that these cell lines differentiate into cells with immature zzso and zzso zzso zzso By real-time zzso zzso and functional zzso of zzso zzso the zzso 1 receptors were identified only on zzso cells, consistent with high levels of expression of this zzso in zzso cells of the zzso No evidence of zzso 2 zzso expression was found on any of the zzso cell zzso Both the precursors and the differentiated zzso and zzso cells demonstrated zzso expression for the key zzso involved in zzso synthesis and zzso This work establishes a zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells, providing an alternative human derived renewable cell model for investigation of zzso zzso function and zzso synthesis and metabolism in the zzso
