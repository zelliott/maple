DNA zzso agents alone or with zzso radiation have been the preferred conditioning treatment in zzso zzso stem cell transplantation zzso In search of less toxic alternatives, we hypothesized that combination of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso would provide superior zzso At low zzso these drugs show synergistic zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso Similar molecular responses were observed in other zzso cell lines and in primary zzso zzso zzso The zzso combination activates an intense DNA damage response through the zzso pathway, leading to cell cycle checkpoint zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso 3 and 4, are much more pronounced in cells exposed to zzso than zzso suggesting their relevance in the efficacy of the zzso zzso A possible mechanism for these observed synergistic effects involves the capability of zzso to induce zzso zzso and subsequent zzso zzso which may render the zzso DNA more accessible to zzso zzso The zzso DNA zzso may provide a feedback loop which zzso the DNA damage response initiated by zzso and commits the cells to zzso Our results provide a conceptual zzso basis for exploring this zzso combination in zzso conditioning therapy for zzso
