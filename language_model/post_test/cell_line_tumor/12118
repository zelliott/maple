We show that two commonly occurring zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso deletion zzso zzso exhibit distinct zzso properties relative to zzso zzso and are zzso sensitive to zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso reveals that both zzso are active but exhibit a higher zzso for zzso and a lower zzso for zzso relative to zzso zzso When expressed in zzso cells, a cell line that does not express zzso or other zzso zzso both zzso are zzso dependent for zzso zzso can activate downstream zzso signaling zzso and promote cell cycle zzso As expected from the kinetic analysis, the zzso zzso is more sensitive to zzso zzso than the zzso zzso zzso Further characterization shows that these zzso promote zzso and zzso growth, and cells harboring these zzso receptors form tumors in zzso zzso Analysis of tumor zzso reveals that the zzso of the zzso zzso cell lines may be due to a differential pattern of zzso zzso zzso as compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso of tumor growth, in mice harboring zzso zzso zzso is only observed at doses of zzso approaching the maximum tolerated dose for the zzso In contrast, the growth of zzso tumors is inhibited by zzso treatment at approximately one third the maximum tolerated zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso directly influence both zzso sensitivity and cellular zzso
