To investigate the mechanism underlying the zzso activity of zzso B on human zzso zzso 

zzso cells were treated with different zzso of zzso B for different zzso zzso zzso was used to evaluate cell zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and fluorescent zzso with zzso zzso zzso were used to estimate cell cycle distribution and cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso B1 and zzso proteins was evaluated by Western zzso zzso In zzso zzso effects of zzso B on tumor growth was evaluated in a nude mouse zzso zzso 

zzso B inhibited cellular proliferation in a dose and time dependent manner zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that treatment with zzso B resulted in zzso of cells at the zzso phase of the cell cycle and cell zzso in a dose and time dependent manner zzso zzso or P zzso zzso zzso changes of cell zzso including zzso of zzso nuclear fragmentation and zzso bodies were observed clearly by zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis demonstrated that the expression of zzso zzso B1 and zzso proteins was suppressed zzso In zzso studies showed that the zzso rates on zzso zzso zzso zzso model were zzso zzso and zzso for lower, moderate and higher dosage group, zzso 

zzso B inhibited cell proliferation and induced zzso of zzso cells by suppressing zzso signal pathway, down regulating the expression of zzso B1 and zzso zzso
