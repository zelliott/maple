zzso added human zzso zzso protein possesses a remarkable zzso activity in human zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which is produced by its gene transfer using zzso zzso has much more effective zzso activity against these tumors, even in cells resistant to zzso added zzso zzso As the first step to zzso the possible difference in zzso mechanisms between zzso and zzso zzso zzso we here investigated the relationship between the zzso level of its zzso and zzso to zzso added zzso zzso In this study, we used seven human zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and one human melanoma cell line zzso At first, we examined the relationship between spontaneous expression of zzso zzso and zzso to zzso added zzso protein zzso zzso in human zzso cells and then confirmed a significant correlation between zzso Next, we confirmed that administration of zzso zzso zzso added zzso protein zzso the zzso zzso in a zzso manner using the zzso technique and that the zzso zzso was suppressed by zzso for zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, we confirmed that the zzso for zzso significantly suppressed the zzso effect of zzso cells treated with zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso cells with 25 and 50 zzso zzso zzso We found this phenomenon in another human zzso cell line, zzso cells, as zzso This finding would suggest that zzso to zzso added zzso protein is related to the amount of zzso zzso zzso in human zzso and melanoma zzso
