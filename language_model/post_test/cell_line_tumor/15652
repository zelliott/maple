zzso a natural product isolated from a zzso source, activates a reporter zzso zzso zzso zzso and shows zzso zzso We previously reported the development of a more potent zzso zzso through the total synthesis of zzso zzso we report detailed zzso relationships of zzso that revealed the significance of the zzso carbon atoms in the zzso ring, the Z geometry of the side chain, the zzso zzso the zzso group, and the zzso zzso zzso the zzso group of the zzso zzso was found to be zzso leading to a new potent zzso Additionally, partially based on in zzso data, we zzso and evaluated potentially more metabolically stable zzso for their zzso zzso These structural insights into zzso may contribute to the zzso of the natural product for further drug zzso
