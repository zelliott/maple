zzso markers enabling the prediction of zzso to zzso may facilitate further clinical development of zzso and its derivatives as zzso zzso In this study, several human zzso cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso were evaluated for zzso to zzso growth zzso The differential expression profiles of genes coding for proteins known to be involved in the zzso signaling pathway, cell cycle control and zzso were studied before and after drug exposure by zzso In cells exposed to zzso we observed a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene expression and late zzso cell cycle zzso Among these cell lines, zzso cells resistant to both zzso and zzso were the sole to show the expression of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso restored the sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso induction by zzso and zzso These results indicate that baseline zzso expression and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso may be regarded as molecular markers enabling the prediction and follow-up of the cellular effects on cell cycle and zzso induction of zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, strategies to down regulate zzso in zzso cancer may prove useful in combination with zzso or zzso for zzso zzso
