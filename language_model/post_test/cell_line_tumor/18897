The zzso cell line and its zzso zzso are frequently used for studying human zzso transport and metabolism of zzso We have investigated the expression of soluble zzso zzso in parental zzso and zzso cells by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in both cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso protein was found in zzso but not in zzso zzso Other differences in zzso between the cell lines were zzso More important was the influence of zzso zzso of the various zzso forms was low or not zzso in cultures just reaching zzso but then increased zzso Likewise, the rate of zzso of the model zzso zzso was increased with increasing culture zzso zzso and zzso were formed in both cell lines when zzso was used as a zzso A further zzso zzso was detected in zzso but not in parental zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced the conversion of zzso to these zzso without altering zzso levels of major zzso zzso forms zzso zzso and zzso Overall, differentiated zzso and zzso cells are rich sources of zzso as is human zzso zzso The zzso pattern is most similar to that found in small zzso although levels of zzso and zzso are lower, and those of zzso are higher in zzso and zzso cells than previously found in zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso in the cultured cells reflects the in zzso situation, where zzso expression is focused to differentiated zzso
