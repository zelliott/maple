We recently completed the total synthesis of zzso A, a zzso natural product with close structural similarities to zzso a zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso currently being evaluated in clinical trials for zzso Here we report a detailed zzso of the in zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso A was a potent zzso inhibitor of class I zzso activity in zzso and acted as a zzso requiring reduction for zzso zzso A was a potent zzso zzso inhibitor of the growth of various cancer cell zzso zzso zzso zzso of specific zzso zzso within zzso zzso and zzso and increased the expression of zzso but did not induce zzso of zzso zzso A also induced cell cycle arrest, differentiation and cell death in zzso breast cancer zzso Like zzso zzso A was both an zzso and zzso of the zzso drug zzso zzso Whereas zzso A and zzso protracted zzso zzso zzso zzso short-lived zzso zzso Using a subset of zzso genes identified by zzso analysis, we demonstrated that these differences in zzso of zzso zzso between zzso correlated with differences in the zzso of induction or repression of specific target zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso A is a potent inhibitor of class I zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of action of zzso may be important for the clinical application of these zzso
