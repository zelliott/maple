zzso resistance, or the ability for cells to live detached from the zzso zzso is a property of zzso zzso The zzso zzso or the preference of cancer cells for zzso for their energy production even in the presence of zzso has been shown to be evident in various zzso Since a cancer cell's zzso ability depends on zzso conditions zzso zzso cells, and zzso and is highly variable for different zzso their cellular zzso zzso and zzso demand may show considerable zzso Moreover, a cancer cell's zzso ability, which is dependent on the stage of cancer, may further create zzso zzso depending on its zzso Although recent studies have aimed to zzso cancer cell metabolism under detached conditions, the zzso demand and zzso activity of cancer cells under zzso conditions remain poorly zzso Additionally, less is known about zzso zzso in zzso cancer cells with varying invasive capability under zzso zzso We hypothesized that the metabolism of highly invasive zzso cancer cells in detachment would differ from less invasive zzso cancer cells and that zzso cancer cells will have altered metabolism in detached zzso attached zzso To assess these zzso differences, we integrated a zzso zzso zzso zzso approach with zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso revealed higher zzso zzso and oxygen consumption in more invasive zzso cancer cells than their less invasive zzso Furthermore, zzso production was higher in more invasive zzso less invasive zzso cancer cells in zzso We found that zzso has an effect on highly invasive zzso cancer zzso migration zzso Our results are the first to demonstrate that higher zzso activity is related to higher zzso cancer zzso under detached zzso zzso our results bring insights regarding the metabolism of cancer cells under zzso conditions and could lead to the development of therapies for modulating cancer cell zzso
