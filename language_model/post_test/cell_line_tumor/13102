The aim of this study was to evaluate the zzso activity of zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced tumor mass zzso and decreased number of zzso events in a zzso zzso melanoma zzso zzso on expression of several genes related to cell cycle were observed when two tumor cell lines were treated with zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso was zzso zzso in agreement to zzso of zzso activity in both cell zzso In conclusion, our results indicate that zzso selectively acts on tumor cells by inducing zzso cell death, possibly by targeting the zzso zzso
