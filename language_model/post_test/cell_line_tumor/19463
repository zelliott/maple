Despite recent advances in conventional therapeutic approaches for cancer, the frequently observed acquired drug resistance and toxic side effects have limited their clinical zzso The main goal of this work was to investigate the combined zzso effect of zzso with zzso zzso gene therapy zzso by human serum zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso zzso Our results show that, among the different zzso zzso tested, zzso complexes prepared from zzso zzso at the zzso zzso charge ratio, was the most efficient to mediate gene delivery, even in the presence of zzso The simultaneous addition of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso cells improved zzso expression more than 10 zzso When combined with the zzso zzso gene therapy zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a great enhancement in the zzso activity in zzso zzso Most importantly, this combined strategy resulted in a significant synergistic effect, thus allowing the use of a much lower dose of the drug to achieve the same therapeutic zzso Overall, our results indicate that this approach has the potential to overcome some major limitations of conventional chemotherapy, and may therefore constitute a promising strategy for future applications in zzso zzso
