It has been shown previously that zzso protein zzso zzso has an zzso activity, which is increased by protein zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso mechanism for zzso zzso is not zzso In this study, we examined zzso involved in zzso zzso and we determined that zzso is specifically zzso by protein zzso 2A zzso By zzso zzso zzso only zzso with zzso but not with protein zzso zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso occurred only in the nuclear zzso Moreover, the zzso association with zzso was identified in cells zzso with zzso zzso but not with zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso acid induced zzso zzso The level of zzso zzso in cells was decreased by the zzso of zzso and was increased by the zzso of zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso stress regulates the zzso status of zzso zzso by both zzso zzso and blocking the zzso interaction with zzso
