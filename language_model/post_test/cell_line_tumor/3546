zzso of the zzso family are key regulators of zzso zzso and zzso Some members of this family, notably zzso and zzso are zzso in cancer cells, which have been associated with zzso We have designed and zzso a small zzso inhibitor of zzso named zzso and studied its role in cancer zzso In zzso studies showed that zzso zzso the binding of the Bid zzso zzso to zzso thus zzso an interaction essential for the zzso activity of zzso This inhibitor zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso and breast cancer cells that express high levels of zzso On the contrary, a variety of normal primary cells, including zzso zzso zzso and peripheral blood zzso cells, do not respond to the zzso A breast cancer cell line resistant to zzso was zzso Analysis of resistant cells revealed a reduced expression of zzso which correlated with low zzso of signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and reduced expression of the human zzso growth factor zzso zzso Of note, zzso cells were more sensitive to zzso induced by zzso Because zzso has not been linked previously to the zzso zzso pathway, we additionally confirmed that specific blockade of zzso in breast cancer cells resulted in zzso of zzso activity and reduced levels of zzso zzso zzso blockade led to zzso zzso These data provide evidence for the selective killing of tumor cells by zzso and represent the first example of in zzso selection of cancer cells zzso to a zzso zzso
