To investigate the role of zzso on the growth and survival of human zzso zzso zzso 

In this study, we enforced zzso of zzso by zzso interference in zzso zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso cell lines expressing various levels of zzso We also established stable zzso of zzso cells zzso zzso We recently showed that zzso regulates cell cycle progression in zzso cancer zzso Thus, the effect of zzso zzso on the rate of cell growth was determined by zzso zzso To evaluate the role of zzso in drug-induced zzso zzso and zzso zzso were determined in zzso for each of the three cell zzso zzso tumor cells must acquire the ability to survive in zzso conditions to grow in zzso zzso To mimic loss of zzso and investigate the role of zzso in this process, cells were cultured on zzso plates and nuclear zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso zzso were used to determine zzso 

We show that enforced zzso of zzso protein significantly affected the growth rates of zzso whereas it had only minimal effect on the other two cell zzso zzso of zzso enhanced the sensitivity of zzso zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso The zzso to zzso induced by loss of zzso was also increased but in a cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso slowed the growth of zzso cells and zzso resistance to drug-induced zzso and zzso induced by loss of zzso 

Altogether, these findings demonstrate that zzso of zzso provokes changes in zzso cancer cell growth and survival that are cell zzso zzso therapeutic strategy for treatment of zzso cancer that target zzso will likely yield variable zzso
