zzso channel zzso is a protein highly expressed in cells of zzso zzso such as zzso Studies performed in native and zzso expression systems have shown that zzso forms zzso zzso channels functional in the plasma membrane and activated on depletion of cellular zzso In addition to internal zzso zzso pH and the zzso zzso zzso are potent zzso regulators of this zzso zzso zzso while zzso is required for zzso channel zzso These channels are also inhibited from inside by other metal zzso and zzso While the regulation of zzso channels by internal metal zzso zzso zzso and zzso is zzso independent, zzso metal zzso and zzso block zzso zzso at zzso zzso and appear to occupy a distinct blocking zzso In the present study we investigated zzso zzso and pH dependence of native zzso currents using whole cell zzso zzso in human zzso T zzso and zzso zzso Our main findings are 1) zzso zzso involves not one but two separate sites of high zzso zzso and low zzso zzso zzso and 2) while sharing certain characteristics with zzso zzso zzso most likely inhibit through one zzso site, corresponding to the zzso zzso site, with an estimated zzso of pH zzso Additionally, we present data on zzso distribution of zzso zzso currents in zzso T zzso in the absence of prior zzso or zzso zzso
