zzso zzso zzso is attributed to zzso disruption and diffusion of a subset of zzso zzso zzso particularly zzso protein zzso into the zzso where they inhibit zzso leading to zzso induction and zzso zzso Previously, we demonstrated that deletion of the zzso zzso gene in mouse liver prevents zzso from zzso the cell cycle after partial zzso Here, we show that this response leads to an increase in zzso which is zzso in culture by zzso treatment and rescued by the simultaneous depletion of zzso However, disruption of zzso of zzso zzso had no effect on zzso integrity, although zzso induction was zzso by zzso leading to the finding that the cell selectively zzso the translation of zzso with a zzso tract at their zzso start site zzso zzso including that zzso zzso on impairment of zzso zzso zzso Increased zzso zzso translation takes place despite continued zzso zzso zzso and a decrease in global zzso Thus, in zzso human disorders involving zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso specific targeting of zzso zzso would spare other stress pathways that mediate the potential benefits of zzso zzso
