Antibiotics like zzso zzso that target bacterial type II zzso pose a potential zzso risk due to interactions with zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso II can lead to the generation of zzso DNA zzso breaks zzso that can in turn manifest in zzso Thus, methods that allow early identification of drugs that present the greatest hazard are zzso A zzso zzso and zzso zzso screen that can be applied to bacterial type II zzso zzso is described zzso zzso induction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells was zzso via flow zzso and correlated with data derived from the mouse zzso screen zzso a default zzso used to rank zzso zzso When applied to a class of novel bacterial type II zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso induction zzso zzso to zzso identified zzso zzso that induced zzso relative zzso frequency zzso in zzso Moreover, response signatures zzso of zzso induction and zzso cell cycle arrest zzso using this approach suggested that these zzso primarily of the H class, operated via a zzso II zzso mechanism of action zzso similar to zzso zzso that induced zzso relative zzso which were mainly A zzso had less impact on zzso zzso and also evoked zzso arrest, indicating that their zzso effects were likely zzso through a zzso zzso zzso between zzso was zzso zzso when zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso These findings were zzso through inspection of human zzso zzso zzso data as zzso exhibiting equivalent zzso capacities had differing zzso zzso zzso in an early screening capacity, the zzso by flow zzso coupled with zzso relationship evaluation can provide insight into zzso and impact medicinal chemistry efforts, ultimately leading to the production of inherently safer zzso
