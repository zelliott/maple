zzso cells with zzso potential might be limited to a small population of cells, called zzso cells zzso zzso efficiently form colonies in zzso yield both zzso and zzso zzso maintain zzso oxygen species zzso at low levels, show high zzso zzso zzso activity, and are mostly in a zzso state of the cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso are small in size, with low levels of zzso The relationship between zzso level and zzso activity in zzso was examined in zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso populations formed colonies in zzso cultures more efficiently than zzso and zzso zzso zzso populations yielded both zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso populations rarely yielded an zzso zzso The number of cells in a zzso state was significantly greater in zzso than in zzso cells, whereas that of zzso and zzso cells was comparable to each zzso These findings show that zzso and zzso cells share zzso potential, but they differ in their cell cycle status, suggesting that zzso are comprised of cells with zzso zzso
