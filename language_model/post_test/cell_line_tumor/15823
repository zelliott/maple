Several studies have reported zzso expression of zzso in pancreatic cancer zzso which is associated with zzso and zzso zzso through which zzso promote zzso of PC cells to distant zzso are poorly zzso 

Identification of zzso interaction and its effect on the zzso of cancer cells to zzso cells were done by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso level for normal and PC patients were evaluated through zzso 

In the present study, we have provided clinical evidence that the level of zzso is significantly elevated in the zzso of PC patients with zzso disease compared with patients without zzso zzso zzso zzso and healthy controls zzso zzso zzso zzso for the first time, we demonstrate that zzso present on the surface of circulating PC cells plays a significant role in the transient and zzso attachment zzso of circulating tumor cells to the surface of zzso zzso Further, zzso zzso at zzso similar to that found in the zzso of PC patients interacts with zzso via surface zzso such as T zzso which results in the zzso of zzso on the cell surface and a stronger attachment zzso of circulating tumor cells to the zzso 

Altogether, these findings suggest that PC zzso zzso helps in the zzso of tumor cells on the zzso zzso During cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso may expose the surface zzso zzso which in turn promotes a stronger attachment zzso of tumor cells to the zzso zzso
