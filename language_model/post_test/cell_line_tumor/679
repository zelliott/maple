zzso the molecular details associated with zzso high mobility group zzso zzso gene expression is key to establishing the zzso underlying its zzso potential and effect on the development of therapeutic zzso Here, we report the involvement of zzso in zzso zzso protein zzso zzso during the zzso end joining zzso zzso We showed that zzso cells displayed zzso in overall and precise DNA zzso repair and accumulated more zzso DNA zzso Proper and timely zzso of zzso consisting of zzso zzso and zzso zzso is essential for the repair of DNA double strand breaks zzso generated zzso or by exposure to zzso In cells zzso zzso zzso of zzso 2A zzso X zzso at zzso zzso was associated with zzso of zzso at zzso and zzso before and after the induction of zzso Also, the zzso complex of zzso and DNA ends was altered by zzso zzso and real-time imaging in living cells revealed that zzso delayed the release of zzso from zzso sites, similar to observations found in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso alone was sufficient to induce zzso zzso a hallmark of zzso in zzso DNA zzso In zzso a novel role for zzso to interfere with zzso processes was uncovered, implicating zzso in the promotion of zzso instability and zzso
