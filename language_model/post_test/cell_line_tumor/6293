zzso of zzso zzso is found in various human zzso Our aim is to investigate the association of zzso expression with the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to zzso zzso 

The half zzso zzso concentration zzso value of zzso in resistant zzso or parental zzso cells was determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso or Western zzso zzso was performed to detect the expression of mature zzso and tumor zzso gene zzso zzso zzso or zzso cell line was zzso with zzso or zzso The zzso value of zzso was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were performed to analyze zzso The activity of zzso was zzso 

The zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso cells was zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We showed that zzso of zzso in zzso cells was concurrent with zzso of zzso zzso zzso mimic or inhibitor could obviously affect the sensitivity of breast cancer cells to zzso Moreover, zzso inhibitor could enhance zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso could mimic the same effects of zzso inhibitor in zzso cells and zzso could increase the resistance of zzso cells to zzso zzso inhibitor could increase zzso protein expression and the zzso activity of a zzso 3' untranslated zzso reporter construct in zzso zzso zzso could partially reverse the increased zzso of zzso cells induced by zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso plays critical roles in the zzso resistance of breast cancer, at least in part via targeting zzso
