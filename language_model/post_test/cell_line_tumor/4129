The aim of this study was to investigate the cellular delivery mechanism of the hybrid zzso zzso the zzso zzso virus zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was zzso labeled with zzso a zzso zzso and zzso with zzso The interaction of the hybrid zzso with the zzso zzso cells was monitored by zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso enhanced the zzso efficiency, which was decreased by zzso of the cells with sodium zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso suggesting the roles of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of the hybrid zzso by the zzso zzso by flow zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated an enhanced interaction between the cells and the virus when zzso with zzso zzso with zzso or zzso B significantly reduced the virus zzso by the cells, suggesting the involvement of zzso zzso zzso signaling and zzso in the interaction between the cells and the hybrid zzso Treatment of cells with the zzso including zzso acid, zzso or zzso zzso impaired the zzso zzso zzso obtained in this study illustrated the involvement of zzso signaling and the zzso production in gene delivery via the zzso hybrid zzso
