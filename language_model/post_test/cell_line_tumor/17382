We examined the effects of zzso nine different zzso zzso fragments with full-length zzso zzso on protein zzso Six fragments enhanced zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso while three others did not zzso zzso and zzso All of the peptides that enhanced zzso contained either zzso zzso or zzso indicating the importance of these regions for promoting zzso of full-length zzso zzso in particular increased both the rate and extent of zzso of zzso considerably as indicated by zzso zzso Atomic force microscope imaging zzso indicates the increase in zzso zzso with zzso is primarily due to increased formation of zzso and zzso rather than formation of large zzso zzso zzso images of zzso when incubated alone also indicate formation of zzso and long thin zzso The increase in formation of the small toxic zzso zzso of zzso along with formation of zzso zzso and thin zzso represent two different potential pathways for zzso zzso The critical roles of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso provide further insight into mechanism that zzso the formation of toxic zzso in zzso Disease zzso and suggest targets for the design of zzso breakers to zzso the zzso and inhibit toxicity of full-length zzso
