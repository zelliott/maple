zzso is a zzso finger protein member of the zzso group zzso of zzso which form zzso complexes essential for embryonic development and stem cell renewal and which are commonly zzso in zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso one of the zzso modifications needed for the zzso repression activity of the zzso of zzso zzso was shown to be part of two complexes, the zzso zzso complex and the zzso complex, which also contains zzso members, thus raising the prospect for additional zzso partners and functions extending beyond the zzso Here we used a high zzso zzso approach based on the single step zzso using zzso zzso of in zzso zzso zzso and associated proteins from a nuclear extract from zzso cells and their identification by mass zzso About 50 proteins were confidently identified of which 20 had not been identified previously as zzso of zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso were among the new zzso zzso We also isolated an zzso complex by zzso tagging to identify shared interacting partners with zzso In this way we identified a novel zzso complex that also includes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The putative zzso activities and protein interaction and zzso binding motifs present in this novel zzso complex potentially provide additional mechanisms for zzso zzso to zzso and more evidence for zzso activities beyond those typically associated with zzso zzso zzso this work demonstrates the utility of zzso tagging for the rapid characterization of complex zzso of zzso complexes achieved through the zzso use of this simple yet high zzso zzso zzso
