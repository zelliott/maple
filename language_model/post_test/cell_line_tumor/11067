zzso aberrations in the form of zzso DNA copy number changes are a hallmark of zzso zzso including breast zzso The goal of the present study was to analyze such aberrations in breast cancer at high zzso 

We employed high-resolution array comparative zzso zzso with zzso bacterial artificial zzso that cover the zzso at zzso zzso resolution to analyze 47 primary breast tumors and 18 breast cancer cell zzso 

Common zzso included zzso zzso in zzso of tumors, with zzso exhibiting high level zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and 57% of tumors, zzso Moreover, we found several positive correlations between specific zzso from different zzso suggesting the existence of cooperating genetic zzso zzso by zzso the most frequently amplified zzso was zzso zzso of zzso whereas the most frequently lost zzso was zzso zzso loss in zzso of zzso zzso of zzso as measured by comparative zzso zzso zzso correlated closely with zzso DNA and zzso levels measured by quantitative zzso as well as with zzso protein zzso The overall frequency of zzso losses was lower, with no region lost in more than 50% of zzso the most frequently lost tumor zzso gene was zzso zzso loss in zzso of zzso Finally, we find that specific copy number changes in cell lines closely zzso those in primary tumors, with an overall zzso correlation zzso of zzso for gains and zzso for zzso 

High resolution zzso analysis of breast cancer reveals several regions where DNA copy number is commonly gained or lost, that zzso correlations between specific zzso exist, and that specific genetic zzso are maintained in breast cancer cell lines despite repeat passage in tissue zzso These observations suggest that genes within these regions are critical to the zzso zzso and may thus serve as future therapeutic zzso
