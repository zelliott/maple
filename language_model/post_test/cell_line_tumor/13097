zzso of zzso has been zzso linked to normal tissue damage after zzso zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso has been suggested as a zzso agent in the treatment of zzso tumors in which zzso of zzso would not compromise therapeutic efficacy but would decrease zzso side effects in normal zzso We tested this concept for zzso of zzso and zzso zzso We observed significant interaction of zzso with zzso zzso checkpoint zzso and zzso efficiency only in zzso cells expressing at least one zzso zzso of zzso This interaction was correlated with zzso zzso of zzso expression of the zzso target gene zzso Despite zzso of zzso function we did not observe significant changes in zzso after treatment with zzso in either zzso or zzso tumor zzso We confirmed these results in zzso lung cancer zzso In contrast, zzso significantly increased the fraction of normal zzso and zzso surviving zzso this was accompanied by improved DNA damage repair, speaking against an zzso of cells with genetic zzso after zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso might prove useful in protecting normal tissue from the side effects of zzso without reducing the efficacy of treatment for both zzso and zzso zzso
