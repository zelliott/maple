The cellular models used usually to study zzso C virus replication involve zzso between translation and zzso Because this linkage makes detailed analyses difficult a new cellular model was developed where replication is rendered independent of zzso The zzso replication was studied using zzso zzso where the reporter gene was flanked by the two untranslated regions of zzso It was shown that these zzso zzso could be zzso zzso into zzso cells expressing the zzso replication zzso This was obtained either by zzso expressing the zzso proteins into zzso zzso cells or by using zzso cells harboring zzso
