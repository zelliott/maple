zzso zzso are a small class of zzso zzso that are widely zzso in various zzso They act as either zzso or tumor zzso genes in human zzso The purpose of this study was to examine the expression levels of zzso in human breast cancer and its potential role in disease zzso The expression levels of zzso were measured by quantitative zzso chain reaction zzso in 40 breast cancer specimens and adjacent normal breast zzso zzso zzso colony formation zzso zzso chamber migration zzso cell cycle and zzso zzso were used to explore the potential function of zzso in zzso human breast cancer zzso zzso reporter zzso were performed to validate the regulation of a putative target of zzso in corroboration with zzso and western zzso zzso We found that the expression of zzso was lower in breast cancer specimens compared with adjacent normal zzso ( zzso zzso of zzso inhibited cellular growth, suppressed migration and arrested cells at the zzso phase, but did not promote cellular zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso can bind with its putative target site in the zzso region zzso of zzso suggesting that zzso is a direct target of zzso zzso and western zzso analysis indicated that the zzso of zzso results in the zzso of zzso at the zzso and protein zzso Taken together, the zzso of zzso expression causes cellular growth zzso suppression of migration and zzso phase arrest by targeting zzso These findings suggest that zzso may act as a tumor zzso gene in breast cancer and that, in the future, it could be used as a therapeutic target for the treatment of breast zzso
