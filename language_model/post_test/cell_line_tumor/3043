zzso virus zzso zzso E zzso interacts with zzso I and with insulin degrading zzso zzso which is a zzso for the zzso We found that a zzso zzso deletion zzso could only be grown in cells expressing zzso zzso of zzso zzso on the surface of cells did not interfere with zzso zzso zzso deleted for zzso is impaired for zzso zzso zzso zzso could not complement this activity in an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso binding domain of zzso grew to peak zzso nearly equivalent to parental zzso however, it was impaired for zzso spread and for zzso with zzso zzso zzso deleted for a region of zzso that binds zzso I could not replicate in cell culture unless grown in cells expressing zzso We conclude that the zzso binding domain is important for efficient zzso spread and zzso of zzso zzso
