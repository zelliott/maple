zzso aberration in zzso zzso zzso zzso has been detected in numerous and diverse human zzso zzso which encodes for the zzso zzso of zzso of zzso is amplified in some cases of zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso in the zzso have also been identified in zzso zzso and, although relatively common in zzso zzso zzso are uncommon in zzso 

The objective of the study was to investigate genetic zzso like zzso gene zzso zzso amplification, zzso and zzso zzso and to further explore the relationship of these genetic zzso with various zzso characteristics in Middle Eastern zzso 

We used the zzso in zzso zzso technique for analysis of zzso amplification from 536 zzso cases, and selected amplified samples were further validated by real-time quantitative zzso zzso analysis was done by direct DNA sequencing of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso amplification was seen in 265 of zzso zzso cases analyzed zzso zzso gene zzso in four of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in 16 of 265 zzso zzso and zzso zzso in 153 of 296 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with an early stage zzso zzso zzso and lower zzso of zzso extension zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and poor zzso survival zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

A higher zzso of zzso zzso and the possible synergistic effect of zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggest their major role in Middle Eastern zzso zzso and argue for therapeutic targeting of zzso and zzso zzso
