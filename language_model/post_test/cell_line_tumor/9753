zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso protein that has been implicated in zzso mechanisms such as zzso invasion and zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso derived from alternative zzso are known to exist, but their functional specificity remains zzso Here, we found that the expression profile of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cell lines and patient zzso were correlated with specific cellular zzso and zzso of zzso Thus, zzso cells with a robust migratory capacity zzso expressed both zzso and zzso but zzso cell lines such as zzso and zzso mainly expressed zzso Moreover, tumor zzso predominantly expressed zzso and zzso whereas normal liver zzso mainly expressed zzso zzso zzso and zzso migration zzso revealed that both zzso and zzso induced zzso cell migration, while zzso had no significant zzso By contrast, zzso suppressed the migratory activity of zzso cells although no significant changes were induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activated zzso signaling pathways such that zzso and zzso increased the expression of zzso type zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso but these pathways were not activated by zzso Thus, the findings of the present study suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso couple to signaling pathways to zzso the migratory property of zzso cells and that this is one of the mechanisms underlying the pathological zzso of zzso zzso
