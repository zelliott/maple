zzso zzso zzso formation is associated with poor outcome in clinically localized prostate zzso We have previously identified genes with diverse functions that are zzso in zzso zzso This study tests the hypothesis that expression of these genes in zzso cells enhances prostate cancer growth in zzso 

The expression of zzso zzso genes in prostate zzso cell lines was evaluated by reverse zzso zzso and zzso Genes were knocked down using stable expression of zzso zzso zzso and the impact on zzso assessed using the differential zzso zzso zzso system, in which prostate zzso cell lines are mixed with zzso prostate cancer cells and growth as subcutaneous zzso zzso 

Nine of 10 zzso zzso genes tested were expressed in one or more prostate zzso cell zzso Gene zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso all resulted in decreased zzso in the zzso zzso In all tumors zzso zzso was decreased and there were variable effects on proliferation and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso has been associated with zzso cell zzso in other tissue zzso Using a zzso zzso we detected zzso of multiple genes involved in zzso cell biology such as zzso and zzso as well as zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso in cells with zzso zzso 

These findings show that genes zzso in prostate zzso zzso promote progression when expressed in prostate zzso zzso Moreover, these data indicate that the zzso model zzso key aspects of cancer zzso zzso interactions in prostate zzso
