The zzso factor specificity protein 1 zzso plays a role in the development and progression of various types of human zzso while cancer stem cells zzso are important in cancer cell zzso resistance to chemotherapy and zzso zzso This study investigated the role of zzso in colon zzso growth and zzso zzso zzso were successfully enriched using special culture medium and identified by typical zzso gene zzso In a zzso state, these zzso formed spheres with slow zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso marker were zzso In ex zzso experiments, the zzso protein was expressed in zzso of colon cancer zzso whereas it was expressed only in zzso of the distant normal colon zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso expression using zzso zzso or zzso A zzso led to marked suppression of zzso growth and induced zzso In addition, the percentage of zzso cells was significantly zzso both in zzso and in zzso following zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso suppression attenuated the characteristics of colon zzso Thus, zzso zzso may be potentially useful for the future development of a novel therapeutic strategy to control colon zzso
