zzso zzso cultures of human urinary tract tissue have been established as intact and zzso zzso with the latter generated by combining cultured normal human zzso zzso cells with an appropriate zzso zzso may be maintained at an zzso interface in zzso culture for periods of up to 20 weeks, with analysis by zzso for expression of zzso zzso markers providing a zzso but objective assessment zzso Where reconstructed using zzso cancer cell lines, the zzso zzso zzso the invasive characteristics of the originating zzso but the need to use zzso cell line stocks is zzso The zzso approach represents an important tool for investigating zzso cell interactions during zzso and disease, and for testing zzso tissue engineering and zzso zzso Potential future developments of the technique are discussed and include genetic manipulation of the zzso cells to generate disease models and incorporation of zzso scaffolds to support artificial zzso zzso
