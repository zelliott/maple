zzso zzso and zzso complexes containing zzso zzso were zzso Their zzso and X-ray crystal structure of the zzso complex were zzso Only the zzso complex showed comparable zzso activity with zzso against zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso the complexes with zzso zzso zzso may be good starting materials to zzso targeting platinum complexes since they could be easily linked to suitable carrier molecules via zzso
