zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, 5, 10, 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso were produced in this work, and various experiments were carried out to investigate the zzso mechanical properties, in zzso zzso and immersion zzso behaviors as well as zzso with zzso pure zzso as control, aiming to study the feasibility of zzso zzso system as potential dental zzso The zzso of zzso zzso changes from single zzso phase to zzso + zzso zzso phase with the increase of zzso zzso Mechanical tests show that zzso zzso has the best comprehensive mechanical zzso The zzso behavior of zzso zzso in artificial saliva with different zzso and zzso acid addition at zzso indicates that zzso and zzso zzso show better zzso resistance to zzso zzso The zzso test indicates that zzso zzso extracts show no obvious reduction of cell viability to zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells, similar to pure zzso which is generally acknowledged to be zzso Considering all these results, zzso and zzso zzso possess the optimal comprehensive performance and might be used as potential dental zzso
