The signaling effects of zzso such as zzso acid zzso are zzso by G zzso receptors zzso There are currently four zzso receptors known as zzso zzso deletion studies have identified essential biological functions for zzso receptors in zzso However, these studies have also revealed zzso consistent with the existence of as yet unidentified zzso Toward identifying new zzso zzso we have screened collections of zzso zzso using reverse zzso and zzso zzso Here we report an interim result of one screen to identify receptors that produced zzso changes in cell zzso the orphan zzso zzso has properties of a new zzso zzso zzso analyses of human zzso and its mouse zzso have approximately zzso zzso acid identity with zzso The same zzso approaches that were used to identify and/or characterize zzso particularly zzso expression in zzso cells or zzso cells, were zzso and compared with known zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso receptors was further combined with G protein zzso and pharmacological intervention, along with calcium imaging and zzso patch clamp zzso zzso zzso zzso following exposure to zzso but not related zzso was zzso Furthermore, zzso induced zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso zzso binding was detected in cell zzso zzso expressing zzso but not control zzso Northern zzso and reverse zzso studies indicated a broad low level of expression in many zzso including embryonic brain and enrichment in small zzso and sensory zzso root zzso as well as embryonic stem zzso These results support zzso as a fifth zzso zzso zzso which likely has distinct zzso functions in view of its expression zzso
