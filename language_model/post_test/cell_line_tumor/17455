zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso currently in phase zzso clinical trials in combination with zzso and with zzso zzso We have prepared a series of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso where a zzso zzso is attached at the zzso via a flexible zzso DNA binding affinity was modified through variation of the zzso or the zzso of the zzso zzso The association zzso zzso for calf zzso DNA ranged from 1 zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strength of zzso zzso DNA binding affinity was dependent on the presence of a positive charge, either in the zzso chain or in the zzso and (for a series of zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated strongly with zzso chain zzso The efficacy of these zzso in killing zzso and hypoxic mouse zzso tumor cells in zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso was measured as the concentration required to reduce zzso efficiency to zzso of controls zzso and the hypoxic zzso ratio zzso for each zzso was calculated as zzso zzso bearing a positive charge showed increased hypoxic zzso zzso compared to zzso and mostly modest zzso zzso but some excellent zzso and zzso zzso There was a strong correlation between zzso and hypoxic zzso but no correlation between zzso and zzso zzso in zzso human colon zzso cells, determined using zzso zzso showed similar relationships with a correlation between zzso and hypoxic zzso but no correlation between zzso and zzso In this cell line, a higher proportion of compounds (7 of zzso had zzso greater than or equal to that of zzso The data confirm that DNA targeting is a useful concept for increasing potency while maintaining hypoxic selectivity and provide a direction for the further development of zzso zzso of zzso
