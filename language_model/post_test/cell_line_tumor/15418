zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso for zzso zzso on T cells implicated in zzso zzso zzso is expressed by tumor cells and zzso zzso zzso but its potential contributions to zzso immune escape and therapeutic targeting have been less zzso To interrogate zzso expression on tumor cells, we analyzed fresh primary zzso cancer cells collected from patient zzso and solid tumors, and established cell lines before and after in zzso zzso zzso expression was detected on the surface of all fresh primary human tumors and tumor zzso but not on most established cell lines, and zzso was lost rapidly by tumor zzso cells after short-term in zzso zzso These results indicated an in zzso requirement for zzso induction and defined conditions for targeting zzso To generate zzso zzso we isolated zzso by differential cell screening of a zzso zzso fragments variable zzso library derived from patients with zzso zzso We identified zzso zzso that reversed in zzso zzso of zzso T cells by zzso zzso zzso these zzso rescued tumor zzso zzso zzso which was otherwise inhibited by zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor cells, or zzso tumor cells mixed with zzso zzso zzso administration of zzso zzso delayed the growth of established zzso Together, our findings showed that cell surface expression of zzso occurs only in tumors in zzso and that zzso binding of zzso could restore zzso zzso zzso We suggest that blocking of zzso zzso interactions may represent a feasible therapeutic strategy for zzso zzso
