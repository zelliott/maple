zzso is a very rare disease that is zzso in nature, all zzso the development of new zzso zzso patients are ideal candidates for personalized medicine after stratification, explaining the current interest in developing a zzso and low-cost zzso model for this zzso The chick zzso membrane is a natural zzso host capable of sustaining grafted zzso and cells without zzso zzso In addition, it is easily zzso manipulated and zzso using optical and zzso zzso zzso further allows detailed analysis of zzso cellular zzso This protocol describes in detail the in zzso zzso of the zzso membrane with fresh zzso tumor zzso their single cell suspensions, and permanent and transient zzso labeled established zzso cell lines zzso and zzso The chick survival rates are up to zzso The model is used to study zzso zzso zzso proliferation index, zzso zzso and host zzso zzso vascular zzso zzso For localized zzso of single cell suspensions, zzso gel provides significant advantages over zzso zzso zzso The zzso proliferation index is related to the distance of the cells from the surface of the zzso and the duration of application on the zzso the latter determining a time frame for the addition of therapeutic zzso
