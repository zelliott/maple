zzso of zzso control elements normally depends on the generation of a series of deletion zzso The consequences of particular deletions are then functionally assessed by their ability to alter gene zzso The information derived from such investigations provides a general regulatory profile of the gene of interest, as well as generating a focus for future zzso Due to the limitations of conventional DNA cloning methods, it has previously not been possible to use such an approach to rapidly assess the role of long-range regulatory elements that frequently lie further than 20 zzso away from the coding zzso In order to identify regulatory elements of the zzso zzso that may be zzso in a subset of childhood zzso acute zzso zzso zzso we generated zzso deletions from a zzso artificial zzso zzso This clone contained 95 zzso zzso of the zzso locus at zzso including 63 zzso of zzso regulatory zzso The deletion series was produced by the use of a zzso based cloning system and clones were subsequently zzso into zzso zzso We have identified several long-range regulatory elements that mediate zzso control of zzso This approach is simple, zzso and zzso Furthermore, it generates multiple deletion clones in a single zzso This novel approach opens up a new avenue for investigating long-range zzso zzso Additionally, by allowing analysis of these elements in the natural context of large zzso the approach does not require the use of artificial zzso zzso This methodology can be applied to any gene cloned into a zzso or zzso zzso and could also be useful in identifying appropriately sized deletion zzso for functional testing in transgenic zzso
