Alzheimer's disease zzso is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by the formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and their deposition in the zzso A zzso and zzso zzso 9 can cleave the zzso precursor protein zzso within the zzso domain and zzso generation of zzso zzso We systematically screened zzso gene promoter region and found four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso in 345 healthy individuals when compared to that in zzso sporadic zzso zzso patients zzso and constructed a relatively protective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso indicated that both zzso and zzso had higher zzso activity zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso zzso than zzso zzso mobility shift zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso bound nuclear factors more strongly than the zzso zzso Additionally, increased zzso zzso activity was seen under zzso zzso Our data suggest that promoter zzso which regulate zzso zzso are protective against zzso
