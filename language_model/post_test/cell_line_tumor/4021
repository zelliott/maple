zzso cancer zzso zzso is a tumor zzso zzso in prostate cancer zzso zzso knockout mice zzso are zzso normal under zzso conditions, however, reduced melanoma zzso has been observed, with the mechanisms of this reduction completely zzso In this work, we demonstrated that zzso zzso in host cells significantly reduced zzso of zzso in zzso zzso transfer of zzso zzso zzso double positive zzso cells, but not T cells, was sufficient to allow tumor development in zzso zzso The expression of an zzso zzso marker, zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso was higher and expression of an zzso zzso marker, zzso zzso 1) was lower in tumors from zzso mice compared with zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of transgenic zzso mouse prostate zzso cells with zzso but not zzso zzso increased tumor zzso in zzso zzso zzso depletion experiments suggested that T cells were required for tumor rejection in zzso although zzso expression in T cells may not be zzso In zzso the expression of zzso in zzso cells, especially in zzso cells, was required for zzso tumor zzso zzso
