The zzso zzso zzso zzso exerts zzso activity on human zzso and zzso Although no zzso zzso has been zzso the zzso mouse zzso cells engineered to express human zzso are rapidly rejected by zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso was generated using a zzso system and was used to determine whether this zzso might also block pre-existing zzso Both zzso and viral zzso showed in zzso zzso activity for zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso but not the control empty zzso when injected in established zzso significantly delayed tumor zzso zzso revealed zzso of zzso and zzso T cells and DC in the treated tumors as well as in draining zzso zzso DC from such zzso zzso zzso zzso by a T cell clone specific for the known zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting the tumor origin of these zzso zzso from the same zzso showed specific zzso activity against zzso tumor cells and their zzso zzso zzso zzso activity required zzso zzso and zzso production, as shown using zzso and knockout zzso Despite the robust and rapid immune response triggered by zzso injection of zzso the zzso were not completely zzso however, the same treatment given before surgical zzso of primary zzso prevented zzso spread and cured zzso of mice bearing the zzso zzso zzso which is perhaps the most compelling model of spontaneous zzso
