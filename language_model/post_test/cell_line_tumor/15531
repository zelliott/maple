zzso cancer has a poor prognosis after complete zzso zzso combined with zzso Even after zzso chemotherapy, zzso zzso is often not zzso Moreover, current imaging techniques cannot reliably distinguish viable cancer cells from zzso tissue at the zzso zzso We investigated the use of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for imaging the effects of zzso The zzso zzso of pancreatic cancer cells was enhanced by a zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was under the control of the zzso promoter, and the zzso gene was inserted adjacent to the zzso death protein zzso zzso zzso zzso of the pancreatic cancer cell line zzso were established in 24 zzso zzso zzso When zzso reached a diameter of 4-6 zzso zzso 1), the mice were injected zzso with either PBS zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or 1000 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On days 19, 26, 33, and 40, zzso were injected zzso into three mice in groups A and zzso zzso was zzso 72 h after zzso injection, and gross tumor volumes were measured then tumors were removed for ex zzso zzso using zzso and zzso zzso zzso between gross tumor volume, pathological evaluation of the percentage of viable tumor area, and zzso zzso were zzso zzso correlated closely with the percentage of viable tumor area (R zzso zzso but not with gross tumor volume (R zzso zzso zzso zzso might be reliable imaging tools for monitoring chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer, and could improve our ability to distinguish viable tumor cells from zzso zzso
