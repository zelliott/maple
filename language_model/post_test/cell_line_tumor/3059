Although zzso has been shown to induce zzso in several cancer cell lines, the mechanism of action of zzso cell cycle arrest and zzso at the molecular level is not well zzso In this study, the mechanism of zzso action on zzso human lung cancer cells was zzso zzso induced zzso arrest through zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso induction of zzso was observed at 50 zzso for 12 h and up to 72 h as examined by a flow zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso increased the levels of zzso and zzso both hallmarks of zzso zzso stress, promoted zzso and zzso production, induced the loss of zzso membrane potential zzso zzso promoted zzso c release from zzso promoted zzso zzso and led to zzso zzso also increased the levels of zzso zzso and zzso but reduced the level of zzso The zzso zzso zzso was added to the cells before zzso treatment, thus blocking the zzso production and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells via a zzso zzso zzso zzso
