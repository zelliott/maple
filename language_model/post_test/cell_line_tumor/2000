zzso zzso protein 1 zzso has been identified as a molecular marker of the zzso zzso however its influences on the biological behaviors of the zzso cancer cells are currently zzso We aimed to study the influences of zzso on the zzso invasion, and zzso of the zzso cancer zzso cell zzso 

We constructed zzso zzso plasmids and zzso them into the zzso cancer zzso cell zzso zzso zzso plasmids were identified by means of zzso laser zzso scanning zzso and reverse zzso zzso chain zzso zzso cells with stable zzso of zzso were confirmed by zzso zzso The influences of zzso on the proliferation of the zzso cell lines were investigated by zzso zzso and tumor transplantation experiments in nude zzso Cell invasion experiments were performed to determine the invasion capacity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso and zzso activities were detected by the gelatin zzso analysis, and zzso expression by the Western zzso zzso 

zzso zzso plasmids were successfully constructed in this study, and the zzso cells with stable zzso gene zzso were confirmed by zzso zzso zzso results showed that the proliferation of the zzso cells was significantly enhanced zzso zzso zzso zzso were harvested from four weeks old zzso zzso volumes were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor weights were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for mice zzso with the zzso cells, zzso cells and zzso cells, zzso zzso volumes and weights from mice zzso with the zzso cells were significantly increased zzso zzso zzso In addition, the numbers of the zzso cells and zzso cells that migrated through zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso so the invasive ability of the zzso cells zzso with zzso gene was significantly greater than that of the zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso and zzso protein activities in the zzso cells were significantly zzso and Western zzso analysis showed that zzso expression in the zzso cells was also zzso 

zzso can enhance the zzso invasion, and zzso of the zzso cancer zzso cell zzso
