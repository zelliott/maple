Cellular zzso targeted imaging agents present the potential to target zzso molecular expression in zzso zzso however, the image contrast in zzso does not reflect the magnitude of zzso expected from in zzso zzso Here, the in zzso delivery and binding zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso was determined for normal zzso and zzso zzso pancreatic tumors known to zzso zzso 

zzso in zzso zzso zzso tumors was targeted with zzso growth factor zzso zzso with zzso The transfer rate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso associated with a zzso model describing the vascular delivery, leakage rate and binding of targeted agents were determined zzso The plasma zzso rate, k zzso was determined from extracted blood plasma zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined from ex zzso tissue washing studies at time points zzso 24 zzso The measured in zzso zzso of zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso injected simultaneously was used to determined zzso 

The vascular exchange of zzso in the zzso tumor zzso and zzso was higher than in the zzso tumor as compared to normal zzso suggesting that more targeted agent can be taken up in tumor zzso However, the cellular associated zzso rate constant zzso was slightly lower for zzso pancreatic tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso than the normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that less binding is zzso 

Higher vascular delivery but low cellular association in the zzso tumor compared to the normal zzso may be indicative of low zzso density due to low cellular zzso This attribute of the zzso tumor may indicate one contributing cause of the difficulty in treating pancreatic tumors with cellular targeted zzso
