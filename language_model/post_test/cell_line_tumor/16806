The radiation doses used to treat zzso lung cancer are often limited by the proximity of normal zzso zzso of zzso a zzso zzso zzso occurs in about half of zzso lung zzso zzso and has been associated with resistance to radiation therapy and poor patient zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso would increase the sensitivity of zzso cells to radiation, enhancing the therapeutic ratio, which may potentially translate into improved local zzso 

We tested the zzso of two zzso zzso lines, zzso and zzso and two zzso lines, zzso and zzso with and without the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso and protein expression were measured with zzso survival zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso levels were evaluated by zzso zzso 

zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso cells but not the zzso cell lines zzso and zzso However, zzso of zzso and zzso cells increased the expression of zzso protein at 30 minutes after the zzso zzso targeting of this zzso zzso by using zzso followed by a second radiation dose reduced the zzso survival of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso reduced the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

These results suggest that zzso of zzso could be an effective strategy to zzso zzso tumors with high zzso zzso expression or tumors that acquired resistance to radiation because of zzso of zzso
