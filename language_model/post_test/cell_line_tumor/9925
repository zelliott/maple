The objective of the present study was to examine the effects of zzso on transcripts of zzso of zzso protein zzso in rat zzso zzso zzso zzso show that zzso zzso IV and zzso zzso zzso are expressed in human and rat pancreatic zzso and zzso zzso By application of either zzso or zzso for 6 hours, calcium zzso was evoked and the release of insulin was zzso The expression of the zzso zzso IV and zzso zzso zzso transcripts was significantly increased due to zzso or zzso Acute zzso treatment (6 zzso in the presence of either zzso or zzso caused a significant decrease in insulin release and induced significant zzso of zzso zzso IV and zzso zzso zzso transcripts in zzso batch zzso The attenuating effect of zzso on transcripts could be almost completely reversed by zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso effect of zzso in zzso cells is associated with significant changes in transcripts of zzso components suggesting that zzso influences gene expression of zzso which are known to be involved in insulin zzso or insulin gene zzso
