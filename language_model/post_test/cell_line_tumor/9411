We recently zzso a type 1 diabetes zzso region on zzso 21, indicating that one or more zzso genes exist in this region with 33 zzso zzso In the current study, we have taken a novel approach using zzso profiling in predicting and zzso the most likely candidate genes influencing zzso function in this zzso Two zzso approaches were used, a rat zzso cell line zzso zzso pancreatic zzso zzso 1 zzso and treated with zzso zzso zzso as well as human pancreatic zzso zzso with a mixture of zzso Several candidate genes with likely functional significance in zzso were zzso Genes showing differential expression in the two approaches were highly similar, supporting the role of these specific gene products in zzso zzso zzso These were genes involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso defense responses and zzso The zzso zzso revealed several zzso factor binding sites shared by the zzso expressed genes and by genes demonstrating highly similar expression profiles with these zzso zzso findings in the rat zzso line and human zzso support the zzso of the methods used and support this as a valuable approach for gene mapping and identification of genes with potential functional significance in zzso within a region of zzso
