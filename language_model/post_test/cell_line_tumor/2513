Human embryonic stem zzso zzso cells zzso may potentially provide a platform to generate zzso therapeutic cancer zzso To apply zzso for cancer zzso in a zzso setting, it is crucial for these cells to zzso zzso zzso immunity before their elimination by host zzso In this study, we investigated whether zzso zzso in zzso may exploit zzso zzso zzso cell zzso activity and boost zzso zzso Using a zzso zzso carrying the zzso zzso we produced zzso zzso and demonstrated that the zzso zzso was functional in presenting zzso for zzso cell zzso zzso with melanoma zzso recognized by T cell 1 zzso the zzso zzso displayed enhanced capability to prime zzso T cells without relying on zzso zzso zzso the zzso with zzso reduced the zzso suggesting the importance of zzso and zzso cell interaction in this zzso The zzso zzso also induced a zzso zzso profile that may favor the T cell zzso Moreover, a similar zzso effect was observed when the zzso zzso strategy was applied in human zzso zzso zzso zzso our study suggests that the zzso of zzso in zzso provides a novel strategy to enhance their zzso This approach holds potential for advancing the application of zzso into human cancer zzso
