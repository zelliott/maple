Despite its importance in cell proliferation and zzso very little is known about the molecular mechanism underlying the regulation of zzso D zzso zzso zzso zzso are significantly zzso with cancer marker genes in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment, as a zzso signal in colon cancer cells, selectively increases zzso expression in zzso and zzso Moreover, experiments using zzso injection of zzso into mice showed selective zzso induction in the zzso and lung zzso which suggests its zzso relevance in zzso zzso we have undertaken a detailed analysis of the effects of zzso on the promoter activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso but not a protein zzso A zzso were found to suppress the zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso suppressed the induction and activity of zzso Moreover, depletion of the supposedly involved proteins reduced the zzso zzso protein zzso An important role for zzso as a downstream target of zzso in zzso zzso induction was also demonstrated using the zzso small interfering zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of these signaling proteins and depletion of zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that induction of zzso through a protein zzso zzso zzso is involved in the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cancer zzso
