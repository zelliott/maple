zzso is one of the main reasons for the failure of zzso in lung zzso The aim of this study was to establish a zzso lung cancer cell line, to evaluate whether zzso zzso zzso zzso could increase its zzso and to explore the relevant zzso The zzso cell line, referred to as zzso was generated by zzso zzso zzso from the human lung zzso cell line zzso The zzso of zzso cells were confirmed by the Cell Counting zzso zzso cell viability zzso and zzso zzso Cell growth zzso zzso feature, and zzso were compared between the original zzso cells and zzso cells treated with or without zzso zzso or zzso To further explore the potential mechanisms of zzso the cell cycle zzso and the expression of zzso zzso 9 zzso were examined by Western zzso and flow zzso The zzso cell line was generated and its zzso was further zzso zzso zzso was found to increase much more zzso of zzso cells under combined treatments with zzso zzso and radiation compared with its control group without any zzso They presented their respective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso with N zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso Further, there was a larger cell population of zzso cells under combined treatment in the zzso phase compared with the control group after treatment with zzso or radiation alone at 24 and 48 zzso The expression level of zzso in zzso cells was found higher than in zzso zzso These results suggested that zzso zzso increased the zzso of zzso cells, which might be zzso via the zzso zzso and prolonged cell cycle arrest in the zzso phase compared with zzso zzso
