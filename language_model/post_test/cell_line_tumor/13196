Many studies have demonstrated that zzso administered bacteria can target and zzso in solid tumors and then quickly be released from other zzso Here, we employed the zzso property of zzso coli zzso 1917 to inhibit mouse zzso melanoma and zzso breast tumors through the expression of zzso zzso For this purpose, zzso zzso zzso coli zzso 1917 was zzso The levels of in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso in the engineered zzso were determined by zzso Our results demonstrated that zzso melanoma and zzso zzso breast tumor growth were remarkably restrained and pulmonary zzso was prevented in zzso zzso It is worth noting that this therapeutic effect partially resulted from the zzso activity of zzso and zzso due to inflammatory responses caused by bacterial zzso No toxicity was observed in the animal during the zzso This study indicates that zzso coli zzso 1917 could be a potential carrier to deliver zzso drugs effectively for cancer zzso
