The present investigation was to evaluate the effects of essential oils of zzso zzso zzso on free zzso and in zzso zzso zzso 

Essential oils were extracted using zzso and compound analysis was performed by zzso zzso zzso for zzso activity was conducted by zzso and zzso zzso In addition an in zzso study was carried out in cell line implanted cancer bearing mice with assessment of levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso oxide and reduced zzso Finally, lungs were dissected out for zzso study of zzso 

zzso analysis revealed the presence of zzso and zzso as the major compounds with zzso comparison with the zzso and zzso zzso The essential oil exhibited significant zzso in zzso free radical zzso Whereas reducing power and zzso radical scavenging activity are dose zzso When compared with the standard, it was found that the essential oil has more or less equal activity in scavenging free zzso zzso In the animal studies, the level of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso were found to be increased in treated groups whereas zzso zzso and zzso oxide were zzso zzso report also shows that the essential oil has a significant combating effect against cancer zzso 

In all the in zzso zzso a significant correlation existed between the zzso of the essential oil and percentage zzso of free zzso The in zzso studies also has shown a very good zzso property for the essential oil during cancer zzso zzso these results the essential oil can be recommended for treating disease related to free zzso and to prevent cancer zzso
