zzso such as zzso are being considered as alternatives to conventional zzso chemotherapy in patients with zzso cancer, but the molecular zzso of sensitivity or resistance to these agents in zzso cancer cells have not been zzso Here we examined the zzso effects of a novel zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso in a zzso diverse panel of human zzso cancer cell zzso The cells displayed zzso responses to the drug that correlated closely with sensitivity to zzso but not with sensitivity to zzso Global gene expression profiling identified zzso as the top gene that was zzso expressed between sensitive and resistant cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso inhibited cell death induced by either zzso or zzso and was associated with decreased proliferation and decreased expression of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso also rendered cells resistant to zzso or zzso Together, our results zzso zzso and its downstream target zzso as zzso of sensitivity to zzso in zzso cancer zzso Our data also suggest that zzso and zzso target different zzso of zzso cancer cells, a conclusion that may have important implications for the therapy of zzso zzso zzso
