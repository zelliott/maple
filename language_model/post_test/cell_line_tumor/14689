A series of zzso compounds with zzso values ranging between 142 zzso and 18 zzso was investigated with respect to their zzso (by the shake flask method as well as zzso zzso zzso reduction potential, as well as their cellular zzso in cancer cells in zzso In general, the zzso properties of the complexes correlated with their zzso as well as their zzso whereas differences in zzso potency could not be explained by reduction zzso since they do not vary significantly within the investigated series of zzso Only minor effects for complexes featuring polar end groups were zzso
