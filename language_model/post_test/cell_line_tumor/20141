zzso factor 1 zzso is a small zzso zzso protein which is principally expressed in the superficial cells of gastric zzso In gastric cancer, zzso is zzso and plays an important zzso zzso 1 zzso is a zzso protein with similar expression and biological functions to zzso This study aimed to determine the expression and biological functions of zzso and the relationships between zzso and zzso in gastric zzso zzso and zzso were performed to detect zzso expression in gastric cancer cell lines and zzso The zzso and zzso zzso cells which zzso expressed zzso or both zzso and zzso were zzso zzso changes such as cell zzso zzso and cell cycle zzso were zzso in the zzso zzso We found that zzso expression was significantly zzso or lost in gastric cancer cell lines, gastric zzso and zzso Restoration of zzso expression in zzso cells suppressed tumor cell viability and arrested zzso cells in the zzso transition phase after zzso zzso However, zzso was unable to induce cell zzso In zzso cells, we found that zzso and zzso did not directly interact at the protein zzso zzso was unable to cooperate with zzso on cell viability suppression, cell zzso and zzso Together, these results indicate that zzso expression is significantly zzso in gastric zzso zzso inhibited cell proliferation by delaying zzso phase transition but not by inducing zzso zzso may not interact or cooperate with zzso at the protein and functional zzso
