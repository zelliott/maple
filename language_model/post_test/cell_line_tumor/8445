zzso zzso zzso one type of zzso zzso cells, have been shown to provide a favorable environment for the zzso tumor zzso zzso reports have demonstrated that zzso stem cells zzso can function as precursors for zzso However, the mechanisms by which tumor cells induce the transition of zzso to zzso have not been well zzso zzso traditionally known as an zzso zzso zzso zzso has been identified to zzso in a variety of tumor entities and be involved in promoting survival and zzso of tumor zzso Here, we interrogated the role of zzso in the generation of zzso from zzso The results showed that zzso treatment induced expression of zzso muscle zzso zzso a marker for zzso in human bone zzso zzso stem cells zzso as well as zzso bone zzso zzso stem cells zzso This phenomenon was correlated with the zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso expression in zzso was obviously attenuated by zzso a zzso type I zzso zzso zzso Taken together, the present data suggested that zzso zzso zzso zzso the differentiation of bone zzso zzso stem cells zzso to zzso through zzso zzso signaling pathway, which may represent a novel mechanism for transition of zzso to zzso and a zzso unknown function of zzso in the tumor zzso
