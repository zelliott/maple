In this paper, the suitability of novel zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso agent for gene delivery was zzso zzso were produced by using the zzso method and zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso as charge carrier and zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso were approximately 120 zzso in size and positively charged, with a zzso potential value equal to zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso were able to form stable complexes with DNA and to protect DNA against zzso I zzso The zzso complexes were characterized by mean diameter and zzso potential zzso In zzso studies on human liver cancer cells demonstrated a very low degree of toxicity of both zzso and zzso zzso Further, zzso complexes were able to promote zzso of liver cancer zzso These data suggest that our zzso zzso may be potentially useful for gene zzso
