To evaluate the zzso of zzso zzso by magnetic zzso in the growth of zzso cell lung cancer zzso under the interference of magnetic field in zzso and in zzso and explore the effects of magnetic field on the efficiency of zzso 

The zzso of zzso was constructed for expressing zzso and zzso against zzso zzso as zzso iron oxide zzso zzso and zzso as zzso zzso comprised the magnetic zzso zzso was transferred into zzso cells by zzso under a series of interaction zzso and intensity of external magnetic zzso zzso was delivered into zzso cells in zzso and injected zzso into the zzso mice every 48 h for four doses in zzso by way of zzso or zzso The zzso efficiency was analyzed by zzso and the potency of zzso zzso by Western zzso At Week 3 after the 4th injection, the mice were sacrificed and the tumors removed and zzso The tumor zzso rate was zzso 

The interaction zzso and intensity of magnetic field could influence the zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso inhibited zzso protein by zzso zzso zzso and by zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso delivered by both zzso and zzso significantly inhibited the tumor growth by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Based on magnetic zzso as gene zzso zzso may become a promising targeted therapy for lung zzso And the zzso efficiency is influenced by magnetic zzso
