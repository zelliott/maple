zzso island zzso represent a zzso zzso discovery platform to identify global zzso promoter zzso candidates along zzso cancer zzso DNA obtained from 10 pairs of invasive zzso zzso were zzso vs their respective normal zzso using differential zzso zzso on custom-made zzso zzso zzso 288 zzso zzso zzso of 84 clones was simultaneously shown in at least zzso of the zzso zzso was selected for further validation by zzso zzso sequencing and zzso zzso chain reaction in zzso cancer cells zzso and primary zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed in zzso cancer cells and associated with lack of gene zzso being restored in zzso by a zzso zzso In primary zzso zzso zzso zzso was present in zzso of the zzso Moreover, zzso zzso was significantly associated with zzso grade and overall zzso Thus, this zzso zzso strategy has served to identify novel zzso candidates in zzso zzso In zzso analyses supported the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso The association of zzso zzso with zzso progression and clinical outcome suggests its relevant clinical implications at zzso patients affected with zzso zzso
