zzso zzso modification is a major regulator of zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso zzso of gene expression contributes to zzso zzso modifications include zzso zzso and zzso resulting in a combination of zzso marks known collectively as the zzso zzso The zzso marks at a given promoter zzso in part, whether specific promoters are in an zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso mark at gene zzso and zzso of this mark by the zzso zzso 1 zzso a zzso of zzso zzso may broadly repress gene zzso We now report that novel zzso and zzso zzso zzso are potent zzso of zzso These zzso inhibit zzso in human colon zzso cells and affect a zzso of zzso zzso silenced genes important in the development of colon cancer, including members of the zzso zzso proteins zzso and the zzso family of zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate by zzso zzso analysis that the zzso is concurrent with increased zzso and zzso zzso decreased zzso and zzso repressive zzso We thus define important new agents for reversing zzso repression of gene zzso
