Triple negative breast cancer is deprived of zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso It constitutes the most zzso and aggressive group of breast zzso for which identification of novel characteristics and characterization of putative targets becomes very zzso In the present work we have zzso the expression of zzso a recently identified zzso zzso of zzso in a series of triple negative breast zzso in relation to the clinical behavior and other zzso features of the zzso While widely expressed within the zzso in almost all tumors, we found that exclusively the zzso expression of the zzso exhibits a correlation with patient's zzso Moreover, membrane zzso zzso in an inverse manner with the expression of zzso a zzso zzso with high zzso relevance in triple negative zzso A thorough zzso zzso approach in breast cancer cell lines, revealed an early zzso zzso signature of the zzso zzso related to immune system processes and zzso zzso zzso zzso regulation of zzso zzso signaling and regulation of the cell cycle, with a zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso expression is not limited within breast cancer zzso linen, but is equally identified in tumor zzso zzso fat zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In light of the above, zzso could represent a major counterpart in triple negative breast zzso
