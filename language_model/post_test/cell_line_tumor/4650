zzso zzso lifetime imaging zzso zzso is a zzso cellular resolution, 3-D functional imaging zzso We investigate the potential for in zzso zzso diagnosis with zzso imaging via zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso cheek zzso model of oral zzso and zzso cell zzso are zzso using zzso zzso at zzso zzso The zzso of normal zzso cheek zzso zzso cells has short zzso zzso and long lifetime components zzso zzso attributed to free and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to moderate zzso and high-grade zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso are zzso from normal zzso by their decreased zzso zzso lifetime ( zzso zzso of cellular zzso and zzso zzso in cell zzso produces an increase and decrease, respectively, in the zzso zzso lifetime ( zzso zzso indicate that the decrease in zzso zzso lifetime with zzso is due to a shift from zzso zzso to zzso consistent with the predictions of zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso is a powerful tool for the zzso characterization and detection of zzso zzso in zzso
