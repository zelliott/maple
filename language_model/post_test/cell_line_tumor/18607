We have previously shown a correlation between the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso protein zzso in human breast zzso To establish a direct zzso relationship between zzso zzso and reduced zzso zzso zzso and zzso breast cancer cell lines were zzso zzso with the human zzso gene to increase zzso protein levels and tested for zzso zzso All clones zzso zzso showed a dramatic reduction of zzso zzso as compared with mock zzso control zzso zzso zzso was promptly and partially restored by induction of zzso with zzso zzso After zzso h of zzso treatment, a tenfold increase in zzso zzso was observed in treated as compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso Our findings provide a rational basis for the development of an in zzso test to detect zzso zzso in human zzso
