zzso are powerful zzso and zzso zzso hormones in animal models of brain injury, including focal cerebral zzso This protective effect has been demonstrated under a variety of different treatments and injury zzso such as in zzso and in zzso stroke zzso zzso in the central nervous system by zzso is less zzso In the present study, cultured cortical and zzso mouse zzso and human zzso cells zzso were exposed to combined zzso deprivation zzso which is regarded as a reliable model mimicking the effects of zzso in zzso Cell viability was zzso using zzso zzso release and zzso zzso zzso for zzso treatment were chosen to yield zzso cell death zzso The zzso of zzso in zzso was compared with permanent middle cerebral artery zzso zzso in zzso zzso for 4 h induced zzso zzso cell zzso zzso in zzso for the same period resulted in significant zzso loss, also suggesting the zzso of zzso as a suitable zzso in zzso zzso Combined steroid treatment zzso and zzso but not the application of single steroids abolished zzso cell death of cortical zzso in zzso By contrast, no cell protection was found in zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso did not obviously counteract the protective steroid zzso This suggests the operation of zzso steroid mechanisms and their implication in mediation of hormonal zzso The surplus of combined protective hormonal effects might be a result of the observed influence of zzso application on zzso zzso zzso The data obtained in the present study clearly highlight the potential of a combined steroid treatment under toxic degenerative brain zzso
