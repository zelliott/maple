After therapeutic hormone zzso most prostate cancer zzso cells develop zzso zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso and zzso suggesting that several molecular processes or pathways may be contributing to zzso The human zzso zzso zzso model retains clinical hallmarks of zzso including zzso growth, zzso production, zzso and progression to zzso In this work, we studied the effect of zzso depletion zzso on the growth of zzso zzso zzso A total of 100 nude mice were implanted and zzso for their growth profiles before and after zzso By 11 and 15 weeks, zzso were harvested and assessed for molecular marker expression specific for zzso Prior to zzso we found 37 fast growing zzso zzso zzso zzso and 63 slow growing zzso zzso zzso zzso a previously zzso result for this zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that in comparison to zzso zzso contained high zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression with low levels of zzso 2 zzso All zzso zzso progressed rapidly to zzso growth 5 weeks after zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso showed retarded progression (by 12 weeks) to zzso whereas zzso responded to zzso zzso zzso analysis permitted us to define distinct molecular profiles zzso different pathways associated with zzso zzso zzso and a zzso of zzso zzso presented significantly high levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso all of which correlated with zzso zzso The second zzso of zzso zzso showed zzso of the zzso gene zzso A third zzso of zzso zzso showed significant expression of zzso gene zzso after zzso This work permitted to define distinct molecular profiles related to different zzso growth in the zzso zzso zzso
