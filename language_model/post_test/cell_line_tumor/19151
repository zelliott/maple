It has been reported that high doses of sodium zzso can reduce side effects of zzso zzso without compromising its zzso activity, thus substantially enhancing the cure rate in zzso zzso However, the toxicity of zzso at high doses should be a zzso The present study revealed that zzso had much lower zzso but possessed equal efficacy in zzso zzso zzso as compared with zzso at similar doses when used for the intervention of zzso In addition, zzso zzso in whole blood and kidney of mice treated with zzso was highly correlated with the survival rate of mice treated with zzso (both zzso and both zzso suggesting that whole blood zzso is a potential clinical zzso to predict host tolerance to zzso In either zzso or zzso mice bearing solid tumors of zzso 22 zzso zzso did not disturb the therapeutic effect of zzso on tumors but effectively attenuated the toxicity of zzso Furthermore, in a highly zzso cancer model, with zzso mice bearing zzso zzso cells, 8 or 10 zzso zzso alone only achieved a zzso or zzso cure rate, whereas zzso of zzso with the above two doses of zzso achieved cure rates of zzso or zzso These results together argue for consideration of zzso as an agent to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of zzso
