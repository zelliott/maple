Many tumor cells shed specialized membrane zzso known as zzso In this study, we show that zzso of mice with zzso produced by zzso or zzso zzso zzso tumor cells resulted in accelerated growth of implanted tumor cells in both zzso zzso mice and nude zzso As implanted zzso tumor cells grew more rapidly in mice that had been depleted of zzso cells, we analyzed the effects of the zzso zzso on zzso zzso The zzso zzso inhibit zzso cell zzso activity ex zzso and in zzso as demonstrated by zzso release zzso The treatment of mice with zzso tumor zzso also led to a reduction in the percentages of zzso cells, as determined by zzso analysis, in the lungs and zzso Key features of zzso cell activity were zzso including release of zzso but not zzso B, as well as the expression of zzso D3 and zzso of the zzso zzso Human tumor cell lines also were found to produce zzso that were capable of zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso produced by zzso cells or B cells did zzso The presentation of tumor zzso by zzso is under consideration as a cancer vaccine zzso however, we found that zzso of mice with tumor zzso blunted the protective effect of zzso zzso cells zzso ex zzso with tumor zzso We propose that tumor zzso contribute to the growth of tumors by blocking zzso zzso of zzso cells and their zzso response to tumor zzso
