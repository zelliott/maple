Rapid cell membrane modification techniques are currently being sought in order to develop gene therapy and cellular zzso zzso against cancer and other zzso We developed a novel technique using the zzso portion of zzso a zzso O family zzso with a high affinity for human cell zzso as a cell membrane zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso of zzso with zzso sites at the zzso were zzso These zzso are able to bind tightly to human cells after simple incubation and have no harmful zzso The zzso were zzso with the partially reduced or zzso zzso of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bound to these zzso were shown to specifically target a zzso zzso cell line, zzso in zzso This is a promising technique for the development of convenient and effective zzso treatment zzso
