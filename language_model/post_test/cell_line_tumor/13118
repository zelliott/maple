The aim of this work is to determine the zzso survival of cells zzso with either the primary field or scattered radiation in the presence and absence of zzso communication following delivery of zzso zzso and zzso treatment zzso Single zzso zzso zzso and zzso plans were created to deliver 3 zzso to half the area of a zzso flask containing either zzso or zzso cells allowing zzso communication between the zzso and zzso cell zzso The same plans were delivered to a similar custom made phantom used to hold two zzso culture zzso one flask zzso and one zzso to allow comparison of cell survival responses when zzso communication is physically zzso Plans were created for the delivery of 8 zzso to the more zzso zzso cells only in the presence and absence of zzso zzso Cell survival was determined by zzso zzso In both cell lines, the zzso survival was not statistically different between delivery techniques for either cell line or zzso There was however, a statistically significant difference between survival zzso when zzso communication was intact zzso zzso culture zzso or inhibited (multiple zzso culture zzso to zzso for all zzso No statistically significant difference was observed zzso with or without cellular communication to zzso for all zzso These data demonstrate zzso effects as important zzso of cell survival following exposure to modulated zzso fields when cellular communication between zzso zzso cell populations is zzso This data is further evidence that refinement of existing zzso models to include indirect cell killing effects is zzso
