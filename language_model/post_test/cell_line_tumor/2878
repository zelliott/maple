Cancer zzso is the life-threatening aspect of cancer and is usually resistant to standard zzso We report here a targeted therapy strategy for cancer zzso using a zzso strain of zzso zzso The zzso strain of zzso zzso is zzso for the zzso acids zzso and zzso These zzso zzso growth in normal tissue but do not reduce bacterial zzso in cancer zzso The zzso strain of zzso zzso termed zzso and expressing green fluorescent protein zzso was administered to both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of human pancreatic cancer and zzso respectively, as well as lung zzso of the zzso in nude zzso The bacteria were delivered via a zzso channel to target the zzso zzso zzso and zzso via the tail vein to target the lung zzso The cancer cells expressed red fluorescent protein zzso in the zzso and zzso in the nucleus linked to zzso zzso enabling color-coded real-time imaging of the bacteria targeting the zzso zzso After zzso days of treatment, the zzso were eradicated without the need of chemotherapy or any other zzso No adverse effects were zzso This new strategy demonstrates the clinical potential of targeting and curing cancer zzso with engineered bacteria without the need of toxic zzso
