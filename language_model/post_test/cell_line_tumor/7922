In zzso imaging of human zzso growth factor zzso type 2 zzso expression may allow direct assessment of zzso status in tumor tissue and provide a means to zzso changes in zzso expression after zzso zzso This work describes the in zzso characterization of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its application to study the effect of 17 zzso zzso on zzso expression by zzso 

To assess the correlation of signal observed by PET with zzso zzso we administered the zzso to zzso nude mice bearing subcutaneous human breast cancer zzso with different levels of zzso zzso To study the zzso of zzso we treated the mice with 4 doses (40 zzso of zzso an inhibitor of zzso protein 90, known to decrease zzso zzso The animals were scanned before and after zzso After the last zzso the mice were zzso and tumors were frozen for zzso zzso 

The zzso was eliminated quickly from the blood and normal zzso providing high zzso and zzso ratios as early as 20 zzso after zzso The zzso images between normal and tumor tissue were recorded for zzso and zzso zzso Low but still zzso zzso was observed for zzso tumors, and none for zzso The signal correlated with the zzso expression as assessed by zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso The levels of zzso expression estimated by zzso PET decreased zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, for mice bearing zzso and zzso zzso These changes were confirmed by the zzso studies, zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso 

Our results suggest that the described zzso zzso zzso can be used to assess zzso expression in zzso by PET and monitor possible changes of zzso expression in response to therapeutic zzso
