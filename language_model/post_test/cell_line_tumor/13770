zzso is a widely expressed zzso protein that binds the Ral and zzso small zzso In the zzso zzso is zzso but its depletion or blockade promotes zzso and zzso the sensitivity of normal and tumor cells to radiation and zzso zzso However, its zzso functions, which support zzso are not well zzso Here, we show that zzso is required for zzso and for efficient zzso of primary solid zzso zzso growth from implanted melanoma or zzso cells was blunted in zzso zzso An X-ray zzso zzso method to model tumor vascular structures revealed defects in both the extent and form of tumor zzso in zzso zzso Specifically, tumor vascular volumes were diminished and vessels were fewer in number, zzso and zzso in zzso mice than in zzso zzso Moreover, we found that zzso was blunted in zzso mice in the absence of tumor cells, with zzso cells isolated from these animals exhibiting defects in migration, zzso and zzso formation in zzso Taken together, our results establish that zzso is required for efficient zzso cell function and zzso in solid zzso
