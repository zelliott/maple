To detect circulating zzso zzso by demonstrating zzso zzso cells or zzso zzso in the nuclear cell component of peripheral blood zzso 

zzso blood (5 zzso samples were obtained from 93 patients with zzso zzso zzso and from 33 control subjects (9 with liver zzso after zzso B, 14 with chronic zzso B, 10 with normal liver zzso To identify zzso cells in peripheral blood, zzso human zzso zzso zzso was amplified from total zzso extracted from whole blood by reverse zzso chain zzso 

zzso was detected in 50 blood samples from the zzso patients zzso zzso In contrast, there were no clinical control patients whose samples showed zzso zzso in zzso The presence of zzso in blood seemed to be correlated with the stage (by zzso zzso of zzso the serum zzso value, and the presence of zzso zzso portal vein zzso tumor diameter and/or distant zzso In addition, zzso was detected in the blood of 21 patients with zzso at zzso zzso zzso in contrast to 29 zzso of 72 patients without zzso 

The presence of zzso in peripheral blood may be an indicator of zzso zzso which might predict zzso spreading zzso of tumor cells in patients with zzso
