Gold zzso have great potential in zzso zzso therapy zzso but their zzso delivery and zzso efficiency have yet to be zzso We show that zzso gold zzso zzso enter cells significantly more than bare or zzso zzso The cellular zzso mechanism involves zzso zzso zzso zzso where particles primarily accumulate in zzso but may also leak out into the zzso After zzso incubation of zzso on zzso breast cancer cells, zzso was accomplished using zzso zzso zzso laser under zzso zzso zzso below the zzso permissible exposure of zzso These results demonstrate the enhanced zzso delivery and efficient zzso of zzso promising agents in cancer zzso
