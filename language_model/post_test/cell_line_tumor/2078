Multiple intravenous injections of a zzso library, derived from human melanoma cell lines and expressed using the highly zzso zzso zzso zzso virus zzso cured mice with established melanoma zzso zzso tumor zzso was associated with the ability of mouse zzso cells to mount a zzso zzso zzso zzso recall response in zzso We used this characteristic zzso response to screen the zzso library and identified three different zzso virus clones that, when used in combination but not alone, achieved the same efficacy against tumors as the complete parental virus zzso zzso zzso libraries can therefore be used to identify tumor rejection zzso that can cooperate to induce zzso zzso This technology should be zzso to zzso discovery for other zzso as well as for other diseases in which immune zzso against more than one target zzso contributes to disease zzso
