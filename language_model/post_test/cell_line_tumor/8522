Alpha zzso zzso is an essential component of innate zzso immunity and of treatment regimens for chronic zzso C virus zzso zzso Resistance to zzso might be important for zzso persistence and failure of zzso zzso Evidence for zzso genetic zzso of zzso resistance is zzso Experimental studies were hampered by lack of zzso culture zzso Using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso we aimed at identifying viral zzso of zzso resistance in zzso zzso culture with zzso in zzso cells resulted in viral spread with acquisition of putative escape zzso in zzso structural and zzso zzso zzso genetic studies showed that primarily zzso acid changes zzso in zzso E1 and zzso in zzso zzso increased viral zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso and zzso enhanced viral entry and release, zzso In zzso allowing viral spread, these zzso zzso a level of zzso resistance exceeding the observed fitness zzso The identified zzso acted in a zzso manner but were not found in zzso zzso and zzso patients, who failed zzso zzso Studies with zzso zzso with different degrees of culture adaptation confirmed the correlation between viral fitness and zzso zzso In conclusion, in zzso escape experiments led to identification of zzso envelope zzso resulting in increased viral fitness and zzso zzso zzso While we established a close link between viral fitness and zzso resistance, identified zzso acted via different mechanisms and appeared to be relatively specific to the infecting virus, possibly explaining difficulties in identifying signature zzso for zzso zzso
