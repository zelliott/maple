zzso therapy and chemotherapy have little effect on zzso zzso zzso We investigated the effect of the tumor vaccination strategy on preventing tumor formation after a challenge with zzso The zzso surface zzso zzso was used to enhance the zzso immunity and tumor vaccination zzso zzso cells expressing zzso zzso were completely susceptible to zzso zzso which implies that zzso vaccination zzso specific zzso immunity against zzso expressing cancer zzso As with zzso zzso vaccination with zzso zzso retarded tumor formation following a zzso zzso After zzso zzso the zzso zzso tumor vaccine completely prevented the tumor formation by zzso zzso vaccination with zzso zzso (5 zzso zzso zzso but not with zzso reduced the tumor rate after a challenge with 5 zzso zzso zzso cells, whereas a lower tumor load was overcome by the zzso vaccination zzso These results confirm the zzso that zzso vaccination elicits an zzso immune response to some putative zzso or enhances the general immune competence in zzso zzso tumor zzso
