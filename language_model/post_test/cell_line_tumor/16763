zzso is a member of the zzso zzso factor family that is highly expressed in multiple zzso playing important roles in zzso zzso and zzso In this study, we observed an inverse correlation between the expression of zzso in human stage II breast cancer zzso and the corresponding level of clinical zzso zzso these findings in zzso we found that zzso of zzso in breast tumor cells was sufficient to zzso resistance to zzso and zzso whereas enhanced zzso expression could render these cells zzso The tumor cell side population, which is enriched for cancer stem cells, was found to be associated with zzso Increased side population zzso were detected among tumor cell lines subjected to zzso zzso In contrast, enhanced expression of zzso was correlated with a decreased side population zzso and significantly, this finding was zzso in zzso where tumors with enhanced expression of zzso were found to have blunted zzso zzso cells subjected to zzso zzso grew faster and were larger in zzso Taken together, our findings suggest that zzso may be an important zzso marker for breast cancer zzso
