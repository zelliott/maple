The activated B zzso (ABC) zzso of diffuse large zzso zzso zzso is characterized by zzso zzso of the nuclear zzso zzso zzso In this study, we showed that the zzso zzso induced the expression of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in ABC zzso cell lines, which also have high levels of total and zzso signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso 3 zzso suggesting zzso zzso Using zzso interference for zzso we defined a gene expression signature of zzso and zzso signaling through zzso Based on this signature, we constructed a molecular predictor of zzso signaling that defined a subset of ABC zzso tumors with high expression of zzso zzso and/or zzso and their downstream zzso Although the zzso and zzso zzso had equivalent expression of genes that distinguish ABC zzso from zzso center B zzso zzso zzso ABC zzso had higher expression of signatures that reflected zzso activity, zzso and zzso A zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso which blocked zzso signature zzso was toxic only for ABC zzso lines and zzso with an inhibitor of zzso zzso These findings suggest that the biological interplay between the zzso and zzso pathways may be exploited for the treatments of a subset of ABC zzso
