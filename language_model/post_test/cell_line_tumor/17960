Complex organisms require zzso zzso programs, yet little is known about how these are zzso The zzso factor zzso is thought to contribute to gene regulation through its ability to act as a pioneer factor binding to zzso zzso Through zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso cell zzso functions rely primarily on differential recruitment to zzso predominantly at distant enhancers rather than zzso zzso This differential recruitment leads to cell zzso changes in zzso structure and functional collaboration with zzso zzso zzso Despite the ability of zzso to bind zzso its differential binding to zzso sites is dependent on the distribution of zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso Together, our results suggest that zzso of zzso zzso zzso 4 is part of the zzso signature that defines zzso zzso recruitment sites in zzso zzso translates this zzso signature into changes in zzso structure thereby establishing zzso zzso enhancers and zzso
