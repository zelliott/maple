zzso an zzso zzso zzso has recently been found to have significant zzso effects on zzso tumor zzso Here, we investigated the potential effect of zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso treatment resulted in obvious zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso cells, as shown by the increase in zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso membrane potential zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso reporter gene activity, decreased the zzso activity of zzso and blocked zzso zzso zzso Of interest, the zzso zzso fusion protein but not its zzso levels were quickly reduced upon zzso exposure in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced the zzso driven by zzso zzso protein reduction could not be reversed by the addition of zzso or zzso zzso The zzso of zzso inhibited zzso zzso whereas zzso or zzso zzso enhanced its zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso cells showed more sensitivity to zzso than zzso control cells, and the zzso protein was zzso as observed in zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso was also observed in primary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso these findings suggest that zzso is a promising potent agent to fight against zzso cells via the zzso of the zzso signaling zzso and depletion of the zzso zzso
