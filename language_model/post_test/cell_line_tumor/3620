In zzso zzso involving primary cells are used routinely to evaluate zzso toxic effects, for instance, the use of primary zzso to evaluate zzso A major drawback of an in zzso system is the lack of multiple organ interactions as observed in a whole zzso A novel cell culture system, the integrated discrete zzso cell culture system zzso is described zzso The zzso is based on the zzso within a zzso concept, consisting of a cell culture plate with larger, containing wells, within each of which are multiple smaller zzso zzso from multiple zzso can be cultured initially in the small zzso (one organ per well, each in its specialized zzso On the day of toxicity testing, a volume of zzso medium is added to the containing well to flood all inner wells, thereby zzso all the small zzso After testing, the zzso medium is removed and each cell type is evaluated for toxicity using appropriate zzso We report here the application of zzso in the evaluation of the zzso of zzso an zzso agent with known human zzso on primary cells from multiple human zzso liver zzso kidney zzso cortical zzso lung zzso airway zzso zzso central nervous system zzso blood vessels zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso human breast zzso zzso zzso produced results that can be used for the quantitative evaluation of its zzso effects zzso zzso towards zzso zzso versus its toxicity toward normal zzso zzso liver, zzso zzso zzso blood zzso
