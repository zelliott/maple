zzso are the most common primary brain tumor affecting human adults and remain a therapeutic challenge because cells of origin are still zzso Here, we investigated the cellular origin of zzso zzso in a rat model based on zzso exposure to zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging coupled to zzso and zzso analyses were used to further characterize zzso rat zzso at different stages of zzso We showed that early zzso zzso have characteristics of zzso tumors and exclusively contain zzso slow dividing precursor cells, which express early markers of zzso zzso These zzso precursors failed to fully differentiate into zzso and exhibited zzso abilities in zzso Moreover, a few zzso zzso cells are resistant to zzso and may be responsible for tumor zzso frequently observed in zzso Overall, these findings suggest that transformed zzso zzso zzso precursor cell may be a potential cell of origin in the genesis of rat zzso zzso zzso This work may open up new perspectives for understanding biology of human zzso
