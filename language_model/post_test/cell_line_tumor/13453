zzso cell therapy using zzso T cells is a promising strategy for treating patients with zzso However, accumulating zzso have demonstrated that optimal function of zzso T cells is often attenuated by negative regulatory zzso delivered through zzso such as zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso programmed death 1 zzso and their zzso zzso Although systemic blocking of these molecules needs careful attention on the risk of uncontrolled immune zzso selective zzso of negative signals in zzso T cells by their genetic modification is an attractive approach to overcome zzso suppression in cancer zzso Here, we demonstrate the improved zzso functions of zzso zzso and zzso human T cells by small interfering zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso human zzso clones zzso the expression of zzso zzso upon zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso enhanced the zzso production and zzso zzso of these zzso zzso blood zzso cells zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chains also increased their zzso functions by this zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso of zzso zzso is an attractive strategy to inhibit a negative regulatory mechanism of zzso T cells resulting in enhanced efficacy of adoptive zzso therapy of cancer using genetically modified zzso zzso
