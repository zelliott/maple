A novel series of zzso zzso cholesterol zzso zzso zzso with a zzso group at the zzso were zzso and their zzso and biological activities were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell formation activity increased dependent on zzso of derivatives with various zzso chains at the zzso The zzso activity curve of the derivatives with a zzso group shifted zzso compared to that of zzso derivatives with a zzso group, and derivatives with no zzso suggesting that a zzso group plays an important role in the interaction with zzso zzso Among zzso zzso zzso had about twofold lower zzso than zzso while it showed twofold higher zzso zzso zzso than and the same zzso cell formation as zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso was higher than that of zzso in zzso The plasma protein binding ratio of zzso was lower than that of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed greater zzso effects on zzso cholesterol zzso in mice than zzso In conclusion, the introduction of a zzso group is effective to design less zzso more zzso and more zzso zzso zzso zzso than previous zzso zzso
