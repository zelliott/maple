The zzso cell line is developed from a human stem cell zzso zzso as the result of zzso disruption and a zzso zzso of the zzso gene and the zzso gene zzso a protein of unknown function called zzso zzso zzso Partner zzso The resulting fusion protein zzso is soluble and has zzso zzso zzso zzso Since the heat shock protein zzso and its zzso zzso have been shown to stabilize many zzso zzso we investigated the requirement for zzso or zzso assistance to maintain the stability or activity of zzso expressed in zzso zzso We found that zzso forms a permanent complex with zzso This results in protection against degradation of zzso and holds the zzso in a permanently active zzso zzso of zzso or depletion of zzso or heat shock factor 1 zzso reduced the expression level of zzso and was sufficient to block the zzso induced proliferation of zzso zzso We conclude that the driver of zzso in zzso zzso cells, zzso is an zzso addicted zzso This provides a rationale for the therapeutic use of zzso zzso in zzso zzso that contain zzso fusion zzso
