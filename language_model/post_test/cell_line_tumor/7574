zzso is highly expressed in a variety of human tumors and associated with tumor zzso However, the relationship among the zzso of zzso zzso to zzso transition zzso and zzso is largely zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression of zzso in human zzso cell lines, clinical zzso specimens and its association with zzso and zzso The results of our study showed that the expression levels of zzso in cell lines with higher zzso potential were significantly higher compared to those with lower zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso and normal liver zzso the expression of zzso was significantly increased in zzso tumor zzso The expression of zzso was correlated with invasion and zzso zzso grade and zzso zzso A significant positive correlation was found between the expression of zzso and zzso and tumors with high expression of zzso had a tendency to higher zzso compared to those with low expression of zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we found that decreased expression of zzso was accompanied by a reduction of zzso zzso Our findings demonstrated that the zzso of zzso is correlated with the zzso zzso of zzso cells and can promote zzso but cannot induce zzso in zzso The decreased expression of zzso is accompanied by an zzso of zzso in the zzso cell zzso
