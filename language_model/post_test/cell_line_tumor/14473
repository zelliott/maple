zzso zzso zzso is zzso in a majority of zzso prostate zzso but most of the cell model studies addressing zzso function have been conducted in zzso prostate cancer cells expressing unamplified zzso zzso Here, we have compared the responses of various types of zzso zzso towards a pattern of zzso target genes and zzso binding sites in zzso of the zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso In keeping with the zzso gene amplification in zzso cells, our analyses show that these cells contain zzso zzso zzso and protein than zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso onto zzso regulatory sites and expression of several zzso target zzso including their zzso zzso were stronger in zzso cells than zzso zzso zzso displayed a trend towards zzso in zzso zzso zzso also evoked zzso interaction, whereas zzso zzso zzso was zzso with this respect both in zzso and zzso zzso These results support the notion that the zzso protein level translates into zzso occupancy of zzso enhancers and target gene activity in prostate cancer zzso
