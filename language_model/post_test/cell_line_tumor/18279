zzso zzso is associated with zzso by promoting zzso and zzso Although zzso of zzso is indicated in many zzso its function in pancreatic cancer has not been well zzso In this study we examined the expression of zzso on pancreatic cancer cells and clinical tissue zzso and investigated the effect of zzso zzso on gene zzso and signaling in human pancreatic cancer zzso We found that pancreatic cancer cells expressed higher amount of zzso zzso than normal human pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also substantially zzso in 11 of 14 zzso clinical zzso samples compared with that in their surrounding normal zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of vascular zzso growth zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells, one of human pancreatic cancer cell zzso zzso expression was zzso by zzso mimicking zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso activated zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso Our studies suggest that zzso might be a zzso factor in human pancreatic cancer by induction of vascular zzso growth factor and zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso along with other zzso therapy could be an effective treatment for this zzso
