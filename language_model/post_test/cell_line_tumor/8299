zzso zzso zzso which is currently used in the treatment of acquired zzso syndrome, has been shown to have zzso zzso In the present study, we examined the mechanisms contributing to increased sensitivity of cancer cells to the zzso effects of zzso This was accomplished by zzso a zzso cell line zzso and a normal liver cell line zzso with zzso in continuous culture for up to 4 weeks and evaluating the number of viable and zzso cells, the induction of zzso cell cycle zzso and zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso caused significant zzso decreases in the number of viable cells at zzso zzso 24 zzso During a zzso recover period, there was only a slight increase in the number of viable cells treated with zzso The decrease in viable cells was associated with an induction of zzso a decrease in zzso activity, and S and zzso phase arrest of the cell zzso During the recovery period, the extent of zzso and zzso activity returned to control levels, whereas the disruption of cell cycle progression zzso Western zzso analysis indicated that zzso caused a decrease in checkpoint zzso 1 zzso and zzso 2 zzso and an increase in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Similar effects, to lesser extent, were observed in zzso cells given much higher zzso of zzso zzso zzso These data show that zzso cells are much more sensitive than zzso cells to zzso They also indicate that a combination of a delay of cell cycle zzso an induction of zzso and a decrease in zzso activity is contributing to the decrease in the number of viable cells from zzso treatment, and that checkpoint zzso zzso and zzso may play an important role in the delay of cell cycle zzso
