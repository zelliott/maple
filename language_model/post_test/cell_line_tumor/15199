The biology of the zzso plasma cells zzso in multiple myeloma zzso is highly influenced by the bone zzso zzso zzso in which they zzso More specifically, zzso zzso cells zzso are known to interact with zzso cells to promote zzso cell survival and zzso By contrast, it is unclear if innate immune cells within this same space also actively participate in the pathology of zzso Our study shows for the first time that zzso zzso can contribute to the biology of zzso by enhancing the proliferation of some zzso zzso We first demonstrate that PCs and Eos can be found in close proximity in the zzso In culture, Eos were found to augment zzso cell proliferation that is predominantly zzso through a soluble zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso studies demonstrated that this activity is independent of zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso Using a zzso in zzso system designed to resemble the native zzso zzso zzso and Eos were shown to have zzso roles in their support of zzso cell zzso Whereas zzso induce zzso cell proliferation predominantly through the zzso of zzso Eos stimulate growth of these zzso cells via an zzso zzso Taken together, our study demonstrates for the first time a role for Eos in the pathology of zzso and suggests that therapeutic strategies targeting these cells may be zzso
