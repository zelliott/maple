zzso zzso zzso functions downstream of zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso by catalyzing the conversion of zzso to zzso acid zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso is regulated directly or zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso Using zzso transgenic mice, we measured the spatial and zzso pattern of zzso expression in zzso during zzso zzso in the zzso zzso was expressed in all layers of the zzso zzso in zzso At zzso and zzso when cortical zzso occurs, expression of zzso was primarily localized to the zzso zone zzso where zzso stem cells zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso decreased proliferation of embryonic cortical neural zzso cells (by zzso P zzso zzso as determined by zzso zzso In adult brain, zzso expression decreased in the zzso zone zzso zzso zzso and zzso bulb zzso However, strong expression of zzso was observed in zzso migratory stream zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells derived from the adult mice significantly increased the number of cells by zzso whereas zzso zzso by zzso decreased cell numbers by zzso at 48 h zzso zzso zzso zzso The results of zzso analysis revealed that zzso in the brain lacks zzso 7 and is identical to the form of zzso found in zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso previously known as a zzso marker, regulates neural zzso cell zzso
