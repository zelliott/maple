The zzso hormone, 3, zzso zzso regulates cell growth, development, zzso and metabolism via interactions with zzso hormone receptors zzso However, the zzso proteins that are regulated by zzso are yet to be zzso In this study, we used the quantitative zzso approach of stable isotope labeling with zzso acids in cell culture coupled with zzso zzso zzso performed on a zzso instrument to identify and characterize the zzso proteins zzso in human zzso zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso In total, zzso and zzso proteins were identified and zzso respectively, in three independent zzso Among these, 61 zzso twofold and 11 zzso twofold proteins were zzso Eight proteins displaying increased expression and one with decreased expression in zzso media were validated using Western zzso zzso quantitative zzso further disclosed induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso target, in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso deletions of the zzso promoter region and subsequent zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso hormone response element on the promoter is localized at positions zzso zzso zzso enhanced tumor growth and migration in a manner similar to what was seen when zzso induced zzso expression in zzso cells, both in zzso and in zzso An in zzso zzso zzso further supported a crucial role of zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso To our knowledge, these results demonstrate for the first time that proteins involved in the zzso zzso zzso system, including zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in the zzso and zzso space of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso generated in the current study may provide an opportunity to establish the mechanisms underlying zzso tumor progression and zzso
