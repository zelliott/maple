zzso the growth patterns of single cells offers answers to some of the most elusive questions in contemporary cell zzso how cell growth is regulated and how cell size zzso are zzso For example, a linear growth in time implies that there is no regulation required to maintain zzso an exponential pattern indicates the zzso Recently, there has been great effort to measure single cells using zzso systems technology, and several important questions have been zzso However, a unified, zzso methodology to measure the growth rate of individual adherent cells of various sizes has been zzso Here we demonstrate that a newly developed optical zzso technique, known as spatial light interference zzso can measure the cell dry mass of many individual adherent cells in various conditions, over spatial scales from zzso to zzso zzso scales ranging from seconds to days, and cell types ranging from bacteria to zzso zzso We found evidence of exponential growth in zzso coli, which agrees very well with other recent zzso Perhaps most importantly, combining spatial light interference zzso with zzso imaging provides a unique method for studying cell zzso zzso Thus, by using a fluorescent reporter for the S phase, we measured single cell growth over each phase of the cell cycle in human zzso zzso cells and found that the zzso phase exhibits the highest growth rate, which is zzso and can be zzso by an zzso
