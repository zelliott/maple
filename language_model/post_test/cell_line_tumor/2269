zzso the structural analog of zzso is a novel and promising zzso zzso zzso inhibitor for use in cancer zzso To investigate its effects on cancer cell growth, zzso zzso was performed in 10 human cancer cell zzso The data showed that the zzso of zzso ranged from 1 to 13 zzso which was comparable to that of zzso in half of the tested cell zzso Furthermore, the growth curve indicated that cell growth was gradually inhibited with an increase in zzso zzso and the zzso was reversed after drug removal in two zzso zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso To determine cell cycle and zzso zzso was carried out in the zzso and zzso cells treated with zzso A decrease in the cell population at S phase and an increase in the cell population at zzso phase occurred in a zzso zzso In addition, zzso induced zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may arrest the cell cycle and inhibit the growth of zzso zzso cells through zzso of zzso Further studies are required to clarify the zzso activity of zzso in zzso and its mechanism in zzso zzso
