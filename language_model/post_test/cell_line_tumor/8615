zzso zzso of zzso zzso cancer zzso and zzso zzso would improve the surgical outcomes of these zzso zzso and zzso zzso express high levels of zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to prove the concept that zzso zzso specifically zzso to zzso tumors in zzso 

We zzso two zzso of a known zzso zzso zzso zzso and four new zzso which have a favorable structure for zzso Their zzso activity was determined using zzso demonstrating decreased zzso zzso after calcium stimulation in human embryonic kidney cells zzso zzso zzso 9 was further zzso with zzso and evaluated in nude mice with and without zzso zzso of zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso that do and do not express zzso zzso 

Two newly zzso compounds, 9 and 11, exhibited better zzso activity than zzso zzso The zzso of zzso 9 in nude mice without zzso was zzso zzso A zzso study in nude mice bearing both tumors demonstrated that the zzso of zzso in zzso tumors was higher than in zzso tumors at 24 hours: zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso percentage of injected dose per gram of tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso with a ratio of zzso zzso zzso zzso ratios for zzso tumors, but not zzso tumors, increased with zzso zzso values increased from zzso zzso zzso at 1 hour to zzso zzso zzso at 24 hour zzso zzso zzso for zzso tumors, and zzso zzso zzso at 1 hour to zzso zzso zzso at 24 hour zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso 

Our new zzso zzso specifically inhibit zzso function in zzso zzso zzso to zzso tumors in zzso and therefore have the potential to serve as scaffolds for further development as imaging zzso
