The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso factors zzso number of free zzso trapped by one mole of zzso zzso of these compounds were determined by induction period methods with a kinetic approach in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso systems at 70 degrees zzso The zzso values for zzso zzso and zzso were approximately zzso greater than those for their zzso in both the zzso and zzso systems, whereas the zzso values for zzso and zzso were identical to those of their zzso zzso zzso and zzso containing zzso groups, were potent zzso The zzso values zzso for zzso and zzso were considerably less than 2, as is commonly observed for the zzso factors of zzso zzso The zzso efficiencies against zzso zzso of the zzso and their zzso were also investigated, likewise indicating that zzso zzso and zzso were potent zzso zzso and zzso were less effective radical zzso because of the zzso factor of their bulky zzso zzso On the basis of zzso activity against a human zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso and human zzso zzso zzso these compounds could be classified into a zzso group zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso as a positive zzso and a zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso was markedly reduced by zzso whereas that of zzso was zzso The sensitivity index zzso of 50% zzso concentration for zzso cells to that for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was approximately 9, 5, 7 and 2, respectively, whereas that of the other compounds was approximately zzso Potential mechanisms of zzso were assessed by zzso zzso molecular zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were highly sensitive to zzso such as zzso and zzso possibly due to the formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the high sensitivity index of zzso may be related to the production of a highly zzso substance, zzso via zzso zzso relationship zzso ) models using zzso calculations may be useful to predict biological activity during the development of potential zzso zzso
