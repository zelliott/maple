We investigated the ability of zzso an zzso drug, to zzso the zzso effect of zzso in two cervical cancer cell lines and in human zzso cervical zzso The effect of zzso alone or combined with zzso on cellular proliferation was studied with the zzso zzso which use a zzso dye zzso Before and after treatment with zzso the zzso zzso of zzso in cancer cells and tumors of mice was evaluated by zzso The expression of zzso and zzso genes was also assessed by a reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and Western zzso In addition, single agents and combination treatment in zzso studies were performed with the zzso cervical zzso zzso zzso were carried out zzso Analysis of the data by the zzso method shows a synergistic zzso effect produced by the combination of zzso with zzso only in the zzso cervical cancer cell line but not in zzso zzso The effect of zzso on zzso of zzso could be zzso at least zzso by an increase of zzso zzso zzso but not by changes in zzso gene relation expression in these zzso In zzso studies showed that the combination of these agents has a significant zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso can improve the efficacy of the zzso effect of zzso in zzso and in zzso This zzso drug therapy may be a useful candidate for further evaluation in combination with other zzso drugs in the treatment of cancer, particularly with zzso
