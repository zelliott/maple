zzso transition zzso plays a key role in the development of chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso and lung zzso 

There are five major zzso regulatory genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso involved in zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso in these genes may influence the development of both zzso 

Seven genetic zzso were zzso in two zzso zzso studies with zzso lung cancer cases and zzso control subjects, and zzso patients with COPD and zzso control subjects to show their associations with development of both zzso 

An zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso decreased risks of lung cancer zzso zzso zzso odds ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and COPD zzso zzso CT zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso affected lung cancer risk indirectly through COPD zzso accounted for zzso of effect that the zzso had on lung zzso Moreover, zzso was correlated with lung cancer stages in smoking patients zzso zzso zzso and those with the zzso zzso were less likely to have zzso at diagnosis than those with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso attenuated zzso ability to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and to promote zzso changes, including zzso changes, cell migration, and zzso However, these effects were not observed for the other zzso 

The functional zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso consistently decreased risks of lung cancer and zzso and this zzso affects lung cancer risk through a mediation effect of zzso
