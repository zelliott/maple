A novel type of zzso zzso zzso zzso based on a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso core with zzso targeting zzso and many zzso zzso zzso zzso arms was zzso as a carrier for zzso drug zzso The star zzso zzso was characterized using nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso transformed infrared zzso zzso and gel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from its highly zzso structure, zzso could form zzso in zzso solution, which was confirmed by transmission electron zzso zzso and dynamic light scattering zzso zzso The zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso were evaluated via zzso zzso zzso against zzso normal cells and red blood cell zzso zzso zzso zzso As a model zzso drug, zzso zzso was zzso into the zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso against an zzso human head and neck zzso cell zzso The strong affinity of zzso zzso to bone was confirmed by the zzso zzso binding zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso are highly promising zzso drug carriers for skeletal zzso
