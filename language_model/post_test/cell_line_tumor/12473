zzso receptors zzso are critical regulators of the zzso of many zzso Despite this, the roles and regulation of one of the two known zzso - zzso are poorly zzso This is partly because analyses have been confused by discrepancies between zzso expression at zzso and proteins levels, and because zzso is expressed as several functionally distinct zzso We investigated human zzso zzso untranslated regions zzso and their influences on zzso expression and zzso We demonstrate that two alternative zzso zzso have potent and differential influences on expression acting at the level of zzso We show that their influences are modulated by cellular context and in zzso and demonstrate the contributions of both upstream open reading frames and zzso secondary zzso These regulatory mechanisms offer explanations for the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso we also demonstrate that zzso allow the first reported mechanisms for differential regulation of the expression of the zzso zzso 1, 2 and 5, and thereby have critical influences on zzso zzso
