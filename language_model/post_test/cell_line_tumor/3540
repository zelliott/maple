zzso zzso zzso numerous cellular functions, including the zzso zzso of its target zzso The zzso tumor zzso encodes a zzso finger protein with distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso uninterrupted zinc fingers, functions as a zzso factor and has a zzso nuclear zzso zzso with an zzso of three zzso acids zzso between zinc fingers three and four, zzso to discrete nuclear zzso the function of which is zzso Because the zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso we tested whether zzso zzso the cellular zzso of zzso We find here that both zzso zzso are directly zzso on zzso zzso 73 and zzso Although zzso zzso zzso depletion effectively suppresses zzso nuclear zzso a zzso zzso zzso double zzso retains zzso to zzso Thus, direct zzso of zzso is not responsible for its cellular zzso and other zzso proteins may target zzso to these nuclear zzso Identification of other components of zzso zzso is likely to provide clues to their zzso
