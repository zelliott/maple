We examined the effect of zzso zzso a selective zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso to zzso zzso downstream zzso zzso and the association between the zzso of DNA repair by zzso and the expression of zzso protein zzso zzso using three zzso cancer cell zzso In the presence of zzso zzso growth zzso and zzso were significantly enhanced in zzso and zzso cells, which express zzso and in zzso which lacks zzso but expresses zzso zzso significantly inhibited the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells but not in zzso zzso In all three cell lines, there was delayed repair of DNA zzso zzso damaged by zzso used in combination with zzso compared with zzso zzso The reduction in zzso levels persisted when cells were exposed to combinations of zzso and zzso in all cell zzso Moreover, the delayed repair was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest that combination therapy with zzso and zzso may increase the therapeutic efficacy of zzso by blocking zzso downstream signaling and/or zzso DNA repair in zzso zzso
