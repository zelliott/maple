Our previous study had amplified zzso full-length zzso zzso and zzso genes of zzso expanded T cells in the peripheral blood zzso of patients with diffuse large zzso zzso zzso The transfer of T cell zzso zzso genes zzso T cells with new zzso zzso zzso the aim of this study is to generate diffuse large B cell zzso zzso T cells by T cell zzso zzso gene zzso 

Two different zzso expression plasmids harboring zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes specific for zzso zzso were constructed and subsequently transferred into human T cells using zzso zzso The expression of targeted genes in zzso zzso cells was detected by real-time zzso and western zzso using zzso zzso zzso The specific zzso of zzso zzso T cells in zzso was estimated using a zzso zzso zzso release zzso 

Two different zzso expression plasmids harboring zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes specific for zzso zzso were constructed and subsequently transferred into T cells from healthy zzso zzso zzso zzso T zzso zzso could be induced by zzso of specific zzso gene to modify healthy T zzso The zzso cassette of zzso zzso zzso was superior to the other in the function of zzso T zzso 

zzso zzso zzso T zzso zzso could be inducted by zzso of specific zzso gene to modify healthy T zzso
