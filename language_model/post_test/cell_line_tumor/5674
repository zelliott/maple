zzso zzso using an zzso zzso is an emerging technique for transient pore formation in adherent zzso Because adherent cells do not have a simple and consistent shape and because the electric field emanating from the tip of the zzso is zzso the zzso equation based on zzso cells in homogeneous electrical fields does not zzso We sought to determine experimental and cell parameters that influence the outcome of a zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were exposed to the zzso dye zzso leading to green zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso causes a decrease with time of the zzso zzso intensity of zzso cells from zzso loss of zzso zzso The transient zzso thus obtained are zzso by a simple model originally developed by zzso et zzso We find that the final zzso following zzso is related to the zzso zzso distance and cell size zzso zzso where A is the area of the cell's image in zzso This quantity is the diameter if the image is a zzso In separate experiments, the relationship obtained can be used to control the final zzso following zzso by adjusting the zzso distance based on cell zzso The relationship was applied successfully to zzso as well as zzso 145 and zzso zzso Finally, zzso show that the zzso in the final zzso zzso zzso is decreased when the zzso distance is controlled according to the derived relationship in comparison to experiments in which the zzso distance is a constant irrespective of cell zzso
