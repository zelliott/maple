zzso the blue zzso produced by the zzso zzso zzso , exists in two different forms, the zzso and zzso zzso We investigated the zzso zzso and zzso properties of both of these zzso Both forms of zzso inhibited the development of marine bacteria, in particular the zzso zzso zzso zzso , at zzso as low as 1 zzso but they did not display any effect on a wide range of zzso bacteria that are relevant for food zzso Both forms of the zzso produced by zzso zzso also exhibited zzso activity against the zzso zzso virus, with zzso and zzso zzso having zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso zzso These values are 2 orders of magnitude higher than the value for the reference drug, zzso Moreover, both forms of zzso were effective in slowing or zzso the proliferation of cancer zzso This study confirms the potential of zzso as a biologically active organic zzso which could have a protective effect on zzso which filter seawater and fix the zzso on their zzso Moreover, zzso could be used in food engineering and chemistry as a natural blue zzso However, despite that it is eaten and possibly assimilated by green oyster consumers, it also deserves in depth evaluation before being considered for use as a zzso
