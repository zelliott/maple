zzso zzso acids have been used extensively in zzso both as diagnostic and therapeutic zzso In our pursuit to develop zzso to target breast cancer, we were interested in determining the zzso of zzso zzso among other labeled zzso zzso in breast cancer zzso In this work, we have developed an alternative method for the synthesis of this zzso The novel tin zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso from the known, corresponding zzso zzso Initially, the labeled zzso was zzso from the above tin precursor in two steps with zzso yields of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso step, zzso zzso it was zzso in a single step with an average zzso yield of zzso zzso zzso zzso After incubation with zzso breast cancer cells for 60 zzso an zzso of up to zzso zzso zzso of the input dose was zzso in comparison, the zzso of zzso under the same conditions was zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso of both zzso was inhibited to a similar degree in a zzso manner by both zzso zzso and zzso With zzso as the zzso zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso were obtained for zzso and zzso respectively, and these values for zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, an improved and convenient method for the synthesis of zzso zzso was developed and the zzso prepared by this route demonstrated an zzso acid zzso zzso in zzso breast cancer cells in zzso that was comparable to that of zzso
