zzso zzso cell zzso zzso is a lethal disease and early death usually occurs as a result of local invasion and regional zzso zzso zzso Current treatment regimens are, to a certain degree, zzso with a zzso mortality rate of around 50% and novel therapeutic targets are urgently zzso Using expression zzso we identified the zzso gene as being zzso in zzso cell lines relative to normal oral zzso and confirmed these findings using zzso and western zzso In human zzso we found that zzso was zzso in zzso zzso of primary zzso compared with normal oral zzso and that expression correlated significantly with zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting a zzso zzso Using zzso cell lines, we assessed the functional role of zzso in tumor zzso Although suppression of zzso produced no effect on cell zzso both cell spreading and migration were markedly zzso The latter cell functions may be modulated through the small zzso zzso and we used pull-down zzso to investigate the role of zzso in zzso zzso We found that zzso and zzso zzso of zzso was zzso through zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso inhibited zzso cell migration similarly and transient expression of zzso active zzso restored migration of cells in which zzso expression had been zzso We also showed that zzso of zzso inhibited tumor cell invasion in an zzso model of zzso These data suggest that zzso and zzso are part of an integrated signaling zzso modulating zzso zzso cell zzso and identify zzso as a possible therapeutic zzso
