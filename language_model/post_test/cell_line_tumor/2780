zzso zzso factor 1 zzso has been suggested to play a critical role in the fate of cells exposed to hypoxic zzso However, the mechanism of zzso cell survival is still not fully understood in zzso zzso zzso status is critical for decisions of cell survival, death and zzso We investigated the effects of zzso zzso on cellular zzso status in zzso cells exposed to zzso or oxygen and zzso deprivation zzso coupled with cell death zzso Our results demonstrated that zzso zzso expression by zzso specific small interfering zzso zzso zzso increased zzso oxygen species generation, and transformed the cells to more zzso environments zzso zzso ratio, low zzso zzso under either hypoxic or zzso zzso Cell death increased dramatically in the zzso zzso cells, compared to zzso cells after zzso zzso In contrast, increasing zzso expression by zzso a metal zzso and zzso zzso induced a more reducing environment zzso zzso ratio, high zzso zzso and reduced cell zzso Further studies showed that zzso regulated not only zzso zzso zzso but also the key zzso of the zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso These zzso are important in maintaining cellular zzso zzso by generating zzso the primary reducing agent in zzso Moreover, zzso significantly decreased cell death in the zzso cells induced by zzso and zzso These results suggest that maintenance of cellular zzso status by zzso protects cells from zzso and zzso zzso zzso
