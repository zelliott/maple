zzso is a newly described zzso regulated gene of potential interest in zzso therapy resistance and zzso The zzso value of zzso in breast cancer was zzso 

zzso levels of zzso in breast cancer cell lines and patient zzso were determined by real-time zzso chain reaction and in a tissue zzso by zzso zzso zzso was used to evaluate the distribution of zzso in tumor zzso relative to zzso zzso analysis as well as zzso Cox zzso survival analyses were zzso 

zzso was zzso expressed in breast cancer cell lines and induced in an oxygen zzso zzso zzso protein expression zzso with hypoxic areas in breast cancer zzso zzso zzso was higher in breast tumors from patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or steroid hormone zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso Breast cancer patients with high zzso zzso levels had more zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This was limited to patients treated with zzso and zzso as primary treatment zzso zzso 53, P zzso zzso No association with zzso survival was zzso In zzso Cox zzso analysis, zzso remained as a statistically independent zzso factor for zzso recurrence zzso ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso zzso after correction for zzso status, zzso grade, tumor size, zzso status, therapy, and steroid hormone zzso zzso zzso protein in breast cancer tissue proved also to be of zzso zzso 

Evidence was provided for an association of zzso with tumor cell zzso in breast cancer zzso In the current breast cancer zzso zzso had independent zzso zzso
