Nuclear factor zzso related factor 2 zzso a zzso zzso factor, regulates the expression of zzso zzso and several zzso zzso which zzso zzso against zzso stress and zzso zzso zzso of zzso in lung cancer cells promotes zzso and contributes to zzso by zzso of zzso zzso and the drug zzso pathways involved in zzso of zzso and broad spectrum of zzso In this study, we show that zzso lowering of zzso levels in zzso lung cancer zzso cell lines zzso and zzso led to a dramatic increase in zzso zzso oxygen species zzso zzso Similarly, zzso formation of protein zzso were significantly higher in zzso lung cancer cells, suggesting increased zzso of zzso radiation in the absence of zzso zzso protein zzso in zzso cells correlated with reduced survival as measured by zzso zzso zzso cell death was zzso by zzso with antioxidants such as zzso zzso and zzso highlighting the importance of antioxidants in zzso protection against radiation zzso Using zzso gain and loss of function models of zzso in mouse embryonic zzso we establish that zzso zzso of zzso protects against zzso radiation toxicity and zzso zzso Thus, targeting zzso activity in zzso tumors could be a promising strategy to circumvent zzso
