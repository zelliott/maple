A zzso study was done to determine whether an electronic nose developed for air quality monitoring at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory zzso could be used to distinguish between the zzso of organ and tumor zzso with an eye to using such a device as one of several modes in zzso imaging and tumor differentiation during zzso 

We hypothesized that the zzso electronic nose zzso would be able to distinguish between the zzso of various organ and tumor zzso 

The odor signatures, or array response, of two zzso chicken heart and chicken liver, and cultured zzso and melanoma tumor cell lines were recorded using the zzso Electronic zzso The overall array responses were compared to determine whether they were sufficiently different to allow the zzso and cell lines to be identified by their array zzso 

The zzso was able to distinguish between the two types of organ tissue and between the two types of tumor cell zzso The variation in array response for the organ zzso was zzso and between the two types of cultured cell lines was zzso 

This study shows that it is possible to use an electronic nose to distinguish between two types of tumor cells and between two types of organ zzso As we conducted the experiment with a sensor array built for air quality monitoring rather than for medical purposes, it may be possible to select an array that is zzso to distinguish between different types of cells and organ zzso Further focused studies are needed to investigate the odor signatures of different cells as well as cellular zzso growth, differentiation and zzso
