To improve zzso with zzso electron zzso we assessed whether the biological efficiency of zzso varied according to its zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells were incubated with increasing activities zzso zzso of zzso zzso targeting the cell zzso the zzso or the zzso We then measured cell survival by zzso zzso and the mean radiation dose to the nucleus by assessing the cellular medical internal radiation dose zzso The relationship between survival and the radiation dose delivered was investigated with a linear mixed zzso zzso For each cell line, we obtained zzso zzso for the three targets and the reference values zzso the dose leading to 75, 50 or 37% zzso When cell survival was expressed as a function of the total cumulative zzso nuclear zzso zzso were more harmful than zzso in the zzso or at the cell zzso However, when survival was expressed as a function of the mean radiation dose to the nucleus, toxicity was significantly higher when zzso was targeted to the cell membrane than to the zzso These findings indicate that the membrane is a more sensitive target than the zzso for the dense zzso produced by zzso zzso Moreover, cell membrane targeting is as zzso as nuclear targeting in zzso zzso We suggest that targeting the membrane rather than the zzso may contribute to the development of more efficient zzso based on zzso electron radiation, also because most of the available zzso are directed against cell surface zzso
