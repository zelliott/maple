The transition from zzso to activated T cells is marked by alternative zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso Using a short hairpin zzso interference screen, we identified zzso zzso zzso zzso as a critical zzso regulator of zzso alternative zzso zzso was zzso in zzso T cells, bound zzso zzso and was both necessary and sufficient for zzso alternative zzso zzso or zzso of zzso in B and T cell lines and primary T cells resulted in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso array analysis suggested that zzso acts as a global regulator of alternative zzso in activated T zzso zzso of zzso during zzso cell zzso and differentiation may allow cells to rapidly shift their zzso to favor proliferation and inhibit cell zzso
