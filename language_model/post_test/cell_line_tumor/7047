There is increasing evidence for a fundamental role for zzso zzso of zzso pathways in zzso Changes in DNA zzso can be detected with a high degree of sensitivity, so we used the zzso zzso to determine how zzso patterns of zzso genes change during zzso zzso and whether DNA zzso could be detected in urine zzso 

We analyzed the zzso status of the zzso regions of 12 zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in 18 zzso cancer cell lines, zzso zzso cancer samples, and 37 samples of adjacent normal zzso zzso using the quantitative zzso zzso We also analyzed the zzso status in urine sediments of 20 zzso volunteers and 37 zzso cancer zzso 

The zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed significant increases in zzso levels when compared with zzso adjacent tissue zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso were significantly associated with tumor staging and grading zzso zzso or zzso zzso whereas zzso levels of zzso and zzso were only associated with tumor stage zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso of tumor grade zzso zzso or zzso zzso To investigate clinical usefulness for zzso zzso cancer zzso we further analyzed the zzso status of the markers in urine samples of patients with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in urine zzso DNA from zzso cancer patients was detected in the majority of samples zzso whereas they were zzso in the urine zzso DNA from zzso zzso zzso 

Our results indicate that zzso of the zzso region of zzso genes is a common finding in patients with zzso zzso The ability to detect zzso not only in zzso zzso but also in urine zzso suggests that zzso markers are promising tools for zzso detection of zzso zzso Our results also indicate that some zzso zzso such as those in regions of zzso and zzso might be of limited use for detection because they are also zzso in normal zzso zzso
