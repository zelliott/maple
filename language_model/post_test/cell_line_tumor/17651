A zzso form of the zzso zzso zzso called zzso zzso has been shown to reduce the spread of tumor cells in laboratory zzso However, some of these effects were controversial, probably due to the use of different tumor cell lines and varying sites of zzso In order to better understand these zzso we have used zzso zzso and performed a molecular analysis of its zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso cell line, we have shown that treatment of cells with this zzso caused a potent zzso effect resulting from the zzso of the key cell cycle regulators, the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was lost due to a twofold effect, the increased expression of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in combination with the reduced expression of zzso A, a regulatory zzso zzso that is essential for zzso zzso Taken together, our results provide a molecular basis for the zzso effects of the zzso zzso namely its differential effects on various parts of the cell cycle zzso
