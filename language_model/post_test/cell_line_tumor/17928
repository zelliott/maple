The zzso growth factor zzso zzso is zzso in many zzso zzso this zzso with zzso is important for imaging and therapy applications in nuclear zzso We investigated the in zzso and in zzso properties of a new high affinity zzso binding zzso zzso zzso when zzso with zzso and zzso with zzso The binding time patterns and retention studies were performed using cultured zzso zzso zzso cells that zzso zzso In the in zzso studies, female zzso zzso mice carrying zzso from zzso zzso cells were zzso The in zzso studies showed zzso specific zzso high zzso and good retention of zzso when delivered as zzso The retention after 72 h of incubation was zzso of the initial zzso The zzso study showed a zzso specific zzso zzso of zzso of injected dose per gram zzso tissue 4 h zzso The zzso to blood ratio was zzso and the zzso could easily be zzso with a gamma camera at this zzso zzso delivered with zzso gave an zzso specific zzso and the results indicated that the zzso zzso zzso is a candidate for zzso zzso zzso Potential therapy applications are zzso
