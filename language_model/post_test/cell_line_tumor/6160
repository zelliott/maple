zzso cells are critical for various allergic zzso zzso cells express zzso family zzso which relay positive and negative regulatory signals by zzso zzso for example, zzso zzso signaling events, but it also zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are reported to be positive regulators, but little is known about the roles of other zzso zzso including zzso in mast zzso In this study, we define the role of zzso zzso zzso associates with zzso and promotes zzso of zzso zzso zzso which include zzso for zzso of T cells, zzso and zzso and downstream targets such as zzso and the zzso in zzso mast zzso As a consequence, zzso positively regulates zzso production of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso appeared to act in concert, as zzso of zzso and zzso are enhanced by zzso of zzso and further zzso by zzso of zzso but are suppressed by zzso of zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso by small interfering zzso zzso further suppressed zzso in zzso bone zzso mast zzso zzso of zzso or zzso restored zzso of zzso and partially restored zzso in zzso zzso Additionally, zzso of zzso by zzso inhibited association of zzso with zzso as well as the zzso zzso of zzso Of note, the injection of zzso zzso diminished the protein level of zzso in mice and simultaneously inhibited zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso positively regulates mast cell through zzso of zzso These findings help clarify the interplay among zzso family zzso and identify zzso as a potential therapeutic target for allergic zzso
