Despite recent advances in cancer zzso cellular mechanisms controlling expression of zzso zzso are poorly zzso zzso in cancer cells, such as loss of zzso may increase expression of zzso zzso The authors investigated the relationship between zzso status and the expression of a zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso 

Human zzso cell lines with confirmed zzso status were examined by Northern zzso analysis and quantitative zzso chain zzso Western zzso analysis was used to measure zzso protein levels across multiple cell zzso 

The loss of zzso was shown to lead to increased levels of zzso protein but no change in transcript zzso Cell lines with serial zzso including zzso of Ras and zzso zzso also demonstrated increased levels of zzso zzso which decreased after treatment with zzso The zzso transcript zzso localized to the zzso compartment after zzso loss in zzso or zzso of zzso in human zzso 

zzso of zzso is controlled by the activated zzso pathway, which is a downstream effect of the loss of zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso may impact the regulation and expression of tumor specific zzso zzso of zzso status in zzso may be helpful in selecting patients for zzso trials in the zzso
