A novel zzso complex, linked to a zzso zzso (named zzso stabilized by zzso zzso for zzso therapy is zzso In order to zzso the degradation zzso typically observed for several zzso zzso agents, zzso is incorporated into a zzso zzso formed by zzso The resulting zzso contain up to zzso in zzso of the zzso complex, and are shown to be stable for several zzso The zzso host the zzso complex with the metal zzso surrounded by zzso zzso zzso and the steroid zzso inserted in the more external zzso chain zzso These zzso zzso are more effective in zzso the growth of cancer cells than a model zzso zzso complex, prepared for a direct evaluation of their zzso zzso These results introduce new perspectives in the design of innovative zzso zzso systems for zzso drug zzso
