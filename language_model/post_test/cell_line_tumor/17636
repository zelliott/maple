zzso necrosis zzso zzso inducing zzso zzso a member of the tumor necrosis factor zzso gene family, is considered as one of the most promising cancer therapeutic agents due to its ability to selectively kill tumor zzso Although zzso of solid tumors zzso zzso zzso and low zzso often affect the effectiveness of chemotherapy, few studies have been reported on the relationship between tumor zzso and zzso In this study, we investigated whether low zzso pH affects zzso zzso zzso When human prostate zzso zzso cells were treated with 200 zzso zzso TRAIL for 4 zzso the survival was approximately zzso at pH zzso and zzso at pH zzso Similar results were observed in human zzso zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso c release, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was promoted at low zzso zzso zzso followed by western zzso analysis shows that low zzso pH enhances the association of truncated Bid with zzso during treatment with zzso Western zzso analysis also shows that the low zzso zzso TRAIL zzso does not involve zzso of the levels of TRAIL receptors zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso effectively prevented low zzso zzso TRAIL zzso Taken together, we propose that zzso zzso is greatly enhanced in low pH environments by promoting zzso zzso
