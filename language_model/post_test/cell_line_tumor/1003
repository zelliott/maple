The zzso response element consensus sequence directs the zzso of a wide range of zzso A zzso zzso zzso response element decoy zzso zzso has been shown to compete with these sequences for binding zzso factors and therefore interferes with zzso gene zzso We have examined the effect of this zzso alone and in combination with a range of common zzso agents in zzso cancer cell zzso zzso had a potent zzso effect in zzso cell lines, yet, a similar enhancement of cell death was not zzso zzso zzso interaction studies showed that combining zzso with chemotherapy resulted in an enhancement of the zzso zzso Furthermore, this zzso effect was protracted and associated with an increase in zzso zzso activity at pH zzso There is a possible role for zzso in zzso this effect, as the enhancement of cell growth zzso was not observed in cells lacking the ability to correctly zzso this zzso Additionally, significant decreases in zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso 4 function were seen in the responsive zzso These data provide a possible model of drug interaction in zzso cell lines, which involves the complex interplay of the molecules regulating the cell zzso zzso the zzso ability of zzso could improve and enhance the zzso effects of conventional zzso zzso
