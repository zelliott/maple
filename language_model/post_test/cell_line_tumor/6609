Few in zzso models expressing complex zzso polarity are zzso We used the zzso rat zzso cell line to isolate the polarized zzso zzso These complex zzso hybrid cells form functional simple zzso zzso To obtain zzso polarized models with a simpler zzso content and developed zzso zzso we employed two zzso zzso success was achieved with zzso zzso As shown by the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso hybrid zzso cells were zzso They formed simple functional zzso zzso and zzso expressed the typical polarity of simple zzso zzso One zzso blocked in this polarity state was zzso A more robust approach was provided by zzso culture, a three-dimensional system that strengthens zzso zzso zzso zzso culture induced irreversible polarization of zzso zzso This induction occurred in most zzso zzso zzso of the zzso From populations enriched in zzso polarized cells, we generated new polarized cell models, designated zzso Can 3-1 cells formed simple functional zzso zzso when zzso at high zzso Regardless of zzso density, Can 9 and Can 10 cells formed long zzso zzso zzso competent for zzso transport of organic zzso and zzso zzso and involving several dozen adjacent zzso Thus, we have generated new cell models zzso expressing typical zzso zzso Among these models, Can 9 and Can 10 are the first capable of forming functional, highly developed zzso zzso similar to those formed in zzso
