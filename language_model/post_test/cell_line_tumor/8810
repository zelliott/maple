zzso evidence implicates the growth hormone zzso zzso in zzso While multiple studies show evidence for expression of growth hormone zzso and zzso zzso in human cancer zzso there is a lack of zzso and only a few cancer types have been zzso The National Cancer Institute's zzso panel includes 60 cancer cell lines from nine types of human zzso breast, zzso zzso zzso melanoma, zzso cell zzso zzso prostate and zzso We zzso this panel to zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with real-time zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso show a broad range of expression within and among most cancer zzso zzso zzso expression is nearly zzso higher in melanoma than in the panel as a zzso Analysis of human zzso melanoma zzso confirmed zzso gene expression in melanoma zzso In these human zzso the level of zzso zzso is elevated in advanced stage IV tumor samples compared to stage zzso Due to the novel finding of high zzso in melanoma, we examined the effect of zzso treatment on three zzso melanoma lines zzso zzso and zzso zzso increased proliferation in two out of three cell lines zzso Further analysis revealed zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in a cell line dependent zzso In conclusion, we have identified cell lines and cancer types that are ideal to study the role of zzso and zzso in cancer, yet have been largely zzso Furthermore, we found that human zzso melanoma tumors express zzso and cell lines possess active zzso that can zzso multiple signaling pathways and alter cell zzso Based on this data, zzso could be a new therapeutic target in zzso
