Most zzso target sites are determined by zzso pairing via the seed region zzso zzso of the mature zzso The binding sites of target zzso are zzso primarily as zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso This study analyzed zzso repression as a function of associations among various zzso zzso The target sequence of zzso from zzso was modified such that their various zzso and zzso could be inserted into the zzso of a reporter gene for monitoring repression activity of zzso zzso revealed that the level of repression could be ordered as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For zzso targets, the order is zzso Fold repression of zzso lay between zzso and zzso A mismatch in one seed dramatically decreasing repressive activity of the zzso This indicated that the degree of repression could be zzso enhanced through the cooperation of the two zzso zzso The zzso zzso carrying zzso zzso zzso higher repressive activity than zzso as they bound to the perfectly matched zzso However, strong repression of zzso and zzso with a perfectly matched target was due primarily to zzso zzso zzso of the target zzso was not a major cause of the observed zzso
