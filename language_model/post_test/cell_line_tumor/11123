To zzso the molecular mechanism of cell cycle arrest and zzso of zzso cells induced by zzso 

zzso zzso was used to determine the cell cycle changes of zzso cells upon zzso zzso Gene expression profiles of zzso cells induced by zzso were obtained by using zzso zzso containing zzso genes and expressed sequence tags zzso 

Cell cycle analysis showed that zzso of cells arrested at zzso phase and zzso of cells underwent zzso upon 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment for 24 hours; zzso zzso results revealed that 27 and 77 genes were zzso expressed upon zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment, zzso 

zzso stabilized zzso and caused zzso cell cycle arrest and zzso cell death in a zzso manner, which is associated with the regulation of selected genes related to zzso assembly and zzso cell cycle regulation, and DNA repair and zzso
