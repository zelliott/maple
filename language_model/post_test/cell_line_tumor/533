zzso zzso have been used to explore whether a zzso response to pancreatic zzso tumor zzso has utility as a zzso of pancreatic zzso To determine if such zzso can be used to identify novel zzso in the zzso from pancreatic cancer patients, proteins from a pancreatic zzso cell line zzso were resolved by zzso zzso zzso and then arrayed on zzso zzso The slides were zzso with serum from a set of patients diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and compared with zzso and zzso normal zzso To account for zzso zzso we used a zzso zzso statistical testing approach in which proteins zzso significant differences in the zzso response in cancer compared with control samples were zzso The prediction analysis for zzso zzso zzso was used to explore the zzso power of the proteins found to be zzso expressed in cancer and control zzso The zzso error of the zzso analysis was estimated using zzso zzso A serum diagnosis of pancreatic cancer in this set was predicted with zzso zzso with a sensitivity and specificity of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identified using this approach were studied for their zzso power by performing a zzso response experiment on zzso proteins using an independent sample set of zzso serum zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were noted to elicit a significant differential zzso response in cancer zzso compared with zzso and zzso zzso from normal patients and patients with chronic zzso and zzso This work demonstrates the use of natural protein zzso to study the zzso response as a means to search for the potential markers of cancer in zzso
