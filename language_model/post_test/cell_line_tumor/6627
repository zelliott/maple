Using tumor zzso zzso of zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso we investigated the contribution of tumor cell zzso to solid tumor growth and zzso progression in two tumor models differing in zzso zzso By lowering cellular zzso zzso levels, zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso drastically zzso solid tumor growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, whereas zzso melanoma solid tumor growth was zzso Yet, zzso zzso 4 zzso did markedly increase the sensitivity of zzso tumors to zzso zzso therapy and abolished the zzso lung colonizing capacity of zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso suppression of tumor cell zzso zzso zzso production zzso the induction of zzso expression by the tumor stress conditions zzso and zzso Thus, our results reflect a zzso positive feedback loop for zzso expression in tumor zzso This was further supported by the restoration of zzso induction capacity of zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor cells when cultured in the presence of zzso zzso Thus, although zzso expression and zzso production may be enabled by zzso from the tumor zzso our results demonstrate the zzso tumor cell origin of zzso zzso promoting solid tumor growth of zzso zzso tumors and zzso progression of strongly zzso zzso
