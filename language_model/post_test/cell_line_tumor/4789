zzso zzso composed of relevant B cell and T cell zzso capable of inducing protective immune response against the whole zzso are potentially safe, alternative vaccine zzso for prevention of wide range of zzso Here, we show that short peptides derived from internal image sequences of zzso zzso zzso can function as both B and T cell zzso and perpetuate zzso specific zzso zzso We have zzso the variable regions of heavy and light chains of the zzso zzso specific to zzso virus zzso protein and predicted T cell zzso in these sequences by an zzso zzso We have studied the interaction of these zzso with zzso class I by in zzso zzso and in zzso analysis by molecular modeling of the zzso complexes as well as zzso zzso zzso The functional capacity of zzso zzso derived peptides to stimulate zzso specific T cells in zzso was zzso The ability of zzso to zzso the immune zzso in zzso was 10 times more when compared with that of a control zzso taken from the constant region of zzso zzso three- to fivefold more amounts of zzso and zzso were zzso by immune zzso in response to in zzso zzso with zzso Further, we have provided evidence for the generation of zzso against zzso in memory response generated on zzso or zzso zzso zzso In zzso our experiments suggest that zzso are generated in the body after zzso zzso and may have important roles in zzso in regulating zzso specific zzso zzso
