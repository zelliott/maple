zzso zzso by genes of the zzso family are specifically expressed in tumors and are therefore relevant targets for cancer zzso One of the first identified family members, zzso is expressed in a large fraction of zzso zzso as a fusion protein together with the product of the zzso zzso In addition, the full-length zzso zzso is frequently expressed in tumors of several other zzso types such as zzso melanoma, zzso zzso zzso cancer and zzso To date, however, zzso specific T cell responses have not been investigated and no zzso derived T cell zzso have been zzso Here, we have assessed the presence of zzso T cells directed against the zzso zzso in circulating zzso of zzso zzso After a single in zzso stimulation with a pool of peptides spanning the entire zzso protein we could detect and isolate zzso zzso T cells from zzso donors zzso zzso zzso populations isolated from these cultures recognized peptides located in three distinct regions of the protein containing clusters of sequences with significant predicted binding to frequently expressed zzso class II zzso zzso of specific zzso zzso T cell populations derived from one donor allowed the identification of several naturally processed zzso recognized in association with zzso These data document the existence of a significant repertoire of zzso T cells specific for zzso derived sequences in circulating zzso of any individual that can be exploited for the development of both passive and active zzso approaches to control disease evolution in cancer zzso
