zzso zzso zzso is a synthetic zzso capable of inducing a zzso state in zzso in zzso and in cultured cells in zzso The effects of zzso seem to be due to its binding to zzso zzso however, it zzso the growth of zzso cells, devoid of zzso zzso We have investigated the effects of zzso on this cell line using transmission electron zzso zzso and zzso in order to zzso the general zzso by which this zzso affects cell zzso We demonstrated that, similar to cell lines provided with zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso structural modifications of zzso and nuclear constituents, as well as a decrease in zzso and zzso However, zzso does not provoke an increase in zzso or zzso cell zzso and, after removing the zzso from the culture zzso all effects zzso We also demonstrated that zzso molecules enter the zzso and the nucleus of zzso cells, mostly binding to zzso zzso and dense zzso zzso where zzso and early zzso of zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, our data demonstrate that the effect of zzso on zzso and on cultured cells does not depend on zzso zzso zzso can, therefore, be zzso as an extremely promising zzso to be used for inducing a zzso zzso state in various cultured cells, without provoking cell damage or zzso
