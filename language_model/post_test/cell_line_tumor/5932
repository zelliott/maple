zzso is a highly zzso genetic process leading to death in zzso zzso A critical step in zzso is zzso membrane zzso which results in the release of proteins critical to downstream zzso zzso protein zzso zzso was identified as a novel zzso of zzso using zzso functional zzso zzso is a novel zzso membrane protein containing a putative zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso loss of zzso membrane potential zzso the release of zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso but not the generation of zzso oxygen species, suggesting that zzso regulates zzso membrane potential in a zzso zzso As expected, zzso A, an inhibitor of membrane potential transition, inhibited zzso loss of zzso and zzso in zzso cells, indicating that loss of zzso plays a pivotal role in zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression using zzso significantly increased zzso and zzso loss in zzso and zzso zzso These findings show for the first time that zzso zzso zzso by blocking the zzso zzso transition and stabilizing zzso membrane zzso
