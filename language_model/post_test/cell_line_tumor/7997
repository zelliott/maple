zzso and zzso are rare zzso neuroendocrine tumors arising from the adrenal zzso and sympathetic zzso When complete surgical zzso is not an option, the treatment of zzso is zzso 

The objective of the study was to identify and characterize zzso of zzso zzso zzso gene expression in human and zzso tumors and verify zzso mouse zzso cell zzso zzso response to a selective zzso 

zzso of zzso was evaluated in a panel of 25 human zzso clinical samples by zzso and eight zzso tumors by indirect zzso zzso and zzso 

The function of zzso in these tumor cells was examined by evaluating tumor sensitivity to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso small and large zzso tumors in zzso nude mice zzso zzso 10) were treated zzso with zzso zzso m zzso 

zzso and tumor size were zzso 

zzso zzso was highly zzso to zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso in zzso Furthermore, zzso was highly zzso to zzso zzso Our results showed a statistically significant decrease in tumor size as early as 3 d after initial treatment and further suppressed growth of zzso zzso All tumors displayed a zzso evidence of necrosis in response to zzso zzso without any adverse effects in host at this zzso 

Human and zzso neuroendocrine zzso zzso the zzso chain, and an zzso zzso zzso approach may prove useful in treatment for zzso zzso zzso
