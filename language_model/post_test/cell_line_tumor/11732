The importance of zzso zzso such as DNA zzso zzso modification and zzso zzso in breast cancer is well zzso zzso zzso are zzso and much research has been focused on understanding these zzso with the aim of developing effective zzso zzso zzso factor zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso factors and has long been under investigation for its key role in tumor development and zzso To date, no studies have been conducted to zzso the zzso modifications of zzso in cancer zzso Using breast and prostate cancer cells, we investigated the effect of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso on the expression of zzso in these zzso The zzso of zzso observed was specific to breast cancer cells as experiments with prostate cells did not exhibit any significant zzso zzso the expression of zzso a zzso zzso zzso inhibitor 1 and also a target gene of zzso was found to be positively correlated with zzso expression following zzso zzso zzso of zzso led to a decrease in the proliferation rate of zzso cells as revealed by zzso proliferation zzso Other zzso zzso such as zzso modifications were not observed in these breast cancer cells following treatment with specific zzso zzso Our data suggest the possibility of zzso modification of zzso due to DNA zzso and involvement of the cell cycle inhibitor zzso Future studies on the zzso zzso of zzso in correlation with zzso or other targets may facilitate the development of effective therapies for the treatment of breast zzso
