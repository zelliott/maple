zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in breast cancer cells was shown to promote their zzso Recently, we demonstrated that aggressive breast zzso zzso express high levels of the zzso zzso which promotes their more invasive zzso via induction of the zzso zzso As these zzso are frequently resistant to therapy, here we tested the hypothesis that zzso promotes their zzso High zzso expressing zzso and zzso breast cancer cells were more resistant to zzso than zzso and zzso cells, which express lower zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso led to decreased survival in response to zzso while zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso cells protected these cells from zzso Similar data were obtained upon treatment of zzso or zzso cells with the zzso agent zzso High serum levels of zzso D are associated with decreased breast cancer risk and zzso although, the mechanisms of its protective actions have not been fully zzso Treatment of zzso and zzso zzso cells with zzso D3 decreased zzso gene expression and levels of zzso targets zzso zzso and zzso while increasing their sensitivity to zzso Thus, zzso which promotes survival and a more highly invasive zzso of breast cancer cells, is a target of zzso zzso providing one mechanism for the observed protective role of zzso D in patients with breast zzso
