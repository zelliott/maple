The involvement of zzso zzso in zzso tumor growth, and zzso makes it an attractive target for therapeutic zzso Here, we show that a continuous delivery of a low, but zzso level of the naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced inflammatory responses and inhibited tumor development in mice, phenomena that are induced by zzso mainly zzso zzso The zzso was delivered from zzso genetically engineered cells, which zzso and zzso this zzso For a tumor model, we used zzso cell line, which zzso high levels of zzso when injected zzso into mice, the cells developed into large tumors characterized by very active zzso zzso The zzso features of zzso were zzso at low levels of the zzso and release of 25 zzso per day of the zzso was needed to oppose its effects and inhibit tumor zzso The continuous delivery of the zzso contributed to improved zzso of the zzso cell zzso the zzso zzso surrounding the systems was much thinner with significantly less blood zzso and inflammatory zzso Not only do our findings point to the zzso properties of zzso in inflammation and tumor growth, but they also provide a more efficient and convenient way for treating diseases involving zzso
