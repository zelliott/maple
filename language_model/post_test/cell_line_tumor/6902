zzso zzso an zzso that zzso zzso zzso is zzso by the liver and transported in the blood zzso to zzso In humans and mice, low plasma levels of zzso have also been linked to the development of zzso We previously reported that zzso zzso expression was decreased when zzso mice were fed a zzso zzso diet supplemented with zzso acid zzso In the current study, we used zzso and zzso X zzso zzso zzso mice to demonstrate that this repression is dependent upon CA and zzso zzso zzso levels were also zzso when zzso cells, derived from a human zzso were incubated with natural or highly specific synthetic zzso zzso In contrast, zzso growth zzso zzso zzso levels were greatly induced by these same zzso zzso Furthermore, treatment of zzso cells with zzso human zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso Finally, deletion studies revealed that the zzso zzso to zzso zzso region of the zzso promoter contains regulatory zzso necessary for promoter activity and zzso acid zzso These data demonstrate that human zzso expression is zzso by zzso acids through the actions of zzso and zzso
