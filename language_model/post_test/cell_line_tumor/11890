In this work, we provide experimental arguments in favor of the fact that components from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso bind to zzso melanoma cells but not to zzso cells that derive from zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibit the adherence of zzso and zzso zzso to various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not inhibit the non specific adherence of zzso 39 cells to zzso In addition, binding of components from zzso zzso zzso to zzso cells is inhibited by zzso zzso and by zzso zzso zzso while these two components have no effect on the adherence of zzso to zzso zzso zzso
