Human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the initial zzso reaction in the metabolism of zzso and zzso to zzso and is, to date, the only zzso shown to metabolize vitamin zzso The objective of this study was to characterize this activity, particularly the influence of key features of zzso zzso zzso The influence of the number and positions of zzso groups on the zzso ring, and of zzso and zzso of the side chain, were explored using zzso cultures and zzso reaction zzso Human liver zzso and zzso selectively expressing zzso human zzso exhibited zzso activity patterns similar to those of zzso zzso Although activity was strongly associated with zzso zzso by cells or zzso substantial differences in specific activities between zzso remained under conditions of similar zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso at zzso of the zzso ring was associated with markedly low zzso zzso exhibited much higher zzso values than their zzso zzso Side chain zzso had no effect on zzso of zzso zzso by any zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso activity revealed zzso zzso for zzso but zzso zzso for other zzso especially zzso Additionally, zzso was a positive zzso of zzso of other zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso is a central feature underlying the different biological zzso and therefore zzso of the zzso and zzso
