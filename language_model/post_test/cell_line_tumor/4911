zzso growth factor zzso and its receptors zzso play important roles in zzso through stimulating tumor growth and promoting zzso via enhancing zzso recruitment and vessel zzso Here we produced a zzso zzso zzso directed against mouse zzso zzso binds to zzso with high affinity zzso and blocks zzso from binding to the zzso with an zzso of approximately zzso zzso The zzso also blocks zzso zzso of zzso and downstream signaling zzso including zzso and zzso zzso in tumor zzso In animal studies, zzso significantly enhanced the zzso and the zzso activities of zzso an zzso directed against mouse vascular zzso growth factor zzso 2, in a pancreatic zzso and a zzso cell lung zzso tumor zzso zzso Treatment with the combination of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso mice resulted in tumor zzso in zzso of mice compared to that in zzso of mice treated with zzso zzso Taken together, these results lend great support to use zzso zzso in combinations with other zzso and/or zzso agents in the treatment of a variety of zzso
