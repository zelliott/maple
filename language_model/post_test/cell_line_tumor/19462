To characterize the growth of human gastric cancer cells in collagen gel zzso and adhesive status of the cells in comparison with conventional zzso zzso Three kinds of human gastric cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso were cultured alone or zzso with normal human zzso in collagen gel zzso and their cell cycle, zzso function, and the expression of adhesive molecules zzso zzso and zzso were analyzed by flow zzso or other zzso Two of three cell lines zzso and zzso and their zzso showed zzso growth in collagen gel zzso and their growth and metabolism rate became slow and the cell zzso molecules zzso expression was down zzso zzso cancer cell alone or with zzso in collagen gel zzso showed distinct growth feature when compared with zzso cells, which represent two kinds of different experimental zzso zzso and zzso cells growing in zzso may recur some characteristics of their original solid tumor in zzso with the invasive or zzso zzso According to different zzso it should pay great care in choice of experimental model to get more reasonable zzso
