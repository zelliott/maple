To study the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso tissue and in different zzso cell lines, and to investigate its clinical and pathological zzso 144 zzso and benign zzso zzso zzso tissue sections were analyzed zzso with zzso zzso zzso The expression levels of zzso and zzso in prostate cell lines were detected through Western zzso The effects of zzso zzso on zzso cells and zzso nude mouse zzso was observed through cell growth curves, tumor growth curves, flow zzso zzso transmission electron zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gene was highly expressed in zzso zzso but not in zzso ones zzso p zzso zzso Furthermore, positive expression of zzso was zzso correlated with the zzso score zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso level zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso However, positive expression of zzso was not correlated with zzso tumor stages or the serum concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The expression of the zzso genes was low in the three zzso cell zzso zzso cells infected by zzso showed zzso of proliferation both in zzso and zzso To sum up, zzso may be involved in the zzso and progression of zzso Moreover, zzso zzso can suppress the proliferation of zzso cells significantly both in zzso and in zzso These results indicate that zzso may become a new target gene for zzso diagnosis and zzso
