zzso zzso is a zzso growth factor with diverse functions related to tumor growth, zzso and zzso zzso seems to have a significant role in prostate cancer cell growth and to mediate the zzso actions of other factors that affect prostate cancer cell zzso However, all studies carried out up to date are in zzso using different types of human prostate cancer cell zzso The aim of the present work was to study the role of zzso zzso in human prostate cancer growth in zzso For this purpose, human prostate cancer zzso cells were zzso zzso with a zzso zzso bearing the zzso zzso zzso in order to inhibit zzso expression zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso cells were measured in zzso In zzso zzso cells were zzso injected into male zzso mice, and tumor growth, survival rates, zzso zzso and the number of zzso were zzso zzso depletion resulted in a decreased migration capability of zzso cells compared with the corresponding zzso or the zzso zzso cells, as well as increased zzso and decreased zzso to zzso cells in zzso In prostate cancer zzso mouse zzso zzso depletion significantly suppressed tumor growth and zzso and induced zzso of cancer zzso In addition, zzso depletion decreased the number of zzso providing a survival benefit for the animals bearing zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso is implicated in human prostate cancer growth in zzso and could be considered a potential target for the development of new therapeutic approaches for prostate zzso
