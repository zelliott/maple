The development of support materials in mass zzso is an important task required for diagnostic markers in conjunction with zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso The zzso approach, which we introduced as zzso laser zzso zzso focuses not only on different zzso but also emphasizes the zzso zzso zzso or particle size of the carrier zzso As a result, it provides a quick and sensitive platform for effective binding of peptides and proteins out of different zzso zzso serum, spinal fluid, urine or cell zzso and to subsequently analyze them with zzso zzso This approach includes a built-in zzso step for serum protein profiling and is sensitive enough to detect proteins and peptides down to 100 zzso Here we zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso using zzso zzso to yield a zzso zzso for further zzso Different affinities have been created, such as immobilized metal zzso affinity zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The diverse zzso and the zzso of the particles created by different chemical synthetic approaches were confirmed by characteristic infrared zzso zzso The zzso carried out by zzso yielded an average pore radius of zzso zzso zzso that enhanced the binding capacity enormously by offering enlarged surface zzso Moreover, atomic zzso zzso zzso provided the metal content loaded on zzso acid zzso in the case of zzso To zzso the zzso zzso approach is sensitive in its performance, extremely fast and can be adapted to robotic systems for routine analysis, allowing sample preparation in less than 5 zzso in contrast to the conventional zzso laser zzso zzso zzso
