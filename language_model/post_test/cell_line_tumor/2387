zzso a clinical zzso factor, is significantly zzso in zzso level, while its protein expression is often decreased in sporadic breast zzso However, how zzso protein expressions are suppressed in these tumors remains zzso In this study, we demonstrated that zzso directly suppressed zzso zzso and translation, impaired zzso zzso zzso repair, reduced DNA zzso zzso nuclear zzso and rendered cells hypersensitive to zzso zzso ultimately inducing high zzso abnormalities in normal breast cells and breast cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso in breast cancer cells enhanced zzso levels and induced resistance to zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso expression via direct binding to the zzso promoter, which led to zzso of zzso and reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso levels in primary breast tumors correlated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso These findings uncover a zzso regulatory and signaling zzso in sporadic breast cancer and support a functionally and clinically relevant zzso mechanism in cancer zzso
