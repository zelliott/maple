zzso acid zzso has extensive effects on zzso blasts through its zzso of zzso zzso The main goal of this study was to identify the zzso of patients who may benefit most from zzso zzso We examined the significance of zzso zzso aberration for zzso treatment response among acute zzso leukemia zzso patients by direct comparison of zzso zzso positive zzso zzso as well as bone zzso blasts from zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso is supposed to be induced via zzso recruitment of zzso zzso zzso cell lines of different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and diagnostic bone zzso samples from patients were treated with zzso zzso induced zzso in zzso and zzso cells in a zzso zzso zzso as indicated by changes in zzso was observed only in zzso zzso zzso increased the expression of zzso target genes - zzso zzso zzso and zzso only in zzso zzso This zzso effect was confirmed also using patient blasts isolated at the time of zzso zzso leukemia shows specific mechanism of zzso residing from differentiation followed by zzso that is accompanied by an increase in the expression of zzso zzso target zzso Our data suggest that zzso patients might derive the greatest benefit from zzso zzso
