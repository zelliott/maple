A large proportion of breast zzso expresses the zzso zzso alpha zzso and are dependent on zzso for their proliferation and zzso The tumor zzso zzso encodes the zzso zzso an important zzso of the zzso and zzso effects of several treatments used for breast zzso A significant proportions of breast tumors zzso carry zzso in zzso gene and these zzso are associated with poor survival and poor response to several types of zzso zzso While there is mounting evidence for functional interactions between zzso and zzso pathways in breast and other zzso the impact of these interactions on response to chemotherapy and zzso treatments remain largely zzso Here, using zzso breast cancer cell lines with different zzso status, we show that zzso through zzso influence zzso protein levels and zzso zzso deprivation reduced, while zzso increased zzso levels, in a time and zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso expressed zzso zzso proteins were zzso This reduction in zzso protein levels resulted in reduced zzso responses induced by DNA damage in zzso zzso cells, lowering the capacity of zzso to induce zzso The zzso response appeared to be zzso but not zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso activity is required for a strong zzso response in zzso breast cancer zzso These results are in line with previous observations that we made in a clinical series, where a larger effect of zzso zzso status was found for patient survival in cases with zzso zzso positive status, a marker of a functional zzso zzso It would thus be important to further characterize the influence of zzso zzso on the zzso value of zzso zzso status in specifically designed clinical trials, as it may open perspectives for improving breast cancer zzso
