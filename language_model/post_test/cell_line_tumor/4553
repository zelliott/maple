Drugs that inhibit growth of zzso and their blood supply could have considerable therapeutic zzso zzso zzso has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of zzso zzso breast cancer cells and zzso in zzso zzso and its zzso zzso were investigated for their ability to inhibit in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The mouse zzso plug zzso for zzso was used to investigate the effect of compounds on zzso and was zzso using a zzso injection zzso zzso mice bearing zzso derived from zzso cells were used to assess efficacy on zzso zzso zzso sections were stained for zzso and zzso to assess zzso zzso and cell proliferation zzso zzso plugs supplemented with basic zzso growth factor resulted in increased zzso over 7 zzso zzso administration of zzso for 7 days at 10 or 50 zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso to or below control levels zzso zzso at 20 zzso zzso was equally zzso zzso zzso daily for 21 days, caused a zzso reduction in zzso growth at 5 zzso zzso and 38% zzso at 20 zzso zzso zzso (20 zzso zzso reduced zzso growth by zzso zzso revealed a reduction in zzso and zzso zzso plug and zzso imaging after zzso injection indicated that zzso caused a marked disruption of zzso These zzso zzso derivatives have been shown to be potent zzso of zzso in zzso This, together with their ability to inhibit zzso growth, indicates the potential of this new class of drugs for further development for cancer zzso
