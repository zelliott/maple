In a screening program for new zzso from zzso zzso the zzso zzso signal zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso designated as zzso was isolated from zzso of the imperfect fungus zzso zzso The structure was determined by a combination of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso induced expression of the reporter gene zzso alkaline zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells with zzso values of zzso zzso zzso zzso Studies on the mode of action of the compound revealed that the zzso of the zzso dependent signaling zzso is caused by blocking the binding of the activated zzso zzso factors to the DNA binding site without zzso zzso zzso The compound has no zzso or zzso zzso
