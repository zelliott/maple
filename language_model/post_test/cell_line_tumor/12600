The aim of this paper is to report the study on gene zzso efficiency of zzso targeted against mouse zzso zzso in zzso zzso by zzso zzso and its zzso effect in zzso zzso zzso was compounded into zzso and zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to image the zzso distribution of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso were used to evaluate zzso gene zzso induced by zzso zzso A zzso nude mice model was established to compare the zzso effect after delivered by local and systemic zzso zzso zzso cells exhibited much zzso in zzso with no evidence of nuclear zzso The expression levels of zzso zzso and protein in zzso cells were significantly zzso compared with that in blank group, the zzso efficiency were zzso and zzso zzso The tumor sizes in mice zzso injected with zzso complexes zzso zzso zzso zzso were reduced definitely compared to that in mice injected with zzso complexes via vein route zzso zzso zzso zzso or to saline groups zzso zzso zzso zzso The study demonstrated that zzso could effectively zzso zzso into cells and silence the zzso gene zzso zzso delivery is more suitable for zzso modified zzso complexes to inhibit the tumor growth in zzso The present data lay a solid foundation to further study on the gene zzso mechanism for zzso zzso and its zzso efficiency in zzso
