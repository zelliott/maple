The purpose of this research was to evaluate the effects of targeted zzso delivery of the zzso chain fatty acid zzso acid zzso on the zzso zzso cell zzso in zzso An intramuscular zzso zzso cell zzso was induced at a single site in the right thigh of 39 New Zealand white zzso zzso 10 days after zzso a zzso zzso was introduced into the right common carotid artery and positioned using zzso guidance in the right deep zzso artery, which was the zzso if not zzso artery zzso the zzso zzso alone zzso zzso zzso containing zzso or zzso containing zzso acid was then injected through the zzso zzso growth and zzso were evaluated zzso days after zzso zzso activity was evaluated 2 days after therapy, and tumor zzso were zzso for zzso zzso 2 and 7 days after treatment to assess the effects of the zzso chain fatty acid on the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso delivery of zzso resulted in zzso growth zzso of intramuscular rabbit zzso tumors while zzso acid, a saturated fatty acid of the same carbon length as zzso was found to stimulate tumor zzso Two and 7 days following treatment, tumors treated with zzso showed a significant decrease in zzso acid zzso and a zzso increase in zzso levels while tumors treated with zzso acid exhibited a significant increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso Western zzso as well as zzso analysis showed that zzso and zzso proteins were present in the zzso zzso No zzso in zzso cell zzso or zzso activity were evident on microscopic examination following zzso These studies suggest that targeted zzso delivery of zzso chain fatty acids such as zzso may be considered as a potential new therapy for treatment of solid zzso The exact zzso responsible for the observed zzso of zzso tumor growth by zzso is zzso Additional in zzso studies are warranted to zzso zzso mechanism of action and further investigate the zzso chain fatty zzso zzso zzso
