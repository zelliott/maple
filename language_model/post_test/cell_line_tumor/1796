Currently, there is high interest in developing zzso zzso platforms for cancer monitoring and zzso zzso we report zzso zzso zzso iron oxide zzso zzso as a promising system for targeted imaging and drug zzso When incubated with cancer cells, zzso were rapidly taken up and the zzso of zzso by cancer cells was much higher than the zzso without zzso zzso The high magnetic zzso of zzso coupled with enhanced zzso enabled magnetic resonance imaging of cancer zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was attached onto the zzso through an acid responsive zzso While zzso was not toxic to cells, zzso was much more potent than free zzso to kill not only zzso but also zzso cancer zzso This was attributed to differential zzso mechanisms and cellular zzso of free zzso and zzso in cancer zzso
