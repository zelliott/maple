zzso zzso exhibits zzso effects on various cancer cell types, but its use in chemotherapy is limited by its zzso zzso We investigated the zzso activities of other plant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso acid, and assessed whether there is any advantage in using zzso extracts zzso in either zzso or zzso over pure zzso zzso obtained in a panel of tumor cell lines clearly indicate that, of the five natural compounds tested, zzso is the most potent inhibitor of cancer cell growth zzso between zzso and zzso zzso with significantly lower potency in zzso zzso The zzso extract was zzso to zzso whereas zzso and zzso followed in the rank of zzso Both zzso and the zzso extract inhibited the growth of zzso tumors obtained by zzso injection into zzso mice of human zzso breast zzso or rat zzso zzso zzso cells and reduced lung zzso zzso from zzso injection of zzso zzso Judging from several experiments on its possible cellular and molecular mechanisms of action, we propose that zzso lacks a unique mode of action in the cell lines zzso At least for zzso cells, however, our experiments indicate that zzso effect is due to its capability of inducing zzso zzso direct or indirect zzso of zzso zzso and zzso transient zzso potential zzso zzso receptors and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso oxygen zzso Our data support the further testing of zzso and zzso extracts for the potential treatment of zzso
