zzso are zzso active zzso formed by invasive zzso cells when grown on an zzso zzso zzso zzso Although many molecular components have been zzso less is known of the formation and regulation of zzso The zzso protein zzso which is involved in the regulation of zzso zzso is one such zzso but how zzso is modulated to control the formation of zzso has not been zzso Here, a new zzso synchronization protocol is used to show that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso involved in zzso complex and zzso binding and zzso respectively, are both required for zzso zzso In addition, through a combination of zzso interference and a wide array of zzso zzso zzso we were able to show that three zzso regulatory zzso based on the regulation of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso are necessary for zzso formation and zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso is a scaffold protein bringing together the different components necessary for the formation of the zzso and that a fine balance between different zzso events zzso subtle changes in structure to zzso zzso zzso
