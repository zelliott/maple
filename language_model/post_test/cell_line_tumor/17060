zzso is a member of a structurally zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso A computer-based analysis of the zzso locus revealed that it harbors two alternative open reading frames promoted by two zzso promoter zzso Using Northern zzso analysis and reverse zzso chain reaction followed by sequencing and alignment of the products, we confirmed the existence of two zzso that were transcribed from this zzso zzso Western zzso analysis indicated that these transcripts were zzso zzso zzso analysis of both transcripts revealed that zzso 2 exists in only one of the zzso zzso designated zzso and has the consensus elements of the zzso zzso domain zzso We found that the translation from the zzso transcript starts 46 zzso upstream from the zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the existence of three zzso transcripts was zzso These transcripts differ only in their zzso untranslated regions zzso Unlike zzso the other zzso zzso is devoid of any known zzso Analysis of the predicted zzso protein revealed the presence of the zzso zzso signature I, the zzso zzso and the zzso alcohol zzso zzso These motifs might zzso on this protein the ability to sense changes in the cellular zzso From these and previous results, we speculate that zzso may function as a negative regulator of zzso
