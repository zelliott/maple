zzso zzso in plants are widely used for prevention and treatment of zzso zzso We previously isolated a new zzso acid zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso leaves for use as a potent zzso zzso Crude extracts from leaves also suppressed allergic conjunctivitis in zzso In this study, we evaluated the in zzso effect of zzso using a pure sample and performed in zzso experiments to zzso the mechanism underlying the extraordinary high potency of zzso and its zzso The zzso values for zzso of rat zzso leukemia cells zzso were 14 zzso for zzso and 3 zzso for zzso indicating that the two compounds were approximately 2 to 3 orders of magnitude more potent than the zzso drugs zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 3, and zzso zzso zzso zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso was significantly inhibited by zzso and zzso at all zzso tested ( zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in the principle signaling pathway, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were inhibited by zzso and zzso In DNA zzso test, zzso inhibited expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso signaling factors, and zzso 2, indicating that zzso broadly zzso allergic zzso During passive zzso zzso in mice, zzso significantly inhibited vascular zzso by two administration zzso a single zzso injection at 10 zzso and per zzso at 5 zzso for 7 days ( zzso These results suggest the potential for zzso to alleviate symptoms of zzso zzso
