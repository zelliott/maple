The high expression of folate zzso zzso on cancer cells might be a potential target for cancer zzso In this study, the zzso expression and the zzso effect of zzso zzso acid zzso in a number of cancer cell lines were zzso The gateway of zzso activity on zzso expression was further studied by a panel of zzso zzso and zzso The results revealed that zzso was capable of zzso the expression of zzso protein in zzso cells in a zzso manner, not in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells was higher when zzso was present in culture medium at zzso zzso for 5 days, and it went down to baseline when zzso was removed from the zzso vice zzso The zzso of zzso expression in zzso cells by zzso was not associated with cell proliferation and zzso In addition, zzso of zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso also induced zzso zzso The induction of zzso expression by zzso could be inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso X zzso zzso zzso zzso could not induce zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso within a certain range of concentration could zzso induce the expression of zzso in a zzso and cell zzso manner, and its action in zzso cells might be associated with the signal zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso rather than zzso and zzso
