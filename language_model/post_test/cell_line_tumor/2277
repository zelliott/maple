zzso survival effects have been ascribed to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso are associated with various zzso In human cells, a single zzso transcript gives rise mainly to two protein zzso zzso 41 zzso that share an identical zzso site but differ at their zzso due to zzso alternative translation initiation zzso In this study we observed that the 34 zzso zzso zzso has differential nuclear and zzso forms in all tested cell lines, suggesting a possible role for the balance between these forms for zzso zzso To further study the cellular role of the 34 zzso zzso of zzso an zzso zzso form of this zzso was zzso expressed in zzso zzso Surprisingly, this resulted in increased level of zzso arrested cells, as well as of zzso zzso These effects could not be obtained by a zzso form of the 41 zzso zzso The zzso arrest and zzso effects were associated with an increase in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso as well as with zzso of zzso zzso and zzso No such effects were obtained upon zzso of a zzso form of the zzso 34 zzso zzso By either using a dominant negative form of zzso or by zzso the 34 zzso zzso in zzso cells, we demonstrated that these effects were zzso These results demonstrate that while zzso can function as a potent survival factor, it can, under certain circumstances, exhibit zzso effects as zzso
