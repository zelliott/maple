zzso zzso zzso topography zzso zzso is insufficiently sensitive at detecting small or zzso breast zzso The characterization of zzso receptors zzso in tumors and the development of zzso PET for imaging could be of zzso The aim of this study was to validate an animal model expressing zzso and to correlate the zzso zzso analysis with zzso and zzso zzso in zzso 

Ten nude mice were zzso with the zzso breast tumor cell zzso Imaging was performed with zzso and zzso and correlated to zzso analysis of zzso 

zzso analyses showed that the tumors expressed zzso On PET imaging, the tumors were barely visible with zzso whereas with zzso specific zzso higher zzso was observed ( zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso PET could be used for detection of breast tumors not detected with zzso zzso status should be assessed to allow for individual zzso
