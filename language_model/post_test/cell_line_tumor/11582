Gene regulation of many key zzso players in zzso zzso phase, and zzso results from zzso repression in their respective promoter regions during the zzso and zzso zzso of cell zzso Within these promoter regions are zzso zzso sequences known as the zzso element zzso and zzso genes zzso regions zzso zzso Thus, we zzso that zzso regulation of zzso regulation via the zzso region together with zzso zzso E zzso promoter could bring about a selective zzso expression in zzso human zzso zzso We show that the newly generated zzso zzso could mediate zzso zzso gene expression in tumor cells and freshly isolated short-term zzso zzso cultures from patient zzso In contrast, normal zzso and human zzso infected with zzso expressed minimal or low zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso effectively suppressed the growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mouse model via the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso that converts zzso to zzso zzso zzso More importantly, we show that combination treatment of zzso with an zzso zzso zzso that targets zzso zzso zzso can bring about a greater therapeutic efficacy compared with a single treatment of virus or zzso Our study showed that targeting zzso human zzso zzso cells through the zzso control of therapeutic gene could represent a feasible approach against zzso zzso
