zzso drugs kill cancer cells mainly by direct zzso but they might also induce a stronger host immune response by causing the tumor to produce zzso cell surface molecules like zzso We previously reported that in zzso zzso cells, zzso induced zzso zzso In this study, we show that zzso zzso zzso even at low doses, induced zzso expression in zzso in mouse zzso zzso cells, by a mechanism that involved zzso oxygen zzso In zzso experiments in the mouse zzso zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso model showed that injection of zzso induced expression of zzso and zzso and decreased expression of zzso indicating that chemotherapy can modify zzso zzso expression in zzso in a way not necessarily observed in zzso Mouse zzso cells exposed in zzso to zzso were more susceptible to specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also induced zzso or zzso expression in 14 of 21 primary cultured human zzso zzso In humans being treated for zzso induction chemotherapy increased zzso expression in the zzso zzso These findings indicate possible synergistic strategies between zzso zzso and chemotherapy for zzso They also suggest an additional mechanism by which chemotherapy can eradicate zzso zzso
