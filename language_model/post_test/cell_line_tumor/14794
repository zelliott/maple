The National Cancer Institute zzso has established the zzso zzso Testing Program zzso for testing drugs against in zzso and in zzso childhood cancer models to aid in the zzso of drugs considered for early phase pediatric clinical zzso 

In zzso zzso testing employs a zzso zzso digital imaging zzso zzso zzso that has a zzso dynamic range of zzso zzso fitting of the fractional survival data of the cell lines in response to various zzso of the agents was used to calculate relative zzso , absolute zzso , and zzso zzso The panel of 23 pediatric cancer cell lines included leukemia zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso brain tumors zzso zzso zzso Ewing family of tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The doubling times obtained using zzso were incorporated into data analyses to estimate the relationship between input cell numbers and final cell zzso 

We report in zzso activity data for three drugs zzso zzso and zzso that are commonly used for pediatric cancer and for the zzso inhibitor zzso an agent that is currently under zzso investigation for zzso To date, the zzso has completed in zzso testing of 39 zzso and approved agents for single drug activity and two zzso agents in combination with various zzso chemotherapy zzso 

This robust in zzso zzso testing system for pediatric zzso will enable comparisons to response data for novel agents obtained from zzso studies and from clinical zzso
