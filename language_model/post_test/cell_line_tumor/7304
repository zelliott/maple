The conversion into zzso folded prion protein zzso plays a key role in prion zzso zzso carries two zzso zzso chains at zzso acid zzso 180 and 196 zzso Previous in zzso data indicated that the conversion process may not require zzso of zzso However, it is conceivable that these zzso function as zzso binding sites during the de zzso infection of cells on susceptible organisms and/or play a role for the interaction of both zzso zzso Such zzso properties could contribute to the formation of specific prion zzso However, in earlier studies, zzso at the zzso sites of zzso led to zzso trafficking zzso which made it impossible to generate zzso zzso mice that were susceptible to bovine zzso zzso zzso or zzso We have now tested more than 25 different zzso at both consensus sites and found one zzso zzso and two zzso zzso and zzso zzso that rather retained authentic cellular trafficking zzso In zzso all three zzso were converted into zzso zzso zzso zzso also provoked a strong zzso zzso on the zzso wild type zzso conversion zzso By using the two zzso zzso we generated transgenic mice zzso zzso in their brains at levels of 2-4 times that of zzso zzso Most interestingly, such mice proved readily susceptible to a challenge with either zzso zzso and zzso or with zzso zzso times were comparable or in some instances even significantly shorter than those of zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso of zzso is not mandatory for prion infection in zzso
