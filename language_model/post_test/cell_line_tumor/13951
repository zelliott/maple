zzso zzso zzso infection is associated with the development of gastric zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and gastric zzso In humans, zzso is found almost exclusively in the zzso zzso of the gastric zzso and rarely zzso the deeper portions where zzso cells of the zzso produce zzso with terminal zzso zzso This structure exerts zzso activity against zzso The development of IM in the stomach is characterized by zzso clearance from the zzso zzso and by major zzso in the expression of zzso and zzso The present work evaluated whether terminal zzso and zzso zzso are implicated in the process of zzso clearance from zzso zzso by analyzing the expression of these zzso in different types of zzso zzso and incomplete zzso in gastric cell zzso Terminal zzso was not detected in IM except in a single zzso of one case, indicating that this structure is not implicated in the clearance of zzso from zzso in contrast to what is observed in normal gastric zzso None of the gastric zzso cell lines studied showed terminal zzso suggesting that they do not display a gastric zzso zzso cell zzso and therefore are useful models for in zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and is present in all cases of complete and incomplete zzso suggesting that either or both can be implicated in zzso clearance from zzso
