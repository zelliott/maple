The zzso protein zzso associates with multiple zzso activities, including stabilization of zzso tumor zzso and has been tested through gene therapy approaches in clinical zzso To identify potential zzso proteins involved in zzso zzso activities, we screened a zzso zzso library and identified zzso an zzso zzso zzso as a novel zzso zzso The zzso region of zzso and the zzso domain of zzso were required for the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso rather than zzso and formed a complex with zzso in the presence of zzso resulting in the stabilization of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso failed to stabilize zzso in the absence of zzso showing that zzso was required for zzso stabilization by zzso Moreover, zzso stabilization of zzso occurred in zzso Although it had no effect on the zzso interaction, zzso facilitated zzso binding to zzso and inhibited zzso binding to zzso resulting in decreased nuclear zzso of zzso Thus, our findings highlighted a novel zzso zzso zzso stabilized the zzso tumor zzso through zzso
