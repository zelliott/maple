zzso specific zzso produced only by zzso undergo a unique maturation process that involves their transition form zzso rounded zzso to zzso zzso zzso during which they move from the zzso to the zzso areas of the zzso This depends upon the trafficking and processing of zzso (also known as zzso and the silver zzso a protein of great interest, because it elicits immune responses in melanoma patients but in which specific zzso remains zzso In this study, we have used zzso and zzso approaches to more critically assess the zzso processing, zzso and trafficking of zzso We now report that zzso is processed and sorted in a manner distinct from other zzso proteins (such as zzso zzso and zzso and is predominantly delivered directly to immature zzso following its rapid processing in the zzso zzso and zzso Following its zzso zzso is zzso at the zzso and at the zzso zzso in a series of specific steps that result in the reorganization of immature zzso to the zzso mature zzso Once this structural reorganization occurs, zzso zzso begin to be targeted to the zzso which are then competent to zzso zzso zzso
