The zzso zzso is zzso in several human zzso but the underlying mechanism remains largely zzso Here, we report that zzso is commonly zzso in zzso zzso zzso specimens and zzso cell zzso The zzso expression of zzso dramatically suppressed cell proliferation and colony formation in zzso and inhibited zzso in zzso Moreover, we identified the zzso D1 zzso gene as a novel direct target of zzso In consistent with the zzso expression of zzso zzso of zzso inhibited cell growth and cell cycle progression in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso was widely zzso in zzso tumors, and its zzso levels were zzso correlated with zzso zzso Taken together, our findings suggest that zzso might be a tumor zzso in zzso which is exerted partially by zzso zzso zzso The identification of functional zzso in zzso and its direct link to zzso might provide good candidates for developing diagnostic markers and therapeutic applications for zzso
