zzso zzso a naturally occurring zzso is an attractive agent because of its potent zzso zzso zzso suppresses the proliferation of various cancer cells in zzso and in zzso zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso is also one of the most promising candidates for cancer zzso zzso to its ability to selectively induce zzso in tumor zzso In this study, we report that zzso enhances zzso zzso in human zzso cells, zzso and zzso The zzso induced by zzso with zzso and TRAIL was markedly blocked by a dominant negative form of the TRAIL zzso or zzso zzso The combined use of zzso and TRAIL effectively induced Bid zzso and the zzso of zzso 8, 10, 9 and 3 at ineffective zzso for each zzso zzso zzso the expression of death zzso 5 zzso a zzso for zzso at zzso and protein levels in a zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso to TRAIL was reduced by zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso was at least partially zzso through the induction of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso neither induced zzso protein expression or enhanced zzso zzso in normal human peripheral blood zzso zzso Thus, combined treatment with zzso and TRAIL might be a promising therapy for zzso
