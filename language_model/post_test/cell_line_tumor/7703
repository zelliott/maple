The screening of zzso compounds from zzso zzso is a promising way to meet the increasing threat of drug-resistant strains of human zzso In the present study, a novel zzso fungus was isolated from the leaves of zzso zzso Crude zzso extracts were obtained through zzso zzso The zzso extracts exhibited an effective zzso activity against bacterial zzso This study reports the zzso activity of the secondary zzso produced by the fungus against zzso 2 zzso zzso cell line by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso investigation of the secondary zzso revealed the active components of the zzso zzso The DNA of the fungus was zzso by amplifying the ITS region of the zzso zzso to be submitted in the zzso and an zzso number was assigned confirming it to be a new zzso
