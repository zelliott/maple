zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides zzso are able to kill zzso and cancer cells, leading to their consideration as novel candidate therapeutic agents in human zzso zzso can physically associate with zzso membrane structures, such as those found on cancer cells, causing pore formation, zzso zzso and leakage of cell zzso In contrast, normal cells are less zzso and are typically not susceptible to zzso cell zzso Because the interaction of zzso with cells is based on charge properties rather than cell zzso both rapidly dividing and zzso cancer cells, as well as zzso cancer cells, are targeted by zzso making zzso potentially valuable as zzso zzso zzso often exist as families of peptides with slightly different zzso acid zzso In addition, libraries of synthetic zzso zzso based on naturally occurring zzso templates can be generated in order to improve upon their zzso zzso screens are needed to quickly and efficiently assess the suitability of each zzso zzso Here we present the methods for assessing zzso zzso against cancer cells zzso and zzso and zzso cells zzso using the zzso zzso or zzso zzso and for discriminating between cell death caused by necrosis zzso using zzso zzso or zzso zzso or zzso and necrosis zzso DNA content measured by flow zzso In addition the zzso zzso which zzso the ability of single transformed cells to multiply and produce zzso is zzso
