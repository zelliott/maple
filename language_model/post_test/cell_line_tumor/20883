The human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene encodes the zzso zzso that functions in the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso to zzso by zzso is essential for the use of zzso bodies as an energy zzso The zzso capacity of zzso is zzso to their level of zzso zzso zzso zzso the site of zzso body zzso have no zzso zzso zzso The absence of zzso in zzso is an important element in energy zzso suppressing zzso in the zzso To study the zzso zzso of zzso zzso we analyzed the promoter function of zzso gene in three different human cell zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso protein was zzso in zzso cervical cancer cells and Chang liver zzso However, zzso protein was not detected in zzso zzso cells and liver zzso indicating that zzso zzso cells maintain the characteristics of liver cells in the zzso body zzso zzso reporter zzso in zzso and Chang liver cells showed that the zzso zzso region of the zzso gene was responsible for the zzso promoter activity and contained two zzso boxes, each of which was bound in zzso by zzso a zzso expressed zzso zzso These results suggest that these zzso boxes may be important for zzso gene zzso Moreover, the region between zzso and zzso appeared to inhibit the zzso promoter activity in zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso of the zzso gene expression may be zzso in part by its zzso zzso
