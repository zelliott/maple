To investigate the effects of zzso zzso extracts zzso serum on the expressions of zzso proteins including zzso zzso and zzso in zzso gastric zzso 

The zzso zzso transformed zzso human gastric zzso zzso zzso cell line (MC zzso was used in zzso as a model of gastric zzso zzso The zzso canine serum was prepared by feeding to the adult zzso dog with zzso zzso extracts and obtaining the serum after zzso zzso zzso cells were cultured with zzso canine serum zzso serum zzso or zzso canine serum zzso control zzso for 72 zzso Expressions of zzso zzso and zzso proteins were detected by zzso zzso and the average optical density of the cells was determined by an image analysis zzso 

Compared with those of the normal control group, zzso and zzso expressions in zzso serum group were significantly enhanced ( zzso while the expression of zzso was significantly reduced ( zzso 

zzso zzso extracts may inhibit the proliferation and promote the zzso of zzso gastric cells through altering expressions of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso
