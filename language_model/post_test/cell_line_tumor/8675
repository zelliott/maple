Because of the complexity derived from the existence of various zzso zzso zzso zzso and their differential roles in zzso development of zzso zzso with differential zzso and zzso profiles would allow best exploration in different zzso combinations, and dosing zzso Here, we report BAY zzso a highly selective and potent zzso I zzso inhibitor with zzso zzso against zzso and zzso BAY zzso exhibited preferential zzso (about zzso of zzso zzso by zzso compared with zzso in zzso BAY zzso showed superior zzso activity zzso in zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso as compared with zzso and zzso zzso breast cancer cell zzso In addition, BAY zzso revealed potent activity to induce zzso in a subset of tumor cells with zzso zzso of zzso as a single zzso In zzso single intravenous administration of BAY zzso exhibited higher exposure and prolonged zzso of zzso levels in tumors versus zzso BAY zzso is zzso in tumors with activated zzso when zzso either continuously or zzso Thus, BAY zzso induced zzso complete tumor zzso when zzso as a single agent every second day in rats bearing zzso and zzso zzso breast zzso In combination with zzso weekly dosing of BAY zzso is sufficient to reach sustained response in all animals bearing zzso zzso cell lung cancer zzso despite a short plasma elimination zzso (1 zzso in zzso Thus, BAY zzso is a promising agent with differential zzso and zzso properties for the treatment of zzso human zzso
