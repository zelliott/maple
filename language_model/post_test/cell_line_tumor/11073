zzso zzso cells were derived from the human zzso cancer zzso cell line by exposing the cells to increasing concentration of zzso for eight months, starting from a concentration of 10 zzso to a final concentration of 4 zzso zzso cell line possesses five fold relative resistance to zzso zzso resistant cell line shows the typical zzso zzso zzso increased expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso to drugs like zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the novel zzso drug zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso restored the sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso by increasing the drug zzso zzso The resistance to zzso was not due to the other zzso such as zzso and zzso being expressed at the same level in resistant and parental cell zzso The finding that cells zzso zzso are resistant to zzso was confirmed in zzso 100 cells, that was found to be zzso resistant to zzso compared to the zzso parental cell zzso
