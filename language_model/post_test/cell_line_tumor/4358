zzso zzso is an integral part of the zzso and is zzso in a variety of human zzso making it an attractive molecular target for the design of novel zzso zzso A highly potent zzso compound targeting zzso zzso was identified and is characterized in this study to determine its potential as an zzso agent for clinical zzso 

The in zzso zzso cancer cell zzso zzso activity, and markers for response of zzso were evaluated with cell zzso zzso of action was confirmed with western zzso and zzso zzso The in zzso potency of zzso was evaluated in three zzso models in zzso zzso toxicity was evaluated in zzso zzso to the target was tested with a zzso zzso zzso safety was evaluated with zzso zzso Clinical correlation was performed with human gene zzso 

zzso showed strong potency across a broad spectrum of tumor zzso zzso disrupted zzso protein interaction, led to zzso degradation, induced significant zzso zzso in zzso and induced zzso cell zzso zzso was effective orally in in zzso animal models of triple negative breast cancer, colon cancer and liver zzso zzso toxicity shows no effect on the body zzso organ zzso and blood zzso at zzso zzso zzso shows high specificity to cancer cells and to target and had no effect on the cardiac channel zzso zzso is synergistic with zzso zzso and zzso in zzso breast and liver cancer zzso zzso to zzso was associated with the status of RB and zzso zzso zzso of RB and zzso in cancer cells increased sensitivity to zzso zzso molecular zzso of human lung cancer were zzso 

The excellent zzso safety and synergistic profiles of this potent zzso zzso small zzso zzso show its potential for clinically utility in zzso treatment zzso
