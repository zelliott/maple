The balance between specific signals from different growth factors dictates the biological response of zzso cells including cell zzso differentiation and zzso zzso cells represent a model of choice to compare the zzso of zzso growth factors, as zzso and of zzso growth factors, as zzso In these cells the prolonged activity of the zzso zzso dictates the decision of cells to zzso Here we focused on the zzso zzso zzso zzso as an established regulator of the zzso zzso to zzso its involvement in determining the zzso zzso cell zzso To this end, we generated zzso derived cell lines that express the interfering zzso of zzso under a zzso zzso Our findings show that zzso zzso to the opposite effects induced in zzso cells by zzso and zzso and that the interactions with the zzso zzso protein mediate such zzso
