The zzso zzso zzso cells provide a model to study zzso zzso zzso that are exposed to zzso acid become mature zzso within a few days with a pronounced zzso and zzso zzso zzso an accelerated rate of zzso extension characterizes densely but not sparsely zzso zzso DNA zzso experiments show zzso differences in gene expression of the dense compared to sparse zzso cultures at 18 h after zzso The zzso expressed genes are enriched by functions of cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and dozens of proteins that regulate zzso dynamics increase in zzso with a rapid zzso zzso A brief zzso in zzso zzso via zzso is sufficient to zzso the zzso of accelerated zzso extension with no effect on zzso cell zzso Furthermore, we show that the zzso dependent changes in the expression of zzso regulators such as zzso are restricted to a short time window prior to the establishment of functional zzso We propose that the wave of gene expression of zzso regulators that is accompanied by accelerated zzso extension acts in zzso young developing zzso in the zzso
