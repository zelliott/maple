A single vaccination of intact or zzso mice zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso melanoma cell line zzso protective zzso immunity and T cells that mediate the zzso of established melanoma in adoptive zzso zzso We wanted to study if multiple zzso during immune zzso of the zzso host would maintain a potent zzso immune zzso 

zzso were vaccinated multiple times over a zzso zzso zzso were isolated from these mice, activated in zzso and zzso transferred into mice bearing zzso experimental pulmonary zzso 

Multiple zzso rather than boosting the immune response, significantly reduced therapeutic efficacy of adoptive zzso and were associated with an increased frequency and absolute number of zzso T regulatory zzso zzso zzso administration reduced the absolute number of zzso cells zzso zzso zzso generated from zzso mice were significantly zzso zzso zzso more therapeutic in adoptive transfer studies than T cells from multiply vaccinated animals with a full complement of zzso zzso 

These results suggest that zzso zzso cells limit the efficacy of multiple zzso and that timed partial depletion of zzso T cells may reduce suppression and zzso in favor of therapeutic zzso zzso The recent failure of large phase III cancer vaccine clinical trials, wherein patients received multiple vaccines, underscores the potential clinical relevance of these zzso
