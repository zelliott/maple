Cell fusion in zzso has been used to study cancer, gene mapping and regulation, and the production of zzso via zzso However, zzso zzso formation by zzso fusion has received less zzso This investigation describes the spontaneous fusion of a human zzso with normal zzso cells after zzso zzso resulting in zzso cells that express both human and zzso genes and gene products, and retention of zzso traits with an enhanced ability to zzso Three of 7 human genes found showed translation of their proteins during serial propagation in zzso or in zzso for years; zzso zzso zzso and zzso each implicated with zzso or zzso This supports the thesis that genetic zzso of cancer and normal cells can transmit zzso and also, as first described zzso regulatory genes involved in the zzso zzso zzso Evidence also is increasing that even zzso human cancer DNA can induce zzso and transfer genetic information to normal zzso zzso we zzso that the transfer of genetic information between tumor and zzso cells, whether by zzso fusion or other mechanisms, is implicated in the progression of zzso and may further define the zzso between cancer cells and their zzso zzso
