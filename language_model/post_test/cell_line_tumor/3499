This study was initiated to determine if potential zzso gamma zzso could block the zzso of cell proliferation caused by zzso The action of zzso differed from other zzso gamma zzso examined in that it zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso mouse zzso cells was inhibited by zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and by potential zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Combined zzso tended to exhibit additive zzso zzso Potential zzso gamma zzso and zzso inhibited the incorporation of zzso into DNA of human prostate zzso colon zzso and breast zzso cancer cells but also affected zzso cells that have little or no expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells was seen after incubation with zzso and both potential zzso gamma zzso and zzso The extent to which the effects of zzso on cell proliferation are zzso through zzso gamma or induction of zzso zzso remains an open zzso We conclude that potential zzso gamma zzso may fail to reverse the growth zzso effect of zzso gamma zzso and may themselves act as growth zzso zzso
