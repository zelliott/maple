We previously discovered the coexistence of dormant and zzso cancer stem cells zzso in gastrointestinal cancer, which leads to zzso zzso zzso zzso liver zzso are sensitive to chemotherapy, and zzso dormant zzso have a limited proliferation ability, survive in hypoxic areas with reduced zzso stress, and zzso and zzso to other zzso In such zzso dormant cells, zzso zzso an zzso repair zzso is dominant after DNA damage, whereas zzso zzso zzso is apparent in zzso zzso cells, suggesting the significance of dormancy as an essential protective mechanism of therapy zzso However, this mechanism may also play a role in the generation and zzso of zzso during cancer zzso although the exact mechanism remains to be zzso Through zzso study, we zzso the underlying zzso mechanism for zzso behavior of dormant zzso zzso simultaneous zzso of several pathways including zzso and zzso proteins in response to zzso suggesting that a zzso approach would open an era to novel molecular targeting cancer zzso
