In a mouse model of zzso zzso we zzso analyzed whether the zzso zzso zzso inflammatory protein zzso a functional analogue of the human zzso 8, stimulates tumor cell migration in zzso and zzso and tumor growth in zzso 

By using zzso chambers, zzso zzso tumor cell zzso and migration were studied under stimulation with different zzso of zzso To evaluate zzso and tumor growth in zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso cells were implanted into the left liver lobe of zzso zzso mice, and 10, 100, and 1000 zzso of zzso or zzso saline zzso was injected into the zzso zzso After 7 days, zzso zzso tumor growth, zzso zzso zzso 3, and zzso expression were analyzed by using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso 

In zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells showed zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso provoked a zzso increase of cell migration and a most pronounced cell zzso at a dose of 100 zzso In zzso zzso in particular in a dose of 100 or 1000 zzso induced a significant increase of tumor zzso density and a marked widening of the zzso front at the tumor zzso zzso of the zzso front, but not of the tumor center, showed significant zzso thus indicating a pronounced action of vascular zzso growth zzso zzso volume was significantly increased, in particular after 100 zzso of zzso zzso when compared with zzso zzso controls, whereas only 1000 zzso of zzso animals additionally showed a higher frequency of zzso cell death within the tumor zzso 

Our study indicates for the first time that the zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso and growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso
