zzso zzso of the zzso zzso region are frequent in head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso To identify novel zzso amplification targets, we integrated high-resolution zzso comparative zzso zzso and zzso zzso profiling of eight zzso cell zzso We found that zzso was the highest zzso gene in the zzso zzso of zzso cell lines when compared with zzso lines without zzso amplification and confirmed the zzso of zzso in primary zzso by real-time zzso Using zzso zzso we investigated zzso function in three zzso lines using both in zzso invasion zzso and zzso zzso Surprisingly, we found that cancer cells become more invasive when the zzso protein levels were reduced, suggesting that zzso may act as an invasion inhibitor in zzso This unexpected result suggests that the zzso zzso may comprise both positive and negative regulators involved in zzso Our study is the first to evaluate the role of zzso in head and neck zzso and suggests a potential link between zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso This article contains supplementary material available via the Internet at zzso
