zzso cells of several species have been reported to express significant levels of zzso protein zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso In this study, we used the mouse zzso adrenal cell line zzso L that zzso zzso in zzso conditions with a zzso fold increase in response to zzso zzso We reported that these cells expressed functional zzso They also expressed zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the culture zzso zzso treatment of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso as well as zzso strongly reduced zzso level by more than zzso On the contrary, zzso treatment did not modify this level although it significantly reduced zzso zzso These results could be correlated to some data obtained in zzso on adrenal zzso removed from zzso obese mice exhibiting a zzso where the level of both zzso and zzso appeared to be reduced as zzso zzso expression level was increased compared to Control zzso All these data would suggest the existence of a link between the zzso status and the zzso of the adrenal zzso zzso
