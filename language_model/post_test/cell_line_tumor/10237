zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso block zzso zzso and zzso of the full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition to zzso truncated forms of zzso exist in breast cancer cell lines and clinical zzso The contribution of these truncated forms, specifically those expressed in tumor cell zzso to the development of therapeutic resistance to zzso zzso has not been previously zzso Here, we show that expression of a zzso zzso zzso form of zzso zzso referred to as zzso zzso zzso was increased in zzso breast cancer cells treated with potent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in tumor cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso was resistant to zzso by zzso zzso Furthermore, the expression of zzso was increased in zzso breast cancer models of acquired therapeutic resistance to zzso that mimic the clinical zzso zzso with zzso zzso blocked zzso induction in response to zzso zzso implicating the role of the zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso fragments of zzso generated by alternate initiation of translation and similar in molecular weight to zzso were expressed in tumor cell zzso where they too were resistant to zzso by zzso zzso When expressed in the zzso of zzso zzso breast cancer cells, truncated zzso rendered cells resistant to zzso zzso zzso the function of zzso truncated forms of zzso and developing therapeutic strategies to block their expression and/or zzso may enhance the clinical efficacy of zzso zzso
