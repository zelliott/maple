Currently available zzso chemotherapy is ineffective for treating zzso zzso and this is partly due to unpredictable zzso variation in zzso For example, tumors with zzso zzso zzso or deletions are less likely to respond to certain zzso However, even if zzso is intact, a tumor may be unresponsive if defects in other zzso zzso genes compromise zzso In an effort to identify zzso that better predict response to zzso we investigated the association of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso or expression of genes upstream or downstream of zzso in cell lines that retain zzso zzso zzso response was greater in cell lines with higher baseline zzso ( zzso In addition, the interactive transcript abundance index zzso zzso was directly correlated with baseline zzso ( zzso and zzso response ( zzso The zzso was also correlated with zzso response among cell lines derived from a variety of zzso that had zzso zzso zzso or zzso supporting its zzso for predicting response to zzso in other zzso regardless of zzso zzso
