The exact role zzso plays in cell migration is not zzso In this study, we have evaluated the effect of zzso of zzso on the migration of breast cancer zzso zzso was carried out by zzso expressing zzso in zzso zzso It was observed that even a moderate level of zzso of zzso significantly impaired the ability of zzso cells to spread on zzso zzso and migrate in response to zzso zzso expressing cells also showed increased resistance to detachment in response to zzso and increased zzso zzso of focal zzso zzso zzso and zzso compared to the parental and zzso zzso cell zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso levels may offer a good strategy for controlling the zzso potential of breast cancer zzso
