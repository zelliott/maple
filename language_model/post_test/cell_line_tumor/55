Recent studies have demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso plays a crucial role in zzso zzso zzso Although a variety of studies showed the expression of zzso zzso in particular, zzso by gastrointestinal tumors, the precise mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso of cancer cells to specific sites of zzso remained zzso Here, we used liver zzso human zzso zzso and zzso colon cancer cells expressing functional zzso to dissect the zzso cascade by zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso zzso is expressed by zzso cells and likely zzso cells lining the liver zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso in zzso was zzso analyzed using zzso zzso zzso Treatment of cells with an zzso zzso did not affect cell zzso but significantly impaired tumor cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In addition, zzso of tumor cells with the zzso zzso enhanced the zzso of the small zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as tumor cell zzso without affecting tumor cell zzso within liver zzso Taken together, the findings of the present study provide first in zzso insights into the early events of zzso zzso liver zzso formation of tumor cells and define tumor cell zzso rather than tumor cell arrest as the zzso zzso
