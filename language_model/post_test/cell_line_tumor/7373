The origin of zzso giant cells in zzso has not been made zzso In a previous paper the authors studied zzso giant tumor cells by using zzso zzso zzso to determine the zzso of intermediate filaments and demonstrated that these cells stay in the early zzso stage, undergoing neither fusion nor zzso In the current study the authors investigated the possible genetic causes of zzso giant tumor zzso 

zzso zzso or zzso human zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The three former zzso revealed a particular zzso cell cycle through zzso zzso of zzso that is, the early phase, mid phase, and late phase, zzso The three later zzso demonstrated zzso of zzso at zzso zzso of zzso at zzso and zzso respectively, making it possible to identify zzso distribution and function during zzso In addition, zzso tissue sections obtained in three patients with giant cell zzso were also zzso zzso giant tumor cells zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso but not with zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and in zzso 

zzso in this study indicated that zzso giant tumor cells remain in the early zzso phase because of zzso dysfunction, zzso aberrations in zzso zzso without affecting nuclear zzso
