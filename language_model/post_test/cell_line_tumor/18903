The zzso drug, zzso is effective in the treatment of acute zzso leukemia zzso Although zzso resistance mechanisms have been extensively characterized in cell lines, their clinical relevance is poorly zzso The aim of the current study was to define clinically relevant mechanisms of zzso resistance in a panel of childhood ALL zzso established in zzso zzso zzso combined zzso zzso We also studied two independent zzso zzso that were selected by in zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso sensitivity determined by a zzso zzso zzso bone zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso but not zzso zzso activity zzso significantly correlated zzso zzso zzso with the length of the patients' first zzso zzso into mechanisms of resistance revealed no association with zzso zzso zzso or increased activity and/or expression of zzso cassette zzso although increased zzso levels of zzso zzso significantly correlated with resistance zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Two zzso zzso selected by in zzso zzso exposure exhibited a zzso increase in zzso zzso levels compared with the parental zzso zzso zzso zzso reflecting their in zzso zzso zzso In this study, a zzso zzso with high levels of zzso zzso was relatively sensitive to the zzso drug zzso These results indicate that the balance between zzso and zzso zzso may be an important zzso of response to zzso zzso chemotherapy regimens in childhood zzso
