Mechanical forces affect biological systems in their natural environment in a widespread zzso Mechanical stress may either stimulate cells or even induce pathological zzso zzso sensing mechanical stress usually respond to such zzso with proliferation or zzso zzso for in zzso studies, the ability to impose a controlled mechanical stress on cells combined with appropriate zzso tools providing an immediate answer is essential to understand such fundamental zzso Here, we present a novel zzso motorized cell stretching device that has been integrated into a combined zzso microscope zzso force microscope zzso system, thereby enabling high-resolution zzso and fluorescent live cell zzso This unique tool allows the investigation of zzso zzso as the cells may be exposed to deliberately controlled mechanical stress while simultaneously zzso zzso imaging and zzso zzso The developed stretching device allows applying zzso zzso strain from zzso relevant to zzso levels to cultured cells grown on elastic zzso zzso zzso zzso stretching experiments are shown for zzso zzso cell zzso cells zzso expressing fluorescent labeled zzso zzso zzso imaging and simultaneously performed zzso zzso reveal the zzso zzso zzso zzso changes and mechanical characteristics such as elasticity changes were determined via zzso while the cells were exposed to mechanical zzso By applying a cell deformation of zzso zzso changes in the Young's zzso of the zzso network due to stretching of the cells were zzso zzso zzso a stretching device into the combined atomic zzso microscope provides a unique tool for zzso analyzing structural zzso and mechanical properties in mechanically stressed zzso
