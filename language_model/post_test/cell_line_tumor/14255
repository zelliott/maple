To investigate the effects of zzso on cell proliferation of human zzso prostate zzso cell lines zzso zzso in zzso and the possible mechanisms zzso 

The A values of the prostate cancer cells zzso and zzso in each group with various zzso zzso 10, 50, 100 zzso of zzso at various time intervals zzso zzso were detected with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso rates of the zzso and zzso cells treated with 10 zzso of zzso for 24 h and 48 h were assessed by flow zzso analysis zzso zzso technique was used to determine the expression of zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso proteins after treatment with 10 zzso of zzso 

The A values of the cancer cells treated with 1 zzso of zzso were similar to that of controls, while those of the cells treated with 10 zzso 50 zzso and 100 zzso of zzso were significantly different from that of controls zzso zzso zzso zzso markedly inhibited cell proliferation of prostate cancer cells zzso and zzso on a zzso and zzso zzso The zzso rates of 10 zzso zzso for zzso cell line at 24 zzso 48 h were respectively zzso zzso with flow zzso method and then zzso cell line were respectively zzso zzso zzso technique showed the expression of zzso and zzso in the zzso and zzso cells treated with 10 zzso of zzso were significantly zzso and the expression of zzso was zzso 

zzso can induce zzso of zzso prostate cancer cell lines zzso and zzso in zzso The zzso effect is zzso zzso zzso could initiate a cell death command via zzso pathways decreasing the expression of zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso protein and increasing the expression of zzso zzso
