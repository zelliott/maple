DNA damaging agents such as zzso and zzso are frequently used for the treatment of pancreatic zzso However, these treatments typically provide only modest zzso zzso the low survival rate for pancreatic cancer patients therefore remains a major challenge in zzso zzso of the key DNA damage response zzso zzso has been suggested as an attractive approach for zzso of tumor cells to DNA damaging agents, but specific zzso zzso have remained zzso Here we investigated the zzso potential of the first highly selective and potent zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso inhibited zzso and zzso zzso of zzso confirming zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly enhanced the sensitivity of zzso zzso and primary zzso pancreatic cancer cells to radiation and zzso under both zzso and hypoxic zzso zzso zzso by zzso led to zzso of zzso G zzso arrest in cancer zzso zzso cancer cell zzso following treatment with zzso was also accompanied by increased DNA damage and zzso of zzso zzso repair, as evidenced by persistence of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso These findings support zzso zzso as a novel approach to improve the efficacy and therapeutic index of standard cancer treatments across a large proportion of pancreatic cancer zzso
