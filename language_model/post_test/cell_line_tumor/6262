High zzso zzso expression in tumors has been reported to be a favorable zzso zzso Continuous exposure of zzso cancer cells to zzso was previously shown to result in significant growth zzso and zzso Our goal in this study was to evaluate the effect of zzso stable zzso expression on the zzso human zzso zzso cell zzso 

zzso cells were zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected by zzso and zzso protein expression was measured by zzso zzso and cell death in zzso zzso cells were measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively and compared with zzso and empty zzso zzso 

zzso zzso cells efficiently expressed and zzso zzso They exhibited significantly decreased cellular proliferation when compared with control zzso or empty zzso cells zzso zzso The mode of cell death was primarily zzso 

zzso expression of zzso significantly zzso the proliferation of zzso zzso cells and has the potential to be used in clinical applications to treat zzso zzso in the zzso
