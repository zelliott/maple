An efficient synthetic methodology to provide zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso derivatives is zzso These zzso restricted zzso scaffolds were evaluated as a novel class of zzso zzso Introduction of an zzso group at the zzso of the zzso zzso has been found to enhance zzso zzso The chain length and the position of the zzso group on the zzso aromatic ring markedly influenced zzso zzso The zzso scaffold was more potent than the corresponding zzso and zzso scaffolds and analogue 31 displayed excellent activity zzso against zzso without significant zzso zzso zzso
