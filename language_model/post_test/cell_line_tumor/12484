While significant advances have been made toward revealing the molecular mechanisms that influence breast cancer zzso much less is known about the associated cellular mechanical zzso To this end, we use zzso zzso to investigate the interplay among zzso mechanics, three-dimensional zzso zzso and transforming potential in a zzso zzso cell zzso cancer progression zzso We use a zzso model system where zzso zzso zzso zzso either zzso zzso or both zzso and zzso with empty zzso as a zzso Our results show that zzso possessing zzso transforming potential stiffen in response to elevated zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso or those zzso only zzso do no exhibit this zzso We further observe that zzso of zzso alone is associated with the highest degree of zzso sensitivity to zzso zzso and that the effect of transforming potential on zzso zzso is zzso Moreover, our zzso zzso zzso parallel cell migration behavior that has been previously reported for these zzso zzso Given the current knowledge base of breast cancer zzso these findings suggest that there may be a positive relationship among zzso zzso sensitivity, cell zzso and zzso zzso in breast zzso
