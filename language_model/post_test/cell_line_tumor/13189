In chronic zzso leukemia zzso the zzso fusion zzso activates multiple pathways involved in cell survival, growth promotion and disease zzso In this report, we show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso bound to zzso and zzso and zzso zzso depending on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso in turn zzso zzso zzso leading to enhanced zzso of downstream signaling molecules including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso interacts with zzso to alter zzso zzso expression leading to zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso plays a crucial role in zzso a growth advantage and resistance to zzso a zzso zzso as well as tumor zzso zzso mice injected with zzso zzso cells developed zzso zzso enlargement and zzso Moreover, suppression of zzso in zzso zzso cells resulted in no tumor formation in zzso Our results demonstrate a critical contribution of zzso in zzso activity, and suggest that zzso might be an important candidate for drug development for patients with zzso Furthermore, the expression of zzso provides useful information for zzso the characteristics of individual zzso zzso
