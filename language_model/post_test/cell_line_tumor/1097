The zzso zzso zzso zzso also called human zzso 8) has been linked to zzso and primary zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso We report that zzso cell lines have zzso active alternative zzso B zzso and demonstrate high-level expression of zzso zzso precursor and its processed zzso zzso To zzso the mechanism of zzso of the alternative zzso B zzso in zzso cells, we have investigated the role of zzso viral zzso death zzso zzso beta zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso We demonstrate that stable expression of zzso but not other zzso in a variety of cell lines zzso zzso zzso B2 expression and leads to its processing into the zzso zzso zzso zzso and processing of zzso critically depends on the I zzso B zzso zzso zzso of the zzso complex, whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso for this zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression by zzso zzso zzso processing and cellular zzso Our results demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that zzso zzso zzso is required for the growth and proliferation of zzso cells and alternative zzso B zzso plays a key role in this zzso zzso agents targeting the alternative zzso B zzso may have a role in the treatment of zzso zzso
