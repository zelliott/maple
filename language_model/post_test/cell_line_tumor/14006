zzso zzso is an important mechanism for zzso zzso genes in cancer and a promising tool for development of molecular zzso This study aimed to determine the prevalence of zzso association domain family protein zzso zzso promoter zzso in zzso zzso of patients with suspected lung cancer and to test whether this type of zzso zzso could be used as a diagnostic adjunct to conventional zzso 

Two hundred three zzso zzso from patients with suspected lung cancer were analyzed for zzso zzso by using a sensitive quantitative zzso zzso chain reaction zzso 

zzso zzso was found in zzso (35 of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso (6 of 6) of zzso zzso collected from patients diagnosed with small cell lung cancer, zzso cell lung cancer, and combined small cell lung cancer, zzso No zzso was detected in patients diagnosed with zzso lung disease zzso of zzso Depending on zzso zzso up to zzso of cases presenting with a negative zzso showed a positive zzso zzso 

The zzso analysis of zzso zzso enabled a highly specific distinction between patients diagnosed with lung cancer and those with zzso lung zzso These results suggested that a zzso zzso is a promising molecular tool for diagnosis of primary lung zzso
