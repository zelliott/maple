A series of zzso zzso zzso derivatives was zzso prepared, and biologically zzso Some C2 zzso zzso zzso showed potent activity against both zzso and drug-resistant tumor cells in which resistance is zzso through either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso The zzso 15 b and related compounds are of particular interest, as they are much more zzso than zzso especially against drug-resistant tumor zzso they are able to kill both drug-resistant and zzso cells zzso zzso zzso and they have high affinity for zzso Our research results led to an important hypothesis, that is, a zzso with very high binding affinity for zzso is able to counteract drug resistance, which may assist in future zzso zzso zzso
