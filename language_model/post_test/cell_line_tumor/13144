zzso bone pain remains a clinical challenge due to the poor understanding of the zzso Recent study revealed zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso receptors may be implicated in zzso zzso under cancer pain zzso zzso here we investigated the potential role of zzso zzso in a rat model of bone cancer zzso 

Walker 256 zzso cells were zzso into the left zzso of zzso zzso The model was verified by X-ray imaging, pathology and zzso zzso The expression of zzso receptors in zzso root zzso zzso was zzso zzso significance of altered zzso receptors was investigated by measuring influx upon zzso stimulation in acutely zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso an zzso of zzso zzso was zzso zzso or locally to evaluate its analgesia effect in the cancer pain zzso 

The zzso zzso was zzso for about 50% in zzso zzso in rats with bone cancer at both protein and zzso levels and correlated with the pain zzso in bone cancer zzso A zzso increase of zzso zzso zzso for zzso evoked transient response currents and a higher percentage of zzso responsive to the application of zzso zzso was detected in bone cancer zzso zzso or local injection of zzso significantly attenuated pain zzso induced by bone zzso 

These results suggest that the zzso zzso is functionally zzso in zzso in cancer zzso zzso zzso is a promising target for therapeutic intervention in cancer patients for pain zzso
