In most patients with zzso cancer, diagnosis occurs after the zzso has zzso beyond the zzso In these cases, zzso zzso combination chemotherapy is the zzso zzso However, most of the patients experience disease zzso and eventually die due to the emergence of chemotherapy zzso zzso zzso zzso are novel zzso agents that hold promise to improve patient zzso 

We compared a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso for their treatment efficacy in zzso cancer cell lines and in primary zzso zzso cancer zzso The primary cancer cells were isolated from zzso zzso collected from five patients with stage III zzso zzso zzso activities were evaluated by zzso Blue zzso and by zzso zzso The ability of zzso to kill drug-resistant zzso cells was also zzso 

By employing the cell lines zzso zzso and zzso we established zzso at zzso of 1 to 20 zzso to be as efficient in inducing cell death as zzso at zzso of 3 to 300 zzso zzso we treated the zzso cancer cells with these doses of the zzso All five zzso were sensitive to zzso with cell killing ranging from zzso to zzso after a zzso exposure to 20 zzso zzso while four of them were resistant to zzso zzso zzso cell death at 300 zzso zzso for 72 zzso Likewise, treatment with zzso led to an increase in zzso activity in all five zzso whereas treatment with zzso had no effect on zzso activity in three of zzso zzso cells were responsive to zzso but resistant to zzso 

These ex zzso findings raise the possibility that zzso may prove effective in the treatment of zzso zzso cancer in zzso
