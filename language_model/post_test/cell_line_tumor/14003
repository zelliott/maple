Increased expression of zzso or zzso has been correlated with progressive disease in certain zzso Present study zzso several human breast cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso varying in zzso zzso as well as 10 human breast cancer specimens to examine the roles of zzso and zzso E zzso receptors in zzso expression or zzso and the relationship of zzso or zzso expression to zzso We found a strong correlation between zzso zzso expression and zzso expression or zzso levels in breast cancer cell lines and zzso expression in breast cancer zzso zzso of zzso a selective marker for zzso zzso was also positively correlated with zzso or zzso expression in breast cancer zzso zzso of zzso expression and zzso in the presence of zzso or zzso zzso or following zzso of zzso with zzso zzso established a zzso role zzso in zzso synthesis by breast cancer zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso production indicating the roles of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso by zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso by zzso cells was inhibited in the presence of zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicating a requirement of these zzso for zzso zzso These results, for the first time, demonstrate a regulatory role of zzso in zzso synthesis (and thereby zzso in human breast cancer, which is zzso at least in part by zzso zzso
