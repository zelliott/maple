zzso zzso a pure compound of zzso zzso has been illustrated with zzso zzso In the present study, the zzso effect of zzso on zzso a human oral zzso cancer cell line, was investigated by zzso zzso cell viability zzso zzso zzso analysis and flow zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the number of zzso cell increased as treatment duration of zzso zzso zzso increased from 3 to 48 zzso and the plasma membrane zzso could be observed after 12 h zzso In cell viability zzso cell surviving rate significantly decreased as the dosage and duration of zzso treatment increased zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso flipping on cell membrane could be detected with 3, 6 and 12 h zzso treatment, which indicated an early zzso zzso Furthermore, cell cycle studies illustrated that the percentage of zzso phase cell declined as the zzso of zzso increased (10 zzso to 5 zzso while the percentages of zzso and zzso phase cell increased zzso zzso zzso in 12, 24 and 48 h zzso zzso These results further confirmed the zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso significantly induced cell zzso in zzso human oral zzso cancer zzso
