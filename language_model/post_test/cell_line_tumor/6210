Cellular zzso being the result of serial zzso or of zzso zzso is considered to be a potent zzso zzso However, it has been proposed that zzso cells may enhance the growth of adjacent zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, exposure of tumors to repeated low doses of zzso is a common treatment zzso Nevertheless, zzso also affects the neighboring zzso cells and the interaction of the latter with cancer zzso zzso in this study, we have exposed zzso cultures of human lung zzso to repeated zzso doses of 4 zzso of zzso We found that a single dose immediately activates a DNA damage response, leading to an intense, but zzso cell cycle zzso After a series of doses zzso dose approximately 50 zzso cellular zzso was accelerated, as shown by permanent growth arrest and the zzso of specific zzso and zzso zzso zzso This process was found to be zzso Next, we studied the effect of these prematurely zzso cells on the growth of human zzso lung cell lines zzso and zzso and found that the presence of zzso zzso cells strongly enhances the growth of these cancer cells in zzso and in zzso zzso mice in zzso This effect seems not to be related to an induction of zzso zzso but, to a significant extent, to the increased expression of zzso zzso zzso as a specific zzso inhibitor significantly zzso the growth of cancer in the presence of zzso zzso These findings indicate that lung zzso that become zzso after zzso radiation may contribute to lung cancer zzso
