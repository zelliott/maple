zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been demonstrated to inhibit tumor growth and zzso yet the mechanisms behind these actions remain to be zzso In this study, we examined the effects of zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso in human breast zzso and zzso zzso cancer cells under zzso zzso of cancer cells under zzso oxygen for 16 h significantly induced zzso expression and activity as zzso by Western zzso and reporter gene zzso Treatment of the cells with zzso zzso but not a zzso zzso prior to zzso diminished zzso zzso expression and activity, and addition of a zzso zzso attenuated the suppression of zzso zzso zzso of zzso attenuated zzso zzso zzso protein expression without affecting the zzso zzso zzso protein level, indicating that zzso zzso promotes zzso degradation in these zzso This was further confirmed using zzso zzso which reversed zzso suppression of zzso expression under zzso Using the zzso technique, we found that zzso of zzso enhances the binding of zzso to von zzso tumor zzso zzso a protein known to mediate zzso degradation through the zzso zzso Following zzso suppression of zzso zzso zzso zzso from the cancer cells was significantly reduced, and tube formation by zzso cells was dramatically zzso Taken together, these findings demonstrate for the first time that zzso of zzso suppresses zzso zzso signaling in cancer cells, providing novel insight into the zzso properties of zzso zzso
