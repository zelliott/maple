The zzso locus zzso zzso encodes two structurally distinct zzso zzso zzso and the alternative reading frame zzso zzso zzso in mouse and zzso in zzso Each of these proteins has a major role in cell cycle control and zzso zzso We originally identified a novel collaborator of zzso zzso from a zzso interactive screen using zzso as bait and found that zzso interacts with zzso in the zzso region and activates zzso zzso In the absence of zzso it interacts with zzso directly leading to zzso enhancement of zzso function and in turn zzso a negative feedback zzso Very recently, we found that zzso interacts with zzso and zzso degradation by an zzso zzso zzso zzso may exert a vital control on zzso zzso that is central to the cell cycle control, zzso and DNA damage response of human zzso
