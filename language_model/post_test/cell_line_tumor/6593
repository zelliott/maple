zzso shedding is a zzso mechanism by which zzso molecules are converted into a soluble zzso zzso is zzso by zzso and proceeds in a zzso or zzso zzso Although believed to be a zzso event, there is increasing evidence that zzso can take place in zzso zzso However, it is unknown how zzso soluble molecules get access to the zzso zzso By zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso cells, we show in the present paper that the zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso is initiated in an zzso compartment that is subsequently released in the form of zzso zzso influx zzso the release of zzso containing functionally active forms of zzso (a zzso and zzso 10) and zzso zzso zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could also proceed in released zzso but only depletion of zzso by small interfering zzso blocked zzso under zzso and induced zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso in response to zzso occurred at the cell surface and was zzso by zzso We conclude that different zzso are involved in distinct cellular compartments and that zzso is responsible for shedding in zzso Our findings open up the possibility that zzso serve as a platform for zzso shedding and as a vehicle for the cellular export of soluble zzso
