zzso a direct target of zzso has been shown to target several molecules associated with the cell cycle and cell survival zzso and its zzso is implicated in cancer drug resistance or sensitivity in several human zzso However, the correlation between zzso expression and zzso has not been explored in zzso In this study, we confirmed that zzso was significantly zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cell lines by zzso zzso zzso with lower zzso expression displayed higher expression of zzso protein than those with high expression of zzso therefore, an inverse correlation is evident between the zzso level and zzso zzso Moreover, patients with lower zzso expression had significantly poorer overall zzso zzso and zzso reporter zzso revealed that zzso binds the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso its zzso Western zzso analysis and zzso confirmed that zzso is inhibited by zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated that the restoration of zzso reduced cell zzso promoted cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso and toxicity in zzso cell lines by zzso zzso zzso This study is the first to demonstrate that zzso zzso sensitivity to the zzso effect of zzso in human zzso cells, suggesting a potential role of zzso in the treatment of zzso
