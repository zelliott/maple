zzso are a large family of plant peptides characterized by a zzso backbone and knotted arrangement of three zzso zzso This unique structure renders zzso exceptionally stable to zzso chemical and zzso zzso They exhibit a variety of zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity and it is these properties that make zzso an interesting zzso scaffold for drug zzso In this study, eight new zzso zzso zzso along with eight known zzso were isolated from zzso zzso a plant from the zzso zzso In addition, zzso 17 and zzso 8 were isolated for the first time as zzso The sequences of these zzso were zzso primarily by using a strategy involving reduction, zzso zzso and tandem mass zzso zzso Several of the zzso showed zzso activities against the cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso The novel zzso reported here: zzso enhance the known sequence variation observed for zzso zzso extend the number of species known to contain zzso zzso provide interesting zzso relationships that delineate zzso important for zzso zzso In addition, this study provides insights into the potential active ingredients of traditional Chinese zzso
