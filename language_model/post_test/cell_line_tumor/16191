DNA zzso primarily occurs at zzso zzso in zzso and is a common zzso mark that plays a critical role in the regulation of gene zzso zzso DNA zzso patterns across the zzso is vital to understand DNA zzso changes that occur during development and in disease zzso In this study, we compared two commonly used approaches to enrich for zzso DNA regions of the zzso namely zzso zzso zzso that is based on enrichment with zzso specific for zzso zzso and capture of zzso DNA using a zzso binding zzso zzso protein to discover zzso zzso regions zzso in zzso The enriched zzso DNA zzso were interrogated on zzso promoter zzso zzso and zzso zzso regions were zzso A detailed validation study of 42 regions was performed using zzso zzso zzso This detailed analysis revealed that both enrichment techniques are sensitive for detecting zzso and zzso identified different zzso rich regions of the prostate cancer zzso with zzso commonly enriching for zzso regions with a low zzso density, while zzso capture favors regions of higher zzso density and identifies the greatest proportion of zzso zzso This is the first detailed validation report comparing different zzso DNA enrichment techniques for identifying regions of differential DNA zzso Our study highlights the importance of understanding the zzso of the methods used for DNA zzso zzso analyses so that accurate interpretation of the biology is not zzso
