zzso is a major dietary zzso found in onions and other vegetables, and potentially has beneficial effects on disease zzso In the present study, we demonstrate for the first time the effects of dietary zzso on bone loss and zzso weight loss by zzso in zzso Female mice were zzso zzso and were randomly allocated to 3 groups: a control diet or a diet with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso After 4 weeks, dietary zzso had no effects on zzso weight in zzso mice, but bone mineral density of the zzso spine zzso and zzso measured by peripheral quantitative zzso zzso zzso was higher in both the sham and the zzso groups than in the zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso group restored bone volume zzso completely in zzso zzso zzso bone, but did not reduce the zzso surface area and zzso number when compared with the zzso zzso In zzso experiments using mouse zzso cell line zzso cells, however, zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso of nuclear zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso expression of zzso related genes was also inhibited by zzso The zzso reporter zzso showed that zzso did not appear to have zzso activity through zzso zzso These results suggest that dietary zzso zzso bone loss without effect on the zzso in zzso mice and does not act as a potent inhibitor of zzso or as a selective zzso zzso zzso in zzso
