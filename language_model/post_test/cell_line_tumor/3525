The zzso DNA binding properties, and in zzso and in zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso (or zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso are zzso The zzso zzso zzso contain a zzso zzso zzso that is attached to a wide range of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso binding zzso The zzso zzso zzso represents the simplest mimic of the zzso zzso zzso found in the natural products, and it lacks a zzso zzso The sequence and minor groove specificity of the zzso compounds was zzso using a zzso DNA zzso stop zzso and a zzso induced DNA zzso experiment using either a zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso For example, zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated specificity for zzso zzso particularly by reacting with the zzso zzso position of zzso This is also the sequence that zzso and zzso prefer to zzso The zzso zzso compounds were subjected to zzso studies against several human zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso cancer cell lines zzso and zzso Following continuous drug exposure, the zzso compounds were found to be zzso with zzso values in the zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso protected compound zzso was significantly less zzso than agent zzso supporting the hypothesis that loss of zzso and formation of a zzso intermediate is necessary for biological zzso The zzso zzso compounds zzso and zzso were submitted to the National Cancer Institute for further zzso screening against a panel of 60 different human cancer cell zzso Both compounds showed significant activity, particularly against several solid tumor cell zzso zzso zzso studies of zzso cells that were incubated with compound zzso at its zzso concentration for zzso showed induction of zzso in a large percentage of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were selected by the zzso for an in zzso zzso zzso test, and received composite scores of 18 and 22, zzso These two compounds were subsequently evaluated for in zzso zzso activity against the growth of a human advanced stage SC zzso melanoma in skid zzso At a dose of zzso zzso administered zzso compound zzso gave a zzso value of zzso (for day zzso and the median number of days of doubling tumor growth was zzso versus zzso for zzso zzso For compound zzso at zzso the zzso was zzso and the median number of days of doubling tumor growth was zzso versus zzso for zzso zzso At these doses no toxicity or weight loss was observed for either zzso Furthermore, compound zzso was not toxic to zzso bone zzso cell growth in culture, at a dose that was toxic for the previously reported zzso zzso zzso
