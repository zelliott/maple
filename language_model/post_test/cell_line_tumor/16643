The treatment for advanced stage zzso cell lung cancer zzso often includes zzso chemotherapy and zzso zzso and zzso combination therapy display schedule and zzso zzso the mechanism of which is not completely zzso In a series of in zzso and cell culture zzso in a zzso model, we investigated both the downstream and direct treatment and damage effects of zzso on zzso zzso repair of a DNA zzso The results demonstrate that extracts prepared from zzso cells are fully capable of zzso zzso repair of a zzso using a zzso DNA zzso in zzso Similarly, using two different host cell zzso zzso treatment of cells prior to zzso of a zzso undamaged reporter zzso revealed no reduction in zzso compared with zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of a linear zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso revealed a significant impairment in zzso repair of the zzso DNA zzso in the absence of cellular treatment with zzso Together, these data demonstrate that impaired zzso in combined zzso treated cells is likely the result of a direct effect of zzso zzso near a zzso and that the indirect cellular effects of zzso treatment are not significant contributors to the synergistic zzso observed with combination zzso zzso
