Growth zzso by zzso a zzso zzso zzso was investigated without or with combined exposure to zzso radiation in three human tumor cell lines zzso zzso and zzso bearing a point zzso in the zzso zzso 

zzso inhibited cell growth with an zzso of 50 zzso zzso 120 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with a poor zzso of zzso The drug brought about zzso and S phase depletion together with arrest of cells in zzso phase and induced a significant zzso of zzso cells showing active S phase DNA zzso with zzso and zzso cells being the most and least responsive, zzso The drug also produced dramatic changes of the nuclear zzso B pattern, without zzso B zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso strictly additive interaction in combined treatment with zzso radiation with regard to cell zzso altered cell cycle progression and induced zzso 

The data suggest that disruption of orderly progression through zzso and zzso is a major outcome of drug action and that this effect proceeds from zzso of zzso B zzso It is anticipated from the strict zzso of zzso and radiation that neither induced radiation resistance nor acute or late complications of zzso should occur in combined treatment with zzso
