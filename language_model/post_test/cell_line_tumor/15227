To study on the molecular evolution of zzso virus A16 zzso from clinical zzso of zzso foot and mouth zzso zzso patients in Inner Mongolia in zzso A total of 921 clinical specimens including stools, throat zzso and zzso zzso were collected from zzso zzso patients in zzso service in Inner Mongolia and viral isolation was then performed, the positive viral zzso were identified by using the real-time zzso method detecting zzso A total of 50 zzso zzso were selected from the patients presenting mild symptoms, severe symptoms and the death patients randomly, and the zzso coding regions of representative zzso zzso were amplified and zzso Finally the zzso tree was constructed among the zzso coding regions of the different zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Eighty two viruses were isolated form 921 clinical zzso the positive rate was zzso zzso of which 3 viruses were isolated from severe cases and 1 viruses was from death zzso The zzso acid of 50 representative zzso strains in Inner Mongolia were closed to zzso strains isolated from mainland China since 1998, especially from Beijing in 2009 and from zzso in 2010, the identity were zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso and zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso zzso There was a little difference in the zzso acid between the zzso strains from Inner Mongolia in 2010 and in 2007, the identity were zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso The zzso tree showed that all zzso strains clustered within zzso and zzso evolution branch of B1 zzso There was slight difference in the zzso and the zzso acid in zzso region among the 50 Inner Mongolia zzso zzso the identity were zzso zzso approximately zzso and zzso zzso approximately zzso respectively, indicating that these strains belonged to many different viral transmission zzso The zzso strains circulated in Inner Mongolia in 2010 were all belong to zzso and zzso evolution branch of B1 zzso and the two evolutionary zzso of zzso virus A16 were zzso and zzso in Inner Mongolia zzso zzso
