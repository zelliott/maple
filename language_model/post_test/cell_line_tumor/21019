The zzso family proteins are important regulators of type I programmed cell death zzso however, their role in zzso cell death zzso or type II programmed cell death is still largely zzso Here we report the cloning and characterization of a novel zzso zzso domain 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that, when zzso and accumulated zzso zzso zzso in cells as characterized by the increasing formation of zzso zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso from the zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of class III zzso zzso and, zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso In addition, zzso failed to induce zzso in zzso zzso and zzso mouse embryonic zzso cells, suggesting that zzso cell death is indeed zzso Furthermore, a zzso domain deletion construct of zzso failed to induce zzso demonstrating that zzso is a bona fide zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we showed that zzso is zzso by zzso in zzso cell death and is a zzso protein with high affinity for zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso Previously, it has been shown that PA directly zzso with zzso target of zzso and positively regulated the ability of zzso target of zzso to activate downstream zzso In addition, zzso has been shown to activate zzso zzso zzso of PA and zzso with zzso may alter the zzso between survival and death leading to zzso To our knowledge, this is the first zzso protein with zzso binding activity that, when zzso zzso zzso zzso
