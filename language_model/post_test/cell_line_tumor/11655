zzso C virus zzso is a zzso zzso virus that replicates on zzso zzso zzso zzso particle assembly is dependent on the association of core protein with cellular zzso droplets zzso However, it remains uncertain whether zzso assembly occurs at the zzso membrane itself or at closely associated zzso zzso Furthermore, it is not known how the zzso replication complex and progeny zzso physically associate with the presumed sites of zzso assembly at or near zzso Using an unbiased zzso strategy, we have found that zzso interacts with the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso associates with zzso and is believed to promote physical interaction between zzso and zzso zzso Active zzso forms of zzso bind more strongly to zzso than a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso in zzso cells, and zzso appears to promote the physical association of zzso and other zzso components with zzso zzso of zzso affects zzso replication and possibly also the production of infectious zzso Our results support a model in which specific interactions between viral and cellular proteins may promote the physical interaction between zzso zzso replication zzso and zzso zzso
