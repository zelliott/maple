To promote the development of improved tumor vaccination strategies relying on the zzso expression of viral zzso membrane zzso we zzso whether the size of zzso or the way tumor cells die has an effect on the therapeutic zzso 

In two zzso subcutaneous zzso colon cancer models we assessed the zzso effect on zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso injection of a zzso zzso zzso respiratory zzso virus fusion protein zzso alone zzso or together with the attachment zzso zzso zzso led to a significant growth reduction of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The treatment response was associated with a strong zzso zzso response and significantly improved survival with medians of 46 d and 44 zzso zzso zzso injection of zzso or a soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso had no significant zzso zzso The median survival of these treatment groups and of zzso control animals was about 30 zzso 

Although in zzso zzso of colon cancer cell lines with zzso resulted in about zzso larger zzso than with zzso the in zzso outcome was not significantly zzso zzso of zzso colon cancer cell lines with zzso or zzso caused zzso cell death, in contrast to zzso with zzso or zzso suggesting an importance of the mode of cell zzso Overall, these findings provide insight into improved tumor vaccination strategies relying on the zzso expression of viral zzso membrane zzso
