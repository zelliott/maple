Multiple myeloma is a fatal B cell zzso characterized by the zzso of plasma cells within the bone zzso zzso is a major survival factor for myeloma zzso zzso protein family regulates pathways to zzso that are activated upon growth factor zzso zzso proteins that have only a single zzso zzso domain, zzso are potent zzso of zzso In myeloma cells, zzso has been shown to be a major zzso protein that appears to regulate cell survival through the zzso zzso In this study, we examined the regulation of the zzso protein zzso and its interaction with zzso The three major zzso zzso are expressed in myeloma cells and are zzso regulated by zzso zzso of zzso signaling zzso an zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso Of major interest, zzso is found strongly associated with zzso in viable myeloma cells while this interaction is disrupted under zzso zzso Of note, while zzso is also found strongly associated to zzso this interaction is not changed under zzso zzso Thus, in myeloma cells, zzso zzso zzso through complex formation and therefore prevents zzso Under zzso zzso the disappearance of zzso allows zzso to exercise its zzso function and to activate zzso
