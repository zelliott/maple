zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity has evolved as a mainstay of therapy for patients with chronic zzso zzso However, a fraction of zzso cells persists under targeted therapy and can lead to disease progression on zzso of zzso 

We analyzed bone zzso zzso cells with the side population zzso and characterized the role of the zzso ABC zzso A3 in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso cells contribute to the side population cell compartment in zzso zzso Such zzso side population cells, as well as zzso zzso from chronic zzso leukemia samples, strongly express the zzso zzso zzso zzso levels are critical for the zzso of chronic zzso leukemia blast cell lines to specific zzso zzso by zzso The zzso is localized in the limiting membrane of zzso and zzso bodies, and zzso zzso zzso accumulates in such zzso The zzso storage capacity increases with zzso zzso thus regulating zzso zzso 

The zzso ABC zzso A3 is expressed in chronic zzso leukemia zzso cells and may contribute to intrinsic zzso resistance by zzso zzso zzso in chronic zzso leukemia zzso
