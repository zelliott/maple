We investigated the effects of zzso isolated from the medicinal plant zzso zzso zzso on zzso in human leukemia zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso incubated with the compound showed zzso of zzso zzso elements in flow zzso zzso the zzso activity was evident at zzso zzso and zzso at about 40 zzso zzso The appearance of zzso elements was preceded by zzso membrane zzso zzso release of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso We subsequently investigated the effect of zzso in combination with human zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso in the four cell zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the two agents, unable to elicit zzso when used alone, induced zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso to zzso of zzso elements when added together to the zzso The zzso seemed to rely partly on the enhanced expression of TRAIL zzso 1 zzso zzso analyzed by zzso by zzso Cell incubation with zzso resulted in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as revealed by Western zzso induction of zzso and zzso zzso by zzso were zzso prevented by the addition of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso indicating that both effects were almost completely zzso by zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso with TRAIL was reduced by about zzso suggesting that besides zzso zzso zzso could influence other zzso that participated in zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso can represent a candidate for in zzso studies of zzso or combined zzso zzso
