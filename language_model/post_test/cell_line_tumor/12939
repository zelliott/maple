zzso zzso C zzso zzso represents a novel potential target for zzso therapies in breast zzso In order to identify patient zzso which might benefit from zzso therapies, we investigated the expression of zzso in human breast cancer cell lines and in a tissue zzso zzso We first screened breast cancer cell line representatives of breast cancer zzso for zzso expression at the zzso and at the protein zzso We analyzed a zzso zzso of tumors from zzso patients with a median followup of zzso years for zzso expression by zzso along with other zzso factors in breast zzso Among a panel of human breast cancer cell lines, only zzso a triple negative zzso cell line, showed zzso for zzso both at the zzso and at the protein zzso In breast cancer patients, zzso expression of zzso correlated positively with human zzso growth factor zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso while nuclear zzso correlated positively with zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The positive correlation of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lost statistical significance after adjusting for multiple comparisons zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not correlate with zzso zzso P zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso There was no significant association between zzso zzso and overall zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso while nuclear zzso zzso with zzso in breast zzso Our study suggests the necessity for assessing the zzso zzso of zzso in breast cancer zzso when evaluating the possible effectiveness of zzso zzso
