The zzso zzso zzso zzso expression can be enhanced by zzso and other stimuli leading to the zzso of zzso zzso Thus, it was the aim of the present study to investigate the role of calcium in the zzso zzso zzso It was shown that the zzso zzso and the cell permeable zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso and protein expression under zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso experiments with zzso and zzso response element zzso zzso promoter zzso revealed that the zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso the response to zzso and zzso Although zzso induced a striking and stable induction of zzso zzso only zzso a fast and transient zzso By using zzso D and zzso we showed that zzso induced zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso acted after zzso Although zzso activated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso as well as protein zzso B, it appeared that the enhancement of zzso by zzso was only zzso via the zzso zzso By contrast, zzso exerted its effects via zzso of zzso zzso activity and von zzso tumor zzso protein zzso zzso Thus, calcium appeared to have a critical role in the regulation of the zzso system and subsequent zzso of the zzso gene zzso
