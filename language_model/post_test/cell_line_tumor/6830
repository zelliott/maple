zzso is a novel zzso zzso in multiple myeloma zzso In this study, we determined the mechanisms regulating zzso expression in zzso zzso promoter sequence was first cloned into the zzso zzso to determine the role of promoter zzso in the regulation of gene zzso zzso cells were treated with zzso and a panel of zzso were used to determine their ability to induce zzso zzso zzso conversion with sequence analysis was applied to a panel of tumor cells and normal zzso to correlate the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We found that zzso promoter function could be silenced by zzso zzso induced promoter zzso and resulted in zzso zzso at both the transcript and protein zzso zzso of the zzso zzso at positions zzso zzso zzso and zzso within the zzso promoter strongly predict for zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso were also able to zzso the expression of zzso in myeloma cells, but only after the promoter sequence has been zzso Our results provide the first evidence showing the role of promoter zzso in the primary regulation of zzso and the ability of zzso and zzso to further enhance zzso gene and protein expression in myeloma zzso
