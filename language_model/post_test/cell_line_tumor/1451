It remains unclear as to whether zzso zzso zzso zzso and the molecules that act zzso such as zzso zzso protein zzso 1/2 zzso are involved in the development of zzso bone pain zzso in zzso Here, we investigated the role of the zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso in spinal zzso and zzso root zzso zzso A zzso model was established by zzso Walker 256 zzso zzso cells into the zzso of female zzso zzso zzso and spontaneous pain were assessed using von Frey filaments and ambulatory zzso The results showed that both the paw withdrawal zzso to tactile zzso and the ambulatory score to spontaneous pain were significantly different between the zzso group and the sham group on days 7-9 zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, rats in the zzso group also showed a progressive increase in ambulatory score, which is different from the sham group zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein expression levels were increased in the spinal zzso horn and zzso of the zzso group relative to the sham zzso However, zzso injection of the zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso zzso and zzso protein expression in the spinal zzso horn and zzso zzso zzso These results provide evidence that the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in the spinal zzso horn and zzso can zzso zzso zzso
