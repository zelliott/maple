zzso forming zzso and selective zzso zzso zzso zzso have been associated with zzso zzso a novel zzso in development by Eli Lilly for the treatment of zzso zzso and zzso has structural similarity to the zzso zzso zzso present in hormone replacement zzso both contain a zzso group susceptible to zzso metabolism to zzso zzso was zzso and zzso for zzso activity, and in cell culture was confirmed to be a more potent zzso than the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso acid gave an zzso zzso zzso zzso which like zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed to be exceptionally zzso with the potential to cause zzso and/or zzso In model reactions with zzso the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were zzso interestingly, in the presence of zzso to inhibit zzso these zzso were formed zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso gave the expected zzso zzso resulting from zzso of the zzso which were characterized by zzso zzso of zzso or zzso with rat liver zzso also gave zzso zzso trapped zzso zzso however, as observed with other zzso zzso metabolism of zzso mainly occurred on the zzso side chain to yield the zzso zzso zzso is believed to be responsible for zzso generation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were detected in zzso zzso However, in corresponding zzso with zzso zzso no zzso zzso zzso of zzso were zzso These studies suggest that although the zzso group is susceptible to zzso metabolism to zzso zzso the formation of these zzso by zzso zzso can be attenuated by the chemistry of the remainder of the zzso as in the case of zzso
