A novel method for synthesis of zzso zzso using zzso binding protein zzso affinity is zzso An zzso zzso zzso or zzso was zzso linked to zzso via a zzso zzso zzso incorporating a zzso folate zzso zzso were prepared by zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso were then obtained by combining zzso and zzso and evaluated for zzso and zzso in zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso constructed via zzso affinity exhibited excellent stability under zzso zzso and quickly released the bound zzso upon low pH zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed similar zzso binding and zzso for both zzso zzso and zzso coupled zzso but not for the zzso zzso zzso loaded with zzso drug zzso were more zzso than zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso affinity is a potential method for construction of zzso and may have applications in synthesis of targeted drug carriers in zzso
