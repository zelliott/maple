zzso zzso zzso is a lethal zzso for which there are no effective zzso To develop rational therapeutic approaches for treating this disease, we are performing zzso studies targeting molecules crucial for the development of zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso in human liver zzso and can transform zzso liver zzso cells to produce liver zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso inhibited proliferation of both primary and highly zzso zzso cell lines in zzso and in zzso The zzso mechanisms underlying zzso zzso involve zzso of zzso zzso because growth zzso and cell death were accompanied by zzso of zzso to the zzso and a zzso reduction in zzso D1 and an increase in zzso 

Our results identify zzso as a novel zzso in zzso and suggest that zzso is a zzso and attractive therapeutic target for this aggressive zzso
