To evaluate the feasibility of using small interfering zzso zzso for selective zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso expression in zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso and observe the effects of zzso gene zzso on the zzso cell zzso 

Four zzso zzso zzso were respectively zzso into zzso cells, using zzso zzso The subsequent changes in zzso zzso level were determined by zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were employed to examine the zzso in cell cycle and cell zzso 

The most effective sequence was identified among the 4 candidate zzso and its single dose caused nearly zzso loss of zzso zzso in zzso cells, with sustained specific zzso for 96 h following a zzso zzso zzso treatment resulted in cell cycle arrest at zzso phase, accompanied by a reduction of cell proliferation by zzso whereas zzso zzso cells appeared zzso 

zzso zzso is vulnerable to zzso interference and selective zzso of zzso suppresses the proliferation of zzso zzso cells, a finding that sheds light on the possible use of zzso interference in further investigations of zzso and for therapeutic purposes of zzso zzso
