To investigate the correlation of the nuclear factor zzso and zzso circulating tumor cells zzso observe nuclear factor inhibitor zzso on zzso cancer zzso and its possible zzso 

In order to establish of zzso nude mice model zzso nude mice zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso To 50 nude mice were randomly divided into experimental group zzso zzso group), the control group zzso group), and zzso group (not zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso mice were labeled with zzso zzso zzso and sacrificed after 8 weeks, then zzso detect zzso expression in peripheral blood as to understand the expression of zzso zzso removed tumor to determine its size, zzso expression of zzso in zzso real-time zzso zzso zzso detection of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso occurrence and the expression of zzso was not obviously zzso expression in the zzso zzso zzso zzso rate was zzso while the expression of negative zzso zzso zzso rate was zzso zzso but connected with the activity of zzso zzso can inhibit zzso zzso reduce the zzso of zzso in zzso nude mice model, zzso group zzso positive rate of zzso significantly lower than the control group zzso positive rate of zzso ( zzso 

zzso can reduce the zzso of zzso in the zzso nude mouse model, its role may benefit from zzso reduced the ability of zzso zzso which may be as zzso inhibit zzso activity, thus make zzso and the expression of zzso down, reducing zzso and reduce tumor invasion of the zzso
