zzso resistance zzso is a major clinical obstacle in the treatment of several zzso including zzso zzso and solid zzso The zzso cassette zzso B1 zzso gene and its product, zzso zzso is one zzso that is involved in drug zzso Here we report on the effect of zzso zzso an inhibitor of DNA zzso on zzso zzso and zzso expressions in drug-resistant zzso and zzso zzso We found that zzso treatment reduced zzso zzso and zzso expressions in zzso and zzso zzso The decrease in the expression of zzso zzso and zzso was accompanied by increased sensitivity to zzso drugs in both drug-resistant cell zzso Our data suggest that DNA zzso is one of the mechanisms underlying zzso zzso in drug-resistant zzso cell zzso The zzso of zzso by DNA zzso zzso may be an effective strategy to overcome zzso drug zzso
