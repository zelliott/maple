Increased expression of vascular zzso growth factor zzso contributes to the growth of many tumors by increasing zzso Although zzso is a potent zzso of zzso we previously showed that zzso growth factor zzso amplification and loss of zzso both of which can increase zzso zzso activity, increase zzso zzso Using both zzso zzso and a cell line permanently expressing zzso active zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso of zzso which is downstream of zzso increases zzso expression in zzso and increases zzso in a zzso plug zzso zzso zzso experiments using reporter zzso containing the zzso promoter showed that zzso of zzso by zzso is zzso through zzso binding sites located in the zzso zzso Small interfering zzso directed against zzso prevented the induction of zzso zzso in response to zzso but not to zzso zzso of zzso is associated with increased zzso of zzso and its increased binding to a probe corresponding to the zzso promoter zzso In conclusion, our results indicate that zzso is required for zzso of the zzso by zzso Others have proposed that the zzso zzso can increase zzso expression via the zzso factor 1 zzso however, our results suggest an alternative mechanism can also zzso
