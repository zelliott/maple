This study aims at evaluating if zzso acid zzso or zzso acid zzso increases the efficacy of radiation therapy zzso on two human zzso cancer cell lines with different zzso 

zzso and zzso cells were treated with 20 or 50 zzso zzso or zzso followed by single X-ray zzso of 0, 2 or 4 zzso to evaluate cell survival, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins were analyzed by Western zzso zzso were used for statistical zzso 

zzso was more sensitive to zzso than zzso zzso and to a lesser extent zzso increased cell death, zzso and zzso production after zzso in zzso and to a lesser extent in zzso zzso zzso zzso This was associated with increased expression of heat shock protein 70, decreased expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The effect of zzso combination with zzso and to a lesser extent zzso was synergistic in the zzso zzso cells, but additive in the zzso zzso zzso This enhanced zzso was provoked at least partly by zzso zzso which consequently modulated inflammatory response and induced zzso
