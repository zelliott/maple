It is attractive to use vitamin zzso as a carrier for targeted delivery of zzso agents such as platinum complexes zzso to the high demand for vitamin zzso by fast zzso zzso The basic zzso zzso are recognized by zzso zzso and converted to zzso zzso in an zzso zzso zzso The reductive zzso of zzso zzso leads to the release of the zzso zzso thus, zzso zzso can be considered as zzso It is important not only to zzso the activity of the zzso zzso but also to understand the mode of action on a molecular zzso Chemical reduction of zzso zzso with zzso yielded zzso and induced release of the corresponding zzso zzso zzso tests and coordination of zzso or zzso to the released zzso complexes allowed isolation and characterization of zzso complexes as released during zzso zzso The biological activity of these zzso complexes was zzso Since the zzso zzso complexes show zzso the zzso zzso can be used for specific targeting of cancer cells and therapeutic drug zzso zzso in zzso zzso studies indicated lower activity zzso between 8 and 88 zzso than found for pure zzso Since active transport and zzso zzso limits the zzso zzso zzso comparison with pure zzso is of limited zzso We could show that the zzso complexes zzso from zzso exerted a zzso comparable to that of zzso zzso zzso studies in vitamin zzso free media showed a dependence on the addition of zzso II for zzso zzso
