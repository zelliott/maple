The majority of deaths associated with solid tumors are caused by tumor zzso To prevent zzso it is vital to understand its detailed zzso In zzso zzso of zzso cancer, some cancer cells zzso into blood circulation zzso into the lung zzso to form zzso To study the molecular basis of the lung zzso of zzso cancer, we employed an in zzso selection system that mimics zzso zzso of zzso cancer on a zzso zzso cancer cell line zzso We have successfully isolated a zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso from zzso zzso We characterized zzso in in zzso experimental zzso No significant difference in growth rate and zzso to zzso cell attack between zzso and zzso cells was zzso However, zzso exhibited the higher capacities of zzso zzso invasion and zzso invasion than zzso These results suggest that the zzso of zzso cells was enhanced among the multiple steps of the lung zzso of zzso zzso Our zzso zzso analysis identified 67 genes whose expression was zzso or zzso in zzso cells compared with zzso zzso This analysis data implied that one possible cause for enhanced zzso of zzso is its higher zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso is the first zzso cancer zzso with enhanced zzso potential using the in zzso selection zzso The information provided by our zzso zzso analysis using zzso will be useful for further investigation into the molecular basis of zzso of cancer zzso
