zzso is a key zzso in the most frequently zzso signaling network in human zzso zzso a novel zzso compound, inhibited all zzso zzso with a potency of 10 zzso or less and inhibited zzso of zzso zzso in cells with a potency of approximately zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the proliferation of 41 of 182 solid and zzso tumor cell lines with a potency of 3 zzso or zzso Cell lines derived from breast zzso showed the highest frequency of zzso There was a significant relationship between the presence of zzso and/or zzso zzso and sensitivity to zzso and between zzso zzso and zzso zzso dosing of zzso to nude mice caused zzso and zzso reduction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso total plasma zzso zzso increases in blood zzso zzso and zzso decreases in zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso oral dosing of zzso caused zzso growth zzso of zzso derived from various tumor types, including zzso breast cancer models that are resistant to zzso zzso also significantly enhanced the zzso activity of zzso zzso and zzso in breast cancer zzso It is concluded that zzso is a potent inhibitor of zzso with zzso activity in zzso has potential to treat a range of solid and zzso tumors as zzso or a zzso agent, and has potential for personalized medicine based on the genetic status of zzso zzso and zzso zzso is currently in phase I clinical zzso
