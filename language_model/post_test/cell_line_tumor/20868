zzso of zzso DNA zzso zzso has been suggested as a possible gene therapy approach to sensitize tumor cells to the zzso effects of zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we show that both elevated zzso expression and short hairpin zzso loss of DNA zzso beta zzso zzso expression in human breast cancer cells increases cellular sensitivity to zzso Resistance to zzso is restored by zzso of either zzso human Pol beta or human Pol beta with an zzso zzso specific to the zzso active site yet functional for zzso zzso zzso zzso These genetic and cellular studies uniquely demonstrate that zzso of zzso causes an imbalance in base zzso repair zzso leading to an zzso of zzso zzso zzso and that the zzso zzso activity of Pol beta is required to restore resistance to zzso These results imply that Pol zzso zzso zzso activity is the zzso step in zzso in these cells and suggests that zzso is a tightly balanced zzso for the repair of zzso bases such as zzso and zzso Furthermore, we find that zzso cell death is independent of zzso zzso and does not induce the formation of zzso as measured by green fluorescent zzso chain 3 zzso The experiments presented zzso suggest that it will be important to investigate whether an active zzso zzso could be partially responsible for the zzso resistance seen in some tumors and that balanced zzso protein expression and overall zzso capacity may help predict sensitivity to zzso
