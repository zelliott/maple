zzso to the zzso zzso and adherence to zzso zzso are essential for persistent colonization of the human stomach by zzso zzso The expression of zzso an zzso implicated in the ability of zzso zzso to adhere to the host gastric zzso can be modulated by phase variation via zzso zzso in repetitive zzso tracts located in both the promoter region and the coding zzso This study demonstrates the occurrence of phase variation at the zzso locus within individual strains of zzso zzso and among multiple zzso from a single zzso In addition, zzso of zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso signal zzso system in zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso locus results in a zzso zzso increase in adherence to gastric zzso cells in strain zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso but not in strain zzso zzso zzso zzso The combination of zzso regulation of the zzso locus by the zzso zzso zzso system and the generation of zzso zzso alternate zzso zzso by zzso zzso during zzso replication could permit zzso zzso to rapidly adapt to varying zzso or host immune zzso As a pathogen with a paucity of regulatory zzso this dual regulation indicates that zzso expression is a tightly regulated process in zzso zzso zzso
