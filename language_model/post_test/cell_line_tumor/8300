The introduction of specific molecules into live cells is a widely used approach to probe cellular zzso Recently, we have reported on the sustained dosing of molecules into single cells via a microscopic diffusion zzso Here we describe zzso zzso a method to reconstruct zzso concentration distribution of the delivered molecules as it varies in time during zzso To characterize this method, we analyzed zzso intensity maps obtained during delivery of zzso Yellow zzso zzso a polar zzso into zzso vascular smooth muscle cells, normal rat kidney zzso cells zzso and zzso human breast cancer zzso zzso zzso indicates a linear increase in concentration of zzso in these cells with a nearly uniform distribution during 20 zzso of zzso The method zzso the effects of varying cell height and variable accessible volume on the measured zzso at different locations within the zzso zzso zzso will be useful to estimate dynamic changes in zzso concentration zzso and thus, facilitate the understanding of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of molecules introduced into zzso
