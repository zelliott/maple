In zzso zzso of tumor zzso genes plays a significant role in zzso Apart from deletions and zzso growing evidence has indicated that zzso zzso including zzso promoter zzso and zzso zzso are also implicated in zzso of tumor zzso zzso The goal of this study was to identify zzso silenced candidate tumor zzso genes in human zzso by comparing the changes in zzso zzso gene expression profiles in zzso cell lines upon pharmacological treatment with the zzso agent zzso zzso By analyzing the gene expression profiles, we selected tissue factor zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso for validation and further zzso Our results showed that zzso was frequently silenced in human zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso was significantly zzso in approximately zzso of primary zzso when compared with their corresponding zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso was detected in zzso of zzso cell lines and zzso of human zzso and was accompanied by reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso expression in zzso cell lines can be robustly restored by combined treatment with zzso and zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso is frequently silenced in human zzso via zzso zzso including promoter zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of zzso significantly suppressed the proliferation and zzso of zzso zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso is a candidate tumor zzso gene in human zzso
