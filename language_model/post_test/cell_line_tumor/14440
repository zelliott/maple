Use of adequate zzso is necessary for induction of effective zzso immune zzso To develop an effective zzso for cancer zzso we selected zzso zzso as an zzso zzso and analyzed the mechanisms underlying its zzso zzso First, we found that zzso can induce the tumor zzso zzso by enhancing zzso zzso by zzso cells zzso mainly through zzso but not zzso Next, zzso was also found to prevent the zzso of zzso zzso cells zzso We demonstrated that the expansion of zzso in the blood and zzso during tumor progression required B cells producing the inflammatory zzso factors, vascular zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso a zzso for zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso on B cells changed to zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso We further showed that the zzso and zzso zzso from B cells by zzso treatment could abrogate the zzso ability of zzso These results suggest that zzso can enhance zzso immune responses as an zzso not only through zzso of zzso but also zzso of zzso via B zzso
