zzso is a key regulator of zzso whose biological activities depend on both zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso and blocks its zzso zzso however, the main zzso zzso of zzso might also imply a regulation of zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso at the zzso in which it zzso binds zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso at zzso zzso and zzso promotes binding between zzso and zzso release of zzso C and zzso In agreement with these zzso zzso reduction by zzso interference increases resistance to zzso zzso in a zzso manner and independently of zzso zzso with these findings, a significant zzso of zzso expression associates with zzso resistance in human zzso zzso and zzso zzso affects zzso sensitivity of zzso cancer zzso These data define a new zzso and function of zzso that, by acting as a zzso site for zzso to zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso Overall, our results point to zzso as a zzso regulator of zzso
