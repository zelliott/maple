zzso cancer is generally zzso to most zzso zzso We investigated whether zzso expression and zzso treatment reverse zzso resistance of human pancreatic cancer zzso We used pancreatic cancer cells that were zzso by using a zzso expression system, which allowed stable expression of the zzso gene in the pancreatic cancer zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso through a zzso zzso zzso zzso in order to enable the expression of zzso The zzso cells were treated with different zzso of zzso and with the zzso agents zzso zzso zzso and zzso The changes in zzso following treatment with zzso agents were determined, and the expression of different zzso indicating marker zzso zzso resistance zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 2 zzso and lung zzso protein zzso were zzso zzso treatment of the zzso cells significantly decreased the zzso of zzso agents in a zzso zzso zzso gene zzso decreased zzso zzso and zzso expression by 57, 47 and zzso respectively ( zzso and zzso treatment zzso zzso for 48 zzso decreased it further by 88, 73 and zzso respectively ( zzso These data suggested that the zzso of zzso genes is responsible for the improvement in the zzso sensitivity of zzso pancreatic cancer cells, when these cells are subjected to zzso zzso
