Human zzso zzso cells demonstrate varying levels of sensitivity to tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stress has been shown to trigger cell death through zzso We therefore pursued a strategy of zzso clinically relevant zzso agents that cooperate mechanistically through the regulation of zzso stress and zzso zzso zzso belongs to the zzso inhibitor class of drugs currently used to treat patients with zzso and is in clinical trials as an zzso zzso We found that zzso treatment led to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso This zzso was zzso by the zzso factor zzso binding protein zzso protein zzso We also determined that zzso zzso zzso zzso was responsible for zzso of zzso In contrast, zzso zzso expression was unchanged by zzso zzso Combining zzso with TRAIL led to a significantly enhanced level of zzso that was zzso by zzso zzso of zzso We provide evidence that zzso zzso stress zzso zzso expression in human zzso zzso cells and can enhance TRAIL zzso These studies provide a potential zzso rationale for the use of the Food and Drug zzso agent zzso in combination with zzso zzso to induce zzso in human zzso
