To investigate the effect of zzso protein zzso on zzso iron oxide zzso particle labeling of zzso rat zzso cells, and track the labeled cells in zzso using magnetic resonance imaging zzso 

A zzso of zzso of zzso zzso gene was constructed and zzso into zzso zzso The parental and the zzso zzso cells labeled with zzso were zzso zzso zzso into nude zzso The mice were zzso by multiple zzso MR scans after zzso cell zzso The mice were killed 2 weeks later, and the concentration of iron in the tumor tissue was measured by zzso coupled zzso 

The iron concentration in zzso derived from zzso zzso cells that were zzso with zzso zzso was significantly higher than that in zzso from parental zzso cells that were labeled with zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso N zzso zzso zzso zzso cells showed an improved zzso contrast in zzso compared with parental cells labeled with zzso but not zzso 

zzso zzso with zzso can lead to a longer zzso cellular tracking zzso
