zzso zzso zzso zzso is a rapidly growing zzso zzso zzso whose treatment requires highly aggressive therapies that often result severely zzso Identification of proteins whose expression or function is zzso in zzso and play a role in its formation could facilitate development of less toxic zzso We have previously shown that zzso expression is zzso in zzso We have now investigated the mechanisms underlying zzso deregulation and found that the zzso sites in its promoter fail to repress its zzso activity in zzso cells and that the zzso zzso zzso barely interacts with these zzso We also have found that zzso protein levels, but not those of its zzso are reduced in zzso cell lines relative to zzso zzso zzso zzso protein expression is also decreased in 24 of 26 zzso tumor samples from patients compared with control zzso Our data demonstrate that enforced zzso expression in zzso cells not only diminishes zzso levels, but also reduces selectively the zzso properties and proliferation of zzso cells, while increasing their zzso in zzso Our results therefore point to zzso as a target for developing novel and less toxic treatments for zzso
