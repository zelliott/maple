zzso zzso acids zzso have been applied as an oral supplementation to patients with liver zzso zzso not only improve nutritional status of patients but also decrease the zzso of liver zzso zzso target of zzso zzso links cellular metabolism with growth and proliferation in response to zzso energy, and growth zzso zzso especially zzso have been shown to regulate protein synthesis through zzso zzso On the other hand, cellular zzso is suggested to function as tumor zzso mechanisms, and induced by a variety of stimuli including DNA zzso zzso However, it is not clear how zzso supplementation prevents the zzso of liver cancer in patients with zzso Here we showed that human cancer cells, zzso and zzso cultured in medium containing zzso with zzso ratio about 3, which was shown to have highest activities to zzso and zzso of zzso had higher activities to induce premature zzso and elevate zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso themselves enhanced the execution of premature zzso induced by DNA zzso drugs, which was effectively prevented by zzso These results strongly suggested the contribution of the zzso zzso to the regulation of premature zzso Interestingly, the protein levels of zzso a zzso target and well-known gene essential for the execution of cellular zzso were zzso in the presence of zzso These results suggested that zzso possibly contribute to tumor suppression by enhancing cellular zzso zzso through the zzso zzso zzso
