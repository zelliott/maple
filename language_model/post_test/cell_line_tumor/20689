zzso zzso are small zzso zzso of zzso in length that are capable of modulating gene expression zzso Although zzso have been implicated in cancer, including breast cancer, the regulation of zzso zzso and the role of defects in this process in cancer is not well zzso In this study we have mapped the promoters of 93 breast zzso zzso and then looked for associations between DNA zzso of 15 of these promoters and zzso expression in breast cancer zzso The zzso promoters with clearest association between DNA zzso and expression included a previously described and a novel promoter of the zzso zzso The novel promoter of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is located zzso upstream of the zzso zzso and maps within a zzso zzso zzso has comparable promoter activity to the previously reported promoter zzso and is able to drive the expression of zzso in its zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso of both zzso and zzso was zzso associated with zzso expression in eight out of nine breast cancer cell lines, and in zzso zzso of both promoters zzso their activity in reporter zzso In clinical samples, zzso and zzso were zzso zzso with zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso zzso compared with matched primary breast zzso whereas zzso zzso was associated with loss of either zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso was associated with gain of zzso and zzso zzso zzso These data suggest an association between zzso regulation and breast cancer zzso and a potential use of DNA zzso of zzso promoters as a component of a suite of breast cancer zzso
