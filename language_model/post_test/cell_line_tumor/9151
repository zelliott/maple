zzso by binding to and zzso two zzso receptors zzso and zzso are critically involved in the development of the zzso zzso and breast zzso An zzso of zzso zzso (also called zzso with an altered zzso region, is zzso with zzso in many human breast zzso In this study, we generated a stable cell line from zzso breast cancer cells expressing an zzso version of zzso along with zzso zzso and examined the effects of zzso on the zzso protein levels and zzso We showed that zzso inhibited zzso zzso via zzso response element and zzso zzso sites of reporter zzso as well as the zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso expression caused a significant reduction in the recruitment of zzso to both the zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso expression induced zzso degradation of zzso The zzso effects of zzso on zzso activity were further confirmed in zzso cells that lack functional zzso zzso We also showed that zzso can interact with zzso both in zzso and in zzso cells, which is compatible with a model where zzso zzso are targeted to the zzso Finally, in human breast cancer samples, we observed that expression of zzso significantly correlated with zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso could influence zzso effects relevant for breast cancer development, including hormone zzso
