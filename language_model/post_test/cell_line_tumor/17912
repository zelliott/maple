The characteristic zzso associated with zzso in the zzso zzso and vitamin D zzso zzso genes defines the resulting genetic disorders, known as zzso and zzso zzso as zzso In both cases, the separation of the zzso zzso from the zzso hair zzso at the onset of the first zzso phase of the hair cycle and the development of zzso zzso and zzso subsequent to zzso of either gene suggests that their activities affect the same regulatory zzso zzso functions as a zzso activated zzso factor, and a role in zzso has been zzso for zzso due in part to its nuclear zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso we examined the hypothesis that zzso and zzso have a direct regulatory effect on each other via a zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso promoter activity in zzso cells and primary human zzso zzso While this repression occurs in the absence of zzso zzso D3 zzso the addition of zzso greatly zzso the zzso However, we also demonstrate the rare phenomenon of zzso promoter zzso by zzso We show that the full-length promoter is zzso by zzso in a zzso and cell zzso manner, suggesting that direct zzso regulation of zzso by the zzso accounts in part for the zzso overlap between zzso and zzso zzso
