We have recently shown that the plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso level is elevated in acute zzso stroke patients, but the origin and role of zzso remain zzso We investigated whether human zzso zzso zzso under zzso and if so, what signaling zzso is involved, and what is the role of zzso Human zzso cell line zzso was exposed to zzso by zzso zzso gene expression was increased by zzso and zzso at 12 and 24 h after zzso respectively zzso both zzso and was associated with twofold increase in zzso protein at 24 zzso zzso release in the culture media zzso zzso was elevated from zzso under zzso to zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso Western zzso revealed the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso under zzso Treatment of the cells with zzso zzso inhibitor zzso abolished zzso increase in zzso expression and zzso In the cells exposed to zzso zzso activity and zzso measured by zzso zzso zzso were increased at 24 h compared with the cells under zzso zzso both zzso It was further increased in the cells zzso with zzso for zzso zzso precursor B zzso both zzso and reversed by administration of zzso zzso ( zzso In conclusion, zzso increased zzso expression and release in human zzso cell line zzso through zzso zzso zzso may play a pivotal role in zzso of zzso under zzso
