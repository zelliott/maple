zzso zzso and trafficking of zzso zzso in zzso cells is tightly regulated and dependent on zzso zzso The dynamics of zzso pathways is modified in a number of diseases, including cancer, and notably in zzso resistant zzso cells that are zzso to the effects of several zzso zzso These cells often zzso expression of zzso pumps but this may be synergistic with alternative resistance mechanisms including increased zzso of zzso zzso that enhances zzso zzso of zzso zzso drugs such as zzso away from their nuclear zzso Here, we zzso the distribution of zzso zzso in commonly used zzso cell lines, zzso zzso zzso and the zzso resistant zzso line, and related this to the spatial distribution of their zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells contained zzso zzso emanating from zzso zzso and their zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were scattered throughout the zzso zzso and zzso cells showed extensive zzso of early and recycling zzso late zzso zzso and zzso to a zzso region but these cells lacked zzso zzso zzso zzso within these clustered regions was however, required for spatial zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso as treatment with zzso and zzso had major effects on their zzso zzso and zzso cells had similar zzso pH of zzso and overall these findings suggests a general relationship between the absence of zzso zzso and the propensity of zzso cell lines to cluster zzso zzso and zzso into the zzso zzso
