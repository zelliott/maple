Cell lines derived from oral zzso cell zzso zzso exposed to variable zzso factors can bestow advantages in understanding the molecular and cellular zzso pertaining to environmental zzso Most zzso cell lines have been established from smoker patients or zzso zzso patients, carrying the zzso zzso in zzso 

A new cell line, oral zzso 3 zzso was established from an zzso in a long-term zzso zzso zzso who does not zzso Cellular and molecular features of zzso were determined by variable zzso 

The cultured zzso cells were mainly zzso and had the expression of zzso zzso The zzso analysis using comparative zzso zzso has revealed the gain in zzso zzso zzso and zzso the loss in zzso zzso and zzso as well as the gain of entire zzso zzso Loss of zzso and instability in multiple zzso markers in zzso zzso were also zzso zzso cells bear zzso zzso coding sequence and have a high level of zzso zzso Its zzso expression was similar to that in normal human oral zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of nuclear factor zzso B zzso zzso in zzso cells following the treatment of zzso nut extract was zzso 

zzso cell line could be valuable in understanding the genetic zzso and zzso changes associated with zzso in oral zzso
