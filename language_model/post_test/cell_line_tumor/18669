zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso is expressed on mature zzso cells and zzso Its zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso play an important role in the migration of these cells to secondary zzso zzso where they are predominantly zzso For most zzso the zzso domain preceding the first two zzso zzso is involved in stabilizing the active zzso of its zzso zzso We have chemically zzso zzso zzso of zzso with the aid of a native chemical zzso method to investigate structure function requirements of this zzso domain by performing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso reduced the affinity of the zzso for the zzso in a zzso zzso Furthermore, Ala zzso of zzso zzso and zzso show that the side chains of these zzso are important for zzso binding of zzso to zzso The effects observed were mirrored in both zzso binding and zzso zzso highlighting the functional importance of this zzso zzso We also describe two partial zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and identify the first analogue of zzso zzso that acts as a functional zzso in zzso zzso approximately 350 zzso for zzso binding zzso As zzso of both zzso and zzso to Ala did not zzso effects on zzso binding from zzso zzso it is likely that the backbone of these two zzso is crucial for zzso zzso
