A zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso modified zzso zzso system was developed for improving drug zzso to zzso cancer zzso In this present work, zzso zzso zzso were successfully prepared by the thin film zzso method combined with zzso post zzso zzso was zzso zzso to the zzso end of zzso zzso by zzso bound and loaded onto zzso zzso surface as the targeting zzso To confirm the targeting zzso to zzso cancer, zzso and zzso were zzso as fluorescent zzso The zzso zzso and flow zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were efficiently associated by zzso cells, while limited interaction was found for zzso modified with a negative control zzso A similar zzso behavior was observed in zzso study of the zzso zzso Meanwhile, the in zzso imaging of zzso in zzso tumor bearing mice indicated that zzso achieved more zzso in tumor compared with zzso without zzso zzso The significant in zzso and in zzso results suggested that zzso might be a promising drug delivery system for zzso zzso therapy with low zzso
