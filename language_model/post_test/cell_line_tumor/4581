zzso zzso zzso are good potential models, to study, zzso zzso the mechanisms that control differentiation during zzso The zzso zzso cell line is a well known system of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso a zzso pattern of differentiation zzso zzso and bone zzso protein zzso or zzso zzso zzso a more zzso zzso pattern of zzso However, whether these human cells could give rise to zzso derivatives as their counterpart in mouse remained zzso We analyzed the zzso characteristics and zzso zzso of genes pertinent in cardiac muscle and zzso zzso during the growth of zzso cells in an zzso zzso medium with or without Bone zzso zzso 2 zzso 

Our experiments showed that zzso maintains their typical zzso organization in zzso zzso Although the beta zzso heavy chain gene was never zzso all the other 15 genes analyzed maintained their expression throughout the time course of the zzso Among them were early and late zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that despite the zzso cells natural tendency to differentiate into zzso zzso they can activate genes of zzso zzso zzso we believe that these zzso cells might still be a good model to study biological development of zzso zzso provided the right culture conditions are zzso
