zzso zzso nuclear zzso protein zzso is a zzso zzso protein that is involved in various biological functions, but little is known about its role in human zzso This study aims to delineate the zzso role of zzso in gastric zzso 

zzso expression was examined by real-time quantitative zzso zzso and western zzso zzso of zzso expression was performed by zzso zzso The functional effects of zzso on cell zzso were measured by cell viability zzso colony formation zzso and flow zzso Cell lines zzso expressing zzso were established to investigate the zzso effects of zzso in zzso 

zzso was readily expressed in all seven gastric cancer cell lines and was significantly increased in human gastric cancer zzso when compared with their adjacent zzso zzso ( zzso In keeping with this, expression of zzso protein was higher in gastric cancer zzso compared with their adjacent zzso zzso whereas moderate protein expression were noted in zzso zzso zzso of zzso in gastric cancer cells significantly reduced cell proliferation ( zzso and soft zzso colony formation ( zzso but induced zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso induced cell zzso is dependent on functional zzso of zzso and zzso and induction of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso promoted zzso cell growth in soft zzso 

Our findings demonstrate that zzso plays an zzso role in gastric zzso zzso of zzso may be a promising approach for gastric cancer zzso
