The exchange of information within and among bacterial populations using small zzso molecules has been termed zzso zzso zzso Due to the zzso distribution of the zzso zzso molecules and the evolutionary highly zzso nature of signaling zzso microbial zzso systems represent an excellent target for zzso zzso Recently, we have described the generation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso used by zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso peptides zzso These zzso suppressed zzso signaling in bacteria and neutralized zzso zzso effects in zzso as well as protected animals in zzso zzso infection zzso
