The zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso binds with high affinity to zzso zzso and related zzso zzso but also binds with lower affinity to structurally diverse zzso and zzso zzso One study reported that zzso zzso activated the zzso zzso zzso through the zzso which acts as zzso zzso whereas a recent report showed that zzso directly bound and activated zzso This study also shows that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso also induce zzso zzso Moreover, in zzso zzso zzso these compounds induce binding of zzso and zzso to the zzso and zzso gene zzso which is consistent with their activities as both selective zzso zzso zzso and selective zzso zzso zzso
