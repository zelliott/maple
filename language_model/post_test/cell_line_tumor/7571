zzso is a common pediatric solid tumor that exhibits a striking clinical zzso favorable and zzso The survival rate of children with zzso zzso remains low among all childhood zzso zzso and zzso play a crucial role in determining the zzso of zzso zzso whereas high-level expression of the favorable zzso genes is associated with a good disease outcome and zzso growth suppression of zzso zzso A small fraction of zzso harbors zzso zzso at diagnosis, but a higher proportion of the zzso cases acquire zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of zzso on zzso cell lines, focusing on the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins and the favorable zzso genes in zzso as zzso of zzso Treatment of zzso cell lines with zzso resulted in a significant growth zzso This growth effect was accompanied by a marked decrease in the expression of zzso zzso zzso and an increase in zzso expression in zzso cell lines without zzso zzso In addition, zzso enhanced the expression of some favorable zzso genes zzso zzso and genes involved in growth suppression and differentiation zzso zzso zzso and zzso Gene expression profile and zzso zzso analyses using zzso zzso cells further revealed that zzso suppressed molecular pathways associated with cell growth and zzso enhanced those of cell cycle arrest and the unfolded protein zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso or its related compounds may have the potential for therapeutic and/or zzso use for zzso zzso
