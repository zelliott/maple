We have previously identified several novel zzso which are zzso expressed among human normal liver and zzso zzso zzso The full-length liver zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned from the human normal liver zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso to zzso with zzso at zzso untranslated region zzso and encodes the same zzso zzso which suggest that these two sequences might be alternative zzso forms of the same zzso zzso located at human zzso zzso The zzso and zzso are specifically expressed in normal human liver zzso but reduced or zzso in most of zzso specimens at both zzso and protein zzso Furthermore, the reduction or zzso of zzso is significantly associated with the degree of tumor zzso Loss of zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso loss of zzso on zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso We detected three zzso zzso among 45 cases of zzso specimens zzso two of which lost the remaining zzso and the third had a replacement of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso expression is frequently associated with zzso zzso The reduction of zzso expression by zzso approach enhances cancer cell proliferation and colony formation in soft zzso Moreover, restoration of zzso zzso zzso expression but not zzso zzso zzso in human zzso cells inhibited their zzso or zzso growth in zzso and suppressed their zzso in nude zzso In conclusion, our data demonstrated that zzso gene zzso was frequently zzso and might possess growth zzso activity in zzso
