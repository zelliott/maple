The goal of controlling zzso cancer zzso formation has zzso considerable interest in identifying the tissue zzso involved in cancer cell colonization of the zzso zzso zzso is a site of prodigious zzso in both zzso cancer models and clinical zzso This tissue is unusual for its milky spots, comprised of immune cells, zzso cells, and structural elements surrounding zzso zzso zzso The present study shows the novel finding that milky spots and zzso play distinct and complementary roles in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso and zzso cancer cells zzso lodge and grow within zzso and zzso fat, which contain milky spots, rather than in zzso fat zzso Similarly, medium zzso by milky zzso zzso tissue caused zzso more cell migration than did medium zzso by milky zzso zzso Studies with zzso mice showed that the mouse genetic background does not alter zzso milky spot number and size, nor does it affect zzso cancer zzso Finally, consistent with the role of lipids as an energy source for cancer cell growth, zzso zzso studies revealed an inverse relationship between zzso burden and zzso zzso zzso Our findings support a zzso model in which both milky spots and zzso have specific roles in colonization of the zzso by zzso cancer zzso
