To investigate the role of zzso from fusion of human zzso cells zzso and colon cancer cells in the zzso of zzso zzso restricted zzso 

Human zzso cells and T cells were isolated from peripheral zzso zzso were generated by fusing the human peripheral blood zzso cells with human colon cancer cells of the zzso line using 50% zzso zzso zzso T cells were zzso zzso and zzso were added into the culture zzso The zzso ratio of T zzso was observed by zzso zzso zzso was used to detect the content of zzso zzso in the zzso 

The zzso ratios of zzso and zzso cells were zzso and zzso % respectively 24 hours after the T cell were mixed with zzso both significantly higher than those of the zzso The proliferation of T cells mixed with zzso was significantly higher than that of the controls zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso in the zzso of the T cell culture 24 hours after mixing with the zzso was significantly higher than that of the control zzso zzso zzso 

The strategy of zzso effectively activates the zzso zzso and zzso reactions and promoted the proliferation of T zzso
