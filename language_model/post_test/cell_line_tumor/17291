To construct an zzso zzso gene expression zzso containing the zzso gene of SEA and zzso zzso zzso region zzso and to express staphylococcus zzso A zzso on the membrane of zzso zzso zzso cell to form a zzso gene modified tumor vaccine for zzso 

SEA and zzso gene were amplified through zzso from zzso containing zzso of SEA and zzso Gene fragments were then zzso into the multiple cloning sites of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was transferred into zzso cells zzso with zzso positive clones were selected in culture medium containing zzso zzso and indirect zzso studies confirmed that SEA was expressed specifically on zzso cell zzso zzso study demonstrated that SEA protein was expressed on the membrane of zzso zzso zzso of zzso primed zzso zzso was analyzed by zzso release zzso T cells cultured with zzso zzso were used as zzso 

zzso zzso and sequence analyses confirmed the correctness of zzso position and orientation of inserted fusion zzso SEA was expressed on the surface of zzso cells, zzso had strong stimulating effect on production of zzso specific zzso ( zzso zzso had enhanced zzso to zzso cells ( zzso 

zzso cell membrane expressed zzso can be used to reinforce the immune effect of tumor cell vaccine for zzso which provides a new method of the enhanced active zzso for zzso
