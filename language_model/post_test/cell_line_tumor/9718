The aim of our study was to investigate the effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on cervical cancer cell zzso zzso The tumor weight of mice treated with zzso zzso 80 zzso zzso was significantly lower than that of the control group and serum zzso zzso zzso activity was zzso while serum alkaline zzso zzso level was only changed zzso Meanwhile, the number of zzso tumor cells was significantly increased in the mice by the treatment of zzso zzso 80 zzso zzso At the same time, cell cycle analysis showed the zzso of tumor cells in the zzso phase and a relative decrease in the S zzso On the other hand, using the reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso zzso 80 zzso zzso showed the zzso of zzso and zzso and significant zzso of zzso in tumor zzso It suggests a possible mechanism of the zzso effect of zzso on tumor zzso
