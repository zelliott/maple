zzso of prion protein zzso into a pathological zzso zzso during prion infection occurs in zzso zzso and is dependent on zzso Here, we show that prion infection increases the abundance of cholesterol zzso zzso cassette zzso type A1 zzso cassette zzso type zzso but reduces cholesterol zzso from zzso cells leading to the zzso of cellular zzso Increased abundance of zzso in prion disease was confirmed in zzso zzso zzso conversion of zzso to the pathological zzso led to zzso zzso in zzso displacement of zzso from zzso and the cell surface, and enhanced zzso of zzso These effects were abolished with reversal of prion infection or by loading cells with zzso zzso of zzso expression with liver X zzso zzso or zzso of zzso zzso reduced the conversion of prion protein into the pathological form upon zzso These findings demonstrate a zzso connection between prion infection and cellular cholesterol zzso which plays an important role in the zzso of prion infection in zzso zzso
