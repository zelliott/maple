The zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso are expressed by pancreatic cancer cells and can be targeted by the zzso zzso inhibitor type 2 zzso We have labeled zzso with zzso to form the alpha zzso zzso and have studied its in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso 

The expression of zzso on pancreatic cell lines, human pancreatic cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso and mouse zzso were detected by zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso zzso was assessed by the zzso and zzso zzso At 2 days zzso cell subcutaneous zzso mice were injected with zzso by local or systemic zzso 

zzso is strongly expressed on pancreatic cancer cell lines and cancer zzso The zzso can target and kill cancer cells in zzso in a zzso zzso Some zzso of zzso positive cells were found after incubation with zzso zzso of zzso A single local injection of approximately 222 zzso 2 days zzso zzso can completely inhibit tumor growth over 12 weeks, and an zzso injection of 111 zzso causes significant tumor growth zzso 

zzso can specifically target pancreatic cancer cells in zzso and inhibit tumor growth in zzso zzso may be a useful agent for the treatment of zzso pancreatic cancer patients with minimum residual zzso
