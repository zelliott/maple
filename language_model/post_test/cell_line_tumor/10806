zzso is a key upstream zzso in death zzso zzso and also zzso in zzso zzso via zzso of zzso zzso However, the role of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso induced by zzso drugs remains zzso We recently reported that the zzso of zzso is sufficient for zzso zzso but not zzso zzso in zzso and zzso deficient zzso head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso zzso 

We show that zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso by utilizing zzso cells carrying a zzso zzso zzso Restoration of zzso zzso function under the zzso conditions, together with zzso treatment, led to substantial zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso but failed to induce zzso In addition to zzso restoration, zzso zzso was needed for zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso and zzso In zzso zzso cells carrying a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, induction of zzso protein and zzso of zzso and zzso although observed in zzso cells, were hardly detected in zzso zzso cells under zzso conditions, suggesting a contribution of zzso reduction to zzso resistance in zzso zzso Finally, the zzso inhibitor zzso or zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso zzso Bid zzso and zzso in both cell lines, indicating that zzso zzso zzso lies downstream of zzso 

we conclude that zzso and zzso can act as upstream regulators of zzso and that zzso is an essential zzso of the zzso zzso induced by zzso in zzso zzso Our data suggest the importance of zzso positive feedback amplification in the zzso zzso induced by zzso in zzso zzso
