The mechanisms by which zzso zzso zzso and zzso proliferation of cancer cells remain zzso In this study, we investigated whether the zzso effect of zzso on human zzso lung cancer cells and zzso liver cancer cells was related to regulating zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used to detect the zzso and zzso effects of zzso with or without zzso acid on zzso and zzso The reporter zzso was used to detect the effect of zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso Competitive zzso binding zzso was carried out to detect whether zzso could directly bind to zzso The result showed that zzso could strongly inhibit the proliferation and induce zzso of both cancer cell lines, which could be antagonized by zzso The reporter zzso showed that zzso could inhibit the zzso effect of the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso However, in zzso binding zzso did not show that zzso bind to zzso zzso The findings suggest that exhibition of zzso its zzso activity may be associated with involvement of zzso signal zzso zzso
