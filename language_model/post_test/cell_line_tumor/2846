zzso zzso is a hallmark of a number of debilitating zzso including cancer, zzso and zzso We have recently shown that in human zzso precursor zzso cells a fall in zzso pH triggers increases in zzso zzso concentration through zzso of zzso coupled zzso receptors zzso to zzso zzso This zzso rise in zzso zzso led to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso providing a zzso explanation of how zzso zzso can promote zzso zzso We now find that differentiation of zzso precursor zzso cells profoundly affects their ability to respond to zzso zzso with gene zzso zzso cells have a lower zzso release probability from zzso zzso stores upon zzso and cells that respond have a significantly smaller and slower zzso signal than zzso zzso zzso zzso release in zzso cells fails to evoke zzso zzso This altered responsiveness of zzso cells is not due to reduced zzso zzso expression or diminished zzso store zzso Rather, our results suggest that in zzso cells, the zzso zzso couples less effectively to zzso C zzso and zzso zzso zzso the ability of human zzso cells to respond to zzso zzso by generating zzso signals and zzso zzso is zzso being lost upon zzso
