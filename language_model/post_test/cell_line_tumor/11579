zzso of the zzso form of zzso zzso zzso in cancer cells is associated with increased zzso To test the hypothesis that tumor growth may be inhibited through the zzso pathway, we generated a series of zzso zzso zzso The compounds exhibited low zzso activity in both zzso and zzso zzso activity zzso These compounds did not affect the growth of cancer cell lines under normal conditions in zzso but strongly inhibited the proliferation of multiple lung cancer cell lines when zzso was absent from the cell culture zzso In addition, zzso zzso inhibited the growth of an aggressive lung zzso zzso These findings show that zzso zzso by small molecules influences the growth of cancer cells in zzso and in zzso and suggest that such compounds may augment cancer zzso
