Although zzso zzso have shown some success in the treatment of head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso the results are not zzso Additional molecular targets are urgently zzso We previously showed that the loss of Ron zzso activity significantly slowed zzso zzso growth and progression in a zzso zzso Based on these data, we zzso that Ron expression zzso an aggressive zzso in zzso We zzso collected and evaluated 154 zzso primary zzso for Ron and zzso zzso zzso correlation with clinical, pathological and outcome data was zzso The biological responses of zzso cell lines to Ron zzso its zzso and the zzso interaction between Ron and zzso were zzso 

We discovered that zzso (99 out of zzso zzso expressed zzso The zzso expressed exclusively mature functional zzso whereas the adjacent zzso zzso expressed predominantly zzso Ron zzso There was no significant association between Ron and sex, zzso zzso zzso invasion or zzso However, patients with zzso were significantly older and more likely to have zzso zzso zzso also had significantly higher zzso expression and correlated strongly with zzso zzso zzso zzso diagnosed zzso with either zzso or both had lower zzso survival than those without Ron and zzso zzso down Ron in zzso cells significantly blunted their migratory response to not only the Ron zzso zzso but also zzso zzso of Ron in zzso cells significantly zzso the growth effect of zzso the synergistic effect of both growth factors in zzso cells was dependent on Ron zzso zzso Ron also zzso with and zzso zzso 

Ron zzso with zzso to zzso certain adverse features in zzso
