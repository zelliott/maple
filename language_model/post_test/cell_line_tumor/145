The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects on zzso cells originating from zzso zzso and zzso cells originating from a zzso line, subjected to polarized light at a wavelength of zzso zzso 

Recently there has been increased interest in the propagation of polarized light in randomly scattering media such as biological zzso because of its potential applications in zzso 

zzso was performed at two time zzso zzso (24 h after cell zzso and zzso zzso h after the first zzso Cellular viability was assessed using an zzso zzso at the following times: zzso zzso zzso zzso (6 h after the first zzso zzso (12 h after the first zzso zzso (24 h after the first zzso zzso zzso h after the first zzso and zzso zzso h after the first zzso The results were analyzed using zzso zzso zzso 

The results showed that time influenced the cellular viability of zzso cells of both control zzso zzso zzso and illuminated cultures zzso zzso zzso zzso differences between control cells zzso zzso zzso and illuminated zzso cells zzso zzso zzso were zzso There was a significant difference between the proliferation of the two types of cells illuminated compared to their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The use of polarized light on zzso and zzso cells resulted in zzso effects that need further investigation, as this is the first study using this zzso
