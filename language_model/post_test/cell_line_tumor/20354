zzso with age in horses is an zzso dominant zzso associated with loss of hair zzso melanoma and zzso zzso We recently identified a zzso zzso zzso in zzso to be associated with the zzso The aims of this study were to investigate if the zzso in Grey horses shows copy number variation and to exclude that any other zzso is uniquely associated with the Grey zzso 

We found little evidence for copy number expansion of the duplicated sequence in blood DNA from Grey zzso In contrast, clear evidence for copy number expansions was indicated in five out of eight tested melanoma zzso or melanoma cell zzso A tendency of a higher copy number in aggressive zzso was also zzso zzso parallel zzso of the zzso zzso Grey zzso did not reveal any additional zzso perfectly associated with the zzso confirming the zzso as the true zzso zzso We identified three zzso zzso that were present in a subset of Grey zzso within the 350 zzso region that shows complete linkage zzso with the zzso zzso Thus, these three zzso zzso must have occurred subsequent to the duplication, consistent with our interpretation that the Grey zzso arose more than 2,000 years before zzso 

These results suggest that the zzso acts as a zzso regulatory zzso The zzso of the zzso features of the zzso will be of considerable interest for the characterization of these horse zzso as well as for the field of human melanoma zzso
