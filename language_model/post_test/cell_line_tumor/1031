zzso zzso zzso the zzso compound of zzso is able to inhibit the growth of rat zzso zzso cells in culture and in the bearing zzso Our recent data indicated that the induction of cell zzso and cell cycle arrest at zzso phase 1 zzso by zzso might be associated with the induction of zzso and zzso and zzso via the zzso zzso family zzso In this report, we further investigated the mechanism involved in the cell cycle arrest induced by zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso on the cell cycle progression of zzso zzso cells which arrested cells at the zzso phase was associated with a marked decrease in the protein expression of zzso zzso and an induction in the content of zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso This effect was correlated with the zzso in zzso zzso Further zzso studies found that, in response to the treatment, the formation of zzso zzso 4 complex declined, preventing the zzso of zzso zzso and the subsequent zzso of zzso zzso These results illustrated that the zzso effect of zzso arresting cells at the zzso phase, was exerted by inducing the expression of zzso that, in turn, zzso the activity of zzso zzso 4 and the zzso of zzso
