zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso can metabolize zzso zzso zzso and absence of zzso due to the zzso zzso has been suggested to be a risk factor for Parkinson's zzso In order to define whether zzso plays a protective role in zzso zzso we have examined the potential role of zzso in the zzso human zzso cell zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso with zzso to generate stable clones with zzso zzso activity of 245 zzso while zzso control and parental cells had zzso activities of less than 12 zzso zzso of zzso for 24 h in both parental and zzso control zzso cells resulted in zzso and zzso cell death as assessed by zzso zzso zzso In agreement, zzso and zzso of parental and zzso control cells, respectively underwent loss of zzso membrane potential zzso assessed by zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso cells were resistant to zzso toxicity and both cell death and loss of zzso were markedly zzso in zzso zzso zzso When zzso was added to zzso oxygen zzso could be detected indicating zzso with zzso formation of oxygen zzso and zzso However, zzso cell death was not affected by the inclusion of either zzso zzso or zzso suggesting that zzso and hydrogen zzso were not involved in zzso zzso formed in medium may exert toxicity zzso or zzso but the protective role of zzso argues for an zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso protects against zzso zzso
