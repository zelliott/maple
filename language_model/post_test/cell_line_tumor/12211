zzso is an orally available type III and V zzso zzso zzso zzso Clinical studies have shown the efficacy of zzso in individuals with gastrointestinal zzso tumors zzso however, the molecular mechanisms by which zzso zzso the proliferation of these tumor cells remains to be fully zzso Taking advantage of zzso cells, which possess an zzso zzso in zzso 11 of the zzso zzso we examined the medicinal action of zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso cells with zzso of approximately 1 zzso and 40 zzso zzso zzso (10 or 20 zzso 48 zzso activated zzso and induced zzso of zzso cells as measured by zzso zzso zzso V zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analyses found that zzso blocked zzso of zzso in association with zzso of its downstream zzso including zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not signal zzso and zzso of zzso Interestingly, when zzso zzso target of zzso signaling was blocked simultaneously by either zzso or zzso growth zzso zzso by zzso was zzso Taken together, this study supports clinical studies of zzso for individuals with zzso and the combination of zzso and zzso of zzso target of zzso signaling represents a promising novel treatment zzso
