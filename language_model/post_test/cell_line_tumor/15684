The identification of zzso acquired tumor zzso is increasingly important in the clinical management of cancer because the sensitivity of targeted drugs is related to the genetic makeup of individual zzso Thus, zzso profiles of tumors can help prioritize zzso zzso We report zzso the development and validation of two zzso zzso designed to detect in DNA from zzso tissue more than 40 zzso zzso in nine genes relevant to existing and emerging targeted therapies in lung zzso The platform involves two zzso a screen zzso based on multiplex zzso primer extension, and zzso zzso that was designed to assess for 38 zzso zzso in eight genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a zzso zzso zzso that zzso for zzso zzso 19 zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso and zzso zzso 20 zzso Both the zzso and zzso zzso can be performed zzso with minimal amounts of genetic zzso Compared with direct sequencing, in which zzso DNA needs to compose zzso or more of the total DNA to easily detect a zzso the zzso and zzso zzso can detect zzso in samples in which zzso DNA composes zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso of the total DNA, zzso These zzso reliable, and relatively inexpensive zzso should help accelerate adoption of a zzso approach in the treatment of lung zzso
