zzso zzso harboring zzso or zzso zzso are zzso to current targeted zzso Using data from a zzso drug screen, we have developed a novel therapeutic strategy that targets the zzso machinery using the zzso family inhibitor zzso zzso in combination with a zzso zzso zzso This combination leads to efficient zzso specifically in zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso This specific zzso results from zzso zzso leading to suppression of zzso expression in zzso but not zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso of zzso zzso This combination strategy leads to tumor zzso in both zzso zzso cancer zzso and genetically engineered mouse models of zzso cancer, but not in the corresponding zzso zzso cancer zzso These data suggest that the combination of zzso zzso with zzso zzso constitutes a promising targeted therapy strategy to treat these recalcitrant zzso
