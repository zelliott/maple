zzso lung cancer zzso is a common type of lung cancer, but its zzso mechanism is not so zzso The aim of this study was to screen the potential pathways changed in zzso and zzso the mechanism of zzso Published zzso data of zzso series was downloaded from Gene zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso was performed using software zzso and zzso expressed genes zzso were zzso The functions and pathways of zzso were mapped in Gene zzso and zzso zzso database, zzso A total of zzso genes were filtered as zzso between normal and zzso zzso Cell cycle and metabolism were the mainly changed functions of zzso zzso Meanwhile genes such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso may induce zzso through DNA replication pathway, and genes such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso may be involved in zzso through cell cycle zzso It is demonstrated that zzso analysis is useful in the identification of target genes in zzso
