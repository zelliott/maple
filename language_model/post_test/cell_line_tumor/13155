zzso of human tumor cell resistance to zzso zzso in zzso cultures, using molecular target drugs zzso and zzso at zzso zzso was zzso zzso a zzso zzso and zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso effectively suppressed resistance of zzso human cells derived from the skin zzso zzso cell line) and zzso zzso cell zzso The effectiveness of suppression of zzso resistance with these zzso for human zzso zzso cells was significantly higher than that for the human zzso zzso zzso zzso For all cell lines zzso suppression of zzso resistance with zzso was more effective than when zzso was zzso The possible reason for increasing tumor cell resistance in zzso cultures and the importance of this phenomenon for understanding drug resistance of cells in the tumor tissue are zzso
