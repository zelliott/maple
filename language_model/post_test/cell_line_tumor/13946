We have zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso to investigate the specificity and efficiency of zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso was facilitated via the zzso interaction between zzso acid and zzso acid zzso zzso efficient gene delivery by this prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated in zzso cells relative to controls, resulting in significant growth zzso in zzso when the zzso was zzso Competition with free zzso resulted in about zzso reduction in both zzso zzso and zzso gene delivery, indicating specificity for zzso zzso More importantly, testing the efficiency of the zzso targeting zzso in an zzso zzso model in nude mice resulted in up to a zzso increase in gene delivery over the zzso zzso zzso The in zzso organ distribution profile also revealed zzso expression predominantly in the zzso which was more than 1 log higher than the next highest level of expression in the zzso Furthermore, with the targeted zzso containing the gene for yellow fluorescent protein or zzso zzso we further demonstrate in zzso that zzso gene delivery is specific for both tumor cells and zzso zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest the potential for further zzso of this novel zzso in the context of therapeutic gene zzso
