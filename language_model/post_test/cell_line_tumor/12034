zzso growth factor beta zzso plays critical roles in the control of cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins are zzso of the zzso type I zzso and are responsible for zzso zzso signals to target genes in the zzso The zzso zzso inhibitor of activated zzso proteins were originally identified as zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso between the zzso proteins and other signaling pathways has been shown to be involved in various cellular zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso signaling by regulating the zzso activity of zzso In this study we tested whether zzso a novel zzso zzso acts as other zzso proteins to regulate zzso zzso We show that expression of zzso zzso enhances the zzso activity of zzso which appears to be zzso and responsive to zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso reduced the zzso activity of zzso A zzso interaction between zzso and zzso with zzso was identified in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were mapped as the regions responsible for zzso zzso from zzso zzso further demonstrated that zzso zzso and zzso zzso within cell zzso Finally, we demonstrated that zzso zzso is significantly impaired in response to zzso induction in zzso zzso zzso embryonic zzso Taken together, these results provide the first line of evidence to demonstrate a role for zzso in regulating the zzso signaling zzso
