Previous studies have demonstrated that some tumor cells occupy a zzso location in melanoma, forming zzso zzso We hypothesized that these tumor cells are zzso along the zzso surface of the zzso a mechanism termed zzso migratory zzso In the present study, we have used human and zzso melanoma cells that zzso express enhanced green zzso protein zzso to zzso in an ex zzso zzso model, melanoma cell interactions with vessels that have zzso from rat zzso zzso We also used in zzso tumor growth on the chick zzso membrane zzso to observe the dissemination zzso of melanoma zzso In the ex zzso rat zzso system, we observed a zzso location of tumor cells that were spreading along the vascular zzso For examination of the zzso in zzso we have used the zzso preparation, allowing one to obtain striking images of the relationship between fluorescent zzso cells and zzso zzso cells were found zzso the outside of vessels around the zzso zzso cells were observed along the vessels several zzso from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso confirmed the zzso location of tumor cells, without any zzso zzso The results indicate that melanoma cells can migrate along the zzso surface of zzso This study also demonstrates that these models can provide zzso analysis that may prove useful in zzso the molecular interactions involved in zzso migratory zzso
