zzso receptors zzso regulate gene zzso by interacting with regulatory zzso Most information regarding how zzso activates genes has come from studies using a small set of target genes or simple consensus sequences such as zzso response element, zzso protein 1, and zzso zzso However, these elements cannot explain the differences in gene regulation patterns and clinical effects observed with zzso zzso and selective zzso zzso zzso To obtain a greater understanding of how zzso and selective zzso zzso zzso zzso regulate zzso it is necessary to investigate their action on a more comprehensive set of native regulatory elements derived from zzso target zzso Here we used zzso zzso and sequencing to isolate 173 regulatory elements associated with zzso Most elements were found in the zzso zzso and regions greater than 10 zzso upstream of the zzso initiation site zzso zzso of the elements were found in the zzso promoter region zzso zzso Only zzso of the elements contained a classical zzso response zzso zzso of the elements did not have any known response zzso including one derived from the naked zzso zzso zzso which was associated with the recruitment of zzso zzso zzso studies found that zzso of the 173 elements were regulated by zzso zzso or tamoxifen with zzso or zzso zzso was more effective than zzso at zzso the elements with zzso whereas zzso was superior with zzso Our findings demonstrate that zzso zzso and zzso zzso regulate native zzso elements isolated by zzso zzso with zzso and zzso
