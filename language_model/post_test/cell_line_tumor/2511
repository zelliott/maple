To investigate the effect of carbon zzso zzso on zzso cell zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso cells were zzso with photons and carbon zzso zzso was analyzed 24 h after zzso zzso cell sorting analysis was performed in order to zzso surface expression of zzso 

Single zzso doses of 2 zzso and 10 zzso enhanced zzso and zzso zzso expression and caused tumor cell zzso on both zzso zzso and zzso zzso Compared to zzso expression in zzso cells, carbon zzso zzso caused decreased zzso expression and inhibited cell migration on both zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso zzso enhances the risk of tumor cell migration and subsequently promotes zzso spread via zzso induction of zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso carbon zzso zzso causes decreased zzso expression and suppresses zzso cell migration on both zzso and zzso thus promising improved local zzso
