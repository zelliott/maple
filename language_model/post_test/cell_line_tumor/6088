We investigated the zzso activity of the combination of two different humanized zzso human zzso growth factor zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso and zzso for gastric zzso 

zzso mouse zzso models were used to examine zzso zzso Cell proliferation was examined using crystal violet zzso zzso family zzso expression was analyzed by zzso and zzso zzso proteins and zzso were detected by Western zzso and in zzso proximity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was examined by zzso zzso zzso zzso cellular zzso zzso activity was detected by zzso zzso density was examined by zzso zzso 

zzso in combination with zzso showed significant zzso activity compared with each zzso in zzso an zzso human gastric cancer zzso zzso The efficacy was stronger than that of the maximum effective dose with each zzso Similar zzso activity was shown in zzso another zzso gastric cancer model, but not in zzso an zzso zzso Combining zzso with zzso enhanced cell growth zzso and zzso activity by zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of these receptors and their downstream zzso This effect was also seen in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso in combination with zzso zzso the zzso activity of those zzso and reduced tumor zzso zzso 

We showed the significantly enhanced efficacy of zzso combining with zzso for zzso zzso gastric cancer through the zzso of cell growth zzso zzso activity, cell killing activity by zzso and zzso zzso This study suggests the clinical benefit of combination therapy with zzso and zzso for patients with zzso gastric zzso
