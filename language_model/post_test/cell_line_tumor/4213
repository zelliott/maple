The zzso gene from zzso is known to be a potent zzso of zzso in a wide range of zzso However, the molecular bases of its zzso properties are still poorly zzso In an attempt to study this effect, zzso cells, derived from a zzso tumor as glioblastoma, where infected with zzso carrying zzso gene developing an acute sensitivity to zzso zzso The induction of zzso correlated with a marked G zzso phase zzso and a potent zzso zzso Our findings demonstrate that zzso plays a pivotal role in zzso zzso through the induction of a zzso stress situation, as our data support by genetic approaches, based in interference and zzso in zzso zzso In fact, we present evidence showing that zzso is a novel zzso target of zzso gene through the effect exerted by this zzso protein onto zzso Moreover, zzso zzso also explains the marked zzso of zzso associated to zzso expression in the absence of DNA zzso Indeed, all these observations were zzso to other experimental models, such as zzso zzso and zzso rendering the same pattern in terms of zzso cell cycle distribution, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso pattern of zzso In zzso our data propose a novel mechanism to explain how zzso mediates zzso through the signaling axis zzso zzso stress zzso This novel mechanism of zzso zzso could be the key to open new possibilities in the current therapy of zzso
