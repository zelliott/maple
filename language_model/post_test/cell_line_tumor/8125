zzso is important for membrane stability and is the key zzso for the synthesis of steroid hormones and vitamin zzso Furthermore, it is a major component of the zzso barrier in the stratum zzso of the human zzso Considering that steroid hormone synthesis is taking place in zzso zzso we tested whether downstream zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso could be possibly modulated by zzso For this purpose, we zzso human primary zzso cell cultures and human melanoma cells with different pigmentation capacity applying zzso zzso Western zzso and determination of zzso zzso Our in zzso and in zzso results demonstrated that zzso can zzso cholesterol via zzso zzso and transport cholesterol via zzso Moreover, we show that cholesterol increases zzso in these cells and in human melanoma cells of intermediate pigmentation zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso Cellular cholesterol levels in melanoma cells with different pigmentation patterns, zzso zzso and zzso do not differ except in the zzso zzso melanoma cell zzso This result is in agreement with decreasing cholesterol content versus increasing pigmentation in zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner zzso after 30 zzso and later after 6 and 24 zzso meanwhile protein expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is induced after 72 zzso Taken together, we show that human zzso zzso have the capacity of cholesterol zzso via zzso zzso and that cholesterol under in zzso conditions increases zzso
