zzso zzso zzso is the third most common cancer worldwide, causing over zzso million deaths per year, with approximately half of these in zzso zzso is the optimal treatment for patients with advanced zzso although zzso has become a significant obstacle to successful zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso also called zzso or zzso is lower in zzso zzso zzso cells compared to zzso zzso zzso To explore the role of zzso in zzso resistance, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell lines were zzso zzso cells were more sensitive to zzso treatment than controls, while zzso zzso resulted in a significant increase in zzso zzso This result was zzso in a second zzso cell line, zzso Further investigation of the mechanism revealed that decreased zzso levels in zzso cells activated the zzso zzso through increasing zzso and the zzso ratio, while zzso of zzso zzso this zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso depletion is involved in zzso resistance, and that therapeutic strategies targeting zzso may improve zzso sensitivity to zzso
