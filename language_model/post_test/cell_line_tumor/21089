zzso zzso is a zzso protein belonging to the zzso zzso which has been shown to accumulate at zzso contacts via its zzso interaction, but its molecular roles remain zzso In this study, we show that zzso bound zzso protein 1 zzso a protein that regulates zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells not expressing zzso zzso was localized only along the zzso However, zzso expression of zzso in these cells recruited zzso as well as zzso to zzso contact zzso Although zzso expression had no effect on the zzso of solitary zzso cells, it accelerated their movement when they were in contact with one another, causing zzso reorganization of zzso and zzso at cell zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso site exhibited no such zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in enhancing cell zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso the zzso and zzso machinery at cell junctions by recruiting the zzso complex to these sites and, in turn, promotes the migration of zzso
