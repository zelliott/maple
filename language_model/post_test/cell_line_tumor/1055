The application of zzso zzso results in higher zzso in tumor zzso This effect can be further increased by blood flow zzso with longer retention time in the tumor and by zzso administration realized in abdominal zzso therapy, a separate partial circulation with a defined flow under hypoxic zzso The pH changes under zzso therapy may affect the further metabolism of zzso zzso used zzso 

The in zzso zzso zzso zzso at increasing pH values were measured using zzso zzso and free zzso zzso 20 zzso rabbits were treated zzso with zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso The pH value was maintained in the zzso range by continuous zzso zzso After 20 zzso zzso of zzso and its zzso zzso were determined in different zzso the zzso serum and the zzso tumor by zzso 

The in zzso zzso zzso which occur only in the zzso pH range, were doubled by the use of zzso zzso In the animal trial, zzso zzso doubled the zzso zzso found in our preliminary zzso Compared to free zzso zzso zzso significantly increased the zzso in the zzso liver tumor by zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso by zzso 

The metabolism of zzso into its active zzso zzso depends on the pH value and can be zzso zzso zzso can be approximately doubled with the zzso application of zzso zzso compared to free zzso
