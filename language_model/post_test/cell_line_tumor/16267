In addition to its zzso role as an zzso in zzso we propose that zzso may act as an zzso zzso of cell zzso and zzso under certain zzso Our evidence shows that, when zzso in both cancer and zzso cells, zzso can form a complex with zzso and zzso that functions to decrease zzso activity to increase zzso zzso and, thus, suppress cell adhesive zzso The linkage between increased zzso and increased zzso zzso on the one hand, and suppression of cell zzso zzso and zzso on the other hand, is a novel observation that may provide a plausible explanation for why zzso zzso in some tumors is correlated with improved patient zzso In addition, we have identified conditions in zzso in which zzso zzso can be increased while cell zzso is zzso These findings underscore the possibility that zzso may be involved in modulating zzso zzso and may provide an opportunity to explore signal zzso pathways important for cell zzso and migration and to develop small zzso therapies for suppression of cancer zzso
