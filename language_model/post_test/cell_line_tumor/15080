To evaluate the expression levels of heat shock protein 70 zzso in human zzso cancer of the zzso and to assess the therapeutic effects of treatment with small interfering zzso zzso targeting zzso on human zzso cancer zzso zzso 

zzso expression in zzso cancer specimens obtained from 235 patients were evaluated by zzso zzso We then analyzed changes in the growth and zzso of zzso cells following treatment with zzso zzso 

zzso levels of zzso protein in zzso cancer specimens were significantly related to major zzso zzso including zzso stage and tumor zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso zzso resulted in a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited the growth of zzso compared with that after treatment with scrambled control zzso Among several zzso agents, the most powerful synergistic zzso effect was observed when zzso was treated with zzso plus zzso zzso which induced more than 50% reduction in the zzso of zzso Furthermore, a significant increase in the zzso fraction of zzso and the DNA fragmentation was observed only after combined treatment with zzso zzso and zzso doses of zzso but not after treatment with either agent zzso Similarly, zzso and zzso but not zzso in zzso were zzso activated by combined treatment with zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso expression using zzso could be an attractive therapeutic strategy for zzso cancer by inducing zzso of tumor growth as well as enhancing zzso
