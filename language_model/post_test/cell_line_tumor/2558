zzso states, leading to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso are common in cancer and portend a poor clinical zzso Although zzso states in zzso patients have been zzso studies exploring zzso zzso ability to directly contribute to zzso activity have not been zzso This study explores the hypothesis that zzso can regulate zzso generation and zzso in response to zzso and that attenuating zzso generation with zzso can slow tumor zzso 

zzso analysis of zzso with adjacent zzso zzso was zzso In zzso proliferation zzso zzso zzso activity zzso and zzso of zzso zzso expression were performed on human and zzso zzso cell lines with varying zzso The efficacy of low molecular weight zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso generation and growth in zzso and in zzso was zzso 

zzso zzso adjacent to zzso were found to harbor tumor surrounded by zzso expressing zzso zzso a finding associated with poor clinical zzso More aggressive zzso cell lines had greater surface expression of zzso factors and generated more zzso than less aggressive cell lines and were found to zzso in response to zzso Treatment with zzso reduced in zzso zzso proliferation and zzso activity as well as tumor growth in zzso 

These findings suggest that elements of the zzso cascade may play a role in and represent a pharmaceutical target to disrupt zzso zzso They also have broader zzso as they suggest that, to be effective, dosing of zzso must take into account an individual zzso capacity to generate zzso
