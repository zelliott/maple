zzso type I zzso is an zzso disorder that affects neural zzso zzso leading to a wide spectrum of clinical zzso Patients commonly present with zzso zzso benign but debilitating zzso that can transform into zzso peripheral nerve sheath tumors zzso a main cause of zzso Currently, surgery is the primary course of treatment for zzso but with the limitation that these tumors are highly zzso zzso is another treatment option, but is zzso because it can induce additional zzso Patients with zzso may also receive zzso as therapy, but this zzso agent has relatively low tumor specificity and limited zzso In this study, we exploited a robust genetically engineered mouse model of zzso that zzso human zzso zzso to identify a novel small chemical compound that zzso tumor cell zzso zzso 21 zzso zzso growth of all available in zzso models of zzso and human zzso cell lines, while remaining nontoxic to normally dividing zzso cells or mouse embryonic zzso We show that this compound delays the cell cycle and leads to cellular zzso Moreover, zzso can reduce zzso burden in a mouse zzso model, zzso the zzso potential as a novel zzso zzso
