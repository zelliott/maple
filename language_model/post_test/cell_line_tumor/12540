zzso is a zzso active zzso zzso regulated by zzso growth factors and zzso It has been implicated in the control of cell cycle progression and zzso and its zzso has been associated with various kinds of zzso and zzso zzso The activity of zzso is dependent on the zzso of several targets involved in transcription, cell cycle and zzso We have recently observed that zzso interacts with zzso protein zzso and zzso with zzso zzso in zzso synthesis zzso zzso have been shown to activate a zzso growth arrest zzso To investigate if zzso could have a role in the response to zzso stress, we induced zzso synthesis zzso in zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso We found that zzso zzso induced by zzso interference or treatment with inhibitor of zzso functions, causes a drastic zzso of zzso The lower level of zzso zzso an increase in the cell cycle inhibitor zzso and blocks cell proliferation even in the absence of zzso zzso restoring zzso level by zzso causes a recovery of cell zzso Our data indicate that zzso may act as a sensor for zzso stress independently of or in concert with the known zzso zzso
