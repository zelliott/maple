Global zzso and zzso profiling platforms have yielded important insights into the complex response to zzso radiation zzso Nonetheless, little is known about the ways in which small cellular zzso zzso change in response to zzso Here, a zzso approach using zzso liquid zzso coupled with zzso zzso mass zzso was used to profile, over time, the zzso zzso of zzso cells exposed to zzso doses ranging from zzso to zzso zzso zzso data analysis of the positive zzso revealed zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso cells and identified certain constituents of the zzso zzso as being significantly depleted as early as 1 h after zzso zzso mass zzso was used to confirm zzso zzso Many of the depleted zzso are associated with zzso stress and DNA repair zzso Included are reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Similar zzso were performed with a transformed zzso cell line, zzso and it was found that a subset of the identified zzso zzso were effective in zzso dose zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso algorithm, which is based on zzso zzso was used to zzso dynamic global changes in the zzso zzso that resulted from zzso It revealed zzso zzso of zzso sharing the same trends in concentration change across radiation zzso zzso zzso the application of zzso analysis to the field of zzso promises to increase our understanding of cellular responses to zzso such as zzso
