Human zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso gene expression is regulated by zzso and zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to determine whether specific zzso zzso directly regulate zzso gene zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso region zzso revealed five putative zzso binding zzso The zzso zzso zzso significant zzso blockade of zzso activity in human zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso also exerted zzso and zzso zzso repression in an zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated that zzso of zzso into primary human zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso NO synthesis in a zzso manner that was zzso by a specific zzso zzso zzso (but not other zzso abolished zzso zzso protein in human zzso but had no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso sites at zzso or zzso zzso in the zzso zzso increased reporter gene zzso Furthermore, intact zzso binding sites at zzso or zzso positions were required for zzso suppression by zzso zzso stimulation directly increased zzso levels in human zzso zzso of zzso inhibitor zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso protein and increased NO synthesis in zzso in human zzso Finally, zzso or zzso injection in zzso in mice increased zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these data identify that zzso directly regulates zzso gene expression by binding in the zzso to produce a zzso zzso These findings suggest dual regulation of zzso gene expression where zzso induce zzso zzso and also increase zzso leading to zzso zzso in a zzso zzso
