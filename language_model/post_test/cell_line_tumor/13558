zzso zzso a large family of naturally occurring zzso isolated from various species of the plant zzso zzso have been found to exhibit significant zzso against a variety of cancer zzso Previous studies showed that these compounds could act on the zzso zzso and block the corresponding electron transport chain and terminate zzso zzso However, more details of the mechanisms of action remain zzso In this study we tested the effects of a set of zzso of zzso zzso on some cancer cell lines, and report that among them zzso exhibits the most potent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activates zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso complex 1 zzso signal pathway, leading to growth zzso and zzso of colon cancer zzso zzso zzso compound C and zzso zzso while zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proliferation suppression and subsequent zzso of colon cancer zzso zzso enhances the zzso depletion and zzso zzso caused by zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso and zzso zzso also zzso zzso agent zzso zzso of zzso and zzso with this drug in suppression of proliferation and induction of zzso of colon cancer zzso These data indicate that zzso is a new zzso inhibitor which exhibits therapeutic zzso in colon zzso
