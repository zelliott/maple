zzso identification of zzso zzso in patients with cancer is crucial to prescribe suitable treatment regimens that can improve recurrence-free zzso Although some new imaging technologies for zzso staging have been developed, such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso imaging, sound technologies for zzso differentiation of zzso and inflamed zzso zzso remain zzso In this study, we illustrate the feasibility of using a zzso fluorescent probe zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso during surgery, highlighting abnormalities related to inflammation and tumor zzso with signal enhancement and reduction methods using this zzso zzso was identified by zzso screening of fluorescent zzso libraries zzso with a zzso zzso It selectively zzso zzso and zzso cell populations in zzso by zzso imaging and flow zzso as well as in zzso for zzso zzso zzso this study provides zzso proof of concept for an zzso imaging platform to accurately assess zzso zzso status, eliminating the need for invasive zzso zzso that can contribute to complications of cancer zzso
