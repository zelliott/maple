The ability to pair the regulation of metabolism and cellular zzso with zzso and tumor zzso genes provides cancer cells with a growth and survival advantage over normal zzso We investigated the mechanism of cell death induced by zzso zzso a sugar analog with dual activity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in acute zzso leukemia zzso We found that, unlike most other cancer zzso in which zzso only zzso cell proliferation under zzso conditions, ALL zzso undergo zzso zzso cell lines and primary cells exhibited sensitivity to zzso whereas zzso cells were relatively zzso revealing zzso differences within ALL zzso zzso with zzso a sugar essential for zzso zzso zzso zzso ALL cells, indicating that zzso of zzso zzso and induction of zzso stress and the unfolded protein response zzso is the zzso mechanism of zzso zzso in zzso zzso ALL cells exhibit zzso of zzso zzso and induction of zzso zzso markers zzso zzso zzso and zzso which correlate with zzso zzso and zzso In addition, we find that zzso and genetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso ALL cells to remarkably low doses of zzso zzso zzso inducing zzso cell death and overcoming the relative resistance of zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso ALL cells by zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ALL cell death under zzso by inducing zzso stress, and zzso and zzso traditionally thought to operate predominantly on the zzso pathway, zzso regulate zzso activity to determine cell death or zzso
