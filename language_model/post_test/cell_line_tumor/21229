zzso repair zzso is the most versatile mechanism of DNA repair, recognizing and dealing with a variety of zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We investigated the influence of an zzso drug, zzso on the efficacy of zzso in removing zzso DNA zzso zzso is used mostly in the treatment of chronic zzso leukemia and zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is a hallmark of this zzso zzso activity was examined in the zzso cell lines zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso origin, respectively, as well as in zzso cells, which do not express zzso A zzso zzso parental zzso cell line and its counterpart zzso with the zzso gene were also zzso zzso activity was assessed in the cell extracts by use of an zzso zzso as a zzso and by a modified zzso gel zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso Additionally, quantitative zzso was performed to evaluate the efficacy of the removal of zzso zzso from the zzso gene by intact zzso zzso obtained from these experiments indicate that zzso decreases the efficacy of zzso in zzso cells expressing zzso zzso zzso may overcome the drug resistance associated with increased DNA repair in zzso zzso
