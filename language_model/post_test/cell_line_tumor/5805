zzso is a cell zzso zzso and its zzso in breast zzso has been shown to correlate with poor zzso Most recent studies related to zzso and tumor progression have focused on its role in regulating cell cycle zzso However, less is known about how zzso zzso the zzso of breast cancer zzso In this study, we revealed that zzso enhances zzso stability by zzso zzso and zzso was shown to directly regulate zzso of the zzso factor zzso Further studies have shown that zzso of zzso in breast cancer cells enhances zzso whereas its zzso zzso zzso in mouse models, and the effects of zzso on breast cancer cell zzso are independent of cell proliferation and zzso Furthermore, we have demonstrated that zzso zzso in breast cancer patient samples directly zzso with the zzso zzso Further insights into this critical role of zzso in the zzso of breast cancer cells and the trial of an zzso strategy in mouse models may reveal its therapeutic potential in prevention and treatment of breast cancer cell zzso
