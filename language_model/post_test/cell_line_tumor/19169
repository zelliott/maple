Evidence from human and animal studies support the hypothesis that psychological stress can be a zzso for the initiation and progression of zzso Recent work from our laboratory and others have shown that the zzso hormone, zzso zzso may influence tumor progression of some solid zzso tumors including zzso zzso zzso and zzso cancer by modulating the expression of zzso and zzso factors, such as vascular zzso growth factor zzso In this study, we determined whether zzso can likewise zzso the expression of zzso in a zzso zzso multiple myeloma zzso a cancer of plasma zzso Three zzso cell lines, zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The presence of zzso and zzso receptors zzso was assessed using Western zzso zzso were treated with 0, 1, and 10 zzso zzso for 1, 3, 6, and zzso and the levels of zzso in culture zzso were measured by zzso zzso of cell zzso revealed the presence of zzso and zzso in all three zzso cell zzso However, these zzso cell lines exhibited varying degrees of zzso regulation of zzso expression with zzso (the only zzso cell line among the three) exhibiting the most significant zzso followed by zzso cells and then zzso The data suggest that the ability of zzso to regulate the expression of zzso is not limited to solid zzso tumors and suggests a possible regulatory role of zzso stress hormones in zzso zzso
