zzso zzso is an zzso zzso that converts zzso acid to zzso and it is hypothesized to induce zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Our previous data also indicated that a higher expression level of zzso was correlated with zzso cancer zzso The zzso protein was detected in the zzso cavity of zzso cancer and the surrounding zzso zzso The usefulness of the zzso gene as a gene therapy target and diagnostic marker remains zzso In this study, a method using zzso and real-time zzso followed by zzso zzso real-time zzso was established and used to detect the expression of zzso in serum samples of nude mice with zzso zzso In addition, we established a zzso gene stable zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso interference zzso technology and established an zzso zzso cancer zzso mouse zzso We found that the zzso invasion and zzso of zzso zzso cells were attenuated compared with zzso zzso zzso experiments also demonstrated that zzso in the zzso zzso zzso cancer cells was zzso The whole body optical imaging revealed that the zzso zzso cells had an zzso ability to develop zzso in the zzso zzso lungs or liver zzso The improved zzso zzso zzso detected significantly lower zzso protein levels in the serum samples of the zzso zzso group compared with those of the zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, our results indicated that the zzso of zzso expression suppressed the proliferation and invasion of zzso cancer cells both zzso and zzso This study also demonstrated that zzso zzso in zzso reduced the zzso potential of zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a promising marker for the diagnosis of zzso zzso and a potential therapeutic target for zzso zzso
