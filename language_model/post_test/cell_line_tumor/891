We confirmed that the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso can substitute for zzso zzso sensitivity in clinical zzso cancer zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso of susceptible genes other than zzso will be desired for prediction or treatment of zzso We initially established conditions for the zzso zzso system in zzso to compare the growth zzso rate and zzso activity in 18 cases of zzso zzso activity levels were zzso with zzso sensitivity in the zzso ( zzso In 18 zzso cases, 4 cases of high sensitivity and 3 cases of low sensitivity to zzso were compared to analyze expression profiles of zzso genes on zzso zzso zzso As a result, a cluster of genes related to the sensitivity were identified and another cluster of genes related to the zzso of zzso were also zzso We determined that zzso expression can precisely predict zzso sensitivity in zzso and found zzso related zzso
