zzso zzso are versatile regulators of cell shape that act on the zzso zzso Studies using zzso zzso zzso have shown that, in some cells, zzso and zzso regulate the formation of zzso and zzso respectively at the leading edge, whereas zzso mediates contraction at the rear of moving zzso However, recent reports have described a zone of zzso zzso at the front of cells undergoing zzso In this study, we use a zzso zzso zzso to show that zzso zzso zzso to the leading edge of zzso zzso zzso of zzso or ROCK enhanced zzso yet markedly inhibited cell zzso these changes correlated with a marked zzso of zzso at the cell zzso Surprisingly, whereas zzso zzso in control zzso cells is zzso and zzso the opposite pattern is observed in zzso cells after zzso of zzso Thus, zzso and ROCK suppress zzso zzso at the leading edge, and zzso of ROCK causes a switch between zzso and zzso as the dominant zzso zzso driving zzso in zzso zzso These data describe a novel role for zzso in zzso signaling by zzso and zzso
