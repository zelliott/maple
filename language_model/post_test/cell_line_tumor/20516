zzso zzso C virus zzso infection is strongly associated with insulin resistance and diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso involved in the initiation of zzso in the zzso Increased zzso expression of zzso has been implicated in insulin zzso We investigated whether zzso of zzso levels following zzso infection zzso zzso zzso insulin zzso 

zzso zzso were expressed in zzso cells followed by analysis of zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso was robustly induced in zzso infected zzso zzso induction was accompanied by an elevated expression of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso The induction of zzso is zzso dependent, since zzso treatment zzso zzso and zzso zzso and decreases zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso resulted in a significant reduction of zzso levels in zzso full length zzso cells, emphasizing the central role of zzso in the exaggerated zzso response observed in zzso zzso Treatment of zzso zzso cells with the zzso zzso resulted in reduction of zzso levels, suggesting that zzso zzso stress promoted zzso zzso Finally, both zzso and zzso zzso levels were significantly elevated in liver samples of zzso infected patients, highlighting the clinical relevance of these zzso 

zzso is robustly induced following zzso infection, resulting in an zzso zzso response, thereby linking zzso infection to zzso insulin zzso Our results suggest that zzso is a potential molecular target for the treatment of zzso insulin zzso
