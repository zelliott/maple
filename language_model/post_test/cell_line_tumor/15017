In this paper we zzso a series of zzso and zzso zzso polystyrene zzso with zzso size and surface properties by conventional and seed emulsion zzso zzso They are characterized by dynamic light scattering zzso and transmission electron microscope zzso zzso the content of zzso and zzso groups on the surface of the particles are determined accurately by zzso zzso and zzso technique zzso zzso the toxicity of zzso modified polystyrene particles was tested in zzso zzso cell line and the results showed the degree of the toxicity is zzso to the zzso content of the zzso suggesting the zzso group is responsible for the toxicity of the zzso zzso those particles were labeled by fluorescent dye and zzso fluorescent zzso experiment showed that the particles can be well absorbed by zzso
