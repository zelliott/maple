zzso gene expression requires the ability to follow the fate of individual zzso Here we use a cellular system for monitoring zzso zzso zzso to characterize the movement in real time of single zzso complexes zzso in the nucleus of living zzso zzso This mobility was not directed but was governed by simple zzso Some zzso were partially corralled throughout the zzso nuclear environment, but no zzso at zzso zzso was zzso Following energy zzso zzso motion of zzso was observed in a highly zzso nuclear zzso movements were constrained to zzso zzso and excluded by newly formed zzso zzso This observation resolves a controversy, showing that the energetic requirements of nuclear zzso trafficking are consistent with a zzso zzso
