A novel zzso activity, which is directly regulated with cell proliferation is a candidate to regulate the abundance of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in human zzso zzso This activity, which we term zzso activity, can also cleave a subset of zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso is a novel zzso distinct from any of the previously characterized human zzso We show that zzso is active in a variety of cell zzso its activity is associated with the proliferation of the human zzso line, zzso and is not inhibited by the broad spectrum zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso has a native molecular mass of approximately zzso zzso Furthermore, the activity of zzso does not change during zzso induced by either zzso of zzso or exposure of cells to zzso The uniqueness of zzso is demonstrated by the fact that none of the human zzso tested zzso are able to cleave a specific zzso zzso zzso and that an zzso modified zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is unable to inhibit zzso but is a good inhibitor of zzso zzso This supports a hypothesis zzso zzso is a currently unidentified zzso zzso which regulates the abundance of zzso in a zzso zzso
