An animal model of pancreatic cancer that is large enough to permit imaging and zzso would be desirable for zzso zzso to develop novel therapies for pancreatic zzso The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that the zzso rabbit model of pancreatic cancer could be developed as a suitable platform to test future zzso zzso 

The authors implanted and grew three pancreatic zzso tumors per rabbit in six zzso zzso resonance zzso imaging was performed at 2 weeks to confirm tumor zzso At 3 weeks, the authors selectively zzso the zzso artery under guidance of zzso digital zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging, zzso MR imaging, and zzso zzso zzso zzso MR imaging were then zzso After imaging, tumors were confirmed at zzso and zzso zzso sizes at 2 and 3 weeks were compared with a paired zzso test zzso zzso zzso 

zzso pancreatic tumors were grown in all six zzso The difference between tumor sizes at 2 and 3 weeks zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was significant zzso zzso zzso All tumors were confirmed to be located within pancreatic tissue via zzso zzso zzso and zzso MR imaging were successful in five zzso zzso and zzso MR imaging were successful in all six zzso 

The zzso rabbit model of pancreatic cancer is zzso as verified by imaging and zzso zzso and may be a suitable platform to test future zzso zzso
