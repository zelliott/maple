High expression of zzso a protein zzso zzso is proved to be associated with zzso zzso zzso in gastric zzso from previous zzso In this paper, we examined the relationship between zzso expression and zzso zzso in gastric zzso We applied the artificial zzso zzso which is based on the zzso zzso zzso to efficiently silence the target gene expression of zzso in zzso gastric cancer cells at both zzso and protein zzso Then we observed that, in zzso zzso significantly depressed the zzso cell invasion and migration independent of cellular zzso In zzso zzso zzso effectively suppressed the growth of zzso zzso and improved the prognosis in nude zzso zzso we concluded that artificial zzso can zzso the expression of zzso and that zzso might be a potential therapeutic target for gastric cancer zzso zzso
