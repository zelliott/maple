zzso zzso zzso zzso are usually fatal zzso originating from zzso duct zzso However, many zzso cells are shown to be resistant to zzso drugs, which induce cell zzso The role of zzso and the therapeutic value of zzso genes are largely unknown in zzso Here, we showed that zzso was activated in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, expression of zzso genes and their zzso activity were higher in clinical zzso specimens than that in normal zzso separated by laser capture zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso or zzso zzso cells showed detention of proliferation and increase of zzso during zzso zzso In addition, zzso inhibitor treatment or zzso of zzso 1 suppressed tumor growth and zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso cell zzso In conclusion, our data showed that zzso is activated in zzso and zzso of zzso may lead to cell zzso and enhance chemotherapy zzso
