Previous studies showed zzso C binding protein 1 zzso participating in the zzso zzso zzso gene regulation via binding to a zzso zzso DNA zzso In this report, we therefore investigate the molecular basis of zzso regulating the zzso gene zzso Various truncated zzso including one domain zzso zzso variable or zzso two- zzso zzso or zzso or zzso zzso zzso or zzso were zzso The zzso zzso binding abilities of these truncated zzso were examined using zzso mobility shift zzso zzso zzso domain possessed a strong zzso zzso binding zzso zzso domain displayed no zzso and zzso or zzso domain possessed a weak zzso zzso binding zzso zzso of zzso zzso indicated an additive effect of zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso a zzso zzso displayed as strong zzso binding as that of zzso suggesting zzso of zzso zzso and variable zzso for the binding zzso zzso analysis demonstrated zzso zzso exhibiting no zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed approximately zzso activity, while zzso zzso displayed zzso of full-length zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggested that no single domain possessed sufficient functional activity to serve as an independent zzso domain, and the combination of three sequential zzso was necessary for its optimal activity to activate the zzso zzso zzso In zzso our data suggested that zzso of three sequential zzso is essential for zzso functioning as a zzso gene zzso Various ways in which this zzso could occur are zzso
