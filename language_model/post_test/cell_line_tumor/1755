zzso zzso zzso inhibitor 2 zzso was initially identified as a regulator of the zzso family of zzso Our recent works suggest that zzso promotes tumor growth and zzso zzso as well as enhances zzso in gastric zzso Here, we delineate the mechanism by which zzso promotes gastric cancer cell invasion and zzso using two-dimensional gel zzso zzso on proteins derived from a zzso zzso human gastric cancer cell line and control zzso zzso expressed proteins were identified using zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso In total, 47 differential protein spots were zzso 33 were zzso and 14 were zzso by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso D, zzso zzso and zzso proteins was validated by Western zzso zzso zzso analysis using small interference zzso zzso directed against candidate genes reveals the need for zzso and zzso in zzso cancer cell invasion and zzso D and zzso in zzso zzso in gastric cancer zzso These data extend our understanding of the genes that act downstream of zzso during the progression of gastric cancer and the acquisition of zzso
