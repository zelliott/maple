zzso derivatives have been widely used for chemotherapy in patients with various zzso but intrinsic and acquired drug resistance is major drawback to be zzso In the present study, we demonstrated that simultaneous treatment with zzso and zzso acid induced zzso of zzso cells, whereas neither agent alone could efficiently induce zzso This induction of zzso was associated with loss of the zzso membrane potential and was zzso zzso Further investigation showed that concurrent treatment modulated the expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression was induced in zzso cells treated with zzso alone, but not in cells treated simultaneously with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells completely suppressed the induction of zzso even with simultaneous zzso On the other hand, efficient induction of zzso was achieved by treatment with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso combined with zzso acid was more than additive for zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggest that simultaneous administration of zzso and zzso acid might be useful for zzso zzso
