zzso zzso zzso zzso show promise as a novel class of zzso agents and have shown the ability to induce zzso of tumor zzso To gain a better understanding of the action of zzso we conducted a functional gene screen approach named suppression of mortality by zzso rescue technique to identify the key genes responsible for the zzso killing zzso zzso Over 20 genes associated with zzso mortality were zzso One of the confirmed positive hits is zzso a putative zinc zzso zzso is significantly induced by treatment with zzso in a number of tumor cells, but not in normal zzso zzso of zzso suppressed zzso induced by zzso in tumor zzso Although zzso induced a slight increase in the free zzso zinc zzso zzso of zzso significantly enhanced the zzso zinc level, which was associated with resistance to zzso On the other hand, zzso of the cells with a specific zinc zzso zzso reversed the zzso resistance zzso by zzso of zzso However, the biological effects of zzso were abolished by addition of zzso zzso of zzso Taken together, the present study identifies zzso as a critical zzso responsible for zzso zzso The effect of zzso is, at least in part, zzso by affecting zzso zinc zzso which may be related to zzso of the zzso activity of the zzso 3 and expression of some zzso family zzso As such, these findings highlight a novel mechanism underlying the action of zzso that could be potentially useful in the clinical zzso
