There is a need for the development of new, safe and zzso drug therapies for the treatment of zzso zzso zzso breast zzso zzso is a second-generation zzso analog that exhibits potent zzso towards a variety of zzso breast cancer zzso zzso we have further examined the mechanism of this zzso activity in three different zzso breast cancer cell zzso The zzso studies demonstrated that zzso (1 zzso induced cell cycle arrest in the zzso phase of the cell zzso Moreover, zzso (1 zzso caused zzso of zzso cells to undergo zzso after 48 h and this effect was zzso This correlated with an increase in zzso zzso as shown by western zzso zzso (1 zzso also decreased zzso zzso and increased zzso in zzso zzso While in zzso and zzso cells zzso (1 zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso and zzso increased the stress zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso exhibited zzso potential in zzso as it inhibited zzso cell migration and the ability of these cells to form zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also orally zzso as it produced a peak plasma concentration of zzso zzso 5 zzso after oral drug zzso Thus, our findings provide evidence that zzso has potent zzso activity and has potential to be further developed as a drug for the treatment of zzso breast zzso
