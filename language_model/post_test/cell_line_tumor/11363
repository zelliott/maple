zzso is a potent inhibitor of tumor zzso In the preliminary studies, we developed a zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso In this study, we compared the zzso effects of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso both in combination and zzso 

The artificially zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso included a zzso site and was zzso into the zzso cancer cells by zzso Cell growth was investigated by the tumor cell growth chart, zzso zzso zzso activity detection zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso detection zzso In the in zzso study, zzso zzso cancer cells were zzso implanted into nude mice and the growth of tumor was zzso The zzso of the tumor zzso in the treated and control groups were zzso 

The cell growth chart showed that the cell population of the treated combination group decreased by zzso compared to the control zzso The zzso rate of the treated combination group was zzso zzso zzso whereas those of the individual zzso and zzso groups were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso activity detection using zzso zzso stain and zzso zzso zzso detection zzso the zzso effect was higher than the individual zzso effects zzso zzso zzso There were significant differences in the zzso of the solid tumor growth in the in zzso zzso 

Our findings indicated that zzso zzso zzso enhance the zzso effects of zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso We noted the synergistic effects of zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso
