Using zzso zzso zzso we identified that paired box gene 5 zzso is involved in human cancer zzso However, the function of zzso in gastric cancer zzso development is largely zzso We analyzed its zzso zzso biological functions and clinical application in zzso zzso was silenced in seven out of eight zzso cell zzso A significant zzso was also detected in paired gastric tumors compared with adjacent zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was closely linked to the promoter zzso status and could be restored with zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in silenced zzso cell lines zzso and zzso inhibited colony formation and cell zzso arrested cell cycle, induced zzso suppressed cell migration and invasion and zzso zzso in nude zzso zzso with the induction of zzso by zzso in zzso terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso zzso showed significantly enhanced zzso cells in zzso tumors compared with the zzso control zzso On the other hand, zzso of zzso by zzso hairpin zzso increased the cell viability and zzso The zzso function of zzso was revealed to be zzso by zzso downstream targets of tumor protein 53 zzso zzso zzso X zzso zzso zzso 1 and tissue zzso of zzso 1, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transition factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso directly bound to the promoters of zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso of zzso of primary zzso compared with zzso zzso of normal gastric zzso ( zzso zzso patients with zzso zzso had a significant poor survival compared with the zzso cases as demonstrated by Cox zzso model and zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso is a novel functional tumor zzso in gastric zzso zzso of zzso zzso can be zzso as an independent zzso factor in zzso
