The zzso zzso factor zzso is a novel zzso zzso It was zzso in human prostate cancer and other tumors zzso as the result of frequent zzso and loss of zzso zzso However, there is no data reporting the levels of zzso both zzso and protein in zzso zzso zzso We therefore detected zzso and expression of zzso in zzso zzso and further observed the effect of it on cell growth in zzso cell zzso 

We analyzed the zzso of zzso gene by direct DNA sequencing, and detected the expression of zzso by zzso and Western zzso in 23 zzso zzso and corresponding zzso zzso Loss of growth zzso effect of the zzso zzso zzso was characterized by in zzso growth zzso zzso flow zzso and Western zzso 

zzso zzso were found in 2 of 23 zzso zzso and one of zzso was zzso zzso of zzso zzso or protein was zzso in 8 zzso or 9 zzso of 23 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited cellular proliferation and prolonged zzso transition by inducing the expression of zzso following stable zzso into cultured zzso cells, but zzso zzso zzso zzso had no zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso may be involved in zzso of zzso
