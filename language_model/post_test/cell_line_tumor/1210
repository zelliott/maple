zzso a major zzso of T zzso promotes human zzso virus type 1 zzso entry via interactions with zzso receptors and the viral envelope zzso zzso Increased zzso levels in T zzso and the appearance of zzso zzso in AIDS patients have been reported zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of zzso regulation on zzso entry by utilizing a mouse cell line zzso which expresses exceptionally high levels of zzso zzso zzso cells bearing zzso zzso and/or zzso were highly resistant to zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso In contrast, these targets supported membrane fusion zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso function was not impaired by zzso zzso as indicated by zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Reduction in zzso levels of zzso target cells resulted in a significant recovery of zzso zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso in the plasma membrane blocks zzso zzso fusion by interfering with the lateral association of zzso zzso Our findings offer a novel mechanism of interplay between membrane lipids and receptors by which host cells may escape viral zzso
