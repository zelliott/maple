A large body of evidence indicates that the immune zzso controls zzso zzso zzso central nervous system zzso zzso are aggressive zzso growing in the central nervous system zzso To evaluate the role and characteristics of this zzso site in zzso zzso we compared the cellular and molecular immune zzso of growing zzso zzso B cells injected into the brain or the zzso In the brain, immune cells, including zzso cells and T zzso with a large proportion of zzso zzso box zzso zzso regulatory T cells, rapidly infiltrated the zzso zzso These populations also increased in number in the zzso The T cell zzso profiles in zzso mice were similar in the two sites, with zzso T helper type 1 zzso polarization after zzso zzso although some zzso zzso could also be zzso We demonstrated that these T cells have zzso activity in the zzso although less than in the zzso nude mice that received zzso cells zzso died significantly earlier than zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the brain is able to recruit all the major actors to mount a specific zzso immune response against zzso
