zzso zzso (formerly known as zzso zzso zzso I) is a zzso opportunistic pathogen which is considered to be associated with colon zzso It is thought that colon zzso or tumors are the main portal of entry for this zzso and that zzso zzso zzso zzso at the colon tumor cell surface are involved in bacterial adherence during the first stages of zzso In this study, we have shown that the zzso protein A zzso of zzso zzso is a genuine zzso bacterial surface protein that binds to zzso acid zzso of the zzso cell wall in a growth zzso zzso In addition, zzso was shown to be one of the major zzso proteins of zzso zzso able to bind to the zzso colon tumor cell lines zzso and zzso zzso although zzso levels of zzso appeared to contribute to zzso coating of additional zzso at the bacterial surface resulted in reduced binding to colon tumor zzso This may be explained by the fact that zzso zzso and zzso compete for the same binding site in zzso Altogether, this study implies that zzso serves as a zzso factor for bacterial zzso
