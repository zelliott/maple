zzso zzso (World Health Organization, grade IV zzso is the most common and most aggressive zzso primary brain zzso We report a novel cell line, designated as zzso which was established from a 56-year-old male patient with a surgically removed zzso zzso The zzso cell line was established in zzso and characterized using zzso and zzso zzso classical and molecular zzso zzso molecular studies and functional zzso using a zzso model in zzso zzso zzso was positive for zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso showed zzso only in a fraction of the zzso zzso and molecular zzso analysis revealed a zzso zzso with a modal zzso number from 88 to 91, and additional zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso and zzso unbalanced zzso Moreover, zzso showed amplification of the zzso and zzso genes whose zzso was observed at the zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso is zzso when implanted in zzso mice, and the cells obtained from the zzso showed the same zzso and zzso in zzso as the original cell zzso zzso represents a biologically relevant cell line to be used to investigate the molecular pathology of zzso zzso also to evaluate the efficacy of novel therapeutic drugs in zzso
