zzso gene mapped at zzso zzso region encodes a tumor zzso protein zzso which is frequently zzso in human zzso including skin zzso In order to clarify the importance of zzso zzso in melanoma, we examined the deletions of zzso and expression of zzso protein in eight zzso primary and zzso melanoma cell lines from human skin zzso zzso skin zzso were used as zzso zzso of entire zzso in the zzso gene were detected by zzso technique and expression of the zzso protein was examined by Western zzso and zzso zzso showed that the fragments from zzso zzso zzso and 3 in zzso gene were totally deleted in the zzso melanoma cell line, zzso and the zzso from zzso 3 was deleted in the zzso melanoma cell line, zzso zzso protein was strongly expressed in two of the primary zzso cell lines zzso and zzso The zzso protein was zzso expressed in one of the zzso melanoma cell lines zzso and negative in the other zzso zzso as compared to their matched primary melanoma cells zzso The zzso protein was strongly expressed in normal skin zzso zzso showed that zzso protein was mainly localized in the zzso of the melanoma cells and normal zzso if it was zzso zzso of zzso gene was uncommon and loss of zzso protein expression was common event in melanoma, especially in the later stages of zzso
