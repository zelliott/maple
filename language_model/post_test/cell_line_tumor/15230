A universal zzso method coupled with zzso zzso exponential amplification reaction zzso is developed for zzso fluorescent detection of multiple zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Taking advantage of the interesting feature of the fine-tuned zzso spectrum of fluorescent zzso silver zzso zzso our proposed zzso is designed such that the different zzso targets are transferred to the different zzso reporters via the zzso in which zzso zzso designed for different targets are employed as the amplification templates, zzso and zzso zzso as mechanical zzso and zzso targets as the zzso The produced zzso reporters act as templates for the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso which zzso to different target zzso This proposed method has been well validated on the multiplex detection of zzso and zzso as well as in practical zzso
