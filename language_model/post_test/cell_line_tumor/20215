Numerous zzso treatments for cancer are undergoing clinical trials or are already approved for zzso One particular area of interest is targeting mechanisms of immune zzso Using a zzso model of zzso we investigated the roles of regulatory zzso zzso transforming growth factor zzso and the negative regulator zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso in immune tolerance to zzso It was found that treatments targeting a single negative regulator zzso mechanism were not as effective against zzso as targeting multiple mechanisms zzso Most importantly, it was found that a combined triple treatment of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso soluble zzso resulted in long-term clearance of zzso and memory against zzso zzso These data suggest that clinical application of zzso against zzso may be improved by simultaneously targeting multiple mechanisms of immune zzso
