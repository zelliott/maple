The zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso has an important role in cell cycle zzso zzso expression of zzso is commonly associated with poor prognosis in many zzso including gastric zzso zzso zzso zzso may be an additional indicator of high-grade tumors and poor prognosis in zzso As chronic infection by zzso zzso is the most important risk factor for gastric cancer development, we evaluated the effects of zzso zzso on zzso expression and zzso in gastric cancer zzso zzso of gastric cells with zzso zzso induced zzso zzso expression and reduced nuclear zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso expression was associated with and dependent upon zzso of zzso at zzso and zzso zzso zzso accumulated in the zzso but zzso zzso affecting zzso or zzso were nuclear in zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso changes were secondary to zzso of cellular zzso zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso and dependent upon a functional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We investigated the clinical significance of zzso zzso zzso in zzso cases of zzso gastric cancer in tissue zzso In 97 cases zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed, and this was associated with increased mortality in zzso zzso These results show that zzso zzso infection zzso zzso zzso of zzso at zzso and zzso to cause zzso zzso zzso in gastric cancer, and that zzso zzso is an adverse zzso feature in gastric zzso This is the first demonstration of the zzso of a specific bacterial zzso factor that zzso regulates a host cell zzso zzso This is of particular significance, because zzso has both zzso and zzso activities, depending upon its zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso induced by zzso zzso may be an important zzso link between zzso zzso infection and gastric zzso
