Gross zzso disease zzso of the breast is reported to occur in zzso of women in the developed world and, although not zzso is thought to be associated with an increased risk of breast zzso zzso and growth factor concentration levels were measured in breast zzso fluid zzso to correlate them with their zzso activity in zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso were, as expected, significantly higher in type I than in type II zzso while transforming growth zzso 2 zzso showed higher levels in type II zzso Fifty per cent of the zzso samples zzso zzso incorporation into zzso cells while zzso inhibited this zzso In zzso cells, most zzso samples were zzso zzso zzso E1 and zzso zzso in zzso samples correlated significantly and positively with cell proliferation in zzso cells, whereas a significant negative correlation was found for zzso In zzso cells, only zzso and zzso exhibited significant positive zzso whereas a significant negative correlation was found for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso incubated under the same conditions had a zzso effect on zzso incorporation into zzso cells, whereas zzso inhibited this zzso zzso zzso E1 and zzso significantly zzso this zzso in zzso zzso 

The zzso action of zzso on cell proliferation in a model of human breast zzso cells could partly explain the increased zzso of breast cancer in zzso zzso
