zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso 2) is an important zzso responsible for diverse diseases in zzso and zzso In this study, we investigated the role of the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso 2 in zzso To assess the contribution of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso 2, an knockout zzso zzso unable to produce zzso was constructed, and the zzso level of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso strain were compared in an in zzso adherence zzso and zzso infection zzso The data showed that zzso zzso exhibited a significant decrease in adherence to the zzso cells zzso The zzso zzso strain was attenuated and could reduce mortality and morbidity in zzso infection zzso Furthermore, organ cultures showed that zzso plays a role in the colonization of the specific zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene into the knockout zzso zzso or incubated with zzso zzso restored its ability to adhere to the zzso cells zzso These findings suggested that zzso is required for the full zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso was considered as an attenuated zzso
