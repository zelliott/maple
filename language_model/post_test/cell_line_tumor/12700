The involvement of zzso in the regulation of fundamental cellular functions has placed them at the fore of ongoing investigations into the processes underlying zzso zzso expression patterns have been shown to be zzso in numerous human zzso including breast cancer, suggesting their probable involvement as novel classes of zzso or zzso zzso zzso The identification of zzso expressed zzso and zzso of their functional roles may provide insight into the complex and diverse molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso is located on zzso zzso and is part of a zzso family which are zzso in numerous zzso The aims of this study were to further examine the expression and functional role of zzso in breast zzso 

zzso expression was zzso in primary breast zzso zzso associated normal tissue and breast cancer cell lines using zzso zzso of function analysis was performed in breast cancer cells using zzso and the effect of zzso zzso on cell zzso zzso zzso and migration was zzso zzso zzso Low zzso zzso zzso were used to identify zzso genes in breast cancer cells zzso with zzso 

We demonstrate that zzso is zzso in breast cancer and expression zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso inhibited migration of breast cancer zzso This finding was substantiated by zzso of zzso from cells zzso zzso which showed zzso of several migration and invasion related zzso Specifically, the zzso protein zzso was confirmed as a target of zzso and zzso of this protein was confirmed with zzso 

These findings indicate that zzso targets zzso and may play a central role in the regulation of migration and zzso in breast zzso zzso this zzso may present an attractive target for therapeutic zzso
