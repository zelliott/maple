zzso is a component of the zzso zzso complex, which binds directly to the zzso zzso to facilitate zzso recruitment to zzso and hence protein zzso zzso expression of zzso has been found in up to 37% of human breast zzso and expression of a truncated zzso version of the mouse zzso protein leads to zzso transformation of normal zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso is a tumor zzso however, a recent study has reported that a reduction of zzso expression in breast cancer cells leads to reduced translation of zzso suggesting that zzso may in fact have an zzso role in breast zzso To gain a better understanding of the role of zzso in breast cancer, we have examined the effects of decreased zzso expression in an immortalized breast zzso cell line, zzso Surprisingly, we find that decreased expression of zzso causes breast zzso cells to undergo zzso transition zzso We show that zzso induced by a decrease in zzso expression zzso invasive and migratory properties to breast zzso cells, suggesting that regulation of zzso by zzso may have an important role in breast cancer zzso Furthermore, we show that reduced zzso expression in breast zzso cells causes a specific increase in the expression of the key zzso regulators zzso and zzso which occurs at both the zzso and zzso zzso Together, our data indicate a novel role of zzso in the regulation of zzso in breast zzso cells and support a tumor zzso role of zzso
