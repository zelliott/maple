zzso such as zzso have been reported to exhibit a wide range of biological activities related to their zzso zzso The objective of the present study was to investigate the protective effect of zzso on cell viability and zzso status of cultured zzso cells submitted to zzso stress induced by zzso zzso zzso of reduced zzso and zzso generation of zzso oxygen species and activity and gene expression of zzso zzso were used as markers of cellular zzso zzso zzso of zzso with 10 zzso zzso completely prevented zzso zzso leakage from the zzso zzso for 2 or 20 h with all doses of zzso zzso zzso prevented the decrease of reduced zzso and the increase of zzso evoked by zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso oxygen species generation induced by zzso zzso was significantly reduced when cells were zzso for 2 or 20 h with 10 zzso and for 20 h with 5 zzso zzso Finally, some of the zzso treatments prevented the significant increase of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities induced by zzso zzso Gene expression of zzso zzso was also affected by the treatment with the zzso The results of the zzso analyzed clearly show that treatment of zzso cells in culture with the natural dietary zzso zzso strongly protects the cells against an zzso zzso
