zzso zzso zzso 7 zzso is zzso in several human zzso however, its clinical implication in breast cancer zzso and zzso zzso zzso is still zzso In order to investigate the function of zzso in zzso BC cell zzso and zzso zzso expression in BC cell lines was zzso zzso signaling in highly invasive breast cancer cells was inhibited by a zzso zzso zzso an zzso against the zzso domain of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso This resulted in decreased zzso and zzso of BC zzso We further examined zzso expression in BC and zzso tissue of 128 BC patients by zzso and its correlation with BC related genes like zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso profiling in BC cell lines and primary tumors showed association of zzso with zzso zzso negative zzso zzso zzso data analysis confirmed this observation and classified zzso in a cluster with genes associated with zzso behavior of primary zzso zzso zzso expression was significantly different with respect to tumor size zzso zzso in BC and zzso involvement zzso zzso in zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso was related to shorter zzso zzso zzso zzso Our observations confirmed the transforming potential of zzso as well as its involvement in zzso and zzso of BC zzso zzso is highly expressed in zzso cell zzso It represents a novel zzso marker for BC patients and has potential therapeutic zzso
