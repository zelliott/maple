A hallmark of cancer is zzso DNA zzso consisting of global zzso and regional zzso of tumor zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso have been recognized as promising candidate zzso zzso Drug development has focused on DNA zzso zzso with the goal of zzso tumor zzso genes silenced by DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso a global DNA zzso zzso was Food and Drug Administration approved to treat zzso syndromes and is clinically tested for solid zzso In this paper, it was demonstrated that zzso zzso activated both silenced tumor zzso genes and zzso genes by zzso raising the concern that it would promote zzso zzso treatment increased the zzso of zzso breast cancer cell lines zzso cells and zzso and dramatically induced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso The hypothesis that the blocking of cellular transformation activity of DNA zzso inhibitor could be separated from the zzso activity was tested using short interfering zzso zzso targeted to the different DNA zzso zzso zzso Although depletion of zzso had the strongest effect on colony growth suppression in cellular transformation zzso it did not result in zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not induce cellular invasion in zzso and zzso zzso breast cancer cell zzso These data have implications on the design of new DNA zzso inhibitor and on the proper zzso of current zzso
