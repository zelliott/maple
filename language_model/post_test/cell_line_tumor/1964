We previously showed that within primary tumors there exist zzso of cells expressing stem cell zzso Using zzso and western zzso we examined the expression of stem cell markers zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso 4 zzso to determine their relationship with cell zzso Six human oral cancer cell lines were examined and a direct correlation was found between expression of these stem cell markers and zzso Poor expression of zzso and increased expression of zzso was also found in zzso and zzso expressing zzso zzso of the major signaling zzso zzso activated protein zzso zzso was greatest in the zzso and zzso expressing zzso These results suggest that expression of specific stem cell markers in tumors may help guide a zzso choice of zzso
