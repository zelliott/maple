zzso are strongly implicated in cancer but their specific roles and functions in the major zzso have yet to be fully zzso In this study, we defined the expression and function of zzso which we found to be zzso in zzso samples and zzso cells by zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso cell lines inhibited proliferation and zzso Using zzso and expression analysis, zzso was identified as a candidate target of zzso zzso zzso with zzso of zzso cloned downstream of the zzso gene showed reduced zzso activity in the presence of zzso providing strong evidence that zzso was a direct regulator of zzso zzso analysis further revealed that zzso was elevated in zzso and associated with survival of zzso Furthermore, we observed that zzso zzso resulted in effects similar to those with zzso zzso in zzso zzso In conclusion, our study demonstrates that zzso deregulation is common in zzso and restoration of its function zzso cell proliferation and invasion, suggesting that zzso may act as a zzso zzso
