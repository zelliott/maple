zzso virus zzso zzso rightward transcripts zzso also designated complementary strand transcripts or zzso have been demonstrated to contain several zzso forms in zzso zzso To date, however, little is known about the actual full-length zzso form and its zzso In the present study, we proved that six forms of zzso were present in zzso cell lines and various tissue specimens with different zzso infection zzso Of the zzso zzso zzso of four major zzso forms, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in all zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso of two minor zzso forms, zzso and zzso was rarely zzso or if at all, at very low expression zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso was transcribed at higher levels in zzso zzso In particular, zzso zzso was expressed abundantly in zzso zzso cells, including gastric zzso and zzso zzso in association with a zzso infection zzso zzso zzso The four major zzso forms were expressed much less in zzso lines with an integrated zzso zzso than in those with zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that at least six zzso forms can be expressed by zzso cells or zzso although the expression patterns or levels differ for different infection states such as zzso and zzso zzso
