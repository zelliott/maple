zzso zzso have been accepted as effective zzso zzso for gene delivery with low zzso unlike viral zzso However, the lack of organ or cell specificity sometimes zzso their application and the modification of zzso zzso has also shown successful improvements in achieving zzso targeting delivery and in promoting zzso gene transfer zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by a zzso zzso reaction, was designed for specific zzso gene zzso 

Due to the zzso properties of zzso the zzso could compact the zzso DNA zzso to form zzso complexes zzso The particle size and zzso potential of the zzso complexes with different zzso ratios were zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso The zzso I protection zzso indicated that the complexes can efficiently protect condensed DNA from zzso degradation by zzso zzso A zzso study indicated that the zzso exhibited less toxicity in comparison with zzso zzso Using zzso and zzso as model tumor cells, the cellular zzso of zzso was zzso 

It was found that cellular zzso of zzso in zzso cells with higher folate zzso expression was faster than that in zzso cells with a short incubation zzso zzso zzso and green fluorescent protein detection were used to confirm that zzso could be an effective gene zzso zzso efficiency of the zzso complexes in zzso cells was enhanced up to zzso compared with that of the zzso zzso However, there was no significant difference between the zzso efficiencies of the two complexes in zzso zzso zzso the zzso efficiency of zzso decreased with free zzso zzso in zzso zzso It was concluded that the increase in zzso efficiency of the zzso complexes was attributed to folate zzso zzso
