The human zzso is the main zzso for zzso zzso (the zzso and the source for both horizontal spread and transition to zzso Some clinical evidence indicates that zzso carriage is harder to eradicate with antibiotics than is zzso invasive disease, which may suggest that colonizing zzso exist in zzso communities that are more resistant to zzso While zzso zzso have been observed during symptomatic infection, their role in colonization and the role of host factors in this process have been less zzso Here, we show for the first time that zzso form highly structured zzso communities during colonization of the zzso zzso that display increased zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso grown on respiratory zzso cells exhibited zzso similar to those observed during colonization in zzso whereas zzso surfaces produced less ordered and more zzso zzso The importance of zzso cell interactions during zzso formation was shown using both clinical strains with variable colonization zzso and zzso zzso with impaired colonization characteristics in zzso In both cases, the ability of strains to form zzso on zzso cells directly correlated with their ability to colonize the zzso in zzso with zzso strains forming less structured and more zzso zzso on zzso cells, an association that was lost when grown on zzso zzso Thus, these studies emphasize the importance of zzso interactions in zzso zzso formation and provide the first experimental data to explain the high resistance of zzso colonization to zzso by zzso
