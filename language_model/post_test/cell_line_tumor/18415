We report here the identification and an initial characterization of a novel cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a longest open reading frame zzso comprised of zzso zzso zzso representing a approximately zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso and protein levels were relatively high during the zzso phase of the cell cycle in zzso 435 breast cancer zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso in zzso cells led to an increase in the number of cells in zzso phase and enhanced activity of zzso a downstream zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso 231 breast cancer cells also led to an increase in the number of cells in zzso phase ( approximately zzso indicative of zzso The examination of the paired sets of human normal and tumor zzso revealed that the zzso zzso level was significantly high in normal breast and kidney zzso as compared to the corresponding primary tumor zzso ( zzso breast, zzso and zzso zzso zzso with these zzso zzso protein expression zzso zzso was high in a majority of the normal zzso zzso examined as compared to the matched zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that the zzso gene expression is likely to be associated with normal cell growth and zzso
