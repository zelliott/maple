The high prevalence of zzso zzso and importance of the zzso zzso downstream of activated zzso in pancreatic zzso zzso zzso emphasize the importance of identifying novel methods by which to zzso target these zzso It was recently demonstrated that zzso of zzso zzso by Aurora A zzso zzso is critical for zzso zzso We sought to evaluate the zzso inhibitor zzso as a potential indirect zzso therapy for zzso We used a zzso zzso zzso zzso and determined that zzso zzso zzso levels were elevated in a subset of zzso cell lines and human tumors relative to zzso normal zzso zzso of zzso on zzso growth in zzso cell lines and growth of zzso zzso zzso were zzso with a subset of cell lines and zzso showing zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso zzso levels in zzso cell lines or zzso tumors did not correlate with zzso zzso However, we identified zzso as a possible early zzso zzso for response to zzso in zzso These results indicate that zzso treatment may be effective for a subset of patients with zzso independent of zzso zzso zzso zzso may be an effective zzso zzso to identify response early in the course of zzso
