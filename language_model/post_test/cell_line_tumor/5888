The zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso can promote cancer initiation and progression in various types of solid zzso However, their role in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso has not been zzso In this study, we found that the expression levels of zzso and zzso but not that of zzso were significantly higher in zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso A high level of zzso expression was significantly correlated with a shorter overall survival in a cohort of 81 patients with zzso and the zzso with zzso stage tumor zzso test, P zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in seven zzso cell lines compared with two immortalized zzso cell zzso zzso zzso reduced cell proliferation and suppressed zzso growth, migration, and invasion in zzso cells in zzso In addition, zzso zzso in zzso cells resulted in a zzso of zzso and zzso zzso 13, whereas a significant positive correlation in the expression levels was observed between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and between zzso and zzso zzso 13 in the human specimens zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Moreover, zzso modulated the sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso probably via reduced activity of the zzso zzso target of zzso complex 1 zzso on zzso zzso In conclusion, our results suggest that zzso plays an important role in the progression of zzso
