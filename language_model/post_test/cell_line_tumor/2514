zzso memory involving zzso T cells is a hallmark of an zzso zzso immune response and constitutes a critical component of protective zzso zzso approaches that enhance long-term T cell memory would, for the most part, zzso vaccines and enhance host protection against infectious diseases and, perhaps, cancer zzso A better understanding of the cellular programs involved in the zzso T cell response has led to new approaches that target the magnitude and quality of the memory T cell zzso In this article, we show that T cells from zzso transgenic mice for the zzso of influenza virus zzso exhibit the distinct zzso expansion, contraction, and zzso an zzso T cell response when exposed in zzso to the zzso zzso zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso family zzso administered at low doses during the expansion or contraction zzso increased zzso central memory zzso T cells and zzso production but suppressed immunity when added during the zzso zzso These effects by zzso were not accompanied by the expected decline of zzso family zzso but were accompanied by zzso target of zzso suppression and/or zzso via another zzso Increased central memory cells by zzso were zzso in mice using a zzso influenza zzso thus zzso the importance of dose and timing of the inhibitor in the context of memory T cell zzso Finally, vaccine plus zzso treatment showed better protection against tumor zzso The zzso effects on zzso T cells by a low dose of zzso might afford better protection from pathogens or cancer when combined with zzso
