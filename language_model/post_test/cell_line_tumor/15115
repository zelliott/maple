zzso of the cell cycle and zzso instability are common features of cancer cells and various mechanisms exist to preserve the integrity of the zzso and guard against zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso promotes cell cycle progression and prevents zzso instability through zzso and degradation of zzso zzso and zzso during S phase of the cell cycle and following DNA zzso Two recently published studies report the zzso degradation of zzso via the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in association with the zzso specificity factor and tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso The newly identified zzso zzso the activity of zzso zzso on zzso and zzso and regulates cellular response to zzso exit from the cell cycle and cellular zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso also promotes the degradation of zzso during an zzso cell cycle to promote efficient progression through S and G zzso zzso of the cell zzso We discuss how this new method of regulating the abundance of zzso zzso in various cellular zzso
