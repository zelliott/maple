zzso factor 4 zzso is a zzso factor that zzso in both tumor suppression and zzso To determine the association of zzso with zzso we integrated data assembled in the zzso database and discovered a decrease in zzso gene transcripts in breast zzso Further analysis of the database also showed a correlation between zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells elevated the growth rate of these cells in the presence of zzso zzso we examined the interaction between zzso and zzso and found that zzso bound to the zzso region of zzso zzso thus zzso the binding of zzso to zzso response elements in promoter regions, resulting in a reduction in zzso target gene zzso Earlier studies have reported that zzso is zzso activated by zzso following DNA zzso We also showed that zzso of zzso decreased the zzso activity of zzso by zzso zzso zzso Our studies discovered a novel molecular network between zzso zzso and zzso As both zzso and zzso are involved in cell growth and zzso these results may explain why zzso possesses both tumor zzso and zzso functions in breast zzso
