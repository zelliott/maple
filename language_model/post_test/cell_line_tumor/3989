zzso inhibitor zzso therapy leads to remarkable anti melanoma responses, but the initial tumor shrinkage is commonly incomplete, providing a zzso for subsequent disease zzso zzso signaling may zzso early zzso resistance and influence the selection pattern for genetic zzso causing late, acquired zzso We show here that zzso (or zzso + zzso therapy in patients frequently led to rebound zzso zzso zzso levels in their zzso early zzso In cell lines, zzso treatment led to rebound levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso domain zzso and zzso zzso expression limited this zzso zzso zzso which could be rescued by the introduction of a zzso zzso zzso known to zzso acquired zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance via amplification of zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso protein zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso growth dependency on zzso or zzso Thus, zzso or genetic zzso of zzso critically zzso in melanoma survival during zzso zzso
