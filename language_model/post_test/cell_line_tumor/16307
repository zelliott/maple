The zzso of zzso zzso detection between the amplification zzso zzso zzso zzso and direct sequencing was evaluated with clinically available zzso zzso specimens of zzso zzso zzso 

zzso DNA from 120 zzso specimens was examined by the amplification zzso zzso zzso zzso and direct zzso DNA zzso of zzso and zzso zzso genes were prepared from the peripheral blood and the zzso human colon cancer cell line for the model zzso 

zzso zzso was identified in 50 samples zzso by the amplification zzso zzso zzso zzso and 42 samples zzso by direct zzso zzso between the two methods was observed for samples with smaller amounts of zzso zzso The sensitivity of direct sequencing was impaired by the decrease in template DNA and zzso chain reaction cycles in the experimental zzso 

zzso sensitivity of direct sequencing caused by insufficient zzso chain reaction amplification resulted in biased zzso between direct sequencing and amplification zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction conditions satisfactory for amplifying tens of zzso copies of zzso DNA to the zzso level might be necessary to ensure the zzso of the direct zzso method employed for zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso
