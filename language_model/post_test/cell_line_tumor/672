In order to identify potential zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at an early stage of the drug discovery process, a zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso for the human zzso X zzso zzso in zzso cells has been implemented and zzso with a viability end point for data zzso as part of a Lead zzso portfolio of zzso As a routine part of Lead zzso operations, zzso are periodically evaluated for utility as well as for potential improvements in technology or zzso We used a recent evaluation of our zzso zzso as a model for the application of zzso zzso process analysis to zzso zzso zzso and zzso This resulted in the development of a zzso zzso homogeneous zzso simultaneously detecting zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso In order to multiplex fluorescent and zzso zzso modifications to each zzso were necessary, which included zzso of multiple zzso parameters such as cell density, plate type, and zzso zzso zzso a set of compounds including known zzso compounds and zzso zzso were used to validate the zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso correlate well with those from the zzso zzso formats measuring zzso zzso and viability zzso Implementation of the zzso zzso for routine compound profiling provides improved data quality, sample zzso cost savings, and resource zzso
