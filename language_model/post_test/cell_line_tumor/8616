In an attempt to develop potent zzso agents, a series of zzso zzso zzso were zzso and characterized using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The compounds were screened for zzso activity against three human cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was observed for several members of the zzso The compounds zzso 4, zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso were active zzso agents in all three cancer cell lines, with zzso values in the range of zzso zzso Further evaluation of some of these potent zzso compounds demonstrated their good safety profile in a normal cell line zzso zzso experiments showed a good correlation between the predicted glide scores and the zzso values of these zzso In zzso zzso studies revealed that these compounds can be used for second generation zzso
