The pancreatic zzso is an aggressive and devastating disease, which is characterized by zzso rapid zzso and profound resistance to actual treatments, including chemotherapy and zzso At the moment, surgical zzso provides the best possibility for long-term survival, but is feasible only in the minority of patients, when advanced disease chemotherapy is considered, although the effects are zzso Several studies have shown that zzso hormone, zzso zzso is able to promote or inhibit cell proliferation in a cell zzso zzso The aim of the present study is to investigate the ability of zzso to reduce the cell growth of the human pancreatic duct cell lines zzso and to increase the effect of zzso drugs at conventional zzso Three human cell lines zzso zzso and zzso have been used as experimental models to investigate the zzso effects on pancreatic zzso cell zzso The zzso and zzso cell proliferation was significantly reduced, while the hormone treatment was ineffective for zzso zzso The zzso cell growth zzso was also confirmed by fluorescent activated cell sorting analysis and by cell zzso zzso zzso A zzso effect of zzso and chemotherapy was demonstrated by cell kinetic experiments performed at different times and by the traditional zzso zzso We have showed that zzso hormone zzso and its combination with low doses of zzso zzso and zzso zzso is able to zzso the zzso action of these zzso zzso Treatment with zzso was, instead, largely zzso In conclusion, our data support the hypothesis that zzso and its combination with zzso and zzso may act in a zzso way on zzso zzso zzso
