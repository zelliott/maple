zzso of the zzso is a leading cause of zzso zzso accounting for an estimated 30,000 deaths per year in the United zzso Multiple studies have indicated that specific zzso zzso zzso may serve in the prevention and treatment of a variety of zzso including pancreatic zzso Recent studies had shown that the long-term use of high concentration of zzso zzso is not toxic free and may be limited due to serious gastrointestinal and cardiovascular side zzso The zzso efficacy of the zzso zzso has been demonstrated in several in zzso and animal zzso In this study we investigated whether zzso zzso the growth zzso effect of a zzso inhibitor zzso Pfizer, NY, zzso in human pancreatic cancer zzso 

zzso zzso high levels of zzso and zzso zzso low levels of zzso and zzso (no expression of zzso evaluated cell lines were exposed to different zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and their zzso Cell viability was by zzso zzso zzso was assessed by flow zzso and zzso expression was measured by Western zzso zzso 

In zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso on cell zzso The growth zzso was associated with zzso of proliferation and induction of zzso Western zzso analysis showed that zzso expression was zzso by the combination zzso 

zzso zzso zzso the growth zzso inserted by zzso in pancreatic cancer cells expressing zzso The synergistic effect was zzso through zzso of zzso This may enable the use of zzso at lower and safer zzso and may pave the way for a more effective treatment in this devastating zzso
