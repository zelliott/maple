The success of bone zzso transplantation in leukemia depends on zzso zzso effects, zzso by zzso T zzso zzso and natural killer zzso zzso These act by zzso or zzso zzso such as zzso B zzso whose only known inhibitor is zzso inhibitor 9 zzso Since zzso protects cells from zzso zzso may counteract zzso in zzso Our aim was to establish methods to analyze the expression and function of zzso 

We screened the most common pediatric ALL subsets, zzso zzso common, and cortical zzso for zzso zzso using a reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso approach which was correlated to zzso and functional methods established in cell lines and patient zzso 

In zzso zzso zzso resistance towards zzso and inhibited zzso zzso of zzso zzso In zzso ALL cells, zzso high and zzso low specimens were studied by flow zzso zzso in zzso zzso treatment and zzso zzso demonstrating zzso results and zzso target cell zzso Analysis of zzso in zzso from ALL patients showed differential zzso but no correlation with zzso 

Our data suggest that zzso in pediatric ALL is zzso zzso without close correlation to zzso Since zzso considerably alters zzso and killer cell sensitivity, it may strongly influence the efficacy of zzso zzso The approaches applied here will allow evaluation of the expression and function of zzso in larger series of zzso
