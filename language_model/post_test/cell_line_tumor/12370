To investigate the induction of zzso cell zzso and the suppression of zzso expression in cancer cells by sodium zzso zzso 

zzso of transformed human zzso vein zzso cells zzso cell line) was detected by flow zzso DNA zzso zzso and zzso zzso Western zzso analysis was applied for determination of zzso expression in cancer zzso zzso degradation by type IV zzso was measured by zzso zzso was used to detect the binding of type IV zzso with relevant zzso zzso 

zzso induced zzso cell zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso After treatment with 100 and 250 zzso X zzso of zzso for 48 zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso treated cells showed strong blue zzso and distinct changes of nuclear zzso such as zzso and the occurrence of zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso cells and prostate zzso zzso cells was reduced after zzso zzso The degradation activity of type IV zzso including zzso and zzso zzso by giant cell pulmonary zzso PG cells was inhibited by zzso in a zzso zzso zzso also reduced the binding of zzso zzso a relevant zzso zzso to type IV zzso 

zzso can induce zzso cell zzso and inhibit zzso expression as well as type IV zzso activity in cancer zzso zzso might be active in modulating tumor zzso and the zzso
