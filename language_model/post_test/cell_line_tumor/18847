The indefinite growth of cancer cells requires zzso zzso which, in the majority of zzso zzso is zzso via the zzso zzso The core components of zzso are a zzso reverse zzso zzso in human, zzso in zzso and an zzso zzso that contains the template for the zzso of zzso Fundamental differences in human and mouse zzso and zzso biology should be considered when using mouse models for the study of human zzso The responses to zzso zzso by the expression of a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso vary in human cells with different zzso zzso Only one similar study has been performed in a mouse cell line with short zzso zzso 7 zzso Thus, we asked whether the responses to zzso zzso are also zzso dependent in mouse cells by analyzing long-term stable expression of zzso in the zzso cell line zzso zzso 11 zzso A brief initial zzso zzso was insufficient to mediate zzso zzso and led to extremely rapid zzso zzso due to an increase in the level of expression of the zzso zzso Thus, mouse cells, in contrast to human cells may not tolerate zzso zzso by introduction of zzso independently of zzso zzso
