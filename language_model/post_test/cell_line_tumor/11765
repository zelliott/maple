Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of zzso deaths worldwide, including zzso Although zzso zzso zzso can detect small lung zzso such as those appearing as ground glass zzso it cannot differentiate between zzso and zzso zzso Previously, we have shown that single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging using zzso zzso zzso an imaging probe of zzso zzso is useful for the early detection of pancreatic cancer in a zzso pancreatic zzso zzso In this study, we aimed to assess the usefulness of zzso with zzso for the evaluation of the zzso of lung zzso 

Lung tumors were induced by a single zzso injection zzso zzso of zzso in male zzso zzso Twenty-six weeks after the zzso treatment, zzso was performed an hour after injection of zzso Following this, the zzso ratios of tumor to normal lung tissue were measured by zzso zzso in the excised lung zzso We also examined the expression of zzso zzso in mouse and human lung zzso 

zzso treatment induced 5 zzso 41 zzso and 12 zzso in the lungs of 8 zzso zzso zzso with zzso could clearly zzso lung zzso though we failed to detect small lung zzso like zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed significant zzso of zzso in all the zzso Moreover, tumor to normal lung tissue ratios increased along with the progression of zzso zzso examination using human lung tissue samples revealed clear zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso type B and zzso rather than zzso zzso zzso 

Although there are some limitations in evaluating the zzso of small lung tumors using zzso zzso with zzso might be a useful zzso imaging approach for evaluating the characteristics of lung tumors in mice, thus showing potential for use in zzso
