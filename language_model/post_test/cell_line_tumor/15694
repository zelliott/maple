Recently, the orphan zzso G zzso zzso 55 zzso has been proposed as a potential zzso zzso although controversy remains on its zzso zzso Current evidence suggests a role for zzso as a zzso for the zzso zzso zzso In this study, we show that zzso is expressed in several prostate and zzso cancer cell lines, both at the zzso and at the protein level, and that it has a critical role in regulating proliferation and zzso zzso We further show that zzso mediates the effects of zzso in prostate and zzso cancer zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso is able to induce calcium zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in these cells and that both pharmacological blockade of zzso and its zzso using specific small interfering zzso strongly zzso these zzso We further identify an zzso loop by which zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso pumped out of the cell by the zzso cassette zzso zzso and is then able to zzso zzso downstream of zzso All together, these data demonstrate a role of zzso and its zzso zzso in cancer cells in zzso an zzso loop that regulates cell zzso These findings may have important implications for zzso as a novel cancer zzso and for its zzso zzso as a potential therapeutic zzso
