The type I zzso growth factor zzso zzso is zzso involved in the control of cellular proliferation and zzso An internal zzso entry site zzso within the zzso zzso zzso region of the human zzso zzso helps to provide the tight control of zzso expression necessary for maintenance of normal cellular and tissue zzso The zzso maps to a discrete sequence of 85 zzso positioned just upstream of the zzso initiation zzso allowing the zzso to bypass the highly structured regions of the zzso as well as the upstream open reading zzso The authenticity of the zzso zzso has been confirmed by its sensitivity to deletion of the promoter from a zzso reporter zzso and its resistance in a zzso reporter construct to zzso of a viral 2A zzso We previously characterized zzso as a potent zzso of zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso C competes with zzso for binding the zzso zzso and enhances zzso translation initiation in a zzso zzso We observed changes in binding of zzso C versus zzso to the zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso in cellular environment or zzso zzso Furthermore, we have found distinct zzso in the pattern of protein binding to the zzso zzso in human breast tumor cells in which zzso zzso activity and relative zzso efficiency are zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso of the zzso zzso through changes in the activities of zzso zzso proteins could be responsible for zzso zzso in a proportion of human breast zzso
