It has been shown in zzso that the cell zzso of zzso a zzso of zzso zzso increases under zzso This is consistent with increased zzso zzso We have previously shown that in zzso heart ex zzso the rates of zzso of zzso and zzso zzso are both zzso In this study, we investigated this effect in tumors by comparing the zzso of zzso and zzso in hypoxic and zzso zzso 

Mice zzso bearing zzso human tumor zzso were injected with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso After 30, 60, and 120 zzso zzso zzso zzso 4) were taken and counted for zzso zzso zzso were frozen, zzso and exposed to zzso image plates to obtain a quantitative digital image of zzso zzso Sections were then stained to reveal tumor zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated viable and zzso regions, and zzso zzso detected zzso metabolism in hypoxic zzso The images of zzso zzso and zzso were then zzso and analyzed to assess zzso zzso throughout the tumor on a zzso zzso The zzso correlation zzso between the 2 zzso were zzso The relative amounts of zzso were then analyzed in viable and zzso regions and in zzso and hypoxic zzso 

zzso zzso for the 2 zzso were zzso A high zzso correlation zzso was obtained for the 2 zzso throughout the tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso indicating a highly similar zzso When the tumors were divided into viable and zzso regions, the ratio of mean counts per zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas for hypoxic versus zzso regions it was zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no significant difference in selectivity for zzso between the 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The tumor zzso of zzso in viable, zzso and zzso regions show that there was little change in the zzso of zzso throughout this time zzso This study extends previous in zzso work and confirms the selectivity of zzso for viable cells over zzso regions and for hypoxic cells over zzso regions in zzso
