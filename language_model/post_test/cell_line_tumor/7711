The development and progression of cancer is associated with disruption of biological zzso Historically studies have identified sets of signature genes involved in events ultimately leading to the development of zzso Identification of such sets does not indicate which zzso processes are zzso drivers and makes it difficult to identify key networks to target for zzso Using a comprehensive, integrated zzso approach, the authors identify the sonic zzso zzso zzso as the gene network that most significantly zzso zzso and zzso samples in human zzso zzso zzso The analysis reveals that the zzso zzso is commonly activated in the zzso samples and its activity most significantly zzso zzso from the zzso zzso The authors zzso validate these in zzso findings in the same zzso material using Western zzso zzso This analysis reveals that the expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels are much higher in most zzso zzso as compared to normal zzso It is also shown that zzso zzso of zzso gene expression resulted in a significant reduction of cell proliferation in a liver cancer cell line, zzso indicating that zzso plays a major role in promoting cell proliferation in liver zzso The zzso zzso is a key network underpinning zzso zzso which may guide the development of interventions for this most common form of human liver zzso
