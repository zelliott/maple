The zzso C virus zzso core protein is a structural component of the zzso and has been shown to zzso cellular signaling pathways by interaction with various cellular zzso In the present study, we investigated the role of zzso core protein in viral zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that the core protein binds to the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso zzso which encompasses the finger and palm zzso zzso interaction between zzso zzso and core protein led to zzso of zzso zzso synthesis activity of in zzso Furthermore, zzso of core zzso but not its derivatives lacking the zzso domain, suppressed zzso replication in a zzso cell line harboring an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso our results suggest that the core zzso through binding to zzso and zzso its zzso synthesis activity, is a viral regulator of zzso zzso zzso
