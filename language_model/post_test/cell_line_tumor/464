The zzso zzso tumor zzso and its family members, zzso and zzso function by zzso zzso zzso factor activity to limit the expression of genes required for cell cycle zzso Traditionally, it is thought that the RB family proteins repress zzso target gene expression through zzso with zzso at gene zzso However, whereas zzso zzso experiments have demonstrated zzso and zzso at zzso zzso RB zzso association has not been reliably zzso Here we used green fluorescent zzso proteins to rigorously explore the mechanism of zzso zzso repression relative to its zzso and zzso family zzso The use of live cell fluorescent imaging demonstrated that zzso zzso and zzso exhibit similar nuclear zzso Although these findings suggest a similar engagement with nuclear structures, zzso zzso approaches with multiple independent zzso failed to detect the association of RB with target gene zzso However, by employing zzso directed against green fluorescent zzso we could zzso the same zzso to assess zzso zzso and zzso zzso This approach demonstrated RB association with target gene promoters in a fashion analogous to zzso and zzso Extension of this technology demonstrated that direct RB zzso zzso promoter association to regulate zzso Thus, RB is associated with promoters in a manner similar to zzso and that association is modulated by zzso during cell cycle zzso
