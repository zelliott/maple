There is accumulating evidence that pancreatic zzso cells zzso promote the progression of pancreatic zzso zzso zzso are small zzso zzso acting as negative regulators of gene expression at the zzso zzso This study aimed to clarify the role of zzso in the interaction between zzso and pancreatic cancer zzso zzso cancer cells were zzso or indirectly zzso with zzso zzso were prepared, and zzso zzso zzso containing zzso for zzso human zzso was used to identify zzso expressed zzso zzso was identified as an zzso zzso by zzso with zzso zzso media of zzso activated zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression decreased migration, decreased the expression of zzso and zzso and increased the zzso expression of zzso in zzso cells zzso with zzso In conclusion, our results suggest a novel role of zzso in the interaction between zzso and pancreatic cancer zzso
