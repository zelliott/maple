zzso of zzso a zzso has been detected in various zzso including zzso However, the underlying mechanism of zzso zzso remains zzso In this study, we explored the role of zzso zzso in zzso expression in zzso zzso By zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso and zzso two zzso catalyzing zzso zzso were physically associated with the zzso promoter, and treatment with zzso a zzso zzso zzso suppressed zzso zzso on the zzso promoter and enhanced zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso and zzso by zzso could also induce zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso by zzso eliminated zzso cell zzso To investigate further whether any zzso factor was involved in zzso zzso zzso repression, we scanned the sequences of the zzso gene promoter and found two binding sites for zzso a zzso zzso By DNA pull-down and zzso zzso we showed that zzso directly bound the zzso promoter, and zzso zzso expression suppressed zzso zzso promoter zzso In contrast, zzso zzso by zzso enhanced zzso expression and inhibited zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso of zzso completely rescued the repressive effect of zzso on zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso our study indicates that the expression of zzso contributes to zzso zzso in zzso cells through zzso zzso and suppression of zzso zzso can provide new insight in zzso zzso
