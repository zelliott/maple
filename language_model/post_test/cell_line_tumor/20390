The zzso of zzso zzso remains zzso zzso cancer cells of varying zzso potential and zzso resistance show altered expression of plasma membrane zzso channels and unbalanced zzso zzso zzso zzso channels zzso are robustly expressed in zzso cells and function to regulate zzso zzso and cell volume for maintenance of zzso and tissue zzso in zzso differentiation and zzso zzso was recently identified as a zzso and it is of interest to determine whether zzso plays a role in development and zzso of prostate zzso Here we show that zzso zzso and protein are highly expressed in human zzso prostate cancer zzso and zzso cells by quantitative analysis of real-time zzso and Western zzso These findings were confirmed by zzso patch clamp recording of zzso and zzso cells with increased current density of zzso zzso zzso zzso further revealed zzso of zzso in human prostate cancer zzso which correlated with the clinical zzso stage and zzso zzso zzso with small hairpin zzso zzso targeting human zzso resulted in a significant reduction of zzso zzso and invasion of zzso cells using zzso colony formation, zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso injection of zzso zzso completely inhibited established tumor growth and survival in zzso nude mice implanted with zzso zzso Our findings provide compelling evidence that zzso of zzso zzso is involved in the zzso progression and zzso of zzso prostate zzso zzso zzso protein may therefore serve as a zzso and zzso of zzso zzso has potential for use in prostate cancer zzso
