zzso an zzso zzso is a chemical compound isolated from zzso zzso a Chinese traditional zzso We examined whether zzso could affect zzso in human lung zzso zzso zzso cells, and test whether and how the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso extra large zzso could off-set the effect of zzso on cell zzso The result demonstrated that zzso significantly induced zzso of zzso as shown by zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA fragmentation zzso zzso V zzso binding of zzso zzso and the zzso probe zzso using flow zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso increased both zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso levels, suggesting these two molecules maybe relate to the zzso effect of zzso The cells with zzso or zzso zzso showed an zzso of nuclear factor zzso B zzso zzso activity, accompanying a significant reduction of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso B by zzso which is a powerful inhibitor of zzso B, restored the ability of zzso to induce zzso in the cells zzso with zzso These data strongly indicated that the zzso effect of zzso on zzso was closely associated with the activity of zzso B, which was zzso by zzso and zzso In conclusion, zzso induced zzso in zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso could be significantly offset by zzso of either zzso or zzso zzso and zzso were able to increase the activity of zzso B, which was a known zzso zzso in human lung cancer zzso
