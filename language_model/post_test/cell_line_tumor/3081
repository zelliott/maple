zzso zzso T cells are required for the control of zzso C virus zzso zzso We investigated the extent to which different zzso functions of zzso T cells contribute to the zzso of viral zzso 

We developed a novel zzso model by zzso zzso the zzso gene into the zzso system, matching the zzso sequence of the zzso to the sequence targeted by an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was then measured to zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso T cells strongly inhibited viral zzso through zzso and zzso mechanisms, in a zzso zzso zzso replication was almost completely inhibited at an zzso ratio of zzso with significant zzso however, zzso viral zzso occurred at ratios as low as zzso zzso no zzso was observed at low zzso ratios, indicating a dominant effect of zzso zzso functions that was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that zzso gamma mediates the zzso zzso 

Only a very few zzso zzso T cells are required to inhibit zzso zzso zzso occurs primarily by zzso zzso zzso
