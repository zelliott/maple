In zzso models are indispensable study objects in the fields of cell and molecular biology, with advantages such as accessibility, zzso of the cell population, zzso and growth zzso The zzso cell line, originating from a colon zzso is a widely used in zzso model for small zzso zzso Cancer cells have an altered zzso making it difficult to zzso their zzso for the tissue from which they are zzso This study was designed to compare the protein expression pattern of zzso cells with the patterns of zzso zzso cells from human small and large zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso liver cells and TE zzso muscle cells were included too, the latter two as negative zzso 

zzso gel zzso was performed on each tissue and cell line protein zzso Principal component and cluster analysis revealed that global expression of zzso zzso scrapings differed from that of zzso zzso cell zzso Since all cultured cell lines clustered together, this finding was ascribed to an adaptation of cells to culture conditions and their tumor origin, and responsible proteins were identified by mass zzso When investigating the profiles of zzso cells and small zzso cells in detail, a considerable overlap was zzso 

Numerous proteins showed a similar expression in zzso cells, zzso cells, and both the zzso zzso of which some appear to be characteristic to human zzso zzso in zzso In addition, several biologically significant proteins are expressed at comparable levels in zzso cells and small zzso zzso indicating the zzso of this in zzso zzso zzso cells, however, appear to zzso as well as zzso certain zzso which needs to be considered by scientists using this cell zzso zzso care should be taken to prevent zzso of in zzso obtained findings when translating them to the in zzso zzso
