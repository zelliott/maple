We investigate the role of protein zzso C zzso in the control of zzso zzso zzso zzso cell proliferation by a zzso zzso zzso in human zzso primary cultures and in the zzso cell zzso We found that zzso zzso reduces cell proliferation by inducing zzso zzso and blocks the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso reduces zzso zzso zzso indicating a direct involvement of this zzso as well as the zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso downstream targets and zzso markers for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso were zzso These data indicate that in zzso zzso is involved in the control of human zzso proliferation and survival by modulating zzso with a mechanism that implicates zzso zzso and zzso in different zzso zzso zzso zzso may represent a useful therapeutic approach for controlling zzso zzso
