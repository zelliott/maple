zzso evidence has been provided that zzso and zzso neurotransmitter zzso proteins form zzso zzso zzso zzso interactions in zzso zzso are thought to promote the assembly of integral membrane proteins to zzso zzso These interactions are determined by selective zzso zzso packing motifs one of which is the zzso A motif zzso This motif is present in the sixth zzso domain of most zzso zzso In order to zzso whether this motif is important for proper expression and function of the zzso zzso zzso we have zzso the effect of mutating the respective zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso upon transient expression of the respective zzso in zzso zzso As revealed by western zzso zzso zzso is found in zzso and zzso forms while both zzso are expressed as zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso is expressed at the cell surface, whereas both zzso proteins are zzso in zzso zzso Failure of integration into the cell membrane is responsible for a total loss of zzso zzso capability by the zzso These findings show that in the zzso protein the integrity of the zzso motif is essential for zzso and proper targeting of the zzso complex to the cell zzso
