zzso have recently been described as zzso zzso zzso by cancer cells, which transfer zzso signals and protein complexes across cell zzso Here, we show the rapid formation and zzso of zzso from zzso and zzso human prostate cancer zzso zzso formation was zzso by zzso growth factor zzso zzso and also by zzso of zzso zzso zzso shed from prostate cancer cells contained numerous signal zzso proteins and were capable of zzso rapid zzso and zzso zzso zzso and stimulating proliferation and migration, in recipient tumor zzso They also induced a zzso reaction in recipient normal zzso zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso Related zzso 3 zzso by zzso interference enhanced rates of zzso formation, indicating that these structures zzso and may be identical to, zzso membrane zzso a feature of the zzso form of cell zzso Analysis of primary and zzso human prostate tumors using zzso single zzso zzso zzso revealed a significantly higher frequency of deletion of the locus zzso zzso zzso in zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso in comparison with zzso zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso confirmed increased zzso loss of zzso in zzso tumors in a different cohort of patients zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso shed from prostate cancer cells can alter the tumor zzso in a manner that may promote disease zzso They also show that zzso is a zzso relevant protein that seems to regulate this zzso
