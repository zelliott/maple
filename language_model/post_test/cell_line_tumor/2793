The zzso zzso plays a central role in tumor development and progression and is often zzso in different tumor types, including zzso We have recently reported on the in zzso approach to identify putative zzso for zzso Of the reported hits, we selected zzso a compound which was shown to inhibit zzso activity in in zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso was performed in melanoma cells, a tumor type that commonly exhibits zzso of zzso Treatment of the zzso human melanoma cells, harboring the zzso zzso with zzso caused efficient zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso Treatment of melanoma cells with zzso also reduced zzso protein zzso which coincided with zzso of zzso association with zzso zzso treatment not only caused cell death of melanoma, but also prostate tumor cell zzso zzso the effect of zzso on cell death was more pronounced in cells that express an active form of zzso zzso zzso injection of zzso caused effective zzso of melanoma tumor zzso which coincided with elevated levels of cell zzso These findings identify zzso as a potent inhibitor of zzso that is capable of zzso effective zzso of zzso melanoma zzso
