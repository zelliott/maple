zzso and its derivatives have attracted great research interest for their potential applications in electronics, energy, materials and biomedical zzso However, little information of their toxicity and zzso is zzso zzso we performed a comprehensive study on the toxicity of zzso oxide zzso by examining the influences of GO on the zzso zzso mortality and membrane integrity of zzso zzso The results suggest that GO does not enter zzso cell and has no obvious zzso But GO can cause a zzso zzso stress in cell and induce a slight loss of cell viability at high zzso These effects are dose and size zzso and should be considered in the development of zzso of zzso Overall, GO is a pretty safe material at cellular level, which is confirmed by the favorable cell growth on GO zzso
