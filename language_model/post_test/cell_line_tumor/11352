zzso cells zzso are constantly exposed to zzso and zzso or their zzso which zzso zzso function, as well as to zzso stress, which plays a crucial role in vascular zzso zzso X zzso zzso is a nuclear zzso and a key regulator of the zzso of zzso and zzso Here we show that zzso zzso stress zzso the zzso flow, activates zzso in zzso whereas zzso zzso stress, the zzso flow, suppresses zzso zzso zzso of zzso in cultured zzso led to the increased expression of a zzso target zzso zzso resistance 1 zzso An in zzso study using rats showed that the expression of zzso was significantly higher in the zzso from the descending zzso zzso where flow is mostly zzso than from the inner zzso of zzso arch, where flow is zzso zzso zzso zzso protects zzso from zzso triggered by zzso via the induction of zzso and other zzso zzso zzso also suppressed the expression of zzso zzso molecules and zzso zzso in response to zzso and zzso zzso of a zzso active zzso in rat carotid arteries zzso attenuated zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso revealed a large number of the zzso zzso genes whose products are responsible for major steps of detoxification, including phase I and II zzso zzso and zzso These zzso genes in zzso are induced by zzso in zzso in a zzso zzso In conclusion, our results indicate that zzso represents a zzso zzso system to protect zzso against damage by zzso and zzso
