zzso zzso regulates a wide variety of zzso processes by interacting with 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, little is known of their zzso roles in human zzso In this study, we examined the expression pattern of zzso receptors in various zzso zzso and human colon zzso cell lines and investigated the zzso functions regarding colon zzso Using reverse zzso zzso chain reaction and Western zzso we found that zzso zzso zzso zzso was consistently zzso in zzso zzso zzso and colon cancer cell lines compared with normal zzso zzso In zzso we observed diffuse zzso of zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of normal colon zzso zzso During a hypoxic state, there was also a significant induction of zzso expression in the zzso zzso level at 8 hours of incubation and in the protein level at 24 hours of incubation in colon zzso cell zzso To examine the function of zzso we applied an zzso zzso zzso to the colon zzso cells, which significantly inhibited cell growth in a zzso manner as demonstrated with a zzso zzso cell proliferation zzso In conclusions, zzso was zzso in zzso zzso grown under a hypoxic state, presumably promoting cancer cell zzso Our data suggest that this zzso zzso is a potential therapeutic target for zzso zzso
