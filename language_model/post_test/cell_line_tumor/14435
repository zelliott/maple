The ultimate biological and clinical meaning of shed zzso zzso domain zzso has remained largely unclear until zzso zzso of soluble zzso zzso has been shown to inhibit growth of zzso cancer cells by promoting zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso receptors thus zzso their zzso zzso and decreasing their zzso zzso zzso drugs capable to enhance the occurrence of zzso zzso zzso shedding but simultaneously preventing formation of truncated cell zzso zzso zzso fragment, which exhibits an zzso zzso zzso activity, might be extremely efficient at managing zzso cancer zzso The dual zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso which works zzso and directly targets the zzso domain of zzso drastically zzso zzso shedding of zzso zzso to inhibit zzso cancer cell zzso zzso treatment significantly zzso the concentration of the inactive zzso form of zzso protein at the tumor cell membrane and promotes an exacerbated zzso zzso shedding to the zzso milieu of zzso cancer zzso zzso sensitivity of zzso cancer cells, which contain nearly zzso levels of soluble zzso zzso when compared with zzso parental cells to zzso cell growth zzso takes place when zzso treatment fully restores high levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso The dramatic zzso of zzso zzso shedding that occurs upon treatment of with zzso is fully suppressed in zzso zzso zzso These findings, altogether, may provide crucial insights concerning clinical studies aimed to accurately describe zzso zzso as a potential predictor of response or resistance to the zzso drugs zzso and zzso
