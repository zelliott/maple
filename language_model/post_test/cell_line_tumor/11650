Independent research groups reported that zzso protein zzso isolated from zzso plant and human cells demonstrate the zzso zzso This might indicate that diverse organisms zzso a zzso zzso protective innate immunity response to pathogen invasion, and that this mechanism is effective also against zzso We performed structural analyses and evaluated the zzso activity for four zzso protein zzso isolated from different zzso Our data show that bacterial zzso plant zzso zzso human zzso binding protein zzso and human zzso zzso from zzso T cells zzso share high degrees of structure and sequence zzso According to earlier reports on the zzso activity of zzso and zzso other members of this protein family from bacteria and humans were able to block zzso of zzso and replication of virus in cell based zzso The efficacy studies for zzso zzso zzso and zzso replication blocking activity showed that the zzso zzso zzso concentration 50 zzso values ranged from zzso zzso and the zzso replication zzso values ranged from zzso zzso Treatment of cells with zzso protein alters the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso proteins may be part of an innate immunity defense against pathogen invasion; the zzso structure and activity makes them appealing candidates for development of a novel zzso targeting zzso zzso
