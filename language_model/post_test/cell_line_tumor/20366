Cell migration is controlled by the integration of numerous distinct zzso zzso the analysis of cell migration is advancing towards comprehensive, multifaceted in zzso zzso To accurately evaluate the contribution of an underlying zzso to cell zzso in complex cellular environments we developed a migration zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso When attached to a culture surface, zzso create a defined void in the cell zzso without zzso the cells or damaging the underlying zzso zzso analysis of migration into this void reveals the zzso contribution to zzso The zzso placement of a zzso stencil allows for full experimental control of the zzso on which migration is zzso zzso enable the evaluation of intact, defined zzso and make it possible to analyze migration on unique surfaces such as zzso zzso zzso surfaces, and zzso zzso These studies also revealed that mechanical zzso including the damage that occurs during scratch zzso diminishes migration and confounds the analysis of individual cell zzso Analysis of migration on increasingly complex zzso reveals that the contribution of the underlying zzso depends not only on its molecular composition but also its organization and the context in which it is zzso
