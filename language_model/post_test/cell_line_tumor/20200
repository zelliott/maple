zzso an zzso hand zzso zzso is a potential zzso in several zzso and is also a zzso zzso growth zzso gene in melanoma and lung cancer zzso However, the mechanism of zzso regulation by zzso and its significance in cancer progression remains largely zzso In the present study we report the mechanism of zzso regulation by zzso and its possible role in zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso promoter revealed an zzso zzso zzso element at positions zzso to zzso as being the most critical factor for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso confirmed the functional binding of the zzso complex, predominantly zzso to the zzso promoter in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso markedly zzso the zzso promoter which was blocked by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso despite the presence of a putative zzso element, zzso regulation by zzso was found to be zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso protein and zzso show synergistic regulation of the zzso zzso Finally, zzso of zzso expression compromised zzso cell migration and invasion of zzso zzso Together our findings highlight an important link between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso pathways in the regulation of zzso expression and zzso zzso
