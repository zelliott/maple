zzso zzso is a widely expressed zzso protein that exerts zzso biological zzso To gain insight into the potential role of zzso as a novel zzso of zzso cells, we investigated its effect on the growth and death of zzso tumor zzso zzso In this study, we identified zzso zzso expression in these tumor cells by zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso and -9 zzso loss of zzso membrane potential zzso zzso c zzso c) release, and zzso expression suggested that relatively high zzso of zzso added zzso zzso zzso induced zzso by the zzso and death zzso zzso These pathways were independently zzso as the presence of the inhibitor of zzso or -9 only partially prevented zzso On the contrary, low zzso of zzso significantly promoted cell zzso without inducing cell zzso zzso the presence of the zzso zzso prevented zzso effects, suggesting the involvement of the zzso recognition domain zzso This study provides strong evidence that zzso is a novel zzso regulator of zzso tumor cell number, suggesting a novel role for zzso in the zzso zzso
