zzso like zzso zzso exhibits beneficial effects on beta cell mass by both enhancing proliferation and zzso zzso The precise mechanism of the zzso effect of zzso and zzso zzso like zzso has remained zzso Here, we studied zzso zzso in the pancreatic beta cell line zzso and performed a comparative zzso protein pattern analysis using two-dimensional difference gel zzso zzso zzso incubation of zzso cells increased zzso activity about zzso which was reduced by zzso in the presence of zzso zzso of zzso oxygen species in response to zzso was completely prevented after zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso were obtained and zzso proteins were labeled with zzso and separated on overlapping zzso zzso gels spanning a zzso of zzso zzso spots with significant changes after zzso and zzso treatment were identified by zzso mass zzso Comparing all treatment conditions, comparative zzso zzso analysis allowed to identify 33 different zzso which were significantly altered between comparison zzso Changes in protein patterns revealed involvement of zzso electron transport chain zzso Thus, zzso zzso complex zzso I and zzso zzso zzso beta were zzso by zzso This was zzso by the presence of zzso In conclusion, this study provides further insights into the role of zzso in zzso zzso We show here that zzso significantly zzso the reduced abundance of electron transport chain zzso leading to a reduction of zzso stress and most likely contributing to the zzso action of this zzso
