To investigate new strategies to intensify zzso in head and neck zzso cell zzso 

zzso zzso zzso cells were examined for nuclear zzso zzso zzso and binding activity by zzso an agent currently used in head and neck cancer zzso zzso shift zzso were used to assess the effect of zzso on zzso binding zzso Cell proliferation zzso were used to study cell sensitivity to zzso To examine whether zzso could be increased by specifically zzso zzso a dominant negative cell line, inhibitor zzso zzso zzso was zzso expressed in zzso zzso 

zzso possessed the capacity to functionally activate zzso as demonstrated by zzso reporter gene zzso and zzso shift zzso zzso was able to inhibit zzso zzso zzso and promote zzso of zzso cells at 24 zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso The dominant negative zzso cell line exhibited increased zzso to zzso by zzso to zzso 

zzso has the capacity to activate zzso in oral zzso zzso zzso zzso can reverse this zzso to decrease cell proliferation and increase zzso Treatment strategies that combine zzso with zzso may have therapeutic benefits attributable to zzso zzso through zzso zzso
