zzso the product of the zzso zzso is a well-established therapeutic target for zzso zzso but zzso zzso fusion proteins are limited in their zzso The goal of this study was to determine if genetically adding an zzso targeting zzso cell zzso zzso zzso to an zzso zzso zzso would result in enhanced zzso zzso 

In zzso studies were done in which the new zzso zzso zzso was compared with zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso were tested to determine if they were as effective as the zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies were also zzso In zzso zzso zzso were given zzso to zzso nude mice bearing zzso human colon cancer flank tumors and zzso to mice with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso showed far greater activity than zzso zzso (sometimes over zzso against most tumor zzso zzso zzso was superior and selective in its activity against different zzso cell zzso zzso zzso had greater activity than zzso zzso indicating an advantage of having both zzso on the same zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies did not explain the differences between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Orientation of the zzso on the zzso had a significant effect on in zzso and in zzso zzso The zzso zzso were more effective than the zzso zzso in the flank tumor mouse zzso 

The synthesis of zzso zzso created a new biological agent with superior in zzso and in zzso activity (over zzso zzso more broad zzso more efficacy against tumors in zzso and diminished toxic effects in zzso
