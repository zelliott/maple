Breast zzso are thought to be organized zzso with a small number of breast cancer stem cells zzso able to zzso a tumor while their progeny lack this zzso Recently, several groups reported enrichment for zzso when breast zzso were subjected to classic zzso zzso However, the underlying mechanisms leading to this enrichment are incompletely zzso Using zzso sorted from patient samples, we found that zzso radiation zzso differentiated breast cancer cells into induced zzso zzso zzso showed increased zzso formation, increased zzso and expressed the same zzso genes as zzso from zzso zzso zzso occurred in a zzso zzso of cells, coincided with zzso of the zzso factors zzso sex determining region zzso 2, zzso and zzso and could be partially prevented by zzso zzso We conclude that radiation may induce a zzso zzso in differentiated breast cancer cells and that this mechanism contributes to increased zzso numbers seen after classic zzso zzso
