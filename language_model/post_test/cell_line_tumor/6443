Carcinoma progression is associated with the loss of zzso features, and the acquisition of a zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso we show that exposure of zzso cells to zzso growth factor zzso resulted in zzso zzso characteristic of zzso transition zzso zzso treatment resulted in increased zzso along with an zzso of zzso factors zzso zzso zzso and zzso markers zzso and zzso Treatment of zzso cells with a combined stimulation of zzso and zzso a naturally occurring zzso with zzso properties, failed to alter cell zzso zzso and zzso of zzso markers induced by zzso Using specific chemical zzso we demonstrated that zzso zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso zzso zzso zzso and that zzso is able to repress zzso zzso zzso In zzso these data provide new evidence of the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso cell zzso
