Cancer is one of the most life-threatening diseases with many forms still regarded as zzso The conventional cancer treatments have unwanted side effects such as the death of normal zzso A therapy that can accurately target and effectively kill tumor cells could address the zzso of the available zzso Atmospheric gas zzso zzso that are able to specifically kill zzso cells offer a promising alternative approach compared to conventional zzso zzso have been shown to exploit zzso genetic defects and a recent trial in mice has confirmed its zzso zzso The mechanism by which the zzso act on tumor cells but not normal cells is not fully zzso A review of the current literature suggests that zzso oxygen species zzso generated by zzso induce death of cancer cells by zzso the function of zzso regulatory zzso The majority of cancer cells are defective in tumor zzso that interfere normal cell growth zzso It appears that zzso or tumor zzso regulation of zzso zzso signaling pathways may be involved in zzso cancer cell zzso The toxic effects of zzso are zzso by normal cells by adjustment of their zzso zzso On the other hand, tumor cells are mostly defective in several regulatory signaling pathways which lead to the loss of zzso balance within the cells and consequently, the regulation of cell zzso This review article evaluates the impact of zzso on the zzso of cellular signaling and its importance for exploring mechanisms for safe and efficient zzso zzso
