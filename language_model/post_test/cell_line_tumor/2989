Recent studies have suggested that first and second generation zzso zzso and zzso have different zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanisms of zzso are not fully zzso and investigations into changes in zzso signaling related to their zzso effects remain zzso In the present study, we compared the zzso zzso with the zzso zzso in zzso human zzso cells via zzso zzso factor zzso zzso notably zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and B cell zzso zzso zzso We examined the effects of zzso (five and 10 zzso and zzso (one and 10 zzso on zzso gene promoter activity in zzso cells zzso with a rat zzso promoter zzso zzso to zzso linked to the zzso reporter zzso The changes in zzso zzso and zzso levels were measured by Western zzso zzso The zzso was not associated with a significant difference in zzso promoter zzso In contrast, zzso was associated with increased zzso promoter activity only with a dose of 10 zzso zzso zzso Treatment with zzso at 10 zzso increased the levels of zzso by zzso compared with control levels ( zzso whereas zzso had no zzso Moreover, cells treated with zzso effectively increased the levels of zzso zzso and zzso at doses of five and 10 zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso respectively, zzso or zzso However, zzso had no effects on zzso beta and zzso zzso This study showed that zzso but not haloperidol, appeared to offer zzso effects on human zzso zzso The actions of signaling systems associated with zzso may represent key targets for both zzso and haloperidol, but the latter may be associated with distinct zzso These differences might be related to the different therapeutic effects of zzso and zzso in patients with zzso
