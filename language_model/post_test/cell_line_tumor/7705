To investigate the zzso regulation on zzso cells by zzso between zzso B and zzso 

zzso B and C zzso gene fragments were amplified and inserted into green fluorescent protein zzso zzso expression zzso zzso to construct zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso and zzso were introduced into zzso cells by zzso HD to obtain zzso cells expressing zzso The zzso and expression of zzso gene were demonstrated by zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of the cells was determined by zzso blue zzso and flow zzso zzso 

zzso and Western zzso analysis showed that zzso genes of zzso B and C were transcribed and expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso blue exclusion showed zzso induced zzso cell death in zzso zzso cells while no significant cell death was observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that no significant differences of zzso rates of zzso zzso and of zzso zzso were observed zzso zzso zzso moreover, no significant differences of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and of the zzso zzso zzso rates in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were significantly lower than those in zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells at 48 hours after the zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cell lines expressing zzso zzso and zzso fusion proteins were successfully zzso zzso X protein blocks zzso zzso of zzso zzso There is no difference between zzso of zzso B and C in zzso zzso induced by zzso
