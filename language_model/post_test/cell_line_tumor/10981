zzso zzso cells are generally resistant or only zzso sensitive to tumor necrosis factor family of cell zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity of zzso compounds present in zzso food products has been well recognized in zzso zzso however, the mechanism of zzso by these dietary constituents largely remains zzso zzso the yellow zzso in the spice zzso has profound zzso activity and exhibits zzso and tumor growth zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated whether zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso to zzso zzso Treatment with low zzso zzso zzso of zzso alone had no effect on the viability of either cell zzso At low concentration (5 zzso TRAIL induced zzso in zzso cells but not in zzso zzso Whereas zzso at zzso concentration zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso it had no effect on zzso zzso in zzso zzso The combined zzso and TRAIL treatment enhanced zzso of zzso zzso cells in zzso zzso cell cycle phase and induced the zzso of zzso zzso -9 and release of zzso c from zzso These data indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso through the zzso of both zzso zzso and intrinsic zzso pathways of zzso These results define a potential use of zzso to sensitize zzso cells for zzso zzso
