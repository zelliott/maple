zzso analgesics are generally used to combat the pain associated with zzso zzso These agents not only inhibit respiratory function and cause zzso but also induce other significant side effects such as addiction and zzso all of which further contribute to a reduced quality of life for cancer zzso Thus, in the present study, the effects of zzso treatment zzso on mechanical zzso were examined in a cancer pain mouse zzso 

In order to produce a zzso cancer pain model, zzso zzso cells were zzso around the zzso nerve of left legs of zzso zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso scanning confirmed the mass of zzso cancer cells embedded around the zzso zzso Mechanical zzso was most consistently induced in the mouse zzso cell line zzso (2 zzso zzso zzso group compared to all the other groups zzso zzso stimulation (2 zzso was administered daily to zzso zzso of zzso bearing mice for 30 zzso for 9 days after zzso zzso 

zzso treatment significantly prolonged paw withdrawal zzso from 5 days after zzso It also shortened the cumulative lifting duration from 7 days after zzso compared to the tumor zzso Also, the zzso of pain zzso substance P in the zzso horn of the spinal zzso was significantly decreased in the zzso group compared to the tumor control on Day 9 post zzso Furthermore, zzso treatment effectively increased the concentration of zzso in blood and brain samples of the mice to a greater extent than that of the tumor control as well as the normal zzso The concentration of zzso for zzso treatment group increased by zzso in the blood and zzso in the brain respectively, compared to the tumor control zzso 

The findings of this study suggest that a zzso cancer pain model is useful as a consistent and short time animal zzso It also indicated that zzso treatment could be used as an alternative therapeutic method for cancer pain due to a zzso decrease in substance P and increase in zzso zzso
