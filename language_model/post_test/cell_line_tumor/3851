zzso cellular mechanisms of de zzso and acquired resistance to drug therapy remains a central challenge in the clinical management of many zzso including zzso cell lung cancer zzso Although much work has linked the zzso transition zzso in cancer cells to the emergence of drug resistance, it is less clear where zzso routes may exist to reverse or inhibit zzso as a strategy for drug zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso protein zzso zzso zzso signaling plays a key role in directing the zzso character of zzso cells and that blocking zzso signaling is sufficient to zzso therapeutic responses to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso promoted an zzso zzso in zzso cells, preventing induction of zzso by zzso zzso Moreover, in cells exhibiting de zzso or acquired resistance to the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso enhanced the sensitivity to zzso and slowed cell zzso These effects only occurred, however, if zzso was inhibited for a period sufficient to trigger changes in zzso marker zzso zzso with these findings, changes in zzso zzso and markers were also induced by the expression of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso Our results suggest that prolonged exposure to zzso or zzso zzso may not only restrain zzso but also overcome zzso or acquired resistance of zzso to zzso therapy in the zzso
