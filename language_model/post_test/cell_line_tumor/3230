zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso directed against the zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso resulted in the generation of three zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso with reductions in zzso zzso and protein levels zzso zzso relative to zzso cells zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso III promoter alone zzso zzso This zzso interference zzso approach dramatically zzso these cells to killing by the tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso loss of zzso also zzso the cells to killing by zzso but had no additional effects on killing by zzso and zzso The increased sensitivity of the zzso zzso cells to killing by TRAIL and zzso correlated with enhanced zzso zzso and zzso including zzso and robust processing of zzso zzso and zzso compared to zzso zzso Additionally, increasing zzso levels by zzso expression protected both zzso zzso and zzso cells from TRAIL killing in a zzso zzso The effects observed by stable zzso with respect to TRAIL zzso were also achieved following zzso of zzso in zzso cells treated with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that reducing zzso protein expression by either zzso or zzso approaches increases cancer cell zzso to functionally diverse zzso agents and supports the notion that zzso of zzso in zzso may zzso with zzso zzso zzso including TRAIL and zzso to increase the effectiveness of zzso zzso
