To establish a zzso zzso zzso cell line and explore its zzso characteristics and mechanisms for drug zzso 

The zzso zzso cell line was established by repeatedly exposing the cells to comparatively large doses of zzso with a zzso zzso and gradually zzso the drug concentration to an zzso zzso The zzso of the resistant and parental cell lines was observed through optical zzso The zzso zzso was used to determine the doubling time and the resistance index to draw growth zzso The zzso cell cycle distribution and zzso zzso between zzso and zzso were analyzed by flow zzso and the zzso by zzso zzso real-time zzso was performed to evaluate the expression levels of zzso zzso and zzso 

The zzso cell line zzso was eventually established following zzso drug zzso Both the resistant and the parental cell lines were similar with regard to zzso and zzso The zzso of the former was more complicated with differences located in zzso 20, X, 4, 5, 9 and zzso The resistant cell line had more zzso phase cells zzso vs zzso less S phase cells zzso vs zzso and less zzso phase cells zzso vs zzso compared with the parental cell zzso The zzso cell line showed significant drug resistance to zzso zzso zzso and zzso the resistance zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was impaired in zzso cell line as less zzso of zzso zzso zzso 36 vs zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso increased dramatically in the resistant cell line, its zzso value was zzso higher than that of the parental cell line zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso while zzso also increased in the resistant by zzso folds zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso However there was a slightly decrease of zzso the ratio of the resistant to the parental calculated by their zzso values was zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

A zzso cell line zzso was zzso The prominent zzso of zzso may be the main cause for zzso zzso
