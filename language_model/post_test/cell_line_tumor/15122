A fluorinated zzso inhibitor based on the zzso zzso zzso was prepared and selected for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso development zzso to its high affinity for the zzso relevant zzso zzso zzso K and zzso zzso with zzso was accomplished in an efficient and reliable zzso zzso zzso by using zzso zzso as a prosthetic zzso The zzso properties of the resulting zzso compound were studied zzso zzso and zzso in normal rats by zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso zzso These investigations revealed rapid zzso formation of the zzso with zzso in the blood, which is associated with slow blood zzso The potential of the developed zzso zzso probe to image zzso zzso activity was investigated by dynamic zzso PET imaging in nude mice bearing zzso derived from the human zzso lung zzso cell zzso zzso analysis of the obtained image data indicated the zzso zzso of the zzso in the zzso The expression of the target zzso in the zzso was confirmed by zzso with specific zzso This indicates that zzso zzso have the potential to target zzso zzso zzso despite their zzso zzso
