Liver zzso is a major lethal complication associated with colon cancer, and zzso steps of the zzso are important for its clinical zzso In order to identify zzso zzso zzso for these steps, we performed zzso screens of a zzso library in a mouse model of liver zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso and to a lesser extent zzso were capable of zzso liver zzso zzso inhibited retention of zzso cells in liver zzso and induced their cell zzso zzso was identified as a direct target of zzso and its zzso partially zzso the zzso zzso High levels of zzso and zzso but not zzso in primary colon cancer were zzso related to the presence of liver zzso and attributed to an increase of zzso expression during zzso We propose that, in a subset of colon cancer, zzso of zzso during zzso prevents liver zzso via the induction of cell death of zzso zzso
