DNA replication stress is an inefficient DNA synthesis process that leads replication zzso to progress slowly or zzso Two main factors that cause replication stress are zzso in pools of zzso zzso precursors required for DNA synthesis and changes in the activity of proteins required for synthesis of zzso zzso zzso zzso containing regulatory zzso and zzso zzso zzso is the zzso that zzso the conversion of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and thereby provides zzso precursors needed for the synthesis of zzso Here, we demonstrate that either zzso or zzso expression of zzso results in decreases in zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso of DNA replication fork zzso and increased rate of fork asymmetry leading to DNA replication zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso in the zzso and directly interacts via its zzso domain with zzso but not zzso zzso of the zzso domain of zzso abrogates its zzso effects on zzso activity, zzso pool level, and DNA zzso zzso zzso directly zzso zzso activity by zzso the functional zzso complex via its zzso zzso Our findings argue that zzso reduces zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso activity, thereby providing insight into how zzso triggers DNA replication zzso
