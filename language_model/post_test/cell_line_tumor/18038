Human zzso 205 colon zzso cells are immune to zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso Among the zzso mechanisms responsible for the immune escape, the zzso of the zzso protein seems to be zzso zzso appears to inhibit the zzso death zzso zzso The application of the zzso inhibitor zzso IX zzso known as a potent zzso zzso zzso zzso 205 cells to zzso zzso The zzso analysis revealed that the zzso of human zzso 205 cells to zzso stimuli resulted from zzso reduction in zzso and zzso protein zzso At the same time, the level of zzso protein was zzso Additionally, the combined zzso and zzso treatment caused zzso of Bid and zzso as well as zzso c zzso Thus, the evidence of this study indicates that zzso zzso the death zzso signal zzso by zzso Moreover, zzso alone initiated intrinsic zzso which could be abolished by zzso zzso It zzso the involvement of zzso in zzso intrinsic zzso In turn, the treatment with zzso III zzso did not assist zzso zzso
