Chemical programming of nine zzso zzso with zzso zzso activity was examined using compounds, equipped with zzso or zzso zzso zzso that inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso The results showed that most zzso were programmed using the zzso compounds in a manner similar to previously reported zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, only those zzso which zzso the retro zzso reaction of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso to zzso targeting compounds, at least three new zzso including zzso zzso and zzso exhibited high specific binding to human tumor cells expressing zzso zzso
