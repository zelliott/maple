The zzso locus encodes two structurally unrelated tumor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of either the zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso occurs in most human zzso zzso D1 is frequently zzso in breast cancer cells contributing an alternate mechanism zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso D1 to the zzso zzso is sufficient for zzso and zzso zzso mice are resistant to zzso zzso zzso Recent studies suggest zzso D1 and zzso expression are zzso in human breast zzso zzso zzso regulation of zzso D1 and zzso was observed in zzso of mice zzso for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited DNA synthesis in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso D1 expression and zzso zzso of zzso D1 by zzso occurred independently of the zzso function and required a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso D1 through a novel zzso zzso at zzso which bound zzso in zzso zzso zzso repression of the zzso D1 gene through distinct DNA sequences may contribute to the tumor zzso function of the zzso zzso
