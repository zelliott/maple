As zzso progresses, the zzso passenger proteins zzso zzso Aurora B, zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso passenger proteins are already expressed during zzso whereas the nuclear envelope is only zzso at the end of zzso However, the mechanisms that zzso their zzso zzso before nuclear envelope breakdown zzso are poorly zzso Using zzso zzso we show that Aurora B, like zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso although both proteins lack identifiable zzso nuclear transport zzso On the other hand, zzso resides more zzso in the nucleus and contains multiple nuclear zzso zzso Finally, zzso was detected in the zzso and the zzso but its zzso zzso is not directly regulated by zzso zzso experiments indicate that the nuclear zzso of Aurora B, but not of zzso is modulated by zzso and that zzso prevents the zzso zzso of zzso Our data reveal that, in contrast to their closely related zzso during zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso before zzso is largely zzso Furthermore, the specific effect of zzso and zzso on the zzso of Aurora B and zzso respectively, suggests that different complexes of zzso may exist not only during zzso as recently reported, but also before zzso
