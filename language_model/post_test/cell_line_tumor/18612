zzso zzso zzso zzso are aggressive tumors without any zzso line of zzso We recently demonstrated that about zzso of them are characterized by high-level zzso of the zzso zzso region, associated with either zzso or zzso band zzso This genetic finding, very similar to that in zzso zzso strongly suggests that these tumors actually zzso to zzso zzso It also suggests that the lack of differentiation could be the consequence of amplification of target genes localized in the zzso or zzso zzso We report here the characterization by array zzso of the zzso minimal region of zzso Our findings demonstrate that amplification and zzso of zzso zzso a gene localized in the zzso band and zzso a zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of the zzso signaling pathway, could inhibit the zzso differentiation process of the tumor zzso Treatment of a cell line with specific zzso of zzso protein resulted in the bypass of the differentiation block and induction of a strong zzso zzso These observations indicate that zzso is a target for new therapeutic management of these aggressive zzso
