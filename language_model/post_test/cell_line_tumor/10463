The success of zzso therapy for treatment of multiple myeloma zzso led to the development of structurally and zzso distinct novel zzso zzso In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of one such novel orally zzso zzso inhibitor zzso in zzso using well-established in zzso and in zzso zzso 

zzso cell lines, primary patient cells, and the human zzso zzso animal model were used to study the zzso activity of zzso 

Treatment of zzso cells with zzso predominantly zzso zzso activity of the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso growth and zzso zzso in zzso cells resistant to conventional and zzso therapies without affecting the viability of normal zzso In animal tumor model studies, zzso is well tolerated and zzso tumor growth with significantly reduced tumor zzso A head-to-head analysis of zzso versus zzso showed a significantly longer survival time in mice treated with zzso than mice receiving zzso zzso of zzso tumors from zzso mice showed growth zzso zzso and a decrease in associated zzso zzso studies showed that zzso zzso is associated with zzso of zzso zzso and zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso stress response proteins zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of nuclear factor zzso zzso Finally, combining zzso with zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso acid, or zzso triggers synergistic zzso zzso 

Our zzso study supports clinical evaluation of zzso alone or in zzso as a potential zzso zzso
