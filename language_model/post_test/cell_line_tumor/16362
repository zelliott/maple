zzso studies revealed a strong correlation between the zzso zzso zzso type 2 zzso and higher zzso and faster progression of breast and colon zzso However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are widely zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are involved in zzso zzso signaling and promote tumor cell growth and zzso zzso we examined regulatory functions and expression of zzso and zzso in a simplified in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso expression was determined by western zzso analysis in zzso breast cancer and zzso colon cancer cells previously cultured under zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso (without and with zzso zzso We studied the culture effects on proliferation and migration of these cells, especially after zzso zzso and zzso We found that zzso expression was zzso with high zzso and insulin in both cell lines, whereas zzso expression was enhanced in colon cancer cells zzso High levels of zzso and insulin increased cell proliferation and migration in both cell lines in zzso zzso by zzso and zzso as shown through the specific pharmacological zzso zzso and zzso 

Our molecular data explain zzso and zzso changes in a cancer cell and help to understand what might trigger tumor cell proliferation and migration in zzso patients, zzso
