Recent studies have revealed that zzso is zzso in several types of zzso and provides a zzso zzso Our findings demonstrate that the high expression of zzso in human zzso specimens is significantly correlated with low levels of zzso zzso protein and high-grade zzso Here, we present the first evidence that zzso zzso zzso zzso provides a tumor zzso effect via induction of zzso in human zzso zzso In addition, we show that zzso is a direct functional target of zzso zzso zzso zzso without zzso abrogates zzso cell zzso Further investigations will focus on the therapeutic use of zzso zzso effects in zzso
