zzso imaging is important for diagnosis of zzso diseases, and thus various zzso zzso have been zzso However, zzso requires zzso procedures including zzso zzso which is complicated and difficult to zzso Recently, zzso method using zzso complex in zzso solution was devised that offered a straightforward zzso zzso We zzso zzso derivatives zzso with zzso acid zzso that can be labeled with zzso using zzso complex and examined their zzso in zzso and in zzso biological properties, and animal PET imaging zzso We found that the zzso derivatives have excellent zzso zzso high zzso specific zzso in cultured hypoxic tumor cells, and high tumor to zzso ratios in zzso zzso Furthermore, the derivatives were labeled with zzso in a straightforward manner within 15 zzso at high labeling efficiencies and zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso zzso were developed and proved to be promising zzso PET zzso
