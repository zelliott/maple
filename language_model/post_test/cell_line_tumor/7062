To develop a novel and effective approach to inhibit tumor zzso based on controlled delivery of zzso we first evaluated the characteristics of the disposition and proliferation of tumor zzso Then, we examined the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso on tumor zzso On the basis of the results zzso zzso was zzso administered to completely suppress the growth of tumor zzso 

zzso melanoma zzso cells were zzso zzso with zzso zzso gene to obtain zzso zzso These cells were injected zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso was injected zzso and the effect was evaluated by measuring the zzso activity as the indicator of the number of tumor zzso 

At 1 hour after injection of zzso cells, 60 to zzso of the injected cells were recovered in the zzso The numbers decreased to 2 to zzso at 24 hours, then zzso An injection of zzso just before zzso significantly reduced the number of tumor cells at 24 zzso zzso of zzso at 1 or 3 days after zzso was also effective in reducing the cell zzso Daily dosing of zzso greatly inhibited the proliferation and the number zzso at 14 days after zzso was not significantly different from the minimal number observed at 1 day, suggesting that the growth had been markedly suppressed by the zzso 

These findings indicate that sustained zzso activity in the blood circulation can prevent the multiple processes of tumor zzso in the zzso which could lead to a state of tumor zzso
