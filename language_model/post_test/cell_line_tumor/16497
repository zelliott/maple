zzso zzso zzso is the most zzso human primary brain zzso and its zzso nature represents the leading cause for the failure of therapies and tumor zzso It is therefore crucial the knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso invasion to identify novel therapeutic targets to limit zzso In this study, we evaluated the role of zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso a crucial regulator of the zzso zzso dynamics accompanying cell zzso and invasion, in zzso migration and zzso We found that zzso of the protein by small interfering zzso zzso zzso the migratory and invasive capacity of three different human zzso cell lines both in zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso effect on invasion was maintained independently by the migration mode zzso by the cells in our 3-D model, and was accompanied by an impaired formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso Our data propose zzso as a key zzso involved in the control of the intrinsic invasive behavior of zzso cells, and suggest that this protein might represent a useful target for the design of new drugs for the treatment of these zzso
