A novel zzso zzso zzso carrier was employed in this study for delivery of the zzso drug zzso zzso to cancer zzso Our strategy is based on facile zzso of zzso to zzso zzso carriers that are designed to be taken up selectively by cancer cells through cell surface zzso zzso The zzso used as a building block in this study was zzso zzso which was chosen for its ability to reduce zzso interactions with proteins and zzso The zzso zzso was exploited for its ability to bind and release zzso zzso such as zzso in a zzso zzso In zzso zzso such as in cancer tissue or the zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso groups to liberate the free drug, which zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso was presented on the zzso carriers to facilitate targeted entry of zzso zzso carriers into cancer zzso Our study demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso dramatically enhanced cellular zzso zzso zzso and zzso toward breast zzso cells in comparison with zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso binding mechanism provides a zzso approach for controlling the release of zzso in targeted cancer cells, establishing a concept that may be applied in the future toward other zzso zzso zzso to treat a broad range of zzso
