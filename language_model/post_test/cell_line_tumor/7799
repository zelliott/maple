The current standard treatment for zzso zzso consisting of surgery followed by chemotherapy with zzso and zzso is fraught with a high rate of zzso We hypothesized that targeted zzso of specific signaling pathways in combination with conventional drugs may increase zzso zzso 

We analyzed the expression and zzso profiles of various signaling pathways in nine established zzso cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 24 freshly procured human zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso component zzso was frequently zzso and/or activated in tumor zzso The effect of several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in combination with zzso on various tumor cell growth characteristics was tested in cell lines and fresh zzso transient zzso and organ zzso 

zzso by itself and zzso with zzso inhibited the growth and invasion, and increased the sensitivity to zzso of most of the zzso cancer cell lines and fresh zzso The additive zzso effect may be due to enhanced zzso as demonstrated by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso V zzso in cells treated with both zzso and zzso 

zzso in combination with standard zzso agents may improve the efficiency of zzso cancer zzso
