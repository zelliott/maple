Our previous work has shown that ethanol zzso the fatty acid synthesis zzso by zzso of zzso regulatory zzso protein 1 zzso In the present study, we studied the mechanisms of this zzso by identifying a new target of ethanol, zzso protein zzso zzso 

The effects of ethanol on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were assessed in rat zzso cells and in the zzso of zzso zzso 

In rat zzso zzso or zzso zzso cell lines, zzso zzso of an zzso promoter was suppressed by the presence of zzso zzso zzso or zzso 2 known zzso zzso zzso with this, over expression of a zzso active form of zzso blocked the effect of ethanol, whereas zzso of a zzso form of zzso zzso the zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso by zzso or zzso largely blocked the ability of ethanol to increase levels of mature zzso zzso These findings suggest that the effect of ethanol on zzso promoter zzso was partially zzso through zzso zzso We further demonstrated that zzso was inhibited by ethanol in zzso zzso In zzso ethanol increased the activity of zzso and suppressed the rate of zzso acid zzso Finally, feeding mice a low-fat diet with ethanol resulted in significantly reduced zzso zzso activity, increased zzso activity, and enhanced zzso zzso zzso 

Taken together, our findings suggest that zzso may play a key role in regulating the effects of ethanol on zzso zzso fatty acid zzso and development of alcoholic fatty zzso
