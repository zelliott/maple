zzso zzso promotes cancer cell proliferation and survival by unclear zzso Here, we show that zzso expression and activity were induced by zzso agents in a zzso manner and antagonized zzso or zzso drug-induced zzso in a variety of cancer zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso of the zzso genes zzso and zzso but not of zzso or zzso This may be explained by zzso capability to inhibit the binding of zzso to zzso leukemia protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso into zzso bodies in response to zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso activity appears to be involved in nuclear retention and zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso In these cells, genetic or pharmacological zzso of zzso enabled suppression of in zzso zzso by low doses of zzso zzso Together, these results uncover novel functions of zzso and contribute to the understanding of zzso involvement in tumor zzso Moreover, they provide a rationale to the therapeutic use of zzso zzso to enhance cancer zzso in selected zzso
