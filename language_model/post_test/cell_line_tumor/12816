In a series of zzso adult soft tissue zzso analyzed by zzso we have observed in approximately zzso of them a zzso amplification of either zzso bands zzso or zzso These two zzso likely target the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both genes zzso proteins that are zzso of the zzso family of zzso zzso Very good correlations between amplification and expression levels were zzso Welch test analyses of zzso data demonstrate that tumors with zzso share a large set of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in cell lines with these zzso leads to similar zzso decrease of proliferation rate, and to a lesser extent decrease of migration zzso These data, and the fact that these zzso are observed either in zzso zzso or in zzso zzso zzso suggest that these zzso events could be involved in zzso and progression of soft tissue zzso
