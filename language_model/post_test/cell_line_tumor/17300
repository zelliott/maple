Work in this laboratory has been involved with the design of zzso zzso cancer drugs zzso capable of both recognizing the DNA major groove and zzso the zzso backbone upon reduction to the zzso The zzso species recognizes the major groove of DNA at single base pairs by zzso hydrogen zzso The present study extends recognition beyond a single base pair by adding zzso acid zzso to the zzso center of the zzso zzso Thus, extension with zzso or zzso results in zzso zzso at zzso with insignificant zzso zzso zzso zzso models were used to validate the observed sequence zzso This report also describes the design of zzso not capable of DNA zzso zzso of major groove interactions by zzso or the presence of zzso bulk prevented DNA zzso reactions upon reductive zzso From these studies it was concluded that DNA zzso was not necessary for zzso zzso and zzso zzso For example, linkage of two zzso to the zzso results in highly selective zzso and zzso activity against melanoma, although this compound is a weak DNA zzso
