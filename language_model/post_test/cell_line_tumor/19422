zzso lineage switch zzso 5 and 7 were originally isolated as genes zzso during an zzso lineage zzso We have shown previously that zzso zzso a zzso zzso on zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso maturation by restricting proliferation and zzso zzso zzso however, zzso does not influence the zzso of zzso zzso Under the influence of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso to the nucleus where it associates with both zzso and zzso In the nucleus, zzso is able to suppress zzso zzso and reduce zzso binding to zzso We conclude that zzso and zzso act zzso to induce zzso and zzso changes associated with zzso lineage zzso
