Although zzso zzso has toxicity on zzso system, it is uncertain if such toxicity is induced by zzso zzso To study whether zzso zzso has the zzso effect and its relevant zzso proliferation zzso of zzso human breast cancer cells, zzso zzso zzso activity zzso and zzso zzso competitive binding zzso were conducted to screen the zzso effect of zzso zzso The zzso cells proliferated in the stimulation of zzso zzso and got to the peak at zzso zzso zzso And this proliferation could be completely blocked by zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso could increase the weight of zzso of zzso zzso rats and the zzso activity of zzso complying with zzso zzso However, zzso zzso could not affect the binding of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso So zzso zzso exhibits the zzso effect through binding and zzso zzso rather than bind to zzso by competing with zzso
