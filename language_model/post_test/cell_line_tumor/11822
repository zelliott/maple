To screen the best zzso components of zzso zzso and their sensitive cell zzso 

Sixteen different components of alcohol extracts from zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso were got by zzso column zzso zzso with alcohol in different zzso In the first zzso the zzso control group, the drug group, the positive group and the blank group were set zzso Then the human cancer cell lines such as zzso zzso zzso and lung cancer zzso zzso were processed with the zzso and the concentration for each drug group was 100 zzso zzso zzso Thus, the 48 hour suppression ratio to the four kinds of cancer cells for each component were compared by the zzso method, to select the most zzso components and the most sensitive cell lines, which were used as the subjects of the second zzso In the second zzso each component including the concentration of zzso zzso 25, 50, 100 zzso zzso zzso was used to treat the sensitive cell lines and the zzso rates to each cell line of 24, 48, 72 h by the zzso zzso were zzso Also, the zzso of each component was calculated and their main chemical composition was analyzed by zzso 

The zzso effect to the proliferation of the different cancer cells has great difference among 16 zzso and the lung cancer cells are more sensitive to them than the zzso zzso Besides, the zzso rates of zzso zzso and zzso are higher than the other components and their effect has a certain time and concentration zzso At 72 zzso the zzso rate of each component ranges from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso for lung cancer cells, and zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are the zzso 

The zzso in alcohol extracts from zzso zzso have exerted a satisfactory zzso effect on the lung cancer cell zzso
