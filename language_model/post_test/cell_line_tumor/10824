zzso instability of tumor cells can result in translation of proteins that are out of frame, resulting in expression of zzso These zzso are not zzso and therefore should be zzso By zzso peptides from human zzso zzso zzso tumor cell surfaces and subjecting them to tandem mass zzso we identified a novel zzso zzso corresponding to a zzso in the 3' zzso zzso type 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso predicted that a zzso acid sequence embedded in this zzso would bind to zzso We confirmed this prediction using an zzso zzso zzso followed by live cell relative affinity zzso but also showed that the zzso binds to zzso Based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were designed and tested for their affinities to zzso and their abilities to elicit zzso and zzso capable of killing zzso in zzso zzso peptides as well as zzso induced zzso zzso as measured by zzso zzso These zzso also killed zzso tumor cells in zzso release zzso This study reports a new zzso target in zzso and further zzso the concept that rational design and testing of multiple peptides for the same zzso zzso elicits a broader response among different individuals than single zzso zzso
