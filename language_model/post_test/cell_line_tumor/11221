zzso zzso is the principal protein component of zzso bodies, a pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease zzso This protein may regulate protein zzso 2A zzso activity, although the molecular mechanisms for zzso regulation of zzso and the potential zzso actions of zzso against zzso pathology remain largely zzso We found that zzso gene zzso in zzso cells and primary zzso led to zzso zzso at zzso a known target of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was higher in zzso cells and primary zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso may promote zzso zzso and zzso zzso leading to zzso of zzso zzso revealed higher zzso complex formation in zzso cells and zzso transgenic zzso A zzso zzso zzso and an zzso cell viability zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso protected zzso against zzso cell zzso zzso the zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso ameliorated the zzso of zzso Our findings define a potential molecular mechanism for zzso regulation of zzso through formation of the zzso complex, zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso may lead to zzso in zzso in part by suppressing the zzso zzso activity of zzso
