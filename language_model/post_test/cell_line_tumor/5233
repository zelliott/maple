To investigate the changes and effects of zzso of in zzso zzso cells zzso after zzso 

zzso cells were incubated at 42 degrees C for 2 zzso The changes of zzso and protein level of zzso were detected by real-time zzso and zzso at different zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso or zzso plus zzso respectively, before heat zzso zzso zzso zzso was applied to determine the zzso of zzso cells before zzso and at 2 zzso 4 zzso 6 zzso 8 zzso 12 h and 24 h after zzso 

zzso expression was up regulated at 2 zzso reached to its peak at 4 zzso descended at 8 h and returned to the normal level at 24 h after zzso The zzso of zzso through zzso induced zzso and delayed descent of zzso Combined zzso with zzso and zzso could significantly induce zzso zzso when compared with zzso with zzso or zzso alone ( zzso 

zzso expression in zzso up regulated promptly after zzso zzso of expression and activity of zzso before zzso can increase sensitivity of the tumor cell to heat zzso
