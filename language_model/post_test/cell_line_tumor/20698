To investigate the effect and the mechanism of zzso zzso in the growth zzso of zzso cancer in zzso and in zzso 

After human zzso cancer cell line zzso was treated with zzso cell growth was determined by the Cell Counting zzso zzso zzso and zzso was evaluated by flow zzso analysis stained with zzso zzso The protein expression in zzso cells was analyzed by Western zzso zzso zzso cells were injected zzso into nude mice to establish zzso zzso After 3 weeks of zzso mice were zzso into 2 groups zzso zzso zzso control group, feed with zzso zzso double distilled zzso zzso group, feed with zzso at a dose of 5 zzso zzso zzso All treatment lasted for two weeks, zzso per zzso Eight weeks after zzso tumor weight and zzso rate were evaluated respectively after the mice were zzso zzso was used to detect the positive expression of zzso and zzso in the zzso 

The proliferation of zzso cancer cells was inhibited significantly by zzso with zzso being zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso rate induced by zzso was markedly zzso than that of zzso The expression of zzso was zzso in zzso cells after treatment of zzso zzso inhibited the growth of zzso zzso tumors in nude zzso Furthermore, the positive expression of zzso and zzso were both decreased in tumors after administration of zzso 

zzso exerts zzso activity in zzso cancer both in zzso and in zzso which may be related to zzso of zzso zzso
