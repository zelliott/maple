A novel zzso analog zzso zzso zzso was characterized for its zzso in a zzso line panel and further characterized for zzso metabolism and mechanism of action in 15 additional cancer cell lines, including zzso zzso In both panels sensitivity varied zzso zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso zzso zzso showed a different sensitivity profile compared to zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of the zzso protected against zzso zzso and zzso protected against zzso but zzso zzso for zzso zzso not, although it protected against zzso demonstrating that zzso is a zzso for zzso and not for zzso zzso activity was abundant in all cell lines, including the zzso zzso zzso was a very poor zzso for zzso zzso zzso less than zzso zzso was rapidly zzso to its zzso predominantly the zzso which was highest in the most sensitive cells zzso zzso and lowest in the least sensitive zzso zzso did not significantly affect zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso into zzso and DNA was higher in sensitive zzso and low in insensitive zzso zzso In sensitive zzso cells 1 zzso zzso resulted in zzso zzso of zzso synthesis but 100 zzso zzso was required in zzso and zzso zzso zzso at zzso values did not affect the integrity of zzso DNA synthesis was completely inhibited in sensitive zzso cells at 1 zzso but in other cells even higher zzso only resulted in a partial zzso At zzso values zzso zzso the expression of DNA zzso In conclusion, zzso showed a completely different sensitivity profile compared to zzso and zzso its zzso is zzso dependent and is activated by zzso zzso is incorporated into zzso and DNA, did not affect zzso integrity, depleted DNA zzso and inhibited zzso and DNA zzso zzso formation is related with zzso
