zzso zzso 17 zzso encodes zzso zzso an zzso with zzso and 17, zzso activities involved in zzso zzso Here we examine the role of zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and corresponding zzso zzso showed that zzso is zzso in zzso zzso (15 of 24, zzso To understand the functional significance of this zzso we silenced zzso gene by introduction of zzso into zzso cancer cell line zzso followed by functional zzso Further, to understand the molecular basis of the role of zzso we zzso the expression of key zzso genes and identified several components of the zzso and invasion pathways that are potentially regulated by zzso zzso of zzso caused decreased cell proliferation and induced zzso zzso zzso depletion leads to zzso of zzso genes B cell zzso 2 zzso and zzso reverse zzso zzso indicating induced zzso Also, zzso of zzso decreased the cellular invasion ability and regulated expression of several invasion zzso components such as melanoma cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 and 9 zzso and zzso and tissue inhibitor of zzso 3 zzso In conclusion, this is the first report documenting that zzso of zzso in zzso zzso play a crucial role in zzso zzso by targeting multiple components of zzso and invasion zzso Further studies are required to understand the detailed mechanisms underlying zzso regulation of these zzso
