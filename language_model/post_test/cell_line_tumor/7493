zzso zzso are an abundant class of small zzso zzso molecules that inhibit the expression of zzso genes in zzso zzso These small zzso have been demonstrated to play crucial roles in a variety of biological processes including cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso of specific expression patterns of zzso is critical for functional zzso Here, we describe a zzso reporter zzso method to measure zzso activity in cultured cells and mice using a zzso zzso reporter gene controlled by zzso binding sites in its zzso zzso This method can be used to zzso monitor the expression patterns of functionally active zzso involved in different biological processes or diseases in zzso
