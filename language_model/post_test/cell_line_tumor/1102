zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells leads to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and subsequent increases in zzso pH zzso This process requires zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso but additional signaling zzso have not been zzso One candidate is the zzso zzso protein zzso which interacts with zzso via specific regulatory zzso The data show that initiation of zzso zzso resulted in rapid increases in both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and occurred in parallel with zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso at this site is known to activate zzso and increase its association with zzso zzso with a central role for zzso zzso in this zzso regulation, an zzso dominant negative zzso construct inhibited both zzso recruitment and zzso increases after zzso zzso zzso zzso occurred in parallel with zzso zzso zzso zzso and the latter proceeded normally in cells expressing dominant negative zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso zzso prevented increases in zzso zzso after initiation of zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso after zzso zzso requires zzso zzso zzso activity, but zzso zzso zzso zzso does not require zzso zzso These data describe a specific role for zzso in the coordinate regulation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso function is necessary for zzso recruitment to the zzso membrane and zzso zzso increases triggered by zzso zzso The data also define a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
