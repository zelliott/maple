To determine whether zzso zzso and its truncated form zzso contribute to gastric zzso using in zzso and in zzso zzso 

Human zzso and zzso plasmids were constructed and expressed in zzso (a gastric zzso cell line) to investigate the effect of zzso zzso or zzso on cell growth and zzso in nude zzso 

The growth of zzso or zzso cells was significantly increased compared with that of the control cells, and zzso cells grew more rapidly than zzso zzso The number of colony formation of the cells zzso with zzso or zzso gene was larger than the control zzso In nude mice injected with zzso or zzso cells, visible tumor was observed earlier and the tumor zzso were larger in size and weight than in control animals that were injected with cells without the zzso of either zzso 

zzso zzso or zzso can promote human gastric cancer cell growth in zzso and in zzso and zzso has greater effect than zzso zzso may be a more promising gene therapeutic target compared with zzso for treatment of zzso zzso
