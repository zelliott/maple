zzso cancer is an aggressive disease that responds poorly to conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso radiation has advantages compared with conventional zzso because it enables more accurate dose distribution and more efficient tumor cell zzso To zzso the effects of local zzso on the characteristics of zzso tumors, it is necessary to understand the nature of zzso in zzso tumor zzso this will, in turn, facilitate the development of effective strategies to counter tumor cell zzso which can be used in combination with zzso The aim of the present study was to examine the zzso of pancreatic cancer cells exposed to zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso suppressed the migration of zzso zzso and zzso diminished the zzso of zzso and tended to reduce the invasion of zzso and zzso However, zzso zzso increased the zzso of zzso through the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Administration of zzso zzso inhibitor zzso alone failed to reduce zzso zzso zzso whereas the combination of zzso and zzso zzso forming protein zzso zzso inhibitor suppressed zzso Furthermore, zzso showed zzso transition when we treated with zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso is effective in suppressing the invasive potential of several pancreatic tumor cell lines, but not zzso this is the first study showing that zzso zzso zzso the invasive potential of a tumor cell zzso Further in zzso studies are required to examine the therapeutic effectiveness of zzso combined with zzso of both zzso and zzso modes of tumor cell zzso
