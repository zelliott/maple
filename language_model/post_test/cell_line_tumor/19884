zzso zzso is a zzso zzso involved in various cellular functions, including the zzso regulation of certain integral zzso Here we demonstrated that zzso of zzso suppressed the proliferation of zzso zzso cells treated with zzso growth factor zzso After stimulation with zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso beta was suppressed in zzso zzso cells, compared with zzso zzso the zzso was enhanced by depletion of zzso by zzso zzso In this study we focused on the role of low molecular weight zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso via a zzso zzso We found that depletion of zzso using zzso interference enhanced the zzso zzso of zzso indicating that zzso works for zzso The enhancement of the zzso of zzso was well correlated with zzso of zzso by cellular zzso generated in the cells zzso with zzso In zzso with hydrogen zzso treatment, zzso showed decreased activity with the zzso formation of zzso zzso zzso protected zzso from hydrogen zzso zzso and zzso in concert with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This strongly suggests that retention of activity of zzso by enhanced zzso expression suppresses the proliferation of cells treated with zzso via enhanced zzso of zzso Thus, zzso plays an important role in zzso cell proliferation by regulating the zzso state of zzso
