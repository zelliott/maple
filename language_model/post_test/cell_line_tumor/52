zzso breast cancer zzso is the most lethal form of primary breast zzso zzso zzso derives from generation of zzso zzso which are zzso cell clusters that rapidly spread by a form of continuous invasion known as passive zzso In most zzso expression of zzso an zzso marker, is indicative of low zzso zzso In zzso zzso is zzso and supports formation of zzso zzso by promoting zzso cell interactions rather than adherence to zzso zzso a surface component of zzso zzso is anchored by interaction with zzso zzso zzso We show that the unique zzso properties of zzso result in part from zzso of the translation initiation factor zzso in most zzso zzso zzso the protein synthetic machinery for increased translation of zzso with internal zzso entry sites zzso that promote zzso zzso cell survival and formation of zzso zzso zzso of zzso promotes formation of zzso zzso zzso by enhancing translation of zzso zzso zzso These findings provide a new understanding of zzso control in the development of advanced breast zzso
