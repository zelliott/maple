The mechanisms controlling the zzso zzso current zzso are incompletely zzso Here, we investigate the zzso of zzso by cellular cholesterol and the potential involvement of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in this zzso In zzso zzso zzso cells, a current with zzso and pharmacological properties characteristic of zzso was activated by zzso zzso A zzso increase in cellular cholesterol content had no zzso effects on zzso organization or zzso zzso A zzso reduction in cellular cholesterol content increased cortical and stress zzso zzso content in swollen zzso zzso depletion increased zzso zzso rate and zzso current after a modest zzso but not after a severe zzso reduction in zzso zzso The cholesterol zzso increase in zzso zzso current was prevented by zzso disruption using zzso B zzso while the current zzso rate was unaffected by zzso but dependent on zzso zzso zzso activity was decreased by approximately zzso in zzso and approximately 50% in severely swollen zzso In modestly swollen cells, this reduction was prevented by cholesterol zzso which also increased zzso zzso zzso zzso which stimulates zzso and causes zzso zzso zzso zzso in modestly swollen zzso zzso activity was unaffected by inclusion of a zzso zzso analogue or a zzso zzso in the zzso or zzso treatment to zzso zzso It is suggested that in zzso cells, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso magnitude and zzso rate, respectively, and that cholesterol depletion zzso zzso at least in part by preventing the zzso decrease in zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso
