To investigate zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso we have developed zzso zzso zzso were prepared in two steps starting from zzso zzso in zzso zzso yields zzso corrected for 100 zzso and with high zzso purity zzso and shown to be stable zzso in an in zzso zzso stability zzso The binding of zzso zzso to zzso human zzso cells was temperature dependent, and binding levels at 4 degrees C were reduced to half of that at 37 degrees C, which was similar to the reduction rate observed for zzso zzso distribution studies in mice showed the highest zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with relatively high zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that this zzso holds promise as a useful zzso zzso for PET zzso
