This study aimed at investigating zzso in the zzso B surface protein zzso in zzso zzso B virus zzso infection zzso and their influence on viral zzso and zzso 

The characteristics of 61 carriers with zzso zzso group), 153 zzso carriers with serum zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso zzso and 54 carriers with serum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso blood donors were zzso zzso in the major zzso region zzso of the viral sequences were zzso Thirteen representative zzso zzso observed in zzso sequences were zzso characterized with a panel of zzso zzso zzso and commercial zzso zzso and functionally characterized in zzso cells and zzso injected zzso 

Of 61 zzso zzso 34 zzso zzso zzso zzso which was significantly higher than the frequency in either the zzso zzso zzso or the zzso group zzso zzso zzso in zzso induced by the 13 representative zzso zzso identified in the zzso group were assessed by reacting zzso zzso zzso with 30 different zzso targeting various zzso Four out of the 13 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso strongly decreased the zzso sensitivity of seven commercial zzso zzso and 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso significantly impaired zzso and/or S protein zzso in both zzso cells and zzso 

zzso zzso alter zzso and impair zzso zzso both of which may contribute to zzso detection failure in individuals with zzso
