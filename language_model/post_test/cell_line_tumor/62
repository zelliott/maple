The zzso III zzso zzso plays a key role in generation of zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso regulates cancer cell zzso to immune surveillance through zzso zzso Indeed, zzso disruption zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and enhanced the zzso of tumor cells to zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso while expression of other zzso proteins examined was not zzso zzso of zzso inhibited the specific zzso of zzso against zzso cells, indicating a pivotal role of zzso in the interaction between tumor cells and zzso Both zzso and zzso are zzso in zzso cells and directly zzso with the 3' untranslated region zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso or these zzso zzso correlated with zzso protein expression and zzso of zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso while zzso zzso levels remained zzso zzso and in zzso zzso analyses of 30 primary zzso zzso demonstrated that expression of zzso zzso or zzso was zzso associated with zzso zzso Taken together, zzso is responsible for the generation of the mature zzso and zzso which suppress zzso expression on tumor cells, thereby zzso the zzso of tumor cells to zzso zzso This study suggests development of novel zzso therapy to promote zzso of tumor zzso
