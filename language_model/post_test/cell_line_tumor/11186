In an attempt to induce zzso T zzso zzso that react to zzso cancer cells, we isolated a zzso clone that specifically recognizes zzso in an zzso zzso zzso zzso T zzso were obtained from a healthy adult donor and zzso twice in zzso with zzso zzso cells that were originally derived from an zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso modification involved zzso gene zzso of intrinsic zzso molecules and zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso Then, zzso library construction using zzso extracted from the parental zzso cells and subsequent expression cloning were zzso These experiments revealed that a zzso clone obtained from the bulk culture recognized a minimal zzso zzso zzso which was derived from an zzso zzso presented by zzso zzso This clone exhibited zzso activities against three zzso cancer cell lines and normal zzso zzso cells in an zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso cancer cells can be used as an artificial zzso cell to generate zzso zzso in a manner restricted by an zzso zzso of zzso
