zzso zzso is frequently zzso in many types of human zzso and its zzso zzso reduces proliferation of cancer zzso Despite its implied zzso zzso zzso functions, its exact role in zzso remains unclear as zzso zzso is also associated with zzso zzso and zzso In this study, we explore the zzso role of zzso its influence on the zzso of zzso cells under stress conditions and the clinical significance of zzso expression and promoter zzso in zzso cell lung cancer zzso DNA zzso expression zzso of zzso is demonstrated in both clinical samples and cell zzso zzso promoter was more frequently zzso in lung zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso partially restored zzso expression in cell zzso Interestingly, zzso A triggered zzso of zzso expression in cancer cell lines and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso surgical specimens correlated with that of zzso and zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso of zzso in cancer cell lines reduced cell migration, invasion and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso impaired cell zzso but only in the lung zzso cell line zzso Upon hydrogen zzso treatment, zzso protected cell zzso migratory potential and zzso independence by attenuating zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso decreased cell zzso zzso migration and zzso independence in a zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso revealed zzso properties in zzso but promoted zzso potential of the cells exposed to stress, suggesting a zzso function in lung zzso depending on cell type and zzso zzso
