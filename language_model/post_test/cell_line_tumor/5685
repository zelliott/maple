zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso mediates zzso and zzso invasion; however, the effect of zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso remains zzso The aim of this study is to clarify the benefit of a zzso inhibitor zzso for zzso zzso 

zzso was administered orally to gastric cancer models created by zzso zzso of zzso gastric cancer cells, zzso The effects of zzso on zzso vessel invasion, zzso vessel density, and zzso zzso were examined by zzso or zzso 

zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso with zzso values of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso gastric cancer models created by the zzso zzso of zzso cells showed the zzso zzso growth and frequently developed zzso zzso The oral administration of zzso significantly ( zzso reduced the size of zzso zzso and the number of the zzso zzso in gastric cancer zzso The degree of zzso invasion and zzso was significantly ( zzso lower in the gastric zzso treated by zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso of zzso zzso cells in gastric zzso 

The zzso of zzso targeting zzso zzso is a therapeutic strategy for zzso zzso zzso of zzso gastric zzso
