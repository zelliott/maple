The organic zzso zzso zzso mediates the zzso zzso of zzso drugs and zzso from zzso zzso The zzso rates of these compounds may depend on zzso expression zzso Because little is known about the regulation of the human zzso zzso zzso we characterized the zzso promoter with respect to zzso elements and their binding zzso By computer analysis, we identified two adjacent putative zzso elements for the zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Each element is of the direct repeat zzso format, containing directly repeated zzso separated by two zzso In zzso mobility shift zzso both elements directly zzso with zzso A zzso reporter construct containing the zzso promoter was strongly activated by zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of either zzso element alone or in combination severely decreased the zzso zzso of the zzso promoter, indicating that both elements are functionally zzso Because zzso is a known target for zzso zzso suppression of transcription, we studied whether zzso acid zzso suppresses zzso gene expression by zzso zzso zzso Treatment of cells with zzso could indeed suppress the zzso of the zzso zzso gene by zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso zzso small zzso partner zzso inhibited zzso of the zzso zzso promoter and of the zzso zzso gene by zzso In conclusion, the zzso zzso zzso an important drug zzso in the human liver, is activated by zzso and suppressed by zzso acids via zzso
