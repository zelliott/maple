zzso zzso is a zzso tumor with poor prognosis and its early detection is still a clinical zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the detection of pancreatic zzso in a zzso human pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso nude mice zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging were performed weekly on zzso human pancreatic zzso zzso zzso nude mice from the 2nd week after tumor cell zzso zzso of interest method and zzso ratio zzso zzso were used for zzso zzso zzso proliferation was evaluated by zzso analysis of zzso cell nuclear zzso 

zzso zzso in the tumor zzso could be detected 1 week earlier in zzso than that in zzso Peak zzso ratio was obtained at the 5th week in zzso and at the 4th week in zzso zzso ratio in zzso was lower than that in zzso during the same zzso By visual zzso tumor zzso were more easily observed in zzso than in zzso in most of the zzso Linear correlation analysis indicated zzso ratios in zzso had no significant correlation with those in zzso zzso size, zzso ratio in zzso and zzso ratio in zzso were not found to be significantly correlated with tumor zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso 

zzso imaging can be used for the detection of pancreatic zzso In the early stage of tumor growth, zzso has better zzso than that of zzso
