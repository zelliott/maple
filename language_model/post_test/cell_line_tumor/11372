Sixteen new zzso derivatives were prepared in one or two steps from zzso by means of an original and zzso zzso and subsequent zzso zzso This strategy has allowed fast access to a family of zzso zzso derivatives with an enlarged and zzso ring zzso Their synthesis and biological evaluation are zzso One compound zzso zzso is zzso times more active than zzso as a zzso assembly zzso Moreover, some of these compounds are highly zzso and two of them are more potent than zzso on zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso modeling studies, carried out with two of the new zzso zzso provide useful hints about how a given zzso introduced at positions zzso and zzso of the zzso ring results in improved binding interactions between one of the new derivatives and the zzso interface when compared to the parent compound zzso
