Recent studies have shown that zzso stem cells zzso obtained from bone zzso transplantation patients originate from the zzso This clinical observation suggests that zzso in their niches could be resistant to zzso However, the zzso responses of bone zzso zzso to zzso have rarely been described in the zzso 

In this study, human bone zzso zzso expanded zzso were used to investigate their sensitivity to zzso in zzso and the cellular mechanisms that may facilitate resistance to zzso The human lung cancer cell line zzso and the breast cancer cell line zzso were used as controls for zzso the former line has been shown to be zzso and the latter zzso We then examined their in zzso zzso changes and sensitivities to radiation zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso are characterized as resistant to zzso Several cellular mechanisms were demonstrated that may facilitate resistance to zzso zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso break repair by zzso zzso and zzso end joining zzso and the zzso capacity for scavenging zzso oxygen zzso 

As demonstrated, zzso possess a better zzso zzso oxygen zzso capacity and active zzso break repair to facilitate their zzso These findings provide a better understanding of zzso zzso responses in zzso and may lead to the development of better strategies for stem cell treatment and cancer zzso
