zzso zzso zzso is common in Southeast Asia and over zzso of zzso zzso have zzso zzso This study characterized the zzso activity of a novel potent dual zzso zzso zzso in five zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in which all of the cell lines possessed zzso and activated expression of zzso and zzso Over zzso zzso of cell growth in all of these cell lines were achieved after 72 h of zzso incubation and their zzso were in hundred zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were selected to further evaluate the effect of zzso on cell cycle, zzso and zzso downstream zzso zzso induced zzso cell cycle arrest and zzso at 24 h incubation and it significantly zzso zzso and its downstream signaling by suppressing the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggesting its effectiveness in zzso of translation and protein zzso zzso was also observed in zzso culture system and zzso formation of zzso cell line zzso was strongly inhibited by zzso zzso activity was observed in zzso zzso in 2 weeks of 10 zzso zzso treatment to tumor bearing zzso nude zzso Both tumor volume and weight in treatment group were significantly lower than those in vehicle group while no obvious body weight decrease was found, suggesting this working dose was effective and zzso zzso effects were observed in combination of zzso with either zzso or zzso There were no synergistic effect observed in drug combination but zzso alone was effective in treating zzso resistant cell lines as compared to its parental zzso The beneficial effects of zzso in both in zzso and in zzso studies for zzso warrant a further zzso
