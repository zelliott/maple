Biological zzso often zzso experimental designs where observations are zzso at multiple levels, and where each level represents a separate component of the zzso overall zzso zzso analysis of such data usually ignores these design effects, whereas more sophisticated methods would improve the statistical power of zzso This report evaluates the statistical performance of an in zzso zzso cell proliferation zzso zzso by identifying the optimal generalized linear mixed model zzso that accurately represents the zzso experimental design and zzso zzso Our statistical assessment found that zzso cell culture zzso data were best zzso with a zzso configured with a zzso link function, a gamma error distribution, and three sources of design zzso zzso zzso and the interaction between zzso variation and zzso The zzso random error of the zzso was estimated to have a zzso of variation zzso zzso zzso per zzso and a zzso component score test described by zzso Lin found that each of the three zzso components were statistically zzso The optimal zzso also confirmed the zzso of five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 17, 49, 66, 74, and zzso Based on information criteria, the optimal gamma zzso consistently zzso equivalent zzso normal and zzso linear models, both with and without random effects zzso Because the gamma zzso was by far the best model on conceptual and empirical zzso and requires only zzso more effort to use, we encourage its use and suggest that zzso models be avoided when zzso
