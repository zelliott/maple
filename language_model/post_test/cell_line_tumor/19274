Although an overall genetic strategy for zzso reverse zzso has been established, the mechanism that zzso the zzso transfer is still poorly zzso We and others independently identified a novel zzso element, termed beta or zzso respectively, that is critical for the zzso DNA synthesis of zzso B zzso A zzso long-range interaction of the zzso template was proposed that involves the zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso and the 3' zzso zzso We subjected the hypothesized base pairing to genetic zzso The data indicated that zzso zzso the hypothesized base pairing markedly impaired zzso DNA zzso while zzso zzso that restored the base pairing rescued the zzso DNA zzso These results demonstrated the critical role of the zzso long-range interaction in zzso DNA zzso We speculate that such a long-range interaction may precisely zzso a donor to an zzso during zzso zzso
