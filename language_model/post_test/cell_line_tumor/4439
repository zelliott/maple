zzso zzso involved in cell zzso and zzso assembly plays important roles in biological processes such as cancer invasion and zzso of multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is aggressive and zzso by acquiring an invasive zzso and this step requires zzso of the zzso zzso Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso its clinical significance such as zzso zzso and its utility of therapeutic zzso zzso and zzso were evaluated using zzso on a tissue zzso of 79 zzso Small interfering zzso zzso approach was used to knock down zzso expression in zzso cancer cell lines to determine whether zzso contributes to tumor cell zzso migration and zzso zzso expression levels were determined by western zzso analysis after zzso zzso using two human zzso cancer cell lines zzso and zzso zzso zzso was significantly correlated with zzso zzso involvement, distance zzso and high International Federation of zzso and zzso zzso stage zzso ( zzso A zzso analysis showed that the zzso expression group was significantly associated with poor overall survival zzso We showed that zzso of zzso by zzso zzso led to a drop in cell zzso and significantly decreased tumor cell zzso migration and zzso compared to zzso zzso We found that zzso expression is a potential poor marker of prognosis for patients with zzso and zzso of zzso suppresses zzso cancer cell proliferation and migration, this could be applied for therapeutic targets in zzso cancer zzso
