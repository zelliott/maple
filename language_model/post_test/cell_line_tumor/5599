The human zzso virus zzso protein zzso has been implicated in zzso zzso zzso one of the hallmark features of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the toxic effects of zzso could thus be a potential mechanism for reducing zzso toxicity in the zzso In this study we demonstrated that zzso zzso was abolished by zzso zzso suggesting the role of zzso in this zzso Furthermore, we also found that zzso of zzso cells with zzso exerted protection against zzso toxicity by decreasing zzso zzso zzso We also demonstrated that zzso calcium zzso zzso was able to abolish zzso zzso thereby zzso the role of calcium signaling in zzso zzso We also showed that zzso signaling zzso was critical for zzso protection of zzso Additionally, blocking calcium entry with zzso resulted in suppression of zzso zzso zzso These findings thus underscore the role of zzso calcium signaling and zzso zzso in the protection of cells against zzso zzso zzso
