zzso cells are often resistant to complement zzso through the enhanced expression of complement zzso In this work, we examined the protective role of factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso in two zzso cell lung cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso upon zzso of the classical zzso of zzso zzso was activated with zzso zzso raised against each cell zzso After blocking factor H activity with a zzso zzso zzso deposition and zzso release were more zzso Besides, a combined zzso of factor H and zzso significantly increased zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not show any effect in the control of complement zzso Factor H expression was zzso on zzso cells using small interfering zzso In zzso growth of factor zzso cells in zzso mice was significantly zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso showed an enhanced zzso of complement in these zzso Besides, when mice were depleted of complement with zzso zzso factor, growth was recovered, providing further evidence that complement was important in the reduction of in zzso zzso In conclusion, we show that expression of the complement inhibitor factor H by lung cancer cells can prevent complement zzso and improve tumor development in zzso This may have important consequences in the efficiency of zzso zzso
