The zzso zzso gene zzso zzso coli zzso is zzso in most zzso cancer cases, leading to the synthesis of truncated zzso products and the stabilization of zzso zzso zzso is almost always retained in zzso cells, suggesting that it serves an essential zzso Here, zzso interference has been used to zzso truncated zzso in several zzso cancer cell lines expressing truncated zzso of different zzso thereby performing an analysis covering most of the zzso cluster region zzso The consequences on proliferation in zzso zzso formation in zzso and the level and zzso activity of zzso have been zzso zzso of truncated zzso results in an zzso of zzso cell population expansion in zzso in 6 cell lines out of 6 and zzso of zzso outgrowth in zzso as zzso in one of these cell lines, zzso This provides a general rule explaining the retention of truncated zzso in zzso zzso and defines it as a suitable target for therapeutic zzso Actually, we also show that it is possible to design a zzso that targets a specific truncated zzso of zzso without altering the expression of zzso zzso zzso of truncated zzso is accompanied by an zzso of the zzso activity of zzso in 5 out of 6 cell zzso Surprisingly, the increased zzso is associated in most cases (4 out of 5) with an zzso of zzso levels, indicating that truncated zzso can still zzso zzso zzso through controlling the level of zzso This control can happen even when truncated zzso lacks the zzso zzso domain zzso involved in targeting zzso for zzso zzso Thus, truncated zzso is an essential component of zzso cancer cells, required for cell zzso possibly by adjusting zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso
