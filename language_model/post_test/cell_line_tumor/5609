Most experimental work addressing zzso zzso inhibitor has focused on suppressing zzso zzso Little is known about the mechanism by which this inhibitor can also block zzso zzso Here, the effects of zzso inhibitor on vascular zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso the highly zzso human lung zzso cell line zzso and its parental line zzso which has a low zzso capacity, we found elevated zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso and protein in zzso cells while zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso and protein in zzso cells in a zzso zzso The expression of zzso and zzso was significantly increased in zzso zzso tumors compared with zzso zzso The zzso tumors showed more zzso vessels and zzso zzso zzso than the zzso zzso In zzso zzso decreased zzso expression in zzso zzso mice to a similar level to that in the zzso zzso zzso zzso with this decrease in zzso zzso the density of zzso vessels and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso mice were suppressed to approximately that found in the zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggest that the differential expression of zzso and zzso might help explain the different zzso zzso of lung zzso cancer, and that zzso inhibitor mediates zzso to block zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso may be a potential therapeutic target for blocking zzso zzso zzso in lung zzso
