To identify the characteristics of zzso colitis zzso zzso 8 zzso high-grade zzso and invasive zzso were implanted into severely combined zzso zzso mice and/or cultured in zzso zzso zzso consisting of high-grade zzso showed extremely slow proliferation after zzso zzso zzso and in zzso culture failed (4 zzso However, invasive zzso demonstrated rapid growth both after zzso mouse zzso and in zzso zzso zzso From two cases of invasive zzso 6 cell lines were established, and these are the first to be described in the zzso In addition to variation in zzso determined zzso expression regarding zzso zzso A and zzso zzso the established cell lines showed varying differentiation zzso or poorly differentiated zzso zzso zzso and poorly differentiated zzso with zzso giant cells and bone zzso The results are in contrast with findings for sporadic zzso zzso Although the prevalence of DNA zzso is not zzso loss of zzso zzso and zzso and deletion of zzso 8 to 11 in zzso were revealed in all of 6 cell lines, suggesting relatively high genetic zzso We found loss or zzso of many zzso zzso 5, 6, 8, 10, 11, 13, 16, 17, 18 and zzso other than zzso 1, 5, 8, 11, 13, 17 and 18, which are frequently involved in sporadic zzso zzso cell zzso Thus, the established cell lines may be good models of zzso and progression in the chronic zzso zzso
