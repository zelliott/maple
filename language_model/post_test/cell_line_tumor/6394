zzso a member of the zzso zzso protein family, regulates the zzso and zzso of cancer zzso Moreover, high zzso expression levels correlate with poor patient survival in several zzso Although zzso zzso and structural data indicate that zzso is a zzso zzso it is unknown if two functional zzso zzso are required for the productive recognition of protein targets and the promotion of cell zzso To address this question, we created zzso linked zzso zzso using a zzso rich flexible zzso The zzso zzso zzso proteins exhibited zzso affinities for calcium and zzso zzso retained the ability to regulate zzso zzso zzso and promoted tumor cell invasion when expressed in zzso colon zzso zzso zzso of the two zzso zzso in one zzso while leaving the other zzso intact, caused a zzso reduction in binding affinity for zzso zzso zzso with a weakened ability to regulate the zzso equilibrium of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso proteins with one zzso deficient in calcium responsiveness did not support zzso colon zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso data indicate that the zzso zzso binds a single zzso target zzso These data are consistent with a model in which a single zzso forms interactions in the vicinity of the zzso target binding zzso of each zzso in such a manner that both target binding sites are required for the efficient interaction with zzso
