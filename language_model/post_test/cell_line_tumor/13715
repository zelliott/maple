zzso has been implicated in zzso cell zzso cell migration, and poor prognosis in patients with high-grade zzso and zzso In this study, we examine zzso expression in a cohort of 176 primary breast zzso by gene profiling and tissue zzso zzso We show that zzso is significantly zzso in zzso breast zzso zzso zzso levels are associated with poor zzso absence of zzso and zzso hormone receptors zzso zzso and zzso increased cell zzso and high zzso zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso cell line, zzso significantly reduced cell growth rate and zzso the cells to growth zzso by omega-3 zzso acid zzso A target of zzso zzso in the nucleus is zzso a zzso nuclear zzso that functions as a zzso factor by either zzso or zzso with other nuclear receptors such as zzso Based on our zzso data, zzso like zzso is an adverse zzso factor for breast zzso We propose that the zzso zzso promotes cell zzso in zzso breast zzso zzso this zzso may thus provide an alternate route for the treatment of zzso breast zzso
