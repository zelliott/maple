zzso zzso and its two known zzso zzso and zzso may play a role in diseases including tumor growth and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso these molecules may be promising targets for drug zzso While studies of cell signaling and zzso screening for drug discovery increasingly are based on zzso zzso because of their high sensitivity and zzso ratio, there currently is no zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso To develop a zzso probe for zzso binding and cellular zzso we fused zzso to zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso that is the smallest known zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso did not alter the zzso zzso spectrum and only minimally affected zzso function under varying conditions of zzso temperature, and zzso zzso zzso also activated zzso signaling to a comparable extent as zzso zzso Using zzso plate zzso we established that zzso increases zzso zzso to a significantly greater extent than zzso We also showed that zzso can be used to zzso zzso of zzso zzso binding by compounds that specifically target zzso These data validate zzso as a zzso probe to investigate molecular functions of zzso and zzso and screen for compounds that zzso zzso zzso
