zzso optical zzso zzso zzso is an emerging imaging zzso that provides subsurface zzso and zzso tissue images with near zzso resolution and zzso zzso zzso A key drawback of zzso for some applications is its shallow zzso zzso penetration zzso This fundamentally limits zzso imaging to transparent, zzso zzso or zzso anatomical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was developed for zzso in zzso imaging of zzso and zzso at greater zzso providing access to zzso solid zzso Using zzso prostate cancer in a rat zzso model, this study evaluated the feasibility of zzso monitoring of zzso changes deep within a tumor caused by zzso therapy zzso 

The zzso zzso probe was constructed using a 22 G zzso approximately zzso zzso needle, with an zzso surface finish for enhanced ultrasound zzso The lens of the probe consisted of a zzso zzso fusion spliced to an zzso zzso tip to allow zzso zzso The lens was then fusion spliced to a zzso optical fiber that was attached to the linear scanner via zzso and driven along the zzso axis of the needle to produce a zzso subsurface zzso zzso The zzso zzso system was used to monitor zzso changes deep within the tumor mass in response to zzso in the rat zzso model of zzso prostate zzso Surface zzso was delivered at zzso zzso with 40 zzso of power, for a total light dose of 76 zzso using zzso zzso of zzso as the zzso zzso 

zzso demonstrated its ability to detect zzso in zzso and record zzso zzso A reduction of detected vascular cross zzso area during treatment and partial recovery zzso were zzso 

zzso is a potentially effective tool for real-time zzso and monitoring of the progress of zzso zzso This capability may play an important role in zzso the mechanisms of zzso in tumors, zzso planning, feedback control for treatment zzso determining treatment zzso and zzso zzso
