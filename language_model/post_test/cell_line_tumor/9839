Little is known concerning the zzso zzso and magnitude of direct therapeutic effects of zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso Such knowledge would help guide the rational development of targeted zzso from bench to bedside and zzso use of imaging technologies that zzso tumor function in zzso clinical zzso 

zzso studies were done using ex zzso zzso zzso and in zzso ultrasound imaging to characterize tumor zzso in a human zzso zzso zzso model treated with the zzso zzso zzso Clinical evaluation was by quantitative magnetic resonance imaging in 10 patients with zzso zzso cancer treated with zzso 

zzso zzso experiments showed reduction in zzso vessels within 24 to 48 h of zzso drug administration zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging confirmed reduced tumor blood volume within the same time frame zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso results, reductions in enhancing fraction and fractional plasma volume were detected in patient zzso cancer zzso within 48 h after a single dose of zzso that persisted throughout one cycle of zzso These effects were followed by resolution of zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor shrinkage in 9 of 26 tumors at day zzso 

These data suggest that zzso zzso zzso rapid structural and functional effects with downstream significant zzso activity within one cycle of zzso This finding has important implications for the design of zzso clinical trials that incorporate zzso zzso The study shows how animal data help interpret clinical imaging data, an important step toward the validation of image zzso of tumor structure and zzso
