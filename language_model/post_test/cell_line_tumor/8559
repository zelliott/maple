To investigate the effects of zzso a zzso isolated from zzso zzso on human zzso zzso cells in zzso 

The viability of human zzso zzso cells was evaluated using zzso zzso Cell cycle was detected with flow zzso zzso The levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso at zzso were measured using zzso zzso zzso activity was determined with zzso To determine zzso zzso zzso and zzso patterns were zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the cell viability in association with increased zzso E level and decreased zzso B and zzso A zzso The treatment also induced zzso as shown by the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and increase of zzso activity in the zzso However, zzso of the cells with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso did not completely prevent the cell zzso On the other hand, zzso treatment increased zzso zzso and caused zzso zzso pattern in the zzso zzso zzso of cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso alleviated the cell death caused by zzso zzso zzso zzso also increased the levels zzso and zzso at zzso in the cells, which were correlated with the induction of zzso cell zzso 

zzso zzso human zzso zzso cell death through both zzso and zzso zzso
