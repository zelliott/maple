The combination of zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso has recently been proposed as a novel cancer zzso However, the mechanism underlying the zzso effect involved is substantially zzso Here, we show that zzso treatment zzso zzso in zzso human melanoma cells, whereas zzso or zzso alone have no zzso It is known that zzso produces free zzso when oxidized by zzso Because zzso stress could induce zzso we measured the production of free zzso at varying zzso of zzso and zzso Our results show that zzso produces free zzso in a zzso manner, which are suppressed by zzso acid or zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, antioxidants prevent zzso zzso indicating that the zzso free zzso play an important role in the zzso zzso In addition, zzso was observed to activate zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which are almost completely blocked by zzso We further investigated the zzso zzso zzso and found that zzso activates zzso and zzso leading to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These events were also blocked by zzso such as zzso acid or zzso Thus, we propose that zzso free zzso lead to the zzso of human melanoma cells via both death zzso and zzso zzso zzso
