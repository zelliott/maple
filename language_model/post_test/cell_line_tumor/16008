Human zzso zzso infection causes a rapid induction of zzso and zzso the major zzso of zzso protein 1 zzso which in turn have been zzso to activate the viral zzso zzso zzso zzso the major zzso promoter zzso zzso a critical control region for initiating zzso zzso infection and zzso from the zzso state, contains one zzso zzso site and a second candidate interaction zzso In this study we explored the role of these zzso elements in the context of the zzso We first show that the zzso candidate zzso motif binds zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity to a core zzso zzso zzso studies indicate that both zzso response elements are critical for zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso In marked contrast to the results obtained with the isolated promoter, disruption of the zzso recognition sites of the zzso in the context of the infectious zzso zzso has no significant influence on the expression of the zzso protein zzso or viral replication in different cell zzso Moreover, a zzso zzso zzso driven by the zzso zzso zzso with the two zzso binding sites zzso is not compromised in zzso is able to grow and zzso to different zzso of the newborn mice as efficiently as the parental virus, and is competent in zzso We show, however, that combined zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso recognition sites leads to an zzso of the zzso in the zzso zzso infection model, not observed when each single element is zzso Altogether, these results underline the functional zzso of the zzso zzso highlighting the plasticity of this region, which probably evolved to ensure zzso zzso performance across many diverse zzso
