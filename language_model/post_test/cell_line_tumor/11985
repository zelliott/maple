In order to find a zzso of tumor progression in zzso for oral zzso zzso we searched for molecules zzso in OC cells when the cells were treated with zzso growth factor zzso whose zzso is frequently zzso in zzso The expression of zzso which is also known as zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso significantly by the treatment of OC cells with zzso as observed by zzso zzso analysis followed by zzso zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso effect was attenuated by the zzso of a zzso zzso The rate of tumor formation in zzso of zzso zzso tumor cells in zzso nude mice was significantly lower than that of mock zzso zzso In addition tumors formed in zzso by the zzso cells were significantly smaller than those of the zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is a zzso having zzso activity toward tumor progression of OC in zzso
