The human checkpoint zzso zzso has been suggested as a target for cancer zzso Here, we show that a new inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso efficiently abrogates both the zzso radiation zzso S and zzso zzso When the checkpoints were zzso by zzso the majority zzso of cells showed fragmented zzso at 24 hours after zzso (6 zzso The formation of nuclear fragmentation in zzso human cancer cells was directly zzso by zzso video zzso of zzso cells expressing a green fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso Nuclear fragmentation occurred as a result of defective zzso segregation when zzso cells entered their first zzso either prematurely without S and zzso checkpoint arrest in the presence of zzso or after a prolonged S and zzso checkpoint arrest in the absence of zzso The nuclear fragmentation was clearly distinguishable from zzso because zzso activity and nuclear zzso were not zzso Finally, zzso not only accelerated zzso nuclear zzso it also increased the overall cell killing after zzso as measured in zzso survival zzso These results demonstrate that transient zzso zzso by zzso allows premature zzso entry of zzso cells, thereby leading to accelerated onset of zzso nuclear fragmentation and increased cell zzso
