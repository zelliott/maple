zzso cancer is the second cause of zzso death in the western world, and although the genetic and molecular mechanisms involved in the initiation and progression of these tumors are among the best zzso there are significant gaps in our understanding of this zzso The role of zzso signaling in zzso cancer has only recently been zzso Here, we use animal models to investigate the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso levels in colon cancer cell lines resulted in significant differences in tumor growth in a zzso model, with low levels of zzso associated with faster zzso In addition, using a genetic model of zzso zzso where zzso zzso coli zzso zzso lead to initiation of the zzso process zzso zzso we show that zzso of a single zzso of zzso results in higher proliferation in both the normal zzso and zzso tumors, significantly larger tumors in the small zzso and a zzso increase in the number of tumors in the large zzso This was associated with a zzso reduction in the lifespan of zzso mice zzso zzso zzso Gene expression analysis showed that zzso zzso result in a profound zzso zzso affecting genes involved in cell zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and cell attachment to the basement membrane among other functional groups of zzso zzso in agreement with the expression profiling experiments, using an in zzso zzso we show that loss of zzso in colon cancer cells results in a significantly increased potential to invade through a complex zzso zzso zzso these results indicate that zzso has tumor zzso activities and that regulation of cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and invasive potential are important mechanisms of tumor zzso
