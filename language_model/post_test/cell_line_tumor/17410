zzso is a common cause of cell death and is implicated in many disease processes including stroke and chronic degenerative zzso In response to zzso cells express a variety of zzso which allow adaptation to altered zzso demands, decreased oxygen demands, and the removal of zzso damaged zzso Using zzso chain zzso suppression zzso zzso to find genes that are zzso expressed in zzso we identified the zzso zzso family protein zzso zzso is a candidate zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso promoter responds directly to zzso via zzso factor zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso zzso rescued cells from zzso cell death and decreased zzso volumes in an animal model of zzso Further, we show that zzso oxygen species and zzso zzso c release participate in zzso hypoxic cell zzso Altogether, our results show that zzso is induced by zzso and mediates hypoxic cell zzso
