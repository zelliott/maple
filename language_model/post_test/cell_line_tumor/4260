The clinical management of cancer reflects a balance between treatment efficacy and zzso While typically, combination therapy improves response rate and time to progression compared with sequential zzso it causes increased zzso zzso in cases of advanced cancer, emerging guidelines recommend sequential zzso as a means to enhance quality of zzso An alternative approach that could overcome zzso toxicity while retaining therapeutic zzso involves the combination of chemotherapy with targeted zzso In the current study, we tested the hypothesis that combination therapy targeting zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso will show enhanced therapeutic potential in the treatment of cancer, as compared to zzso with zzso We demonstrate in both in zzso and in zzso models of breast cancer that combination therapy with a low dose of zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso is superior to zzso with either low- or high-dose zzso zzso zzso therapeutic efficacy showed prominent sequence zzso zzso of zzso was observed only when the cells were treated with zzso followed by zzso whereas the reverse sequence zzso the benefit of the drug zzso In zzso confirmation of successful sequence dependent combination therapy was demonstrated in a zzso zzso model of breast zzso Finally, to determine if the observed effect is not limited to breast cancer, we extended our studies to a zzso zzso model of pancreatic zzso and found similar outcomes as shown for breast zzso
