The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso factor existing in two zzso A zzso and B zzso resulting from alternative promoter zzso It has long been speculated that genetic zzso of zzso are associated with the risk for various benign and zzso diseases, but data from clinical trials and zzso studies remain zzso The most extensively studied zzso is termed zzso and consists of an zzso zzso zzso zzso and two coding zzso zzso and one silent single zzso zzso in complete linkage zzso zzso frequency in Caucasians zzso Our study aimed at zzso the functional consequences of the zzso single zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso as compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The two zzso and two zzso full-length zzso zzso were expressed by zzso in the zzso human breast cancer cell line zzso and zzso with respect to zzso properties, zzso zzso combined net zzso and protein stability and zzso zzso 

In all experiments the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso were zzso 

Though there still might be tissue specific effects of the zzso our data indicate that these common zzso zzso do not functionally zzso which may provide a basis to explain the zzso outcome of association zzso
