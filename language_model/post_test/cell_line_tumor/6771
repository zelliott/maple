Plasma cells zzso are the zzso cells of the zzso zzso zzso Unlike other dedicated zzso cells, they exist as two populations with opposite cell zzso short-lived and zzso zzso Upon transformation they lead to an incurable zzso called multiple zzso In this study we have explored the molecular mechanism of PC zzso Our data show that their zzso zzso is unique among other zzso cells zzso as neither the death receptors nor the zzso play the central zzso PC zzso is initiated by zzso of zzso at the zzso zzso membrane and subsequent zzso of the zzso zzso zzso before the release of zzso zzso zzso Together, our observations indicate that the zzso function of PC zzso zzso zzso is also the cause of their zzso
