In the course of searching potential zzso agents from a library of zzso zzso under zzso zzso the brine shrimp zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso relationship zzso studies were followed by the zzso evaluation of most potent zzso 

The objective of the current study was to effectively use the zzso zzso for the identification of potential zzso zzso from a set of zzso 

We applied the comparative molecular field analysis zzso and devised zzso on 33 zzso zzso leading to prediction of five related compounds with improved zzso The scope of zzso zzso for the prediction of zzso potency was tested through the in zzso zzso studies against six human tumor zzso zzso studies and the zzso zzso 

The newly designed compounds zzso displayed very promising zzso zzso From our results, the zzso zzso zzso efficacy and zzso outcomes could be easily zzso 

The study draws a very good relationship between a simple, zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the zzso potential of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso analysis helped in designing zzso with improved zzso potential as displayed through their zzso and zzso activity against human tumor cell zzso The studies are noteworthy as such comprehensive studies were never performed before on the zzso zzso The present studies widen the scope of the zzso model that may prove quite helpful as a preliminary screen in the zzso drug designing and synthesis zzso
