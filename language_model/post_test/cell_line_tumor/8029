We have previously described zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in horses and dogs that result in deficits in zzso zzso DNA repair, and zzso In this paper, we document substantial zzso growth defects in zzso dogs that are not apparent in zzso zzso zzso cell strains derived from either fetal or adult zzso dogs zzso poorly in culture and undergo premature zzso zzso somewhat reminiscent of cells derived from zzso zzso A limited number of animals have been immune zzso (by bone zzso zzso so that they can be maintained in a normal environment for long zzso Several of these animals have developed conditions associated with premature zzso at 2-3 years of age, roughly zzso of their expected zzso These conditions include zzso zzso and primary neural cell zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso is not tolerated equally in all species, perhaps providing insight into why zzso zzso has not been observed in zzso Finally, this study demonstrates the feasibility of maintaining zzso dogs for extended periods of time and documents their utility for bone zzso transplantation studies and as hosts for the propagation of zzso In sum, zzso dogs may present researchers with new possibilities for the development of animal models of human zzso
