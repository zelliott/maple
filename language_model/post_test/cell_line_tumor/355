A variety of zzso strategies have proven effective in zzso tumor models, either as single agents or in combination with zzso Clinical gains have been relatively modest, however, and questions remain regarding optimal zzso The objectives of the current work were to evaluate whether the sequencing of acute treatment critically affects tumor zzso and therapeutic zzso zzso zzso Global Research & zzso an inhibitor that predominantly targets vascular zzso growth factor zzso was administered either before or after each daily radiation fraction in two human prostate zzso tumor zzso zzso were frozen at sequential times to monitor changes in zzso vascular zzso zzso zzso and basement membrane coverage, and zzso zzso Although similar reductions in blood vessel counts were observed with each tumor model, tumor zzso was not functionally zzso Instead, tumor zzso increased, accompanied by a progressive zzso of zzso and basement zzso Ultimately, tumor growth zzso was found to be equivalent for each of the combination zzso These studies illustrate a clear advantage to combining zzso with zzso therapy but argue against an acute zzso or zzso of either the tumor cells or tumor zzso Instead, zzso and zzso daily drug administration serve equally well in supplementing the response to zzso
