Exposure to solar zzso radiation is involved in the development of zzso zzso We previously showed that human zzso and melanoma cells respond to zzso radiation via a zzso zzso involving zzso zzso Here, we determined that zzso of zzso is necessary for zzso arrest and that zzso and its partner zzso zzso in nuclear bodies called Nuclear zzso We further observed that zzso zzso arrest is associated with zzso zzso in these Nuclear zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso interference prevents both zzso zzso zzso in Nuclear zzso and zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso arrest of melanoma cells is zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso zzso by zzso occurs in Nuclear zzso suggesting a new role for these nuclear bodies, so far only linked to zzso zzso
