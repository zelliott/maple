zzso elements are functional motifs in the zzso region of zzso and are binding sites for the zzso binding protein zzso an zzso stabilizer and translation zzso implicated in zzso It is not clear whether, and, if so, how the zzso elements function in cells when they are separated from their zzso and form an independent zzso zzso Here, we show that a short zzso with zzso elements derived from zzso zzso suppressed growth in a human liver cancer cell zzso It specifically bound zzso and it zzso with zzso zzso in order to bind to zzso Our results provide evidence that the cancer cell growth suppression by this zzso zzso containing zzso elements may be due to competitive binding to zzso This work may open new options for the development of novel zzso zzso
