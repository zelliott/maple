Alexander disease is a primary genetic disorder of zzso caused by dominant zzso in the zzso intermediate filament zzso zzso zzso protein zzso While most of the zzso zzso described to date have been found in the zzso zzso rod domain, some zzso are found in the zzso zzso tail zzso Here, we compare five different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso located in the zzso domain of zzso on filament assembly properties in zzso and in zzso zzso cultured zzso All the zzso disrupted in zzso filament zzso The zzso also affected the zzso and promoted filament zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This correlated with the zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso and an increased association with the small heat shock protein zzso zzso zzso Of the zzso zzso zzso zzso caused the most significant effects both upon filament assembly in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso This zzso also caused extensive filament zzso coinciding with the zzso of zzso and zzso as well as zzso of the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Associated with these changes were an zzso of zzso 3 and a significant decrease in zzso zzso We conclude that some zzso in the zzso of zzso correlate with zzso 3 zzso and the loss of cell zzso suggesting that these could be zzso factors in the development of Alexander zzso
