To more clearly understand the molecular mechanisms involved in synergistic enhancement of cancer preventive activity with the green tea zzso zzso zzso zzso we examined the effects of zzso with zzso plus zzso a zzso selective zzso We specifically looked for induction of zzso and expression of zzso related zzso with emphasis on growth arrest and DNA zzso 153 zzso zzso in human lung cancer cell line zzso zzso with zzso plus zzso strongly induced the expression of both zzso zzso level and protein in zzso cells, while neither zzso nor zzso alone zzso However, zzso did not induce expression of other zzso related zzso zzso and zzso Judging by zzso of zzso only zzso with zzso plus zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso zzso zzso effects with the combination were also observed in 2 other lung cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso did not enhance zzso gene expression or zzso induction in zzso cells in combination with zzso or with zzso Thus, zzso of zzso is closely correlated with synergistic enhancement of zzso with zzso zzso also activated the zzso protein zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso of zzso and synergistic induction of zzso of zzso cells, while zzso zzso zzso zzso did not do so, indicating that zzso expression was zzso through the zzso signaling zzso These findings indicate that high zzso of zzso is a key requirement for cancer prevention in combination with zzso
