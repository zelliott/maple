Among zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has during the last decade become an attractive carrier for small interference zzso zzso zzso Currently, degradation of zzso in the zzso is assumed to be a major barrier for effective zzso zzso zzso zzso protocols are focused toward zzso release zzso In this work, we have tested 3 novel zzso zzso and their zzso delivery properties in zzso To obtain efficient gene zzso of our model zzso zzso various zzso parameters were investigated, such as zzso zzso ratio, zzso zzso zzso media for complex formation, and cell zzso Our results showed that 2 linear zzso zzso demonstrated excellent zzso gene zzso better than zzso zzso The zzso effect was achieved without zzso treatment, under zzso zzso and with no zzso reduction in cell zzso
