zzso zzso databases for new members of the human small heat shock protein family, we recently identified zzso which is expressed exclusively in zzso as determined by Northern zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we confirm this zzso expression pattern by zzso in a larger series of normal zzso Interestingly, while screening zzso zzso we also noted expression in zzso which could be verified by zzso zzso expression of zzso was also detected in normal human zzso and various zzso samples using zzso zzso We thus conclude that zzso belongs to the steadily growing number of zzso zzso To get a better understanding of the function of zzso we performed a zzso zzso screen to search for zzso zzso zzso a light chain component of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in both the zzso zzso system and in zzso experiments with zzso Additionally, zzso zzso showed zzso of zzso and zzso in similar stages of zzso and in zzso zzso The possible functional significance of this interaction is zzso
