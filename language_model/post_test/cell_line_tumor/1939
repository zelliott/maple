zzso zzso zzso are a class of zzso solid zzso that can deliver zzso cells or molecular therapies to a target site via syringe or zzso injection as a carrier zzso These physical zzso can zzso and consequently flow as a zzso material under a sufficient zzso stress but immediately recover back into a solid upon removal of the stress, allowing them to be injected as zzso gel zzso zzso behavior during flow was studied in a zzso zzso geometry that zzso the actual situation of injection through a syringe needle in order to zzso effects of zzso injection delivery on zzso flow behavior and zzso cell zzso It was observed that all zzso zzso zzso investigated displayed a promising flow profile for zzso cell zzso a central wide plug flow region where gel material and cell zzso experienced little or no zzso rate, and a narrow zzso zone close to the zzso wall where gel and cells were subject to zzso zzso The zzso of the plug flow region was found to be zzso dependent on zzso rigidity and flow zzso zzso zzso were performed on zzso zzso cells 3 h after injection flow and revealed that zzso delivery through the zzso had little impact on cell viability and the spatial distribution of zzso cell zzso These observations help us to fundamentally understand how the gels flow during injection through a thin zzso and how they immediately restore mechanically and zzso relative to zzso zzso zzso
