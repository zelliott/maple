zzso zzso a yellow natural zzso extracted from turmeric zzso zzso has potent zzso properties as has been demonstrated in various human cancer zzso However, the widespread clinical application of this efficient agent in cancer and other diseases has been limited by its poor zzso zzso and zzso In this study, we prepared novel zzso human serum zzso zzso zzso zzso for intravenous administration using zzso bound zzso Field zzso scanning electron zzso zzso and dynamic light scattering zzso investigation confirmed a narrow size distribution in the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso showed much greater water zzso zzso than free zzso and on storage, the biological activity of zzso was preserved with negligible activity zzso In zzso zzso and vascular zzso cells transport studies demonstrated the superiority of zzso over zzso zzso of zzso in tumors after treatment with zzso were about 14 times higher at zzso after injection than that achieved by zzso Furthermore, vascular zzso cell binding of zzso increased zzso and transport of zzso across a vascular zzso cell zzso by zzso testing was zzso greater for zzso than zzso Finally, in zzso zzso tests revealed that zzso (10 or zzso had a greater therapeutic effect zzso or zzso tumor growth zzso zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in tumor zzso zzso models without inducing zzso We attribute this potent zzso activity of zzso to enhanced water zzso increased zzso in tumors, and an ability to traverse vascular zzso zzso
