zzso cancer is characterized by a poor prognosis and an unsatisfactory response to conventional zzso zzso experimental animal models that mimic the disease are essential to establish new zzso The aim of this study was to compare zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso tissue zzso zzso methods in the zzso zzso Syrian golden zzso pancreatic cancer zzso 

zzso tumors were induced in 32 Syrian zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 4) were killed at 1, 2, 5, and 8 weeks zzso zzso zzso and growth and the rates of local invasion and zzso were compared at zzso 

zzso zzso was zzso by zzso and zzso by zzso zzso pancreatic tumors were significantly larger in the zzso group zzso weight, zzso g zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso of local invasion and rates of zzso zzso liver, and zzso zzso were all significantly higher in the zzso zzso 

The zzso method is more effective than zzso in terms of tumor zzso zzso growth and the rates of local invasion and spontaneous zzso are higher with zzso than zzso The zzso method is better than zzso and can contribute to the development of therapeutic strategies in pancreatic cancer zzso
