zzso of the zzso gene is the most common genetic zzso in human zzso Our study proposes to rationally design a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which contains a series of zzso containing single zzso differences to discriminate between each zzso and wild type zzso zzso The zzso software was used to predict zzso and we designed an initial series of zzso zzso zzso that target the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso strongly inhibited the expression of zzso zzso in a panel of human tumor cell lines zzso zzso and zzso while having little effect on the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso In three cancer lines harboring each of the zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment led to a zzso zzso of cell growth, cell zzso colony formation and invasion, and expression of zzso zzso survival zzso Our preliminary results indicate that a single zzso difference in zzso can discriminate between zzso and zzso zzso These observations support the hypothesis that a zzso zzso zzso can be a potentially valuable tool to knock down zzso zzso zzso and warrant the testing of a zzso zzso zzso in in zzso zzso
