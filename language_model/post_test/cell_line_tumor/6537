To investigate the expression of zzso in various zzso zzso and to demonstrate different zzso patterns of zzso expression in distinct pathological entities of the zzso The zzso zzso 1 zzso gene product is a zzso protein with ubiquitous expression in normal adult zzso 

zzso of zzso was detected in prostate cancer cell lines and zzso by reverse zzso chain zzso zzso zzso for zzso was performed on 73 cases of zzso zzso zzso zzso was negative or zzso positive only in the nucleus zzso N) of zzso zzso zzso in nine normal and zzso prostate zzso whilst most zzso tissue showed intense, uniform zzso for zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Of the prostate cancer zzso zzso showed positive pattern C zzso Of the cases with high-grade zzso zzso zzso zzso around cancer, zzso showed pattern zzso However, in specimens from the patients without prostate cancer zzso displayed pattern C in only zzso of zzso Western zzso analysis showed that all cancer cell lines expressed zzso in the zzso but there was little nuclear zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso is a novel zzso characteristic in zzso zzso and high-grade zzso suggesting that zzso might be a novel marker for zzso zzso
