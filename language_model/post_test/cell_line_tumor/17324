zzso mouse leukemia cells differentiate to zzso by the stimulation of zzso zzso zzso factor zzso To identify new zzso zzso we have performed zzso difference analysis using zzso cells and cloned mouse zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso The zzso expression of both zzso zzso zzso alpha and beta zzso is zzso after 1 h stimulation of zzso and remains to be elevated along the differentiation of zzso zzso This induction is almost completely suppressed in zzso cells expressing a dominant negative form of zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso zzso zzso increases in zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may play a role in the differentiation of zzso cells by regulating zzso zzso
