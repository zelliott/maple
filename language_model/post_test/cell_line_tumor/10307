zzso resistance zzso driven by active zzso of drugs from the cells is one of the major obstacles in zzso zzso the nature of zzso and designing more efficient zzso requires the comparison of the zzso rate between different zzso of zzso Here we propose a zzso approach for such a zzso In essence, the entire cell population is loaded with a suitable fluorescent zzso for zzso membrane zzso The zzso of zzso zzso from individual cells is followed by zzso zzso zzso and analyzed at the zzso zzso zzso is also used to assign cells to different zzso based on differences in zzso or level of zzso by molecular zzso The kinetic parameters obtained for individual cells are then averaged for different cell zzso and the mean values of these parameters are finally compared between zzso To test our zzso approach, we studied zzso zzso for two zzso of cultured breast cancer zzso cells in zzso and zzso zzso of the cell zzso The assignment of cells to zzso and zzso zzso was done by fluorescent DNA zzso after the completion of zzso By using the zzso approach, we were able to prove for the first time that the rates of zzso zzso differ in zzso and zzso zzso of the cell zzso We zzso that this approach will be an important tool in studies of zzso and in designing combination zzso
