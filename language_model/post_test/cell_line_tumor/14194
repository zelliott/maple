zzso a zzso zzso zzso expressed in the brain, binds both zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso envelope zzso zzso There seem to be zzso differences between the zzso zzso induced by zzso and that induced by zzso but the zzso pathways involved have not been compared in human zzso zzso In this study, we characterized the zzso zzso pathways activated by zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in human zzso cells zzso zzso (10 zzso and zzso (2 zzso induced similar levels of zzso after 24 h of incubation zzso zzso zzso and 48 zzso zzso respectively, of the zzso were zzso zzso zzso was completely abolished by the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso Exposure to zzso (10 zzso triggered an increase in zzso zzso with a maximum after 20 zzso of incubation zzso zzso zzso times higher than control, P zzso zzso zzso calcium flux was enhanced only if cells were incubated with zzso for 20 zzso before applying zzso By contrast, zzso zzso was not affected by the zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso enhanced zzso calcium flux immediately, without zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, levels of zzso increased following exposure to zzso (by a factor of zzso zzso zzso at 120 zzso P zzso zzso but not after exposure to zzso Thus, zzso and zzso induced a similar level of zzso zzso but by zzso different zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso activity indirectly via zzso zzso whereas zzso probably activated the zzso zzso directly and zzso zzso
