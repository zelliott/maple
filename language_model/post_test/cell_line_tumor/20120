A simple and zzso zzso DNA zzso based on the detection of the product of a zzso chain reaction zzso and the use of gold zzso zzso as signal generators has been zzso During zzso the zzso were zzso together, resulting in a distinct color change in real time after a sufficient number of zzso zzso The cumulative nature of the protocol produced a detection limit of 20 zzso with a selectivity factor of zzso
