To construct an zzso zzso zzso containing zzso tuberculosis heat shock protein 70 zzso and enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso controlled by zzso promoter using zzso zzso 

The zzso gene zzso was amplified by zzso from zzso using specific zzso The zzso product was cloned into the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the correct clone was selected according to DNA sequence zzso The interested zzso gene zzso was zzso into zzso zzso with zzso and zzso I zzso The zzso zzso was zzso into mouse melanoma zzso cell line, and the green fluorescent cells were detected by zzso zzso and zzso expression was detected by Western zzso 

The zzso zzso obtained was confirmed by zzso zzso The zzso mouse melanoma zzso cells exhibited green zzso under zzso zzso and expressed zzso protein as demonstrated by Western zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso has been established to allow further investigation of the role of zzso gene in tumor zzso
