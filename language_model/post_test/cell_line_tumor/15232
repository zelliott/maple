zzso zzso has been widely used to study its possible clinical application in cancer zzso However, in order to make it into clinical practice, it is important that this technique is able not only to identify cancer cells from their normal counterparts, but also from the array of cells present in human zzso To this purpose, we used zzso zzso to assess whether this technique was able to differentiate not only between lung cancer cells and lung zzso cells but also from lung zzso Furthermore, we studied whether the differences were due to cell lineage zzso versus zzso or to different zzso characteristics of cells, and where in the cell compartment these differences might zzso To answer these questions we studied cell zzso cell nucleus and isolated whole cell zzso Our data suggests that zzso zzso can differentiate between lung cancer, lung zzso cells and lung zzso More important, it can also differentiate between 2 cells from the same lineage zzso but with one of them rendered zzso and with an increased zzso zzso Finally, it seems that the main spectral differences reside in the cell nucleus and that the study of isolated zzso strengthens the differences between zzso
