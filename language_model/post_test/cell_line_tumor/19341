To characterize zzso in neural tumors, we analyzed the zzso zzso zzso of 13 neural tumor cell lines using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are cell surface molecules that are endowed with the Human Natural zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso were expressed in all cell lines with zzso ranging from 210 to 330 zzso per 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was the prominent species with lesser amounts of zzso zzso zzso zzso in these tumor cell lines as assessed by quantitative zzso zzso Among the zzso surveyed, zzso and zzso zzso zzso were expressed in all tumor cell zzso In contrast, zzso was not found to restrict to small cell lung zzso zzso In addition, we have analyzed serum zzso zzso against zzso zzso and zzso in patients with neural tumors by zzso and zzso zzso All zzso had high zzso of zzso of the zzso zzso against zzso zzso over zzso especially in tumors such as zzso zzso zzso tumors, zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a patient with zzso also had a high zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso types zzso over zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was also elevated in patients with zzso and zzso the latter cases also had a high zzso of zzso against zzso Our data indicate that certain zzso zzso especially zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in neural tumor cells and may be considered as zzso zzso that represent important zzso for neural zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso in zzso of patients with these tumors may be of diagnostic value for monitoring the presence of tumor cells and tumor zzso
