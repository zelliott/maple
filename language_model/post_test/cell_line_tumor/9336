zzso therapy is limited in application in clinical therapy because of two existing problems: rapid degradation of zzso zzso acids and poor diffusion across the cell zzso Here we report the use of zzso carbon zzso as delivery system for transporting zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso carbon zzso were zzso characterized by atomic force zzso zzso fluorescent zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso cells at 37 degrees C, the zzso carbon zzso zzso inside zzso cells were measured zzso by zzso zzso of zzso gene and protein were analyzed by reverse zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso dropped character zzso at quadruple zzso zzso compared with zzso and could enter into zzso cells within 15 zzso after zzso whose zzso amounts by zzso cells increased as the incubation time zzso After 48 hours, the amount of zzso in zzso cells began to zzso Compared with zzso and zzso zzso zzso exhibited the strongest zzso on the proliferation of zzso cells, induced cell zzso and zzso lowest expression of zzso gene and zzso zzso The zzso can directly deliver zzso into zzso cells, enhance the zzso of zzso on zzso cells, and is likely a better delivery system for zzso zzso zzso modified zzso can be used for zzso gene regulation with potential applications in tumor therapy and drug zzso
