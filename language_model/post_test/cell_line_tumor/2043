zzso zzso therapy zzso at low zzso conditions has shown to selectively enhance the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso localized zzso tumors grown on zzso lungs without causing zzso zzso of the zzso The present experiments explore the impact of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso to different tumor types grown on zzso zzso 

Three groups of Fischer rats underwent zzso generation of zzso zzso or zzso tumors on the left zzso At least five animals of each group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso underwent zzso zzso zzso at zzso ) zzso with zzso zzso of the tumor and the lower zzso This was followed by intravenous zzso administration of zzso zzso After a circulation time of zzso the zzso lung was processed for zzso zzso At least five animals per group underwent the same procedure but without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Five zzso animals per group underwent zzso zzso of their tumors with zzso assessment of the tumor zzso 

zzso zzso significantly enhanced zzso zzso to all tumor types zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not to normal lung tissue compared to IV drug administration zzso zzso led to a significantly increased ratio of tumor to lung tissue drug zzso for all three tumor types zzso zzso However, the tumor drug zzso varied between tumor types and paralleled tumor vascular zzso The vascular density was significantly higher in zzso than in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso whereas there was no significant difference between zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso zzso selectively enhances the zzso of zzso administered zzso zzso in tumors without affecting the drug zzso to normal zzso However, drug zzso varied significantly between tumor types and paralleled tumor vascular zzso
