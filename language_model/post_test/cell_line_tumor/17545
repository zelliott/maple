zzso a member of the zzso family, zzso zzso by blocking zzso and zzso zzso zzso cancer, which is among the most intractable of zzso tumors, is known for resistance to various drugs, including zzso zzso Since this agent zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso may mediate the drug zzso We investigated zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in gastric zzso and the relationship between expression and sensitivity to zzso zzso of the zzso gene was significantly zzso in gastric zzso compared to the zzso of normal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as assessed by a quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and was zzso associated with overall survival of patients who received zzso zzso To investigate whether zzso is a resistance factor against zzso zzso we zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso gene into gastric cancer cells using a zzso zzso zzso of zzso protected zzso cells from zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso zzso cells to drug-induced zzso These results indicate that zzso may be pivotal in the development of gastric cancer and resistance to zzso and therefore controlling expression of the zzso gene may be zzso zzso
