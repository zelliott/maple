We have analyzed in molecular detail how zzso a zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso suppresses nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and cancer cell zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso acts as an zzso and zzso growth factor, which promotes zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and changes zzso to hormones and to zzso Our results in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso knockout cells, and zzso zzso zzso breast tumor cells show that zzso can inhibit tumor cell proliferation and selectively block nuclear zzso zzso of specific target genes such as zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso This occurs via zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso pathways and zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso As zzso zzso and zzso activity are important hallmarks of human zzso including zzso zzso and solid tumors, zzso zzso represent an attractive class of natural zzso of the zzso signaling zzso for cancer zzso
