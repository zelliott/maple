The zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso a member of the basic zzso zzso gene family, binds a variety of zzso aromatic zzso and mediates their toxic zzso zzso has been shown to act as a zzso in nuclear zzso gene zzso In this report, we demonstrate that zzso interacts with zzso through its zzso zzso zzso of zzso greatly enhanced zzso reporter gene activity in a zzso manner in transient zzso zzso Upon zzso treatment, zzso zzso was recruited to the zzso response element of the mouse zzso zzso an zzso zzso Reduction of the zzso zzso level by small interfering zzso inhibited zzso zzso by zzso These findings reveal a new function of zzso in zzso gene zzso
