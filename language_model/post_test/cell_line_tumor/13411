Recently, zzso cell lines zzso have emerged as an innovative model system for mapping gene zzso that predict the dose response to chemotherapy zzso 

In the current study, this strategy was expanded to the zzso zzso association approach, using 516 zzso derived from a White cohort to assess the zzso response to zzso 

zzso association analysis using zzso million zzso zzso zzso zzso identified a statistically significant association ( zzso with zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso We also show that the primary zzso in this region is significantly associated with the differential gene expression of zzso ( zzso in zzso and differential zzso in zzso samples from The Cancer Genome zzso 

The previously documented clinical and functional relationships between zzso and zzso response highlight the potential of zzso zzso association studies of the zzso model system to identify meaningful genetic zzso
