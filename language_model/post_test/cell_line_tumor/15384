zzso zzso of the zzso gene occur frequently in breast cancer, and zzso that are specific for zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso are being investigated in clinical zzso In a search for zzso of sensitivity to zzso zzso among zzso breast cancer cell lines, we observed that sensitivity to zzso (as assessed by cell zzso was associated with full zzso of signaling through the zzso zzso zzso cancer cells that were resistant to zzso had persistently active zzso zzso although zzso zzso was zzso Similarly, in patients, zzso zzso zzso expression (a marker of zzso zzso was associated with tumor response to zzso and zzso was found to be zzso in tumors from patients whose disease progressed after zzso In zzso cancer cell lines with persistent zzso signaling despite zzso zzso blockade zzso is, zzso the addition of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso to the cells along with zzso resulted in reversal of resistance in zzso and in zzso Finally, we found that growth factors such as zzso growth factor 1 and zzso 1 can activate zzso target of zzso zzso and mediate resistance to zzso Our findings suggest that simultaneous administration of zzso zzso may enhance the clinical activity of zzso drugs and delay the appearance of zzso
