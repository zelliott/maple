zzso zzso are zzso through the zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a variety of cells in response to various zzso zzso All cells require at least one zzso for zzso and zzso play a central role in regulation of zzso In a previous study, incubation of zzso cells with zzso (a zzso zzso induced zzso and inhibited cell zzso and the zzso of different zzso between various cellular compartments were found to be zzso To determine whether PG receptors are involved in this regulation, zzso analyses were performed specific for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which were expressed in zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso that were isolated from zzso cells expressed zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso receptors were zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso and zzso receptors were detected from zzso cell zzso These results suggest that the change of PG production in zzso cancer cell zzso might be related to the different expressions of zzso and zzso receptors in cell and zzso zzso
