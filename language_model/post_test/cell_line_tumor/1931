zzso which boost the immune system of zzso have been used as zzso to promote zzso production against zzso and zzso as zzso during therapy for zzso zzso and as a component in therapeutic vaccines for zzso These biomedical applications have led to growing interest in obtaining zzso with high zzso Here, we study the zzso properties of a modified oxidized zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained by the zzso of its carbohydrates using sodium zzso We assessed the zzso of zzso into zzso and its zzso and zzso zzso zzso electron zzso showed no changes in zzso zzso structure with respect to native zzso although zzso treatment followed by zzso analysis demonstrated that Schiff bases were zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso faster than zzso mainly through zzso During this process, zzso remained inside zzso structures for a longer zzso Mouse zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso is more zzso and a better carrier than zzso Moreover, zzso showed a significant zzso effect in the zzso melanoma model similar to that produced by zzso inducing zzso zzso Together, these data demonstrate that the zzso formed by the zzso zzso of sugar zzso zzso the zzso structure, increasing its zzso carrier zzso
