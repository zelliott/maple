zzso zzso 1 zzso plays an important role in the zzso zzso zzso or unfolded zzso stress response by zzso its downstream zzso factor zzso protein 1 zzso We demonstrated previously that zzso 71 zzso zzso zzso zzso levels but did not activate spliced zzso zzso zzso or its downstream target zzso zzso and zzso In this study, we investigated further this regulatory mechanism and found that zzso was zzso and activated after zzso infection, whereas its downstream zzso protein level zzso We also found that zzso was not zzso directly by zzso but that zzso of zzso translation initiation factor zzso by the zzso zzso protein may contribute to the decrease in zzso zzso zzso of zzso increased viral protein zzso and the synthesis of zzso viral protein and the production of zzso viral particles were inhibited in zzso zzso zzso When incubated with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells exhibited reduced viral zzso levels, suggesting that the zzso of zzso by viral infection may zzso viral entry, which is required for viral zzso Our findings are the first indication of the ability of zzso to inhibit viral entry, possibly via its zzso activity in regulating molecules in the zzso zzso
