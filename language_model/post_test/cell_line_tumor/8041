As methods of cancer diagnosis and treatment improve, interest in zzso brain tumors continues to zzso In the present study, we attempted to characterize genetically the dynamic changes occurring during brain zzso formation by DNA zzso and attempted to compare these findings with zzso zzso Lewis lung zzso cells were injected into zzso mice carotid zzso The mice were sacrificed at days zzso after zzso We performed zzso observation and zzso expression profiling using a DNA zzso In zzso zzso tumor cells were observed in zzso vessels at day 1 after zzso At day 3, the tumor cells had begun to zzso At day 6, the zzso zzso showed zzso zzso Next, we performed a zzso comparison of gene expression zzso data from day 1 to day 9 after zzso The first major change occurred between Phase Two and Phase zzso When zzso zzso was performed between different samples using the zzso zzso they could be classified into identical clusters for days 1 and 2, identical clusters for day 3 to day 5, and identical clusters for day 6 to day zzso For time course analysis, we extracted zzso genes by the zzso zzso By using the quality threshold zzso zzso zzso method, we identified 37 expression zzso These patterns can be separated into eight clusters by using the zzso zzso The zzso results reported here strongly suggest that a large number of genes exhibit a spike pattern, which is tantamount to zzso zzso
