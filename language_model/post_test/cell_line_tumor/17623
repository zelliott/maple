The clinical efficacy of zzso oxide zzso has been shown in patients with relapsed acute zzso leukemia zzso To identify potential common primary targets of action of zzso in zzso and zzso cell lines, we analyzed zzso effects on zzso and on the zzso membrane potential zzso under uniform zzso zzso induced breakdown of zzso and activated zzso in cell lines with different sensitivities for zzso including cell lines resistant to zzso or zzso but sensitive to zzso zzso zzso could not prevent breakdown of zzso in zzso cell lines, whereas zzso of zzso and zzso could be zzso zzso of zzso seems to be a downstream effect occurring after breakdown of zzso We could show that all of these effects are independent of zzso zzso There was no difference in the mode of action of zzso in cell lines sensitive or resistant to zzso zzso or zzso zzso deserves further evaluation as an adjunct or alternative to other zzso zzso
