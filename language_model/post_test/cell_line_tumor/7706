To investigate the mechanism underlying the zzso effect of zzso species through the zzso of cell growth and induction of zzso in breast zzso zzso 

To evaluate the zzso activity of methanol extracts of eight zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Montana, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso we first investigated the proliferation of zzso zzso zzso zzso breast zzso cells exposed to 5 or 200 zzso for 72 zzso zzso induction was assessed by an zzso V binding zzso in cells exposed to extracts at a high concentration zzso zzso To verify the mechanism of zzso zzso expression and its related signaling was investigated using an zzso zzso under the same zzso 

zzso cells showed the strongest zzso response to the tested zzso However, a zzso effect was zzso the extracts inhibited proliferation at high zzso whereas they zzso it at low zzso zzso expression was similarly modulated by the zzso However, all of the extracts induced zzso at a high concentration zzso zzso Compared to the control level, exposure to the extracts resulted in a remarkable increase in the shift of cell zzso 

The present study suggests that the tested zzso species exerted their zzso effects through the induction of zzso via an zzso zzso
