The zzso are the zzso subset of a group of diseases in which in zzso protein zzso leads to a zzso gain of function, zzso zzso leading to protein deposition, with subsequent tissue zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are the zzso agents in zzso systemic zzso We describe a zzso zzso that measures the zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using cells of the same lineage as the in zzso tissue target of zzso zzso We have zzso the zzso to screen small molecules for their capacity to inhibit the zzso cell zzso We compared the zzso activity of each compound with its ability to prevent zzso zzso formation in zzso Our results emphasize the importance of screening compounds under zzso zzso Moreover, if a common zzso intermediate is responsible for cell death in all the zzso diseases, the zzso zzso has the potential to aid in the discovery of compounds useful in the treatment of zzso caused by other zzso proteins as well as those caused by zzso
