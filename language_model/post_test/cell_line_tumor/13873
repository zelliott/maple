zzso zzso is a human pathogen that causes multiple diseases zzso Despite appropriate therapy with existing zzso zzso chronic exacerbated diseases often occur and lead to serious zzso Since zzso zzso has been found to enter a persistent state after exposure to deleterious conditions, the role of persistence in the failure of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells were infected with zzso zzso zzso zzso infectious zzso Three days later the infected cells were treated with minimal zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso for 24 days or 30 zzso zzso efficacy was assessed by measuring zzso inclusions and infectious zzso by investigating the resumption of zzso growth after zzso removal and by testing zzso viability using reverse zzso zzso chain reaction targeting zzso zzso zzso processed zzso zzso and zzso zzso Treatment of infected zzso cells with the usual zzso antibiotics suppressed zzso active zzso The infection remained zzso However, 24 days post treatment the zzso was found to be viable, as proved by continued expression of zzso and processed zzso zzso and zzso zzso This inactive zzso zzso state is not zzso suggesting zzso zzso zzso zzso also developed persistence both in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Unlike in zzso cells, persistent zzso infection in zzso and zzso cells was resolved after 30 days of zzso zzso Of interest, we noticed that only zzso and zzso cells that were persistently infected following their interaction with infected zzso cells remained capable of zzso active infection to zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso and zzso usually administered to combat zzso diseases, fail to resolve persistent infection occurring during treatment in zzso zzso zzso However, in immune zzso and zzso cells, the persistent infection is resolved by therapy with zzso zzso cells could be the zzso of persistent zzso zzso
