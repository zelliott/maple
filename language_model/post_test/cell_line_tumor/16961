We evaluated a new therapeutic strategy for zzso zzso which combines zzso zzso of zzso stem cells zzso expressing zzso zzso gene with zzso zzso zzso For in zzso and in zzso experiments, zzso were zzso with zzso carrying either enhanced green fluorescent protein gene zzso or zzso zzso gene zzso to establish zzso zzso zzso or CD zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells with zzso in a medium containing zzso resulted in a remarkable reduction in zzso cell zzso The migratory ability of zzso toward zzso cells was demonstrated by zzso zzso For the in zzso study, rats harboring zzso brain tumors were zzso with zzso or zzso zzso of rat brain tumors zzso with zzso showed zzso distribution of zzso Survival analysis of rats bearing zzso zzso treated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso resulted in significant zzso of survival compared with control zzso In conclusion, molecular therapy combining suicide gene therapy and zzso as a targeting vehicle represents a potential new therapeutic approach for zzso zzso both with respect to the zzso potential of this system and its zzso effect on normal brain zzso
