zzso tumors are aggressive and incurable pediatric zzso zzso a tumor zzso zzso zzso in zzso tumors, directly zzso zzso zzso zzso tumors and cells are exquisitely dependent on zzso D1 for genesis and survival, suggesting that targeting the zzso zzso zzso axis may be an effective therapeutic strategy for these zzso Because zzso zzso have not been used for zzso or clinical testing on zzso tumors, we investigated the effect of zzso a zzso inhibitor with promising clinical activity, on zzso zzso 

The effect of zzso on zzso cells was tested in zzso using survival, cell cycle, and zzso zzso Its effect was assessed in zzso using zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso and zzso analysis was used to assess the effect of zzso on zzso D1 and zzso expression in zzso and in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso cell growth zzso approximately 200 zzso induced zzso and zzso arrest, and zzso in zzso in a zzso zzso These effects were correlated with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso (at zzso zzso significantly inhibited the growth of zzso zzso tumors, and its effect was correlated with the induction of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso is effective in inducing cell cycle arrest and zzso in zzso zzso Its effects are correlated with the zzso of zzso D1 and the zzso of zzso zzso is potentially a novel zzso agent for zzso zzso
