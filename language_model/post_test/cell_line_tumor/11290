zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is characterized by zzso zzso of zzso resulting in zzso presence of zzso zzso zzso In primary zzso samples zzso is only expressed in a zzso of zzso cells in a pattern that is reminiscent of that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was carried out to determine the association between these two proteins in ten primary zzso cases and three available zzso cell line zzso Surprisingly, only a minute fraction of zzso zzso was observed, while each sample contained considerable zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso coexistence of zzso and zzso zzso suggests a negative interaction between these zzso In zzso screening of the zzso zzso promoters for DNA consensus binding sites identified five zzso in the zzso zzso We confirmed zzso binding to the zzso promoter in zzso and in zzso by band shift zzso super shift zzso and zzso zzso Using zzso zzso reporter zzso depletion of zzso by zzso and zzso zzso of a zzso active zzso zzso we proved that zzso is sufficient to zzso repress zzso Recently developed small zzso zzso zzso and zzso that increases zzso target gene expression and decreases zzso levels, respectively, demonstrate that a combined targeting results in additive efficacy regarding their negative effect on cell zzso The delineated zzso molecular repression mechanism links zzso to zzso in zzso and may carry therapeutic zzso
