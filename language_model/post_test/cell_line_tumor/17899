Most tumors grow in zzso hosts despite expressing zzso zzso zzso such as the zzso class I zzso genes A and B zzso However, their participation in tumor cell evasion is still not completely zzso Here we demonstrate that several human zzso zzso lines and freshly isolated zzso do not express zzso on the cell surface but have zzso deposits of this zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso correlated with the ratio of zzso to zzso class I molecules but not with the amounts of zzso on the cell surface of tumor zzso zzso zzso of zzso restored cell surface expression and resulted in an increased in zzso zzso and zzso zzso by human zzso zzso In zzso nude mice, these zzso exhibited a delayed growth and extensive in zzso zzso zzso of tumor growth was due to zzso zzso zzso activity against zzso tumors, given that this effect was not observed in zzso zzso zzso Also, mouse zzso cells killed zzso zzso in zzso A zzso analysis revealed the retention of zzso in the zzso zzso an effect that was associated with zzso of zzso zzso forms of zzso retrograde transport to the zzso and degradation by the zzso Our study identifies a novel strategy developed by melanoma cells to evade zzso zzso immune surveillance based on the zzso zzso of immature forms of zzso in the zzso zzso Furthermore, this tumor immune escape strategy can be overcome by gene therapy approaches aimed at zzso zzso on tumor zzso
