To circumvent the toxicity caused by systemic injection of zzso zzso zzso genes zzso the human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso were inserted into zzso zzso These zzso were used for zzso gene therapy of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Treatment with three doses of zzso or zzso zzso given a day apart, was more effective than zzso gene zzso We found that tumor zzso enhanced the therapeutic efficacy of zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso administered 1 day prior to three doses of zzso treatment, was more effective than radiation or zzso alone, resulting in tumor growth arrest in all mice, increased survival and a consistent increase in complete tumor zzso response zzso Complete zzso rejected zzso tumor challenge and demonstrated specific zzso zzso activity, indicative of specific tumor zzso The effect of radiation combined with three doses of zzso was less pronounced and did not lead to tumor zzso zzso observations showed that zzso of the tumor prior to gene therapy increased tumor destruction and inflammatory infiltrates in the tumor zzso These findings demonstrate that tumor zzso improves the efficacy of zzso gene therapy for induction of zzso immune zzso
