We describe here a new zzso zzso liquid zzso with mass zzso detection method for zzso intact zzso zzso in human zzso leukemia zzso zzso mass zzso was used to identify the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso For the protein zzso and sample preparation, a zzso acid extraction method is zzso zzso are then zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and injected into the zzso zzso zzso were zzso in negative selected zzso monitoring mode using a single zzso mass zzso The method was validated in terms of retention time zzso limits of zzso zzso recovery, and zzso zzso The developed method was linear in the range of zzso zzso for all studied zzso The limits of detection for the zzso vary from zzso to zzso zzso
