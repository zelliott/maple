Previous studies showed it was possible to employ zzso contrast agent for identification of the zzso zzso zzso zzso This study is to investigate the usefulness of zzso (a zzso contrast zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for detecting the zzso in a zzso breast cancer zzso 

zzso was performed in 12 female rabbits with breast zzso tumor after subcutaneous administration of zzso The site, number, and pattern of enhancement of the zzso were observed and zzso After zzso zzso zzso of blue dye was injected into the same location as zzso and the zzso were detected by surgical zzso The findings of zzso were compared with those of blue zzso 

Of the 12 tumors zzso a total of 17 enhanced zzso were detected by zzso Among them, a single zzso was detected in eight tumors, two zzso in three tumors, and three zzso in one zzso All the zzso showed partial enhancement on zzso zzso zzso were identified by blue dye with surgical zzso There were no zzso zzso findings in terms of zzso zzso The overall sensitivity of zzso for detecting zzso was zzso zzso Among the 17 zzso detected by zzso tumor zzso were identified zzso in 4 zzso whereas proliferation of zzso tissue was identified in the other 13 zzso 

zzso combined with zzso is useful for detecting zzso although it may not be helpful for detecting zzso in zzso
