zzso protein zzso zzso zzso in the circulation from zzso stores to peripheral zzso Since little is known regarding the regulation of this zzso we zzso the zzso sequences of the mouse zzso zzso Our data show that zzso of the gene is regulated through a zzso promoter: a zzso region necessary for zzso expression and a zzso segment responsible for zzso This latter region contains several binding sites for the structural zzso zzso which are important to promoter zzso We further demonstrate that zzso play a key role in zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso genes are zzso regulated in zzso and in zzso zzso acts to recruit zzso factors to the zzso promoter and we specifically identified zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso as components that interact with this zzso zzso factor 1 zzso or the related liver zzso zzso 1 zzso are also associated with this complex upon zzso zzso of zzso by zzso interference resulted in a dramatic loss of zzso zzso our results demonstrate that zzso and zzso zzso zzso is regulated by a zzso complex that is similar to ones that zzso expression of genes of steroid hormone zzso Since genes related to zzso metabolism are regulated in a similar fashion, this suggests that zzso expression may be regulated as part of a network of pathways relevant to the onset of type 2 zzso
