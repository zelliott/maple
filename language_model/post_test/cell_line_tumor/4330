The zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso in multiple myeloma zzso we therefore tested a highly selective class I zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies were first performed in zzso cell lines, then extended to primary zzso patient samples cultured in zzso zzso was then assessed as a single agent and in various combinations in myeloma tumor zzso zzso We show zzso zzso and zzso are the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and that a highly selective class I zzso zzso zzso has robust activity as a single agent to induce cell cycle arrest and zzso of both zzso cell lines and patient myeloma zzso zzso studies revealed an induction of cell cycle arrest at zzso with decreased zzso levels, decreased zzso D1 and zzso zzso and an increase in the cell cycle zzso zzso zzso of zzso correlated with increased expression of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso 3 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso index values of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso has zzso activity and significantly increases the activity of the standard of care agents in several zzso zzso tumor models zzso tumor growth zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso These data provide a clear therapeutic hypothesis for the zzso of zzso and provide a rationale for clinical development of zzso in zzso
