zzso protein is probably the best known tumor zzso Earlier reports proved that human breast cancer cells expressing zzso zzso displayed resistance to zzso This study is intended to zzso the potential applications of zzso interference zzso to block zzso zzso as well as its subsequent effect on cell growth, zzso and migration on a triple negative human breast cancer cell line zzso zzso significantly reduced cell index zzso compared to the control and we observed an zzso of cellular migration in the zzso of time between 0 and 30 zzso as shown in the data obtained by dynamic evaluation using the zzso zzso Also, by using zzso technology, a panel of 84 key genes involved in zzso was zzso Our studies indicate that the zzso of zzso expression by zzso zzso several genes involved in cell death pathways and zzso showing statistically significant gene expression differences for 22 zzso from which 18 were zzso and 4 were zzso The present research also emphasizes the important role of zzso zzso family of genes zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and reducing cell proliferation by zzso zzso Death receptors cooperate with zzso zzso genes in reducing cell zzso The limited success may be due to the zzso of the zzso gene zzso and it may be associated with the resistance of triple negative breast cancer cells to cancer zzso Thus, targeting zzso pathways using zzso may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of breast zzso
