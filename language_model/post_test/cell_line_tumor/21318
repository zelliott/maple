The human gene zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso of zzso that is associated with pancreatic tumor zzso In the normal zzso zzso is not zzso whereas zzso of its expression is observed in the early steps of pancreatic zzso The molecular mechanisms responsible for zzso gene zzso are however still zzso The zzso zzso region being zzso and including two zzso islands, we hypothesized that zzso regulation may be involved and undertook to decipher the molecular zzso zzso By treating cancer cell lines with zzso zzso and zzso A zzso we were able to restore zzso expression in a zzso zzso We showed by zzso zzso DNA sequencing and zzso zzso that zzso of five zzso sites and establishment of a repressive zzso code at the zzso region were associated with zzso zzso and impaired its zzso by zzso zzso involvement of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was demonstrated by zzso interference and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso zzso by zzso was associated with strong zzso repression in zzso zzso In conclusion, this work shows for the first time the importance of zzso in regulating zzso expression and may represent a new strategy to inhibit its expression in zzso zzso
