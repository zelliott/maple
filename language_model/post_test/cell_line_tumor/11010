To study the in zzso and in zzso zzso effects of zzso on invasive potential of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and to explore the underlying zzso 

zzso zzso zzso cells were exposed to zzso The invasive activity of tumor cells was zzso in zzso cell culture zzso zzso expression and cell cycle were evaluated by a functional zzso Cell zzso analysis was performed with zzso zzso In addition, bilateral zzso capsule zzso transplantation of zzso was performed in 10 nude zzso zzso was injected and the invasion of zzso into the zzso zzso was zzso zzso with zzso zzso were zzso 

zzso significantly inhibited the growth of zzso zzso cells, the zzso rate of tumor cells was zzso The invasive potential of zzso zzso cells in zzso was significantly zzso the zzso rate was zzso zzso caused zzso cell cycle arrest, S phase decreased zzso The occurrence of zzso in zzso group increased zzso The expression of zzso in 5 zzso zzso group zzso and 10 zzso zzso group zzso was significantly lower than that in the control group zzso zzso zzso growth in zzso nude mice was significantly retarded in comparison to control mice, the zzso rate of tumor growth was about zzso zzso also significantly inhibited the invasion of zzso zzso cells into the zzso zzso of nude mice with zzso zzso The positive unit value of zzso in zzso group zzso was significantly lower than that in control group zzso zzso 

zzso can effectively inhibit the invasive potential of zzso zzso zzso cells by altering cell cycle, zzso and zzso zzso of focal zzso zzso may play a significant role in this zzso
