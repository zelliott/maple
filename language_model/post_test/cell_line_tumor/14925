zzso zzso tumor models are now widely used in cancer biology zzso However, specific methods for efficient and reliable cell seeding into these and zzso zzso used for zzso medicine often remain poorly zzso Here, we describe a zzso zzso method for seeding the human prostate cancer cell lines zzso and zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso force seeding method improved the cell number and distribution within the porous scaffolds compared to well-established protocols such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso efficiency was found to be strongly dependent on the rounded cell diameter relative to the pore diameter and pore zzso size, parameters that can be zzso modulated during scaffold zzso Cell seeding efficiency was evaluated zzso using a zzso DNA zzso which demonstrated some variation in cell retention using the zzso force zzso When cultured within the porous zzso both cell lines attached and proliferated within the network, but zzso showed the formation of a zzso zone by 7 days likely due to oxygen and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zone thickness was decreased by zzso zzso cells in an zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that despite a variable seeding efficiency, by 7 days in culture, scaffolds contained a roughly consistent number of cells as they proliferated to fill the pores of the zzso These studies demonstrate that zzso zzso scaffolds have the potential to serve as an adaptable cell culture zzso for engineering a three-dimensional prostate cancer zzso
