The purpose of this study was to investigate the responses of the human zzso cell line zzso to calcium zzso zzso with different zzso zzso ratios and different surface zzso In particular, the study evaluated zzso zzso levels, zzso zzso zzso zzso levels and protein production at the cell attachment zzso The results indicated that the surface zzso zzso within a factor of 10) of the zzso did not play a prominent role in cell attachment and zzso but the effect of composition was zzso Increased zzso and total zzso levels and promoted cell attachment and cell cycle progression were observed upon an increase in cement zzso zzso zzso with a higher zzso content was beneficial for collagen Type I zzso I) zzso zzso I zzso and zzso zzso zzso whereas cement with a higher zzso content increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and enhanced zzso zzso zzso These results establish zzso differences in zzso binding as a mechanism regulating cellular responses to zzso zzso
