zzso of zzso zzso zzso DNA repair has been implicated in breast zzso and zzso Here, we investigated the zzso status of zzso zzso genes and analyzed their association with tumor zzso and responses to zzso zzso Core specimens were obtained before zzso chemotherapy from sixty cases of primary breast cancer of the following four zzso zzso breast cancer zzso with pathological complete response zzso zzso with stable disease, zzso breast cancer zzso with zzso and zzso with poor zzso The zzso DNA zzso status of the following zzso zzso was analyzed using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Among the genes zzso only the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso was significantly higher in zzso than that in zzso Whereas the zzso of zzso zzso was tended to be higher in zzso cases than in zzso cases in zzso that of zzso was significantly lower in zzso cases than in zzso zzso Our results indicate that the zzso status of zzso genes was not generally associated with zzso zzso or zzso although zzso of zzso is associated with zzso zzso and may impact zzso
