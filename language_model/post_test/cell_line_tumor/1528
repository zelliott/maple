To evaluate the effects of zzso zzso laser zzso of zzso zzso containing hollow gold zzso zzso and zzso zzso administered zzso in an animal zzso 

For the ex zzso experiments, zzso zzso rabbits underwent administration of zzso or zzso via the zzso artery zzso The animals were killed, the liver tumors were subjected to zzso zzso and temperature changes were estimated with magnetic resonance zzso zzso For the in zzso study, zzso zzso rabbits were randomly assigned to three groups: zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was delivered at 1 hour and at 3 days after administration of saline or zzso via the zzso Animals were zzso and tumors were analyzed for necrosis and zzso Plasma samples were collected from the zzso animals for zzso zzso 

zzso zzso experiments showed zzso heating in animals that received zzso but no temperature change in animals that received zzso Animals treated with zzso showed a transient increase in plasma zzso levels after each zzso zzso and significantly greater tumor necrosis than animals that received zzso or zzso zzso vs zzso or zzso P zzso zzso The mean zzso index in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso was significantly higher than the mean zzso index in the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso groups zzso zzso zzso 

zzso laser zzso after zzso administration results in zzso heating and increases the efficacy of zzso Further studies are required to evaluate the optimal laser settings to maximize therapeutic zzso
