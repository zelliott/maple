The zzso protein (18 zzso zzso previously known as zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein involved in various cell functions including zzso zzso and zzso zzso is highly expressed in zzso and zzso zzso especially in zzso cells, and its expression is altered in certain pathological conditions such as cancer and neurological zzso In this study, we characterized the regulatory elements present in the region of the zzso promoter extending from 515 to 805 zzso upstream of the zzso start site, an area previously identified as being important for zzso zzso fragments extending zzso zzso and 805 zzso upstream of the zzso start site were able to direct enhanced green fluorescent protein expression to zzso cells of the zzso zzso cells of the zzso and cells of the adrenal zzso in transgenic zzso This expression pattern perfectly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso characterization of the zzso zzso region revealed the presence of one specificity protein zzso protein 3 zzso and two zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso binding sites that are important for zzso activity in both zzso mouse zzso tumor cells and zzso whole mouse zzso zzso zzso protein alpha zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso factors, was found to be associated with the zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso and members of the zzso family of zzso factors bind to specific binding sites in the zzso promoter to drive zzso zzso gene zzso
