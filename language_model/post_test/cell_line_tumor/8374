zzso stroke stimulates zzso in the adult zzso zzso The molecules underlying zzso zzso have not been fully zzso Using real-time reverse zzso we found that stroke substantially zzso zzso 2 zzso a zzso zzso expression in zzso zone neural zzso zzso zzso of neural zzso cells with zzso human zzso significantly increased the number of zzso zzso cells, a marker of immature zzso but did not alter the number of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso cells, a marker of zzso suggesting that zzso promotes zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with small interference zzso zzso attenuated zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels compared with levels in the zzso cells zzso with control zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso protein zzso zzso zzso by zzso bound to zzso zzso which is consistent with published data that there are several zzso beta binding sites in the promoter of zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso enhanced migration of neural zzso cells measured by single zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso and a zzso zzso did not suppress zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso zzso with zzso blocked zzso zzso zzso our data suggest that interaction of zzso a zzso factor, with its zzso zzso promotes neural zzso cell differentiation into zzso lineage cells, whereas zzso regulates neural zzso cell migration through zzso zzso which do not require its zzso zzso
