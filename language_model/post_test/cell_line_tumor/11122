To investigate the possibility of using stealth zzso modified with zzso acid zzso zzso as the targeted carriers to achieve increased zzso in tumor and enhanced zzso delivery for the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso as a zzso for zzso was zzso and zzso zzso to the active zzso zzso zzso to form zzso zzso zzso Then zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso and zzso containing zzso zzso were prepared by film zzso followed by ammonium zzso zzso zzso The zzso probe, zzso was used to study the binding of melanoma cells to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were performed to evaluate the cellular association or zzso zzso for zzso or zzso in zzso 

The melanoma cells zzso and zzso showed enhanced binding to the immobilized zzso The cells treated with zzso showed remarkable increase in cellular association or zzso zzso compared with zzso 

The zzso zzso could be as the targeted carriers to facilitate the delivery of the zzso zzso drugs into tumor cells by zzso zzso
