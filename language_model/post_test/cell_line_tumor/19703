The protein factor zzso zzso zzso from the zzso medium of human prostate cancer cell lines, zzso growth and enhanced zzso zzso and bone zzso zzso gene expression in human prostate cancer cells by zzso a zzso zzso zzso protein zzso A signaling zzso When zzso was zzso in prostate cancer cells, it induced explosive tumor growth in mouse bone through increased zzso zzso element binding protein zzso and activated zzso target gene zzso including zzso zzso zzso A, zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth zzso zzso the zzso downstream signaling zzso by injection of the zzso small interfering zzso zzso complex produced an effective zzso of previously established prostate tumors in mouse bone through increased zzso as shown by zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso signaling is an attractive new therapeutic target for the treatment of lethal prostate cancer bone zzso
