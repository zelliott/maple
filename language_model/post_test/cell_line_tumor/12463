Numerous studies have reported links between zzso growth factors zzso and the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso We ourselves have reported that zzso binds to zzso via zzso proteins zzso to stimulate zzso and zzso cell zzso Here, we detail the functional evaluation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the presence and absence of zzso and zzso The data presented here, combined with our prior data on zzso suggest that zzso zzso and -5 are the most effective at stimulating cell migration in combination with zzso and zzso In addition, we demonstrate that different regions within zzso and zzso are critical for complex zzso Furthermore, we examine whether zzso complexes of zzso and zzso associated with zzso and collagen IV are also able to enhance functional biological zzso
