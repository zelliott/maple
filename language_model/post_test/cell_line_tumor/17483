Growing evidence supports the critical role of zzso zzso products in the control of cell zzso In previous studies we demonstrated the efficient restriction of the proliferation rate in several cell lines resulting from the in zzso treatment with zzso zzso polar components of cell zzso Among these, zzso acid zzso a primary intermediate of zzso zzso induced a significant arrest in zzso in zzso colon cancer zzso In response to zzso treatment of zzso we observed cell growth arrest and increase in zzso expression both at the zzso and the zzso zzso Growth of zzso zzso human colon zzso cells was not inhibited by zzso We present evidence that zzso is required for zzso zzso growth arrest in human colon zzso zzso
