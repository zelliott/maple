zzso zzso is mainly produced from zzso zzso in zzso zzso and shows strong impact in cancer zzso This work aimed to investigate the mechanism that zzso uses to drive zzso zzso It was found that zzso and zzso showed high expression in zzso zzso zzso cells and in almost all zzso cell zzso zzso had preferential binding to zzso cells via zzso and blocking this zzso by either zzso zzso or zzso could zzso zzso zzso After zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso whereas there was no change in zzso Moreover, zzso could not activate zzso in condition of treatment with a zzso zzso These data provide evidence that zzso invasion of zzso cells is through the zzso zzso Strategies aimed to inhibit this zzso may, thus, provide therapeutic zzso
