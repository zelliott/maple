This research aims to evaluate the application of Real - time cell zzso zzso based on zzso sensor technology in the detection of zzso induced cell zzso Growth indexes of zzso cells at different stages were observed zzso appropriate cell concentration was selected to test zzso zzso and to determine the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso The traditional zzso test was used as methodology comparison and results validation at the same zzso Cell zzso was transformed to cell index zzso value and visual dynamic curve through software, and the result showed that the observation of zzso zzso was more than zzso when the zzso cells concentration was zzso 5 X zzso hole on the 96 electronic orifice zzso Compared with the traditional zzso effect zzso through microscope observation method, the end point judgment results were consistent between these two methods at zzso (about zzso zzso post virus zzso In the zzso tests, three zzso values of zzso zzso zzso against zzso in human serum were zzso to those obtained from traditional 96 zzso zzso zzso also suggested that the presentation time of zzso induced by the i virus could be different even the end point judgment was the same with the same zzso zzso zzso Compared with the traditional zzso monitoring method, zzso can save labor and eliminate the hands-on error in the monitoring zzso zzso and zzso zzso detection in zzso zzso can be served as one of the supplementary methods of traditional detection method, with the advantages of zzso observing the occurrence and development of cell pathological changes, and the variation of virus zzso and serum zzso zzso
