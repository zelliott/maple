zzso is a recently identified protein that is released from zzso after zzso zzso It binds zzso allowing zzso zzso and cell zzso In view of its activity it might participate in zzso In the present study, we analyzed zzso expression in a panel of cervical cancer zzso 

We performed zzso quantitative zzso on 41 cervical tumor and 6 normal tissue zzso The study included 8 stage I zzso 16 stage zzso 17 stage zzso and a control group of 6 samples of normal cervical zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso expression was below the detection limit in the normal cervical tissue zzso In contrast, 13 zzso of the 41 cervical cancer zzso showed zzso levels of this zzso The samples expressing zzso were distributed equally among the stages (5 in stage I, 4 in stage II and 4 in stage zzso with similar expression zzso We found no correlation between the presence of zzso zzso and zzso menopause, WHO stage or disease zzso 

zzso is expressed de zzso in a subset of cervical cancer patients, reflecting a possible zzso in the pathways leading to cervical zzso There was no correlation with any clinical zzso
