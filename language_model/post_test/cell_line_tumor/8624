Although zzso zzso frequently form highly dynamic networks, zzso of zzso become stabilized in response to environmental cues and function as specialized tracks for zzso and zzso zzso zzso stabilization is controlled by specialized zzso tracking proteins zzso whose zzso at the zzso ends is facilitated by the zzso zzso zzso and regulated by various signaling zzso As zzso themselves, viruses are dependent on zzso for their zzso zzso Although many viruses affect zzso organization, the potential contribution of zzso stabilization by zzso to infection remains zzso Here we show that early in infection of primary human zzso zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso the zzso the primary zzso organizing center in many cell zzso As infection zzso zzso zzso the formation of stable zzso zzso through zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso by the viral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso formation is reduced in cells infected with zzso zzso and those stable zzso that form cluster around the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso specialized host zzso that control zzso formation at the zzso network and cortical capture, are specifically required for zzso zzso stabilization and zzso zzso Our findings demonstrate the biological importance of zzso to viral infection and suggest that zzso has evolved to exploit the zzso network as an alternate zzso organizing center to facilitate virus zzso
