This study characterized the membrane zzso to zzso in a cell line derived from the rat colon zzso by comparison of zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso under various experimental conditions including cell membrane zzso and zzso cell zzso Cell volume was modified by changing the zzso and composition of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso media induced graded increases in cell volume and stable zzso of zzso channels that was reflected in an increased zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso solution also enhanced the zzso of zzso (a zzso analogue of zzso Both the zzso of zzso and of zzso were inhibited by zzso zzso 100 zzso suggesting the involvement of zzso zzso zzso To gain further insight into the route zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were determined over short zzso zzso zzso of these zzso demonstrated close zzso comparable increases were observed that correlated with the increases in cell volume in zzso and zzso zzso zzso they were inhibited strongly by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 20 zzso together with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso while barely reduced by zzso zzso zzso and they were not affected by zzso (1 zzso In contrast, the zzso of zzso and zzso had zzso different zzso they were insensitive to cell zzso barely inhibited by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso while strongly reduced by zzso zzso zzso zzso Unlike the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso were reduced in zzso media, suggesting the presence in this cell line of two different zzso carriers, one zzso and one zzso Taken together the present data show that in this rat zzso cell line, zzso zzso is increased by cell swelling in zzso zzso medium and inhibited by zzso and zzso zzso The similarity of these characteristics to those of zzso zzso suggests the involvement of a zzso zzso zzso
