zzso are often heterogeneous, being composed of multiple cell types with different zzso and molecular zzso Cancer zzso cells zzso are a highly zzso cell type found in zzso diverse tumors or cancer cell lines, and they are often resistant to standard zzso zzso The origins of zzso and their relationships to zzso cancer cells zzso are poorly zzso In an zzso breast zzso model, zzso are generated from zzso cells at a specific time during the transformation process, but zzso formation is not required for zzso zzso profiles indicate that zzso and zzso are zzso but different cell types arising from a common zzso zzso Interestingly, medium from the transformed population stimulates zzso to become zzso and conversion of zzso to zzso occurs in mouse zzso Furthermore, zzso is sufficient to convert zzso to zzso in genetically different breast cell lines, human breast tumors, and a prostate cell zzso Thus, breast and prostate zzso and zzso do not represent distinct zzso states, and these zzso do not behave as or arise from classic stem zzso Instead, tumor zzso involves a dynamic equilibrium between zzso and zzso zzso by zzso and zzso of the inflammatory feedback loop required for zzso This dynamic equilibrium provides an additional rationale for combining conventional chemotherapy with zzso which selectively zzso zzso
