zzso zzso of tumor zzso genes by zzso DNA zzso and zzso modifications at their promoter regions plays an important role in the initiation and progression of zzso The therapeutic effect of the widely used zzso drugs, including DNA zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso remains zzso One important underlying factor in the ineffectiveness of these drugs is that their actions lack zzso 

To investigate whether zzso extract can be used for zzso zzso of cancer cells, zzso human lung cancer cells were zzso zzso and incubated with bovine zzso zzso 

zzso sequencing showed that bovine zzso extract induced significant zzso at zzso promoter zzso islands of the tumor zzso genes zzso and zzso however, the DNA zzso levels of repetitive sequences were not zzso zzso zzso showed that bovine zzso extract significantly reduced zzso repressive zzso modifications and increased zzso zzso zzso modifications at the promoter regions of zzso and zzso zzso zzso extract zzso the expression of zzso and zzso at both the zzso zzso and the protein levels without zzso the zzso of zzso zzso At the functional level, zzso zzso migration and invasion of zzso cells was strongly zzso 

These results demonstrate that bovine zzso extract zzso zzso silenced tumor zzso genes by zzso the zzso modifications at their promoter zzso zzso zzso extract may provide a useful tool for investigating zzso mechanisms in cancer and a valuable source for developing novel safe therapeutic approaches that target zzso zzso
