zzso growth factor zzso zzso gene zzso activate the zzso zzso in lung cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso induce zzso of cancer cells, but prolonged treatment is often associated with acquired zzso Here, we identified a novel zzso zzso zzso and compared its zzso effects to those of zzso zzso in zzso cell lung cancer zzso cell lines harboring zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso cell lines showed poor responses to zzso and zzso zzso with an zzso zzso 10 zzso By contrast, combination treatment with zzso and zzso inhibited cell proliferation and produced a zzso higher number of zzso zzso cells than zzso alone in zzso zzso Furthermore, combination treatment decreased zzso zzso signal related zzso zzso and zzso levels and zzso the expression of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso depletion reduced zzso activity zzso in zzso and zzso treated zzso zzso An in zzso zzso activity zzso showed that zzso levels were approximately a zzso lower in zzso cells treated with zzso and zzso combination than in cells treated with zzso zzso zzso was more zzso than zzso when used in combination with zzso Our results suggest that combination treatment with zzso and zzso zzso is a promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of zzso lung zzso and its effect is zzso by the zzso of zzso and the induction of zzso
