zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is highly induced in zzso and stressed cells via mechanisms that include zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso within the first zzso of the zzso gene was identified and characterized in this zzso The zzso had high sequence zzso to an zzso acid response element and was shown to act as a zzso zzso in zzso cells by binding the zzso factor, zzso element binding protein A zzso zzso During zzso zzso stress, binding of zzso alpha to the zzso zzso the element acted as a positive regulator in early stress by binding of the zzso factor zzso and as a negative regulator in prolonged stress by binding the zzso zzso family member, zzso We conclude that zzso control of the zzso gene is tightly controlled by multiple zzso zzso contributing to regulation of zzso zzso acid transport for cell growth and zzso In addition, we propose that genes may use zzso elements such as the zzso to support zzso expression in the absence of zzso
