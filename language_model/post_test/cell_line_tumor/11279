This work aimed to determine if the treatment outcomes of zzso cancer could be improved by targeting zzso that are decorated with zzso zzso zzso on the surface and loaded with the zzso drug zzso 

zzso efficacy and specificity was determined with cell zzso An in zzso targeting and zzso efficacy study was conducted in mice carrying zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were more efficient than zzso zzso in delivering the drug load into zzso cancer cells both in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso was less toxic than free zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and allowed administration of zzso the maximum tolerated dose without increasing the zzso zzso zzso were more effective than the zzso zzso in controlling cancer growth zzso zzso zzso and zzso overall survival zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso loaded with zzso offer strong potential for clinical applications in treating zzso zzso
