The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of zzso zzso a heat shock protein 90 zzso zzso on the zzso cell cycle, and zzso of human zzso zzso zzso Cell proliferation and cell cycle distribution were measured by the zzso zzso and flow zzso analysis, zzso zzso of zzso was determined by flow zzso and zzso zzso The expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso B1 were detected by Western zzso zzso The activity of zzso was also zzso We found that zzso inhibited cell growth and induced zzso cell cycle arrest and zzso in zzso cells together with the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, increased zzso activity was also observed in zzso cells treated with zzso In conclusion, our data suggest that the zzso of zzso function by zzso may provide a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of human zzso
