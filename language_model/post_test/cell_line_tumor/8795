zzso is an inhibitor of multiple zzso zzso zzso including zzso and zzso In a phase II clinical trial in advanced prostate cancer zzso zzso treatment improved bone scans in zzso of zzso zzso Our studies aimed to determine the expression of zzso targets during zzso progression and to evaluate its efficacy in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso models while zzso its effects on tumor and zzso Using zzso and tissue zzso containing normal zzso primary zzso and soft tissue and bone zzso our data show that levels of zzso zzso and zzso are increasing during zzso zzso Our data also show that the expression of zzso targets are particularly pronounced in bone zzso To evaluate zzso efficacy on zzso growth in the bone environment and in soft zzso we used zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso inhibited the growth of zzso in bone as well as growth of subcutaneous zzso Furthermore, zzso treatment attenuated the bone response to the tumor and resulted in increased normal bone zzso In zzso the expression pattern of zzso targets in primary and zzso zzso zzso and its efficacy in two different models of zzso suggest that this agent has a strong potential for the effective treatment of zzso at different stages of the zzso
