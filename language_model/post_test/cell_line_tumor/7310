In the human zzso the zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene has expanded into a tandem array of genes termed zzso Two members of this family, zzso and zzso have been found to have potent activity against zzso zzso factor deficient zzso human zzso virus 1 zzso These zzso become zzso in zzso zzso zzso and in the next round of infection zzso the newly zzso reverse zzso The zzso zzso protein prevents the zzso by inducing the degradation of zzso and zzso We report here that two additional zzso family members, zzso and zzso have potent zzso activity against zzso zzso virus zzso but not zzso Both zzso were zzso in zzso and zzso zzso and were active against zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso neutralized the zzso activity of zzso but not that of zzso zzso induced abundant G zzso A zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso induced substantially fewer zzso zzso was found to be active against zzso and sensitive to zzso zzso These findings raise the possibility that the different zzso family members function to neutralize specific zzso
