The tumor zzso gene zzso encodes a zzso zzso that signals DNA damage to cell cycle zzso In response to zzso radiation, zzso is zzso on zzso 68 zzso by zzso zzso zzso protein leading to its zzso We have previously shown that zzso zzso 3 zzso a protein involved in DNA damage checkpoint and zzso functions, interacts with and zzso zzso When zzso was zzso from zzso cells zzso it had weak zzso activity towards zzso compared with zzso derived from zzso cells zzso zzso This activity was restored by addition of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at two zzso zzso 62 zzso and zzso 73 zzso in zzso and this zzso zzso subsequent zzso of zzso on zzso by zzso in response to DNA zzso When the zzso zzso construct zzso zzso zzso 73 zzso to zzso is zzso into cells, it no longer associates with a large complex in zzso and zzso a significant reduction in zzso zzso It is also zzso activated by zzso by zzso at zzso and, in turn, is unable to zzso the zzso zzso zzso which contains the zzso zzso target zzso zzso As a consequence, zzso 15 zzso on zzso remains zzso and there is a loss of the zzso zzso These data describe a functional role for zzso in a zzso linking zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in cellular response to DNA zzso
