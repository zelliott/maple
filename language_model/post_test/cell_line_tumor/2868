The poor prognosis of patients with aggressive and invasive zzso combined with toxic effects and short zzso of currently available treatments zzso development of more effective tumor selective zzso zzso stem cells zzso are emerging as novel zzso delivery zzso however, a thorough investigation addressing their therapeutic potential and fate in different cancer models is zzso In this study, we explored the engineering potential, fate, and therapeutic efficacy of human zzso in a highly zzso and invasive model of zzso We show that engineered zzso retain their zzso properties, survive longer in mice with zzso than in the normal brain, and migrate extensively toward zzso We also show that zzso are resistant to the zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso and, when engineered to express zzso zzso zzso induce zzso zzso in established zzso cell lines as well as zzso primary zzso cells in zzso Using highly zzso and invasive human zzso models and employing real-time imaging with zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso TRAIL has profound zzso effects in zzso This study demonstrates the efficacy of diagnostic and therapeutic zzso in zzso zzso models and forms the basis for developing stem zzso therapies for different zzso
