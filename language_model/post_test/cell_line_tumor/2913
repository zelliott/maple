An efficient and facile synthesis of naturally occurring zzso zzso and their zzso have been zzso zzso I zzso was prepared by condensing zzso zzso zzso with protected zzso under phase transfer conditions followed by zzso and zzso The influence of zzso group on zzso and zzso activities was zzso The presence of zzso group as in zzso enhanced radical scavenging activity but decreased reducing power activity when compared to zzso analog zzso In zzso testing in zzso cell line revealed that zzso zzso and zzso showed better zzso activity than their zzso zzso zzso I and its zzso though exhibited negligible zzso activity their zzso activities were comparable with other zzso zzso
