zzso regulates many target genes in response to zzso and growth zzso To study the mechanisms of zzso transcription, we established several cell lines in which zzso cells were zzso with a variety of zzso zzso Using these cell lines, we found that truncated zzso but not zzso could not recruit zzso and was not zzso on zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso to zzso caused the loss of zzso zzso zzso leaving zzso zzso zzso zzso with this, the zzso zzso showed no increase in zzso zzso zzso at zzso and a decreased level of zzso zzso II recruited to the target gene promoter, although zzso recruitment and zzso zzso zzso were zzso This zzso also lost responsiveness to zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso region from zzso to zzso called zzso zzso plays critical roles in zzso zzso by recruiting zzso and allowing zzso zzso
