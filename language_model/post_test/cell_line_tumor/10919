Border cell migration is a process that occurs during zzso zzso development in which cells derived from a simple zzso migrate and invade neighboring zzso This process resembles the behavior of zzso cells that derive from the simple zzso of the human zzso One important regulator of border cell migration is zzso a zzso of steroid zzso zzso zzso Because increasing evidence indicates that similarities exist between the molecular control of migration of border cells and of cancer cells, we investigated whether zzso controls zzso cancer cell zzso Little or no zzso expression was detected in normal zzso surface zzso zzso zzso and borderline zzso tumors that lack zzso zzso In contrast, zzso was abundantly expressed in high-grade zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cancer cells markedly reduced cell spreading and migration, and altered zzso zzso of focal zzso zzso This zzso effect on cell migration was independent of the zzso zzso zzso status of the zzso These studies reveal a novel role for zzso in zzso cancer progression by promoting cell migration, independently of its role in zzso zzso zzso
