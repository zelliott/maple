Increased levels of zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso in plasma are known to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular zzso In this study we have investigated the effects of environmental air pollution particles zzso and zzso carbon black zzso on the expression of zzso and zzso in the lung zzso cell line, zzso After treatment with zzso or zzso the cells were found to have increased expression of zzso and zzso localized in both the cell zzso and zzso Analysis of the cell zzso revealed that zzso and zzso were present, suggesting zzso of both proteins in response to the particulate zzso To investigate if the expression of zzso and zzso was the result of free radical production, cells were treated with zzso in the presence of antioxidants zzso and zzso This revealed that antioxidants reduced the amount of zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso These findings suggest that zzso and zzso may be zzso from the lung zzso as a result of zzso stress and have important effects on the inflammatory response associated with inhalation of particulate zzso
