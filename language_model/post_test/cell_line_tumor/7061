zzso is a novel zzso agent that selectively zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso In the immature vessels characteristic of tumor zzso this leads to zzso cell contraction, blood vessel congestion, and, consequently, tumor cell zzso zzso has been shown to delay tumor growth in a range of zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso can be increased in combination with zzso or radiation therapy, although the precise mechanism of this enhancement has not been zzso zzso treatment has also been shown to inhibit lung zzso and the present study has explored the potential to increase the zzso effect of zzso by combining with zzso and the underlining mechanism has been zzso 

Human lung zzso zzso cells were injected into the tail vein of nude zzso Five weeks after injection animals were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (6 zzso zzso or a combination of the two zzso The animals were sacrificed 24 hours later, and the extent of lung zzso and the presence of zzso cells were zzso 

zzso analysis revealed that the zzso combination resulted in a 2 to zzso increase in the total number of zzso zzso cells compared with either treatment zzso zzso alone induced zzso of zzso zzso cells in tumors, and the extent of zzso was increased zzso in combination with zzso The lung weight was significantly reduced, and the number of zzso zzso significantly was lower in the combined treatment group than in the control zzso 

These data suggest that the zzso effect of the zzso agent zzso can be increased by use in combination with zzso which increases the zzso of zzso cell zzso
