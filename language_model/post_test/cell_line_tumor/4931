zzso and zzso with zzso group have been demonstrated for their selective zzso zzso modulating zzso We screened their effects on cell growth in human prostate zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cell line was used for the measurement of zzso activities of zzso zzso zzso and 30 zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso served as the zzso positive control, and 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso served as the specific zzso zzso zzso zzso cultured rat prostate zzso cells used as cell growth selective zzso The zzso effects were analyzed using zzso zzso and zzso zzso flow zzso and zzso were employed to illustrate the possible zzso When treated with zzso for 24 to 72 zzso cell growth was strongly inhibited (at 48 h zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso potential zzso zzso Meanwhile, few changes in zzso could be observed when zzso with zzso zzso zzso growth zzso was associated with zzso arrest ( zzso and zzso arrest depending upon zzso zzso with zzso arrest, zzso increased protein expressions of zzso zzso and zzso while showed decrease in zzso zzso zzso D1 and zzso zzso zzso has much lower effects on zzso cells and showed only weak zzso arrest, suggesting a possible zzso zzso These findings suggested a novel zzso efficacy of zzso zzso selectively via induction of cell cycle arrest but not associated with zzso receptors in zzso zzso
