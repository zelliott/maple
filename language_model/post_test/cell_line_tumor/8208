zzso zzso is a zzso which enters the brain and may cause permanent zzso Thus, the properties of zzso transport across cell zzso are a key factor in designing an appropriate model for zzso zzso This study uses cell cultures to examine the zzso and zzso mechanisms of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and rat brain zzso zzso zzso The cellular zzso and zzso of zzso was investigated using zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was zzso while the zzso of zzso was zzso in all the three cell zzso This indicates that zzso of zzso is due to passive diffusion and zzso of zzso is due to a protein zzso zzso of the zzso acid transport system L inhibited zzso of zzso in zzso and zzso cells, but not zzso cells, indicating a role for system L in zzso in the former zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and several zzso acids did not alter the zzso of zzso from zzso and zzso zzso The zzso acids zzso and zzso however, increased the zzso Both zzso and zzso are important in the generation of zzso zzso suggesting the involvement of zzso in zzso zzso zzso at low zzso zzso and zzso zzso decreased the zzso zzso and at high zzso zzso and zzso zzso increased the zzso This zzso effect of zzso at low zzso is possibly due to binding to zzso while the effect of high zzso zzso is attributed to disrupted membrane integrity, as measured by zzso zzso This study demonstrates differing transport mechanisms of zzso in the cell lines zzso zzso and zzso
