zzso zzso gene 1 zzso a novel zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso was cloned with zzso differential display zzso Previous researches showed zzso might inhibit cell growth, zzso colony formation in soft zzso and zzso of zzso zzso cell line zzso This study was to screen the proteins associated with the tumor zzso function of zzso by comparative zzso zzso 

The whole cellular proteins of zzso and zzso cells were extracted and separated by two-dimensional gel zzso zzso zzso After zzso the gels were stained by zzso zzso Blue zzso and analyzed using zzso zzso The zzso expressed proteins were cut from the gels, analyzed by zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and identified through searching database with zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso patterns of zzso and zzso cells were zzso The total protein spots were zzso in zzso cells and zzso in zzso cells, with an average matching rate of zzso Using mass zzso technology, 20 differential protein spots between the 2 cell lines were zzso Among them, 16 were identified by zzso and 4 were identified by zzso zzso Some of the identified proteins were characterized as members of cellular zzso and metabolism zzso 

In this study, zzso gels of zzso cell line with high expression of zzso zzso and zzso control zzso cell line were zzso some differential proteins related to zzso were identified by mass zzso These data will help to illustrate the molecular mechanism of zzso
