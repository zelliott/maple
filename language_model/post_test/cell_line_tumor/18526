The marine zzso zzso D zzso has been recently characterized as a potent poison of human zzso I endowed with remarkable zzso activities against tumor zzso We report here the first zzso relationship study in the zzso zzso Two groups of zzso compounds incorporating various zzso on the three zzso OH at positions 8, 14 and 20 of zzso zzso zzso zzso typical of the parent zzso were tested as zzso I zzso The zzso compounds in group A showed no activity against zzso I and were essentially non zzso In sharp contrast, compounds in group B incorporating zzso acid zzso strongly promoted DNA zzso by human zzso zzso zzso derivatives zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso or a related zzso side chain, stabilize zzso zzso zzso The DNA zzso sites detected at T downward zzso G or C downward zzso G zzso with these molecules were identical to that of zzso but slightly different from those seen with zzso which stimulates zzso zzso zzso at T downward zzso G zzso In the DNA relaxation and zzso zzso the corresponding zzso compounds and the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso lacking the 5-6 double bond in the zzso zzso showed no effect on zzso I and were considerably less zzso than the corresponding zzso compounds in the zzso zzso The presence of positive charges on the molecules enhances DNA interaction but melting temperature studies indicate that DNA binding is not correlated with zzso I zzso or zzso Cell growth zzso by the 41 zzso derivatives was evaluated with a panel of tumor cells zzso With prostate zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso resistant to zzso and colon zzso and zzso cells resistant to zzso cancer cells (but not with zzso colon zzso zzso the most zzso compounds zzso to the most potent zzso I zzso The observed correlation between zzso and zzso I zzso strongly suggests that zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso can be used as a guide to the development of superior zzso in this zzso zzso is the lead compound of a new promising family of zzso agents targeting zzso I and the zzso acid derivatives appear to be excellent candidates for a zzso zzso
