Multiple zzso structures of an zzso series of zzso bound to the molecular zzso zzso have been zzso These structures explain the observed zzso for previously described compounds and new compounds, which possess up to zzso improved potency against the isolated zzso zzso cell potency and mechanism of action data is also described for the most potent zzso These data should enable the design of more potent zzso zzso
