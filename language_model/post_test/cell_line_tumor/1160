zzso is an zzso zzso expressed by most human natural killer zzso cells and a subset of T cells that recognizes human zzso zzso E zzso on potential target zzso To zzso the cell surface dynamics of zzso zzso we have expressed zzso receptors in the rat zzso leukemia zzso cell zzso zzso experiments revealed that zzso receptors move freely within the plasma membrane and accumulate at the site of contact with zzso The enriched zzso is markedly less mobile than the zzso zzso We observed that not only are zzso zzso not required for zzso zzso they are excluded from the site of zzso contact with the zzso Furthermore, the zzso raft patches normally observed at the sites where zzso zzso receptors are zzso were not observed when zzso was zzso along with the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso of the zzso receptors at zzso sites not only promote zzso of the zzso zzso but by zzso zzso exclusion prevent formation of zzso signaling zzso
