The zzso movements generated by myosin, zzso and zzso were observed in living cells in an attempt to understand the molecular mechanisms of movement within zzso First, the sequential process of the transport of zzso including human zzso factor 2 zzso after zzso was observed for long periods in three dimensions using quantum dots zzso and a three-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso after being zzso into the cells, moved along the membrane by transferring zzso filaments and were then rapidly transported toward the nucleus along zzso Second, the position of zzso was detected with a precision up to zzso zzso and 330 zzso using a new two-dimensional tracking zzso The movement of the zzso transported by zzso VI lying just beneath the cell membrane consisted of zzso and zzso steps with a transition phase between these two zzso zzso zzso were then transported toward the nucleus or away from the nucleus toward the cell membrane with successive zzso zzso The zzso movements of these motor proteins in cells were observed using new imaging methods that allowed the molecular mechanisms underlying traffic to and from the membrane to be zzso
