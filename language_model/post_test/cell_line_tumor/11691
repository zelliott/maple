zzso zzso zzso have been reported to be activated in several types of zzso including zzso zzso cell zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate whether zzso protein expression is a useful predictor of the clinical outcome or drug resistance in zzso zzso was conducted with 75 zzso zzso specimens using a zzso zzso against zzso The patients were divided into two groups according to the degree of zzso zzso and the relationship between the zzso level and the zzso features was zzso Seventy-five patients were divided into low zzso 1, zzso and high zzso 2, zzso zzso expression zzso The overall survival was significantly worse in the grade 2 patients than in the grade 1 patients zzso survival rate, zzso zzso zzso zzso Cox zzso hazard analysis revealed that zzso type 3 or 4 disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and high zzso expression zzso were independent zzso of a poor zzso With regard to the zzso analysis among the 31 patients undergoing zzso chemotherapy, the grade 2 patients had a worse prognosis than did the grade 1 patients zzso survival rate, zzso zzso zzso zzso This tendency was not observed in the zzso without zzso chemotherapy zzso survival rate, zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso expression is a good predictor of zzso and it may be closely related to the zzso efficacy of zzso plus zzso in zzso zzso
