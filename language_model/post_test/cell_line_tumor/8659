zzso zzso zzso is valuable for evaluating therapeutic effects of drugs and generating better treatment zzso However, conventional protein analysis is often challenging due to inadequate sample size of clinical zzso lack of zzso zzso zzso and zzso A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso system zzso was used to study the dynamic zzso status of signaling molecules in zzso cell lung cancer zzso cells treated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed the same dynamic zzso zzso as Western zzso with good zzso zzso using 1,000 times less zzso The zzso separation in zzso system enables multiple protein zzso zzso to be resolved and detected zzso With zzso we identified a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso response pattern to zzso inhibitor zzso which was not zzso by Western zzso zzso We also revealed a zzso signal that may be associated with zzso cell sensitivity to the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and distinguished zzso cells from intrinsic as well as acquired resistant cells to zzso Moreover, zzso could differentiate human zzso zzso from the mouse zzso based on their zzso point differences and showed that zzso effectively inhibited zzso zzso in targeted human zzso cancer cells but not in surrounding mouse zzso zzso With 8 zzso of tumor zzso we precisely zzso the response of 18 signaling molecules to zzso and zzso inhibitor treatments in an zzso zzso zzso higher sensitivity, better resolution of protein zzso status, and reduced tissue requirement warrant zzso investigation for future drug development and evaluation of drug effects of targeted zzso
