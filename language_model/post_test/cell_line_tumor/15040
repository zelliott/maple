zzso zzso zzso is a common and aggressive cancer, and the treatment options are limited for patients with advanced zzso zzso the major zzso component of the traditional Chinese medicine zzso exhibits significant zzso activities in many tumor cell zzso In the present study, we investigated the effect of zzso on the zzso of an zzso signaling pathway, and examined the relationship between regulatory proteins and zzso effects in zzso zzso 

zzso wound healing, zzso and zzso zzso were performed in zzso and zzso cell zzso The protein levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were measured by western zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression levels were also evaluated by zzso 

zzso inhibited zzso cell zzso migration, invasion and zzso In addition, treatment with zzso significantly decreased the levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso while increasing the levels of zzso and zzso and suppressing the nuclear zzso of zzso 

zzso is a potential zzso therapeutic candidate through its zzso of the zzso signaling zzso Further studies with zzso are warranted in patients with zzso especially those with the disease at advanced zzso
