Previously, we demonstrated the zzso form of the zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso to be zzso in zzso and to enhance zzso in zzso To determine the zzso of these effects, the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were administered to zzso 20 zzso prior to zzso water maze zzso The zzso and zzso significantly reduced escape zzso during water maze learning and enhanced its recall in a probe trial 3 days zzso In contrast, zzso did not influence these zzso zzso The zzso effects of zzso were further zzso in zzso using zzso 2A zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso In zzso zzso the zzso induced profound zzso outgrowth at zzso up to zzso zzso with the zzso and zzso being less zzso zzso analysis of zzso D3 expression in zzso zzso indicated the zzso and zzso to induce zzso zzso of this zzso similar to that associated with zzso cell cycle arrest zzso by zzso whereas zzso was without zzso These results indicate that the zzso effects of zzso are due to the actions of the zzso and that zzso D3 zzso and associated zzso and zzso actions are predominantly associated with the zzso
