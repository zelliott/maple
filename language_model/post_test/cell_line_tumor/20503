Here we report that zzso Cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso grown in zzso zzso in contrast to conventional zzso zzso display distinct differences in cell zzso proliferation and expression of important zzso proteins associated with cancer zzso zzso with in zzso growth rates, in zzso cultures, all zzso zzso were found to zzso at significantly lower rates in comparison to their zzso zzso Moreover, when grown in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to mimic more precisely protein expression patterns of zzso zzso formation as found in zzso In comparison to the prostate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited a zzso of zzso and zzso zzso expression and an zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso active zzso In comparison to the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were found to have an zzso of zzso zzso zzso consistent with a zzso zzso In zzso cultures, there was little distinction in protein expression between zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso cultures are more representative of in zzso zzso and may serve as a more biologically relevant model in the drug discovery zzso
