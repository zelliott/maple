A series of zzso zzso compounds are considered as synthetic zzso of zzso for zzso zzso We performed zzso relationship studies by zzso a number of zzso zzso or zzso with zzso or their zzso precursors as potent zzso zzso Both zzso on zzso rings and on zzso nitrogen zzso or zzso zzso or zzso or zzso zzso zzso were zzso The zzso efficacy of the new zzso compounds was tested by measuring their zzso to cancer cell lines zzso and zzso and to the zzso cell zzso The results showed that all zzso compounds induced a significant loss of cell viability in the human cancer cell lines zzso however, only zzso appended zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Ahmed, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Rivera, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cancer zzso 2010, 9, zzso zzso 7, 9) showed limited toxicity toward zzso cell zzso Computer zzso simulations support the biological activity zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso will be useful as a safe and effective zzso agent for cancer zzso
