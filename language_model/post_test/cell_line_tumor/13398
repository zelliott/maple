Recently, we showed that the zzso zzso virus zzso has a significant therapeutic potential in treating zzso zzso zzso of human zzso prostate zzso in tumor zzso In this study, underlying mechanisms of the zzso zzso reduction were zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso resulted in a drastically decrease of blood and zzso vessels, representing essential routes for zzso cell migration, in both tumors and zzso Thus, zzso drastically reduced essential routes for the zzso spread of zzso zzso Furthermore, analysis of viral distribution in zzso zzso mice by plaque zzso revealed significantly higher virus zzso in zzso compared to solid zzso To zzso conditions potentially zzso the preferential viral colonization and zzso of zzso zzso components of zzso tumors and zzso were compared by microscopic zzso These analyses revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso showed increased vascular zzso higher proliferation status of tumor cells as determined by zzso and zzso zzso and lesser necrosis of zzso cells than solid zzso Moreover, an increased number of immune cells zzso zzso zzso B zzso combined with an zzso expression of zzso zzso was observed in zzso in comparison to primary zzso zzso We propose that these zzso components zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso might offer a novel treatment of zzso prostate zzso in zzso
