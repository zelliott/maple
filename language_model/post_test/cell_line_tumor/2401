zzso zzso are short zzso regulatory zzso that control gene expression and play an important role in cancer development and zzso However, little is known about the role of zzso in chronic zzso leukemia zzso Our objective is to decipher a zzso expression signature associated with zzso and to determine potential target genes and signaling pathways affected by these signature zzso 

Using zzso zzso and zzso real-time zzso we characterized the zzso expression profile of zzso cell lines and patients in reference to zzso cell lines and healthy zzso Of all zzso tested, zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in zzso zzso zzso of these zzso was dependent on zzso zzso We next analyzed predicted targets and affected pathways of the zzso zzso As expected, in zzso cells, the expression of several of these targets was zzso to that of the zzso zzso regulating zzso zzso the analysis identified zzso as the main disease associated with these zzso zzso zzso zzso target of zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso were the main molecular pathways related with these expression zzso zzso zzso zzso we found appreciable overlap between the zzso zzso and the signaling zzso zzso 

The zzso identified in this study might offer a pivotal role in zzso Nevertheless, while these data point to a central disease, the precise molecular zzso targeted by these zzso is variable zzso a high level of complexity of zzso target selection and zzso These zzso zzso highlight new candidate gene targets allowing for a better understanding of the molecular mechanism underlying the development of zzso and propose possible new avenues for therapeutic zzso
