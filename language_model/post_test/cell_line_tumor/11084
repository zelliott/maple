During the course of zzso processing and degradation of a zzso many structurally related intermediate zzso products are zzso Human body zzso and zzso contain several thousand peptides that can be zzso by zzso zzso and subsequent zzso zzso zzso zzso Networks zzso efficiently detect structural and biological relations of zzso based on statistical analysis of zzso zzso We combined CAN with recognition of probable zzso sites for zzso and zzso in zzso fluid, resulting in a model able to predict the sequence of unknown peptides with high zzso On the basis of this approach, identification of zzso coordinates can be zzso and a rapid overview of the zzso content of a novel sample source can be zzso
