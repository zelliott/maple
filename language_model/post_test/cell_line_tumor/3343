zzso is an accessory zzso and the binding partner of zzso Previously, we showed that zzso expression leads to the zzso zzso of zzso at position zzso To further investigate the zzso zzso of zzso we have now generated a novel zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso is zzso at both zzso 19 and zzso We zzso this zzso event by zzso zzso zzso and zzso We generated a series of zzso zzso harboring the zzso of each zzso to zzso zzso or in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression of these zzso in zzso cells demonstrated that neither zzso is the unique zzso site, and that double zzso of zzso 19 and 27 to zzso abrogates zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso cells revealed that the two zzso forms of zzso exhibited some distinct zzso zzso zzso is concentrated at cell edges and at zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso is distributed in a zzso pattern throughout the cell surface and zzso Further functional analysis revealed that zzso zzso of zzso has no effect on its targeting to zzso zzso but clearly zzso the zzso of zzso with zzso In an attempt to identify upstream zzso we investigated zzso zzso zzso in an zzso zzso We found that in zzso cells, zzso stimulation is sufficient to induce zzso zzso at zzso 19 and zzso However, the behavior of the two zzso forms of zzso zzso upon zzso zzso First, zzso zzso and zzso zzso display different zzso zzso In addition, the zzso response to zzso stimulation appears to be zzso zzso is zzso at zzso 19 in a rapid and transient fashion, whereas zzso at zzso 27 is sustained over zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to associate with zzso in a zzso zzso However, zzso at zzso 27 appears to be more critical than zzso at zzso 19 for this binding to zzso Taken together, these results suggest that, in addition to the common characteristics that these two sites appear to share, zzso zzso and zzso zzso may each possess a set of unique functional zzso
