The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso carrier 28 zzso gene family and is expressed in the liver, zzso and zzso zzso mediates the zzso of naturally occurring zzso zzso but also zzso zzso used in zzso and zzso zzso Thus expression levels of zzso may affect the zzso of these drugs and the outcome of drug zzso Because little is known about the zzso regulation of human zzso gene zzso we have characterized the zzso promoter with respect to DNA response elements and their binding zzso The zzso start site of the zzso gene was determined by zzso In zzso analysis revealed the existence of three putative binding sites for the nuclear zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso within the zzso zzso A zzso reporter gene construct containing the zzso promoter region was zzso by zzso in human cell lines derived from the liver, zzso and zzso zzso with this, we showed in zzso shift zzso that zzso specifically binds to two zzso direct zzso motifs within the zzso zzso zzso In zzso experiments, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso further increased, whereas the zzso zzso zzso small zzso partner reduced, zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso with the latter phenomenon, zzso zzso expression levels were suppressed in primary human zzso upon zzso acid zzso Supporting the zzso relevance and species conservation of this effect, zzso zzso zzso expression was decreased upon zzso acid feeding and increased upon zzso duct zzso in zzso
