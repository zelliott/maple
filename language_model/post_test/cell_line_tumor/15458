The zzso of zzso signaling pathways zzso the zzso of zzso metabolism in tumor cells and increases zzso acid zzso into the tumor zzso This is a well-known characteristic of tumor cells, termed the Warburg effect, and is a candidate target for zzso zzso Previous reports show that zzso acid zzso by tumor cells is a zzso zzso that activates the zzso pathway, thereby inducing zzso zzso and tissue zzso Here, we show that zzso acid, or more specifically the zzso it causes, increases zzso I zzso expression in zzso to inhibit zzso proliferation and zzso zzso we hypothesized that zzso of the immune effects by zzso acid might suppress tumor zzso We show that zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso targets zzso to suppress zzso of the zzso zzso and the expression of zzso by zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso but zzso zzso proliferation was restored when zzso were zzso with zzso acid and zzso zzso treatment decreased zzso expression in zzso immune cells and increased the number of zzso zzso T cells and zzso cells in zzso mouse zzso Although zzso treatment alone did not suppress tumor growth, it increased zzso zzso activity of zzso in both zzso T zzso and zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso acts not only on tumor cells to suppress zzso but also on immune cells to improve the immune status modulated by zzso acid and to increase the effectiveness of zzso zzso
