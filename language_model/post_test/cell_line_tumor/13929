We report a novel role for the zzso zzso in the proliferation and invasion of head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso Previously, we reported zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso In this study, we provide biological validation of these findings and show that zzso is intimately involved in tumor cell zzso migration, and zzso zzso derived from a zzso zzso zzso but not from a zzso primary zzso zzso zzso as judged by Western zzso of zzso zzso We used zzso interference to generate cell lines zzso in which zzso expression was greatly reduced, and tested whether this modulated the cell zzso zzso cells showed decreased proliferation compared with cells harboring zzso control zzso In addition, we found that the ability of zzso cells to migrate and invade in zzso through a basement membrane substitute was greatly impaired compared with control zzso Finally, whereas control cells were highly zzso in nude mice, the zzso potential in zzso of zzso cells was found to be zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso production contributes to both enhanced proliferation and invasion of zzso cell zzso and that targeting of zzso pathways may represent a potential therapeutic zzso for these zzso
