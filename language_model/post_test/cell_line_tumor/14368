zzso cells act as an interface between human zzso surfaces and the surrounding zzso As a result, they are responsible for the initiation of local immune responses, which may be crucial for prevention of invasive zzso Here we show that zzso cells detect the presence of bacterial zzso toxins (including zzso from zzso pneumoniae, zzso from zzso zzso zzso O from zzso zzso and zzso O from zzso zzso at zzso zzso far below those required to cause zzso zzso of zzso zzso appears to be a zzso response of zzso cells to zzso zzso of bacterial zzso zzso and this activity is inhibited by the addition of high molecular weight zzso to the zzso zzso By sensing zzso stress caused by the zzso of a zzso number of pores into their zzso zzso cells may act as an early warning system to zzso an immune response, while the local density of zzso bacteria remains zzso zzso may thus represent a novel innate immune response to a common bacterial zzso zzso
