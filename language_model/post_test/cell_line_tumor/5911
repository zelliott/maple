zzso zzso zzso zzso is a pivotal zzso zzso and a signaling zzso which acts at the interface between stress factors and the cellular zzso zzso Earlier, we found that zzso of zzso in human zzso cell lines resulted in cell proliferation arrest and zzso to S zzso zzso zzso To zzso the mechanism by which zzso depletion arrests cell zzso we examined the effect of zzso zzso on human zzso cells zzso Our results show that zzso cells establish zzso zzso as revealed by proliferation arrest, changes in zzso zzso zzso and more than zzso zzso of zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso zzso following zzso depletion results from compromised zzso and energy crisis leading to the sustained zzso zzso via zzso of zzso zzso at zzso Our findings demonstrate that zzso depletion switches human tumor cells to zzso zzso via zzso network, in the absence of DNA zzso zzso experiments using zzso and genetic models confirmed that zzso has important regulatory functions linking the energy metabolism and the cell cycle zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cell lung cancer cells via zzso depletion suggests a novel strategy to control tumor cell zzso
