We previously identified zzso as a functional zzso of breast cancer liver zzso We now confirm that zzso levels are elevated in liver zzso but not in skin zzso compared to levels in their matched primary tumors in patients with breast zzso Moreover, zzso is specifically expressed in zzso breast cancer cells compared to populations derived from bone or lung zzso The increased liver zzso exhibited by zzso breast cancer cells requires zzso interactions between breast cancer cells and primary zzso Furthermore, the reduction of the zzso expression level, either in cancer cells or in primary zzso diminishes these zzso zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrate that the first zzso zzso loop is essential for zzso tumor zzso interactions and the ability of breast cancer cells to form liver zzso in zzso Thus, during breast cancer liver zzso zzso shifts from acting within zzso complexes to functioning as an zzso zzso between breast cancer cells and zzso
