We have identified zzso a human zzso protein which is composed of 308 zzso acids and exhibits zzso zzso to human zzso at the zzso acid zzso Database analysis revealed that the gene corresponding to zzso is composed of 7 zzso and 6 zzso zzso level of zzso zzso was found to be increased in 5 cell lines derived from zzso zzso compared with 2 cell lines derived from primary zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that the zzso level of zzso zzso with the zzso propensity of several zzso human colon cancer and pancreatic zzso cell zzso zzso zzso to a recently identified zzso zzso and zzso we have demonstrated zzso of zzso zzso by zzso and zzso Investigation of several types of human zzso and their corresponding normal zzso revealed high levels of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso tumors compared with the corresponding normal zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso in breast cancer samples with disclosed zzso features and corresponding normal zzso The levels of zzso zzso were significantly zzso in tumors compared with normal breast zzso and correlate with lack of zzso zzso expression of the zzso
