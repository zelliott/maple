zzso changes in human cancer are complex and vary between the different types of zzso zzso this zzso zzso in an zzso of zzso changes will be beneficial for basic research as well as zzso zzso zzso approaches that interrogate zzso patterns zzso have already generated promising zzso However, these methods are still limited by their quantitative accuracy and the number of zzso sites that can be assessed zzso Here, we use a unique approach to measure quantitative zzso patterns in a set of zzso candidate zzso In this high-resolution study, we employed a zzso model consisting of 59 cancer cell lines provided by the National Cancer Institute and six healthy control zzso for discovery of zzso differences in zzso zzso To assess the effect of cell zzso we validated the results from colon cancer cell lines by using clinical colon cancer zzso Our results show that a large proportion of genes (78 of 400 zzso are zzso altered in zzso Although most genes show zzso changes in only one tumor type (35 zzso we also found a set of genes that changed in many different forms of cancer zzso zzso This zzso can easily be expanded to develop a more comprehensive and ultimately complete map of quantitative zzso zzso Our zzso data also provide an ideal starting point for further zzso research where the results can be combined with existing large-scale zzso to develop an approach that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
