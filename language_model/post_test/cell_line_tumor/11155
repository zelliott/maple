Many zzso have been shown to cause tissue specific tumors in animal zzso The mechanism for this specificity has not been fully zzso and is usually attributed to differences in organ zzso For zzso zzso potent zzso that are formed in zzso meat, the ability to either bind to the zzso zzso and activate or inhibit an zzso response will have a major impact on zzso Here, we describe our work with the human zzso zzso alpha zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso We demonstrate both by zzso zzso and zzso analysis that zzso binds with the zzso binding domain zzso This binding competes with zzso zzso in the native zzso binding cavity of the zzso In zzso zzso show that zzso in contrast to the other zzso zzso increases cell proliferation in zzso human breast cancer cells and activates the zzso zzso We also find that other zzso zzso and zzso inhibit zzso zzso We propose that the mechanism for the zzso zzso seen in the rat breast tumors and the zzso human breast cancer associated with the consumption of zzso meat maybe zzso by this zzso zzso
