zzso in the expression of the zzso zzso fragile zzso zzso zzso gene have been reported in a variety of human zzso including lung cancer and restoration of its expression in cancer cell lines resulted in the zzso of proliferation and zzso zzso Most of the studies that have assigned a zzso role to the zzso gene were performed in zzso cancer cells expressing high levels of the zzso zzso The present work was the first study designed to investigate the effects of zzso gene replacement in a human zzso zzso lung cancer zzso cell line zzso by using a zzso expression system that allows tight zzso of the zzso zzso Through this approach, we demonstrated that a prolonged induction was required to accumulate the zzso protein at levels adequate to promote a significant decrease of cell zzso Analysis of zzso phase distribution showed an zzso of cells in the zzso phase and a zzso decrease in the S zzso Moreover, an zzso of zzso transcript was found, which could account for the zzso of the cycling properties of the zzso The zzso effects observed were not associated with zzso appearance, and although in these conditions the zzso protein content was higher than in normal zzso human zzso cells zzso it was still significantly lower than the level capable of inducing zzso in zzso cells after zzso zzso gene zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso properties of zzso are strictly related to its expression level and show that the zzso protein has a zzso zzso effect on the zzso zzso lung cancer cell zzso
