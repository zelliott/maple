Lung zzso zzso cells are the first barrier exposed to volatile zzso such as zzso prior to reaching the targeted zzso zzso Previously, the effects of volatile zzso on lung zzso were studied primarily with zzso models and there has been little experimental data from cell zzso Therefore it was investigated whether zzso zzso zzso of zzso lung zzso zzso zzso cells were exposed to zzso via a zzso zzso with a zzso flow in a zzso chamber at zzso The concentration of zzso in zzso modified zzso medium was detected with gas zzso zzso cells and cells treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso were used as negative and positive controls, zzso zzso factors, including the level of zzso zzso by terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso zzso DNA damage and the level of zzso were zzso zzso treated with zzso showed a significant reduction in zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group were greater than in the zzso zzso The difference of zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso groups was statistically zzso DNA degradation was observed in the zzso and zzso groups, however this was not observed in the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso groups induced increased zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso induced zzso of zzso lung zzso zzso cells, which resulted in decreased cell zzso increased zzso bodies, impaired DNA zzso and increased levels of zzso
