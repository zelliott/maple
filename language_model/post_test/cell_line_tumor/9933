A specific zzso zzso in the zzso gene zzso most cases of zzso inherited zzso zzso zzso This zzso causes the protein to zzso and form zzso inclusion bodies in cultured cells and animal zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso proteins resulted in the zzso of the zzso protein from the zzso zzso to inclusion bodies in cultured zzso cells, and this was associated with increased interaction between the two zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso in primary zzso zzso zzso resulted in the formation of zzso inclusion bodies, predominantly in zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in these inclusions and this process was zzso by increased zzso interaction between zzso zzso and zzso zzso Analysis in an zzso zzso cell culture model demonstrated altered zzso zzso activity in the presence of the zzso but not zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that the interaction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso may contribute to the zzso and reported zzso dysfunction in zzso zzso
