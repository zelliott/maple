The important role of zzso in many chronic and acute pathological conditions of the central nervous system is widely zzso zzso is a major component of turmeric and reportedly has zzso and zzso zzso This study investigated the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso (or zzso zzso zzso zzso production and whether the effect is zzso by zzso protein zzso zzso in the rat zzso cell zzso We observed that zzso (1 zzso induced the zzso of zzso zzso and protein in zzso Treatment with zzso zzso 10, and 25 zzso decreased the expression of zzso zzso and protein in a zzso manner under treatment with zzso Additionally, the zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso only had a mild effect and the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso had no zzso Finally, western zzso showed that zzso induced rapid zzso zzso and zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso expression at 30 zzso after zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso effect of zzso relates to the zzso of zzso expression through the zzso zzso in zzso cells, which indicates a possible benefit from the use of zzso in the treatment of zzso zzso
