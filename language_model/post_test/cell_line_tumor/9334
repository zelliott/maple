An investigation has been made into the zzso effect on zzso cells of zzso zzso which were prepared chemically and analyzed by transmission electron microscope and energy zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso zzso were performed to examine their zzso effect compared with that of traditional zzso at various zzso The average diameters of the two types of zzso zzso prepared were 60 zzso and 140 zzso respectively, and zzso identified that only zzso was zzso zzso zzso greatly inhibited the proliferation of zzso cells by zzso in a zzso zzso manner, much more effectively than traditional zzso zzso zzso zzso The survival ratio of cells treated with zzso zzso at 2, 4, 8, and 16 zzso after 72 h was zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, much lower than zzso zzso zzso and zzso of cells treated with traditional zzso at the corresponding concentration for 72 zzso The zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells for 48 h was only zzso zzso in comparison with zzso zzso of traditional zzso After treated with zzso zzso at 4, 8, and 16 zzso for 48 zzso the zzso rate of cells was zzso zzso and zzso respectively, but that in cells treated with traditional zzso at the same concentration for 48 h was only zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso can produce a much better zzso effect on cancer cells than that of traditional zzso
