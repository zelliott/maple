In the previous study, we found that zzso zzso was significantly zzso in lung cancer and could induce zzso in lung cancer patients' zzso To further study the function of zzso zzso the short hairpin zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso was constructed in zzso and zzso into human lung zzso zzso zzso zzso down zzso zzso expression by zzso the zzso level of zzso zzso was investigated by zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso protein was examined by Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso chamber model were used to evaluate proliferation and invasion of zzso cells in zzso The concentration of zzso zzso zzso and zzso B zzso in the zzso was evaluated by zzso At zzso after zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso and protein was zzso significantly, respectively zzso zzso proliferation and invasion capability of zzso cells also decreased significantly zzso zzso The concentration of zzso and CB was zzso obviously, respectively zzso zzso This study implies that zzso zzso might play an important role in the progression and invasion of human lung cancer cells, and could promote progression of lung cancer by regulating the expression of zzso and zzso
