The emerging field of mass zzso chemical zzso provides a powerful instrument in the target discovery of zzso zzso such as drugs or natural zzso The identification of their zzso targets is required for a comprehensive understanding of their zzso role and for unraveling their mechanism of zzso We report the application of a chemical zzso approach to the analysis of the cellular zzso of the marine zzso zzso zzso zzso was linked to an opportune zzso zzso zzso chain and then immobilized on a zzso zzso The modified beads were then used as a bait for fishing the potential partners of zzso in a zzso zzso cell zzso Surprisingly, we identified zzso a protein involved in the cell zzso of zzso viruses and other biologically relevant zzso as a specific and major zzso zzso In addition, we verified the zzso role of zzso testing its ability to inhibit the zzso zzso of zzso This finding indicates zzso as a new zzso tool for cell zzso studies and zzso the way to further investigation on its potential role in modulating zzso zzso
