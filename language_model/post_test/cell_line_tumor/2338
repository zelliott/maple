One of the key challenges in zzso bone surgery is to provide living zzso that possess the ability to integrate in the surrounding host zzso Bone graft zzso and zzso have already been widely used to heal zzso bone defects due to zzso tumor zzso and tissue zzso In the present study, zzso zzso have been seeded with human zzso zzso followed by the in zzso culture of the zzso In order to overcome the drawbacks associated with zzso culture systems, including limited diffusion and in homogeneous zzso distribution, the present work describes the application of a zzso to physically enhance the cell culture in zzso using an electromagnetic zzso The results indicate that the physical stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso the bone zzso zzso We anticipate that the scaffolds developed consisting of human bone proteins and cells could be applied for clinical purposes related to bone zzso
