zzso DNA zzso zzso repairs zzso zzso one of the most abundant DNA zzso caused by zzso zzso In the zzso zzso is thought to prevent zzso of the intrinsic zzso zzso in response to zzso stress by zzso DNA zzso However, the predominance of the zzso zzso which lacks zzso DNA zzso activity, suggests that zzso zzso functions in a role independent of DNA zzso We report here that zzso of zzso human zzso zzso in human lung zzso cells with some zzso zzso cell characteristics zzso zzso prevents zzso zzso dysfunction and zzso by preserving zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking zzso DNA repair activity were as effective as zzso zzso in preventing zzso zzso zzso reductions in zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that the protective effects of zzso occur independent of DNA zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso using zzso reduces zzso zzso and zzso zzso These findings suggest a novel mechanism that zzso acts as a zzso zzso zzso protein to prevent zzso zzso dysfunction and zzso that might be important in the molecular events underlying zzso zzso
