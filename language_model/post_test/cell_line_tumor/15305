zzso is the most common primary bone zzso of adolescents and young zzso 

We analyzed liver X zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in 16 pairs of human zzso zzso and adjacent zzso zzso Moreover, we investigated zzso potential role in regulating cell proliferation in zzso and zzso zzso 

We found that zzso of zzso a member of nuclear zzso was able to inhibit cell proliferation in zzso and zzso zzso At the molecular level, our results further revealed that expression of tumor zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso activates zzso zzso through a direct binding on its promoter zzso 

zzso acts as a tumor zzso for zzso which may offer a new way in molecular targeting cancer zzso
