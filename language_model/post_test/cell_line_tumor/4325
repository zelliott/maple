This study aims to demonstrate that zzso high-intensity focused ultrasound zzso may enhance the zzso zzso zzso zzso in tumor zzso using zzso zzso zzso 

To the mice bearing zzso zzso human tongue zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso was applied to zzso Immediately after zzso treatment, zzso was zzso injected, and biological zzso including zzso imaging and zzso were zzso 

Both zzso studies and zzso imaging performed after intravenous injection of zzso revealed higher tumor zzso in zzso mice than that of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of tumor sections and zzso zzso of nearby normal zzso revealed no significant difference between the zzso mice and the zzso 

This study demonstrated that zzso was beneficial to the zzso of zzso drug in the head and neck tumor zzso and may enhance the therapeutic efficacy of clinical zzso
