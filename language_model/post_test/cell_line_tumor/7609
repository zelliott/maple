To investigate the effect of zzso of zzso by zzso on invasion, migration, and colony abilities in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso against zzso was employed to inhibit the expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso included the zzso zzso for invasion and migration, plate colony formation zzso for cell colony ability, Western zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso expressions in total zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso and protein expressions of zzso were suppressed significantly in zzso cells zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed in zzso zzso the average invasive cells in zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso was less than that in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso control cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso the average number of migration cells in zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso was lower than that in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso cells and control cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In plate colony formation zzso the average colony number of zzso zzso cells was zzso zzso zzso which was less than that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and control cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Western zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso increased the expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in zzso and decreased the expressions of zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in zzso 

The zzso of zzso zzso the invasion, migration, and colony formation abilities of zzso cells, which is probably related to the regulation of zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso and zzso may be a promising gene therapy target for zzso zzso
