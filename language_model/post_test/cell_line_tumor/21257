zzso plus protein synthesis inhibitor zzso zzso in human zzso leukemia zzso but not in zzso zzso minus zzso zzso zzso cells, derived from zzso To investigate how zzso DNA depletion zzso zzso we investigated zzso Both zzso and its zzso form were observed only in zzso indicating that depletion of zzso increased protein and the active form of zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso which zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso significantly increased zzso induction by zzso plus zzso and eliminated zzso of zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso was induced by the depletion of zzso and inhibited zzso zzso
