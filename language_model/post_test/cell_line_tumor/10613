Expansion of zzso zzso derived zzso cells zzso is governed by the presence of increasingly zzso zzso primary zzso zzso not the primary zzso is often the cause of zzso This study sought to fully characterize the zzso zzso in response to zzso and zzso zzso tumors using zzso mass zzso shotgun zzso in a mouse model with tumor cell lines, zzso and zzso derived from the same zzso zzso cells form only primary zzso tumors, whereas zzso cells readily zzso to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis identified a total of zzso protein groups with a zzso false discovery zzso Of the zzso true zzso 43 proteins were exclusive to the zzso group, 153 were exclusive to the zzso group, and zzso were zzso Among the shared zzso 26 proteins were increased and 31 were decreased in the zzso zzso cohort compared to zzso zzso controls after zzso zzso selectively express proteins involved in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and other pathways involved in zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso acid zzso in response to highly zzso zzso zzso Cell cycle regulation dominated protein pathways and zzso groups of the zzso zzso zzso Not only does this study provide a starting point to identify potential zzso of zzso expressed by zzso it identifies critical pathways that are unique to zzso and zzso zzso zzso interventions aimed at these pathways in zzso may offer a new route to control zzso and zzso
