zzso cell cycle checkpoint control is essential for the maintenance of cell and zzso zzso Members of the zzso zzso zzso family of zzso protein zzso have been implicated in the regulation of various aspects of the cell zzso We explored the cellular functions of zzso a novel member of the zzso family, and demonstrate a role for zzso in the cellular zzso zzso zzso was required for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1/2 zzso signaling upon zzso zzso but not in response to zzso such as zzso growth factor zzso zzso physically associated with zzso and zzso in a zzso manner, and the formation of this complex was necessary for zzso zzso zzso zzso did not affect the zzso activity of zzso but instead promoted the zzso zzso of zzso The appropriate maintenance of the zzso checkpoint following zzso zzso required zzso expression and zzso zzso Taken together, our results uncover a role for zzso in the cellular response to zzso zzso
