Recently, we have reported the therapeutic efficacy of delivering zzso zzso zzso or executioner active zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso cells using the human zzso reverse zzso zzso gene promoter system zzso or zzso In the present study, we investigated if conventional treatments for zzso zzso augment the efficacy of the zzso zzso First, we demonstrated that zzso exhibited a greater ability to induce zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells than zzso Next, as conventional treatments to combine with zzso zzso agents zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso therapies zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso Combination of zzso gene therapy with zzso yielded a zzso additive effect, while zzso and zzso had additive effect only when tumor cells were treated at zzso of each zzso A decline in the combination effect of zzso and zzso at zzso was due to decreased activity of zzso in treated tumor cells prior to the zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso or zzso had no significant additive effect on induction of zzso These results suggest that agents, which induce zzso without zzso zzso activity are a promising counterpart to combine with zzso therapy for the management of zzso zzso
