The novel zzso analogue of zzso zzso zzso was zzso in our laboratory with the aim of developing zzso DNA zzso II zzso The compound showed significant zzso effects on seven cancer cell lines and induced zzso zzso phase arrest in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso showed a potent zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso in a zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso zzso through the zzso and zzso pathways were the central mechanisms for zzso zzso phase arrest in human colon cancer zzso
