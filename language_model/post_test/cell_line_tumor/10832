zzso of zzso in breast cancer is frequently associated with expression of zzso and zzso expression influences response to zzso zzso The aim of this study was to examine the effects of combining dual zzso of zzso and zzso using zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso breast cancer zzso Combination proliferation zzso were performed in two zzso positive breast cancer cell lines, zzso and zzso zzso combined with zzso was also tested in zzso zzso In proliferation zzso dual targeting with zzso and zzso or zzso showed zzso or zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso or zzso (5 zzso alone did not induce significant zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso induced significant zzso in zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso further enhanced zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso and zzso (5 zzso induced zzso comparable to zzso alone zzso zzso suggesting that zzso of both zzso and zzso may be required to induce zzso in these zzso zzso with zzso and zzso or zzso enhanced response to chemotherapy in zzso The combination of zzso and zzso also effectively blocked zzso growth in zzso zzso targeting of zzso and zzso by combining zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso may improve response in zzso zzso breast cancer cells that also express zzso
