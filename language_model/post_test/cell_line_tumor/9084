zzso foam cells in zzso zzso are generally thought to play a major role in the pathology of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was recently found to play an important role in zzso Here we applied zzso interference to study the role of zzso in foam cell formation in zzso zzso of zzso reduced zzso synthesis as measured on zzso and protein level by real-time zzso Western zzso It was found that zzso interference for zzso with small interfering zzso zzso zzso foam cell formation by the human zzso cell line zzso which was treated with oxidized zzso zzso zzso while the majority of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso vascular cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and so on, were zzso through large scale gene expression analysis using DNA zzso These data demonstrate that induction of zzso by zzso factors may be a key step in zzso the cellular events that result in zzso zzso
