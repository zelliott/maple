zzso zzso has been reported to be involved in the development of zzso disease, and zzso gene variation has been associated with plasma zzso levels and different cardiovascular disease zzso However, the genetic architecture of the zzso promoter and its zzso regulation are poorly zzso 

We identified 1008 zzso of the zzso zzso region to be sufficiently zzso active in zzso cell lines and generated serial promoter deletion zzso Individual zzso revealed the existence of 3 molecular zzso zzso zzso zzso wild zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared to zzso zzso activities of zzso 2 and 4 were significantly reduced zzso Whereas introduction of the zzso zzso reduced zzso activities of the full-length zzso zzso it significantly increased activities of the deletion zzso zzso zzso mobility shift, competition, and zzso zzso zzso revealed specific zzso interactions for the zzso with zzso and zzso and identified zzso interacting exclusively with the zzso zzso 

We propose new structural and zzso features within the zzso promoter region and identified zzso being zzso zzso active and zzso interacting with a zzso zzso zzso
