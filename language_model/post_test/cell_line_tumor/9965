Giant plasma membrane zzso zzso are zzso model membrane systems that undergo large-scale zzso phase separation when cooled below room zzso Because of their presumably more zzso zzso zzso they are increasingly used as alternatives to synthetic model zzso However, the exact mechanism of zzso formation, and thus, effects of this process on the zzso integrity of the membrane are still zzso zzso we identify the key steps of zzso formation and characterize their differences with respect to the plasma membrane of intact zzso zzso of zzso zzso triggers a steady zzso influx that is accompanied by zzso zzso zzso degradation and zzso zzso zzso zzso before detachment of the zzso and the onset of zzso zzso When comparing zzso to other zzso model systems, zzso is not zzso in zzso plasma membrane spheres zzso either, but is present in zzso zzso zzso differ from the zzso state of the plasma membrane in the presence of specific zzso which limits their use as model zzso Furthermore, we propose that zzso influences the zzso zzso
