Breast cancer is a sex steroid zzso zzso zzso The role of zzso in this zzso has been well zzso however, the involvement of zzso has remained zzso To determine the role of zzso zzso zzso in human breast cancer, we studied the metabolism of zzso testosterone and zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso 231 cells, at different zzso zzso zzso zzso and time periods (30 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells served as zzso zzso were identified and zzso by reverse isotope zzso A distinctive pattern of zzso metabolism was identified in zzso cells, being the zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso the major conversion products of testosterone zzso with zzso as zzso The formation of zzso and zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso and abolished by zzso In contrast, very little of any zzso formation was observed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso Additional zzso gene expression studies revealed an zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, as compared with zzso 231 zzso The zzso activities of zzso were assessed in zzso cells zzso with expression zzso for alpha or beta zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso genes and for an zzso reporter zzso The results show that zzso zzso and to a lesser extent zzso bind with high relative affinity to zzso and zzso Both zzso induced zzso reporter gene zzso in a zzso manner, similar to that induced by zzso though with lower zzso an effect that was abolished by zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and to lesser extent zzso induced zzso cell zzso The overall results demonstrated that zzso cells exhibit enhanced expression and activity of zzso zzso leading to rapid and large zzso formation, and provide evidence that these zzso zzso exert a potent zzso effect, at zzso level, in zzso breast cancer zzso The data suggest that zzso may act as in zzso zzso factors in breast cancer and that its formation can be zzso zzso
