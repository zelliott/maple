In order to explore the effects of zzso fraction zzso from one of the zzso strains of zzso zzso on zzso activity of zzso tumor bearing mice, zzso mice were treated with zzso for 7 days by zzso injection at doses of 15 zzso zzso 30 zzso zzso and 60 zzso zzso after zzso tumor cells were zzso At the end of the experiments, the tumor weight of each mouse was zzso zzso of mouse zzso zzso was tested by neutral red zzso The zzso expression of zzso was zzso by zzso zzso ability and zzso of zzso zzso were determined by zzso zzso The zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso were detected by zzso The results indicated that zzso not only significantly inhibited the zzso tumor growth, but also significantly elevated zzso zzso It significantly enhanced the zzso capacity of zzso zzso and proliferation ability of zzso zzso at all the three zzso it significantly promoted zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso also significantly elevated zzso and zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso This experimental finding suggests that zzso could elevate the zzso activity in zzso tumor bearing zzso
