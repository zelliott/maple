zzso is one of the most zzso tumors in the central nervous zzso As a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso induce growth arrest and cell death in a broad spectrum of tumor zzso In this study, we investigated the role of zzso in zzso zzso We found that zzso a member of zzso suppresses growth of human zzso cell lines zzso and zzso zzso also zzso cell cycle arrest and zzso which may be the mechanism of its zzso zzso Next, we found that zzso suppresses the expression of zzso and its zzso zzso and suppresses zzso of zzso zzso also zzso formation of the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso affects the expression of zzso associated regulators of gene zzso including zzso and zzso These results suggest that zzso suppresses growth and cell cycle of human zzso cells by blocking the zzso zzso zzso
