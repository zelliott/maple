Control of zzso pancreatic cancer remains a major objective in pancreatic cancer zzso The zzso of zzso zzso plays an important role in cancer zzso The aim of this study was to detect the expression of zzso in human primary zzso zzso and three pancreatic cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso and target zzso cancer cells in zzso using zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso on pancreatic zzso zzso and cancer cell lines was performed by zzso and further confirmed by zzso microscope and flow zzso analysis on the cell zzso zzso of zzso was tested by zzso zzso zzso was documented using zzso zzso zzso of zzso was found in approximately zzso of tested zzso samples and the three pancreatic cancer cell zzso zzso is specifically zzso to pancreatic cancer cells in a zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso in pancreatic cancer is a useful target, and that the novel zzso zzso selectively targets pancreatic cancer cells in zzso zzso may be a useful agent for the treatment of zzso or minimal residual disease zzso in pancreatic cancer patients with zzso of zzso zzso
