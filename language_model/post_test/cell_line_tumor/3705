The zzso domain zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso can zzso zzso function such as zzso zzso and zzso trafficking of zzso zzso To assess the potential role of the zzso domain of human zzso zzso zzso in the zzso regulation of zzso gene zzso we developed zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines expressing a full-length or a zzso deletion zzso zzso of human zzso to analyze gene expression in response to zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we observed zzso candidate genes having zzso or zzso difference expression at zzso and 3 h after zzso Focusing on several zzso related zzso we confirmed differential expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 1, zzso and zzso zzso by zzso and zzso protection zzso Analysis of zzso stability indicated that the differential regulation of gene expression by the zzso of the zzso zzso is at the level of gene zzso Our results indicate that the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity induced by zzso engagement in zzso and provides a framework for understanding distinct expression profiles zzso by different zzso zzso zzso
