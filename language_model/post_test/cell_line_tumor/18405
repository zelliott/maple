In previous studies zzso zzso 434 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (2002) zzso we demonstrated for the first time that zzso zzso is zzso in cultured zzso cell lines, such as zzso 12 zzso and its zzso zzso Our current focus is analysis of the dynamics of zzso zzso in these zzso In this communication, we show that zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso space regulate the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso is apparently in dynamic zzso zzso zzso zzso is constantly released into the zzso space by an undefined zzso and continuously and zzso taken up into cells by an zzso zzso Under these conditions, zzso and its zzso zzso in the medium may competitively inhibit the zzso of zzso via the zzso resulting in zzso of the zzso acid in the zzso zzso We additionally demonstrate that zzso a well-established zzso zzso zzso is taken up by the zzso during long time zzso but not on a short zzso
