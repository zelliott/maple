The zzso growth factor zzso zzso and related family member, zzso are often zzso simultaneously in patients with a variety of zzso tumors, and the combination may zzso promote cancer cell growth and zzso The purpose of this study was to examine zzso effects of the combination treatment of zzso and zzso on head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso using 16 zzso cell lines in terms of zzso effect and zzso zzso zzso Previously we have reported the expression levels of zzso zzso on 16 zzso cell zzso All cell lines expressed zzso for zzso zzso and zzso 12 cell lines expressed zzso for zzso and 4 cell lines did not express zzso for zzso In in zzso proliferation zzso the combination treatment of zzso and zzso significantly lowered cell viability compared to either drug zzso The zzso expression levels of zzso and zzso were not correlated with the efficacy of the combination treatment of zzso and zzso and the expression levels of zzso and zzso also showed no correlation with the efficacy of the combination zzso We evaluated the gene status of zzso zzso 23 and 24 in 16 zzso cell lines, but there was no zzso of zzso in any of the cell zzso Either drug showed zzso in the 3 cell lines using peripheral blood zzso cells zzso however, a significant combination effect was not zzso Combined molecular targeted zzso drug therapy for zzso and zzso may be useful in the treatment of zzso
