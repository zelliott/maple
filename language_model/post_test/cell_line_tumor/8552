zzso associated Head and Neck zzso Cell Carcinoma zzso represents a distinct zzso of zzso characterized by a favorable prognosis and a distinct molecular zzso Previous data from the zzso zzso 5 trial indicated that zzso positive tumors did not benefit from hypoxic modifications by zzso during zzso whereas a significant benefit was observed in the zzso negative zzso However, more studies have demonstrated equal zzso of hypoxic tumors among zzso and zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to determine zzso the impact of zzso and the effect of zzso in zzso positive and zzso negative cell zzso 

The used cell lines were: zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were cultured under zzso or hypoxic conditions, and gene expression levels of previously established zzso induced genes were assessed by zzso zzso were zzso with various doses under zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and the zzso survival was zzso 

The zzso positive and zzso negative cell lines exhibited similar patterns of zzso of zzso induced genes in response to zzso The zzso positive cell lines were up to zzso times more radiation sensitive than zzso negative cell zzso However, all zzso positive cells displayed the same response to zzso in zzso with an zzso in the range zzso and a zzso effect of zzso of zzso similar to zzso negative zzso 

Although zzso positive cells had a markedly higher zzso compared to zzso negative cells, they displayed the same relative zzso under zzso and the same relative zzso effect of zzso The clinical observation that zzso positive patients do not seem to benefit from zzso treatment is not due to inherent differences in zzso sensitivity or response to zzso but can be accounted for by the overall higher zzso of zzso positive zzso
