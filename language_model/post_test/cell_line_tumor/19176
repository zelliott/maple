zzso is a zzso factor of the zzso gene zzso zzso in the zzso gene can cause zzso or absent zzso zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso might be associated with breast zzso Here, we show that zzso is zzso in zzso cells of primary breast cancer zzso by zzso zzso interacts with zzso zzso zzso 1, 2, 3, and zzso zzso interacts with zzso 2, and 3 via two distinct binding zzso However, deletion of the repression domain zzso acids zzso of zzso completely zzso its interaction with zzso zzso zzso and zzso interaction and zzso are found in a breast cancer cell line by zzso and zzso zzso The functional significance of the interaction between zzso and zzso is also tested in a zzso reporter zzso zzso indicate that zzso zzso expression of zzso tumor zzso and that a zzso inhibitor is able to reverse the zzso repressive function in a zzso zzso This study suggests that zzso may function by recruiting zzso to the zzso binding site in the promoter zzso zzso repression to its targets is dependent on zzso zzso zzso may serve as a zzso for breast cancer and have significant applications in both breast cancer diagnosis and zzso
