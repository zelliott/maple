Five new type zzso zzso complexes zzso have been zzso and characterized by zzso analysis, zzso zzso analysis, zzso zzso zzso zzso and mass spectral zzso The zzso of the complexes was tested by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso B zzso zzso The acute toxicity and zzso activity of complex zzso zzso were also zzso The results indicate that complexes zzso have no activity against zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines, with a higher zzso value zzso zzso Complex e zzso substantially greater zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines with an zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of complex e is zzso it was significantly higher than that of zzso and zzso Complex e at dose of 4, 12 and zzso has no activity against mouse zzso zzso and Lewis lung zzso in mice, but displays significant activity against human zzso zzso zzso and human colon zzso zzso in nude mice at dose of 12 zzso and activity is similar to that of zzso at dose of 4 zzso Complex e at dose of zzso has no activity against human lung zzso zzso in nude mice zzso The results suggest that the species of zzso for the new type zzso platinum complexes have important effect on their zzso and they may be a new class platinum zzso zzso
