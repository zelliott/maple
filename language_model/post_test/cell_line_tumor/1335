zzso zzso is a zzso zzso with a remarkable diverse clinical zzso zzso half of the high stage aggressive zzso are characterized by zzso gene amplification but our understanding of the role of zzso in zzso zzso is zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso expression is zzso correlated with expression of zzso zzso a gene zzso an zzso protein with presumed zzso zzso activity, but direct zzso regulation of zzso was excluded leaving the mechanism of regulation zzso Given the recently established role of zzso zzso in zzso of zzso genes and predicted seeds for zzso cluster members within the zzso zzso we hypothesized that this mechanism would act in zzso regulation of zzso To investigate this, we used a validated zzso cellular system and could demonstrate robust zzso of zzso zzso and protein levels upon zzso zzso Next, two of the three predicted zzso zzso and zzso were shown to lower zzso protein levels, in addition to measurable zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso interaction between zzso or zzso and the zzso of zzso was validated using zzso reporter zzso In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the zzso zzso of zzso results from direct zzso of zzso components zzso both zzso zzso stability and translation which further contributes to the zzso zzso effect of elevated zzso zzso The strict zzso regulation of zzso is suggestive for an important downstream function of the zzso protein and thus warrants further investigations to unravel the role of zzso in zzso
