zzso is an zzso zzso from the zzso zzso which is zzso in many breast cancer zzso We have conducted two overlapping zzso vaccine trials to prevent recurrence in zzso zzso and zzso zzso breast cancer zzso 

zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso factor was given zzso to previously treated, zzso zzso breast cancer patients in a dose escalation safety trial and to zzso breast cancer patients in a dose zzso zzso Local and systemic toxicity was zzso zzso responses were assessed using in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso hypersensitivity zzso Clinical zzso were zzso 

One hundred and zzso patients were enrolled in the two studies zzso 95; zzso zzso Human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso patients were vaccinated zzso zzso zzso whereas all others zzso zzso zzso were followed zzso as zzso zzso were zzso and a zzso zzso response to the vaccine was zzso Planned primary analysis revealed a recurrence rate of zzso in vaccinated patients compared with zzso in the controls zzso zzso zzso at a median of 20 months zzso As zzso immunity waned over time, the difference in recurrence lost significance at 26 months median follow-up zzso versus zzso however, a significant difference in the pattern of recurrence zzso 

zzso is safe and effective in raising a zzso zzso immunity in zzso and zzso zzso and zzso breast cancer zzso More importantly, zzso may reduce zzso in zzso conventionally treated, high-risk breast cancer zzso These findings warrant a zzso zzso phase III trial of the zzso vaccine with periodic booster to prevent breast cancer zzso
