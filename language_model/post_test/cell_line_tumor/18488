We describe the synthesis of a series of zzso and zzso zzso which were used as components of targeted zzso (in conjunction with zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for zzso specific gene transfer into cells expressing zzso which displays a high affinity for zzso zzso studies were investigated with suspension zzso human zzso zzso cells and with adherent zzso human zzso zzso and human lung zzso zzso cells lines in order to demonstrate a zzso zzso zzso and to minimize zzso zzso zzso Altogether, our results show that zzso formulated with zzso zzso zzso under certain conditions, specific gene transfer systems into suspension zzso zzso zzso This is more particularly the case when the zzso zzso pathways are minimized zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in the presence of zzso zzso zzso which triggers zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso to a larger extent than that of their respective zzso zzso Although encouraging, the zzso zzso and efficiencies obtained with these compounds should however be zzso This study also illustrates the difficulties to demonstrate and to obtain a specific and efficient gene transfer system with zzso zzso DNA particles which also provide zzso zzso gene transfer to cells, and more particularly to adherent zzso
