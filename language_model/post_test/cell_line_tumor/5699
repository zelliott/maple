Advances in molecular cell biology, medical research, and drug development are driving a growing need for technologies that enable imaging the dynamics of molecular and zzso processes simultaneously in numerous zzso living zzso Here we describe a platform technology and zzso zzso zzso enables zzso zzso imaging of thousands of individual living cells, each held at a given position zzso on the zzso The system allows for sequential monitoring, manipulation and kinetic analyses of the effects of drugs, biological response zzso and gene expression in both adherent and zzso cells held on the zzso Here we present four specific applications that demonstrate the utility of the system including monitoring zzso of zzso oxygen species generation, assessing the zzso zzso activity, measuring calcium flux and the dynamics of target cell killing induced by zzso zzso zzso We found large variations among individual cells in the overall zzso of their response to zzso as well as in kinetic parameters such as time of zzso initial rate and zzso of the response, and frequency and zzso of zzso These variations probably reflect the zzso of even cloned cell populations that would have gone zzso in bulk cell zzso We demonstrate the utility of the system in providing kinetic parameters of complex cellular processes such as zzso influx, zzso and zzso in numerous individual zzso The zzso opens up new opportunities in zzso research, in particular for acquiring zzso kinetic data from zzso individual zzso zzso
