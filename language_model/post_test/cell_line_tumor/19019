zzso is a type I zzso zzso with zzso activity which comprises up to zzso of the cell surface area in zzso zzso zzso We have previously demonstrated the absence of nuclear zzso in zzso T cells after zzso zzso The aim of this study was to characterize the role of zzso in nuclear zzso In contrast to wild type zzso T cells, the zzso T cell lines are resistant to the induction of DNA fragmentation and zzso zzso following zzso zzso or zzso exposure, but not to zzso zzso zzso zzso in deficient cell lines led to the restoration of zzso zzso and DNA fragmentation following zzso zzso In both zzso and negative T cell lines, zzso exposure mediates zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, DNA fragmentation was also induced by zzso in cells deficient in expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed a decrease in nuclear zzso of zzso and zzso Together, these results demonstrate for the first time, that zzso expression plays a key role in zzso DNA fragmentation and zzso zzso processes during zzso zzso activity or its zzso activity, appears to be located downstream of zzso zzso and plays a role in retention of zzso in the zzso
