zzso cell zzso zzso cell lines are difficult to zzso only nine lines have been described so far and few of them have been thoroughly zzso 

We established zzso a new zzso cell line, obtained from a zzso zzso harboring both a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso and used zzso flow zzso molecular biology and zzso techniques in order to characterize the cell line zzso 

By zzso and flow zzso zzso displayed a classical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and genetic analysis showed a typical zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso According to both classic zzso analysis and spectral zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso associated with a complex zzso zzso analysis by zzso chain reactions showed that the zzso zzso is within the major zzso zzso Other important abnormalities of zzso include zzso gene zzso by a combined zzso of zzso 8 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The new cell line will be useful for in zzso studies regarding zzso zzso and drug sensitivity, as well as a diagnostic control zzso
