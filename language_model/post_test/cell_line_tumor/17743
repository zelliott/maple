The zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is involved in cell growth, zzso and zzso The functional zzso of zzso provides survival signals and blockade of this zzso may facilitate cell zzso zzso targets of zzso include the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso We have previously reported that BAD is zzso zzso in primary acute zzso leukemia zzso cells, a zzso zzso which zzso its zzso zzso In this study, we tested the hypothesis that the zzso of zzso by zzso results in the zzso of zzso and zzso and thus promote leukemia cell zzso We investigated the effects of zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells, primary zzso and normal bone zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso reduced zzso zzso activity, induced zzso of zzso and zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso signaling or combination with zzso zzso acid further enhanced zzso of zzso zzso In primary zzso samples, zzso cell growth was significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso were less affected, suggesting preferential targeting of leukemia zzso In conclusion, the data suggest that the zzso of the zzso signaling zzso restores zzso in zzso and may be explored as a novel target for molecular zzso in zzso
