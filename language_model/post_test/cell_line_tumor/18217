The nuclear zzso zzso nuclear factor 4 alpha zzso 4 zzso is a master regulatory protein and an essential player in the control of a wide range of zzso zzso zzso of zzso 4 alpha is associated with zzso disorders including zzso We were particularly interested in investigating molecular causes associated with diabetic zzso 

Novel disease candidate genes were identified by the zzso zzso zzso and by sequencing of zzso zzso zzso of candidate genes was analyzed in kidney and liver of zzso diabetic fatty zzso and of zzso zzso rats and after zzso zzso of zzso 4 zzso 

We identified the zzso zzso transient zzso potential zzso channel, zzso C, member 1 zzso as a novel zzso 4 alpha gene zzso zzso zzso is localized on human zzso zzso zzso a region considered to be a hotspot for diabetic zzso We observed a significant reduction of zzso gene expression in kidney and liver of diabetic zzso and of zzso rats as a result of zzso 4 alpha zzso We found zzso 4 alpha and zzso protein expression to be zzso in zzso of diabetic patients diagnosed with zzso zzso as evidenced by zzso Finally, zzso functional knock down of zzso 4 alpha zzso zzso gene expression in cell culture zzso 

Taken zzso results obtained from animal studies could be translated to human diabetic zzso there is evidence for a common regulation of zzso 4 alpha and zzso in human and rat kidney zzso We propose zzso of zzso 4 alpha and zzso as a possible molecular rationale in diabetic zzso
