zzso gene zzso plays an important role in zzso In cancer cells, the improper zzso of specific genes is usually ascribed to zzso zzso machinery including zzso factors, zzso zzso II, and zzso zzso This study reports on short hairpin zzso zzso gene zzso of zzso a zzso of zzso complex, and its effect on the growth of pancreatic cancer zzso zzso interference was performed by zzso zzso system to specifically zzso zzso expression in zzso and zzso zzso The zzso efficiency of zzso was confirmed by quantitative zzso and western zzso The effect of zzso zzso on zzso and zzso cell proliferation was evaluated by zzso zzso zzso incorporation zzso colony formation zzso and flow zzso zzso This study shows that zzso of zzso remarkably reduced cancer cell proliferation and colony formation capacity in two pancreatic cancer cell zzso In addition, zzso zzso induced zzso cell cycle arrest and zzso This study provides a potent role of zzso in promoting pancreatic cancer growth and a possible drug target for cancer zzso
