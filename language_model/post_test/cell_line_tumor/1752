zzso evidence indicates that zzso zzso is a key zzso in zzso and is significantly elevated in multiple myeloma zzso In this study, we explored the role of zzso in human zzso cells and searched for zzso zzso By knocking down the expression of zzso zzso in zzso myeloma cells, we observed reduced growth, an arrested cell cycle, and increased zzso To further understand its molecular mechanism in the zzso of zzso we employed a zzso zzso isotope labeling by zzso acids in cell zzso quantitative zzso strategy to systematically identify potential targets of zzso In total, we found that the expression of 178 proteins was zzso significantly by zzso zzso zzso that they could be potential targets of zzso Among these, the protein inhibitor of activated zzso zzso was confirmed as a direct zzso target by Western zzso and reporter gene zzso We further demonstrated that zzso enhances the zzso signal zzso by zzso the function of zzso and that zzso of zzso contributes to the zzso function of zzso This zzso of the role of zzso in the zzso positive regulatory loop not only may shed light on the molecular basis of the biological effects of zzso observed in zzso cells but also has direct implications for the development of novel zzso therapeutic zzso
