zzso is a component of the zzso complex linking zzso and zzso zzso as well as a major zzso of the zzso pathway, which is a critical signal cascade regulating embryonic development, cell zzso zzso and stem cell zzso zzso functions as a key regulator of immune responses and zzso and zzso in zzso signaling can lead to immune diseases and zzso We previously showed that zzso zzso of zzso signaling is zzso by zzso zzso tumor zzso 2 zzso and that zzso expression is zzso regulated in various cancer zzso Its functional zzso however, are poorly zzso We showed that zzso zzso of zzso zzso is regulated by zzso expression in zzso stem cells zzso and several cancer cells, and that zzso zzso expression is zzso regulated among cancer cell zzso Here, using a zzso zzso and zzso we demonstrate that zzso regulates zzso zzso by directly binding to the zzso promoter, and that zzso zzso zzso differs by cell zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso techniques affected proliferation and zzso of several cancer cell lines such as breast, zzso prostate cancer, and zzso but did not affect zzso sensitivity or cell zzso Our data indicate that zzso expression is zzso regulated by zzso activities, and the zzso of zzso expression affects cell proliferation and tumor growth through the zzso zzso in various cancer cell zzso
