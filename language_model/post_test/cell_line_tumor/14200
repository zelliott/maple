Although the majority of zzso germ cell tumors zzso are zzso by zzso chemotherapy, in a few cases, the occurrence of zzso resistance results in a poor zzso The biological basis of this differential zzso sensitivity in zzso remains largely zzso zzso zzso zzso cells represent the zzso tumor stem cells in zzso zzso and are known to express the zzso zzso factor zzso and to be hypersensitive to zzso In the present study, we analyzed zzso cell lines and nude mouse zzso showing differential zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that a lack of expression of zzso in zzso cells is associated with a higher zzso threshold and zzso resistance which is accompanied by an impaired zzso zzso reduced zzso activity and altered zzso zzso We were able to induce loss of zzso in a zzso zzso cell line resulting in a secondary zzso cell type with retained zzso cell characteristics and changes in zzso signaling identical to those in primary resistant zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso cells are retained in their zzso state by zzso and that a complete and ultimate loss of zzso followed by an early differentiation step is necessary to establish the zzso zzso Our data suggest that loss of zzso expression leads to induction of a higher zzso threshold and to zzso resistance in zzso cells of zzso zzso We zzso that in zzso zzso the original tumor stem cell population of zzso zzso zzso cells could be replaced by an zzso resistant population in a selection zzso In contrast, the presence of the zzso highly sensitive zzso cells as the tumor stem cell component in most zzso could explain the general high zzso and zzso of these zzso
