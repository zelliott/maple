Regular physical activity protects against the development of breast and colon cancer, since it reduces the risk of developing these by zzso During exercise, zzso factors are released from the working muscles for zzso signaling to other zzso We hypothesized that these zzso mediate some of the zzso effects of exercise on zzso cancer cell zzso zzso and muscles were collected from mice after an exercise zzso zzso with zzso serum inhibited zzso cell proliferation by zzso and increased zzso activity by zzso A similar increase in zzso activity was found after incubation of zzso cells with zzso media from zzso zzso zzso zzso array analysis zzso zzso revealed that seven genes were zzso in the muscles after exercise, and of these zzso M zzso proved to inhibit zzso proliferation by zzso increase zzso activity by zzso and induce zzso zzso zzso signaling with zzso zzso reduced the induction of zzso activity by zzso To verify that zzso was a zzso we showed that it was significantly zzso in serum and in three muscles, zzso zzso zzso and zzso after an exercise zzso In contrast, zzso expression remained unchanged in subcutaneous and visceral zzso zzso liver, and zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso serum zzso zzso cancer cell proliferation and zzso zzso of these zzso We suggest that one or more zzso zzso from working muscles may be zzso this effect and that zzso is a possible zzso These findings emphasize that role of physical activity in cancer treatment, showing a direct link between zzso zzso factors and decreased tumor cell zzso
