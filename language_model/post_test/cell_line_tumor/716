Human zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso involved in tumor escape zzso The aim of this study is to zzso its zzso significance in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso expression as well as zzso zzso regulatory zzso and zzso zzso T cells was carried out on tissue zzso containing 173 zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso protein expression in five human zzso cell lines was detected by Western zzso 

zzso expression was associated with zzso zzso especially in zzso diseases, with high expression independently associated with shortened overall survival zzso zzso zzso and increased tumor recurrence zzso zzso zzso zzso level was positively related to zzso ratio and their combination served as a better zzso patients having concurrent high levels of both variables at more than three times of risk of death and tumor zzso than those with concurrent low levels (both P zzso zzso In addition, zzso expression increased in a zzso manner with the increase of zzso potential in human zzso cell zzso 

zzso of zzso protein in zzso was an independent indicator for poor outcome especially in zzso zzso The combination of zzso expression and zzso ratio added the zzso power to both zzso offering a possible strategy of zzso zzso cancer zzso
