zzso zzso has a protective role against zzso zzso however, the mechanisms remain zzso We determined the effect of zzso on cell zzso the cell cycle and cell death in three cell lines derived from human zzso cervical zzso infected or not with human zzso virus zzso We also determined whether zzso effects are zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells was evaluated by violet crystal zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to evaluate the zzso of the cell cycle, and cell death was detected using a commercially available zzso zzso detection kit that determines zzso zzso DNA fragmentation was determined using the terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso labeling zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used to inhibit zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and zzso was used to inhibit the conversion of zzso to zzso Our results show that zzso inhibited cell proliferation in a zzso manner in the three cell zzso the zzso zzso doses were 50, 60 and 70 zzso for zzso zzso and zzso cells, zzso The zzso effect was not zzso by zzso of zzso and zzso receptors or by an inhibitor of the conversion of testosterone to zzso and this effect was associated with an increase in zzso cell death in zzso cells and zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso strongly zzso the proliferation of cervical cancer cells, but its effect is not zzso by zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso could therefore be used as an alternative in the treatment of cervical zzso
