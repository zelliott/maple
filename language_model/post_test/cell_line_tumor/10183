The purpose of this study was to evaluate the toxicity of zzso zzso zzso a major in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso rat zzso zzso zzso At zzso shown to be zzso by both the zzso and the zzso blue dye binding zzso zzso 5 and 10 zzso zzso caused after zzso a reduction in the number of extensions developed from zzso cells induced to differentiate by serum withdrawal and addition of sodium zzso zzso scanning of Western blots of extracts of zzso cells demonstrated that, at all zzso used, zzso decreased after zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso compared to zzso In addition, exposure to 10 zzso zzso for zzso reduced the levels of zzso and zzso associated protein zzso zzso On the other hand, levels of zzso were not affected by zzso zzso In contrast to our previous data on zzso the above findings suggest that its zzso zzso zzso may, at biologically relevant, zzso zzso interfere with zzso cell zzso
