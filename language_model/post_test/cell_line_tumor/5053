Nuclear receptors are zzso zzso factors involved in all major zzso functions of complex zzso In this respect, they are often described as zzso targets for a number of pathological states including zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a recently zzso nuclear zzso which is bound in zzso by zzso acid, although this natural zzso does not seem to promote zzso zzso In zzso zzso is a major regulator of liver development and zzso zzso metabolism and zzso in human have been linked to zzso Here, we have used a zzso zzso system to identify small zzso zzso of zzso in a library of synthetic compounds and found one hit bearing a zzso group zzso on a zzso zzso A collection of molecules zzso from the discovered hit was generated and tested for activity toward zzso in zzso zzso zzso It was found that both the zzso group and a complete zzso backbone were required for full activity of the zzso Furthermore, adding a zzso group at position 7 of the minimal backbone led to the most active compound of the zzso zzso a direct interaction of the zzso compound with the zzso binding domain of zzso was detected by zzso and zzso zzso zzso When used in zzso cell culture systems, these compounds proved to be highly toxic, except when zzso on the zzso zzso One such compound was able to zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso activity can be modulated by small molecules and suggest new routes for targeting the zzso in zzso
