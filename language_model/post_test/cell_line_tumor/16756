zzso plays an important role in DNA damage and repair, zzso zzso zzso regulation and zzso zzso zzso cancer often presents at an advanced stage, however, tend to have better response to zzso chemotherapy as compared with sporadic cases of zzso zzso cancer zzso In spite of this, most patients will develop a recurrence and eventually succumb to the zzso zzso studies are currently investigating natural compounds and their zzso for zzso targets in zzso zzso The aim of this study is to investigate whether the zzso inhibitor zzso a novel zzso zzso has a therapeutic effect on zzso zzso zzso Our novel agent, zzso and a commercial zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso cancer cells in zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer cells treated with zzso exhibited a significant degree of zzso with elevated levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso treatment induced more zzso oxygen species zzso in zzso cells compared with zzso cells, however, there was no increased zzso when benign zzso surface zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso cancer cells had higher expression of zzso zzso zzso as compared with other zzso zzso Furthermore, treatment of these cells with zzso resulted in decreased expression of zzso and its downstream targets zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, zzso of zzso zzso provided resistance to zzso zzso Our results show that zzso a potent zzso zzso may have a role as a biologically targeted agent for zzso zzso either as an adjunct to zzso chemotherapy or as a single zzso
