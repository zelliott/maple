zzso zzso zzso has been proposed as a potential zzso zzso However, its mechanism of action is not totally zzso Here, we showed that zzso cell cycle arrest and zzso were associated with an increase of zzso in zzso breast cancer zzso This increase was more important in the zzso as revealed by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso deficient for interaction with zzso but not with zzso deficient for interaction with zzso zzso zzso zzso cell cycle zzso This indicated that cell cycle zzso involved the interaction of zzso with zzso However, zzso was zzso since zzso zzso did not modify cell cycle zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso was abolished by zzso zzso or zzso In addition, zzso decreased zzso levels, but increased the association of zzso with zzso These results suggested that zzso zzso required zzso and its interaction with zzso
