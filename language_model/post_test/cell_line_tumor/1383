zzso zzso are a class of zzso zzso small zzso zzso which suppress its target zzso at the zzso zzso Studies have demonstrated that zzso which is a direct target of the zzso tumor zzso zzso functions as a tumor zzso and is associated with the tumor growth and zzso of various human zzso However, the role of zzso in zzso has not been totally zzso In the present study, the effects of zzso on zzso and the possible mechanism by which zzso affected the tumor growth and zzso of zzso were zzso 

zzso of zzso partially inhibited zzso migration and invasion of zzso cells in zzso as well as the tumor growth and pulmonary zzso of zzso cells in zzso zzso is a target of zzso and regulates the migration and invasion of zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso exhibited a significant decrease in the expression levels of zzso zzso and protein zzso Finally, the results from zzso analysis demonstrated that there were multiple putative targets of zzso that may be associated with the proliferation and zzso of zzso including factors in zzso and zzso signaling zzso 

The results presented in this study demonstrated that zzso of zzso could inhibit the tumor growth and zzso of zzso probably through down regulating zzso And there are other putative zzso target genes beside zzso which could potentially be key players in the development of zzso Since pulmonary zzso are responsible for mortality of patient carrying zzso zzso may prove to be a promising gene therapeutic zzso It will be interesting to further investigate the mechanism by which zzso functions as a tumor zzso gene in zzso
