zzso carbon zzso zzso convert absorbed near infrared zzso light into zzso The use of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of tumor cells is attractive because the penetration of zzso light through normal zzso is optimal and the side effects are zzso zzso zzso zzso with minimal collateral damage can be achieved by using zzso attached to zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the role that the cellular zzso of zzso plays in the subsequent sensitivity of the target cells to zzso zzso zzso remains zzso To address this issue, we used zzso zzso coupled to an zzso or a control zzso and tested their ability to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but not zzso breast cancer cell zzso Using flow zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso we observed the gradual zzso zzso zzso of zzso whereas a control zzso zzso did not bind to the zzso Most importantly, the zzso cells that zzso the zzso were more sensitive to zzso zzso damage than cells that could bind to, but not zzso the zzso These results suggest that both the targeting and zzso of zzso might result in the most effective zzso zzso of tumor cells following their exposure to zzso zzso
