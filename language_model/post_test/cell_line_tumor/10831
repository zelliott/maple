Three stable zzso zzso IX zzso zzso zzso complexes of zzso namely zzso zzso 1, zzso 2 and zzso 3 with distorted zzso structure and zzso ground state have been tested in zzso for zzso activity in a panel of tumor cell zzso The novel zzso complexes showed zzso activity in a zzso manner with zzso values comparable to those of zzso zzso agent zzso together with lower zzso against zzso zzso Further detailed evaluation of the active analogue 2 and the less active complex 3 showed that their potency greatly zzso with the ability to induce zzso and to bind zzso Despite the structural zzso between complex 2 and zzso their zzso were equally effectively recognized and repaired by the zzso zzso repair zzso Complex 2 showed quite superior ability to accumulate in zzso cells relative to zzso
