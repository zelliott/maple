zzso which has a widely acknowledged role in zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso cells, also functions as a tumor zzso The zzso of human zzso contains four potential zzso sites at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We investigated the role of zzso zzso in cell cycle progression by zzso zzso We showed previously that all four potential zzso sites of zzso were zzso in human breast zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso at zzso dramatically affected zzso zzso In this study we showed that zzso zzso missing zzso at zzso zzso and zzso failed to induce cell cycle arrest in zzso phase and to suppress cell proliferation in comparison with zzso zzso Moreover, zzso at zzso and zzso but not at zzso seemed to be indispensable for zzso suppression of cell cycle zzso zzso of zzso at either zzso or zzso of zzso was accompanied with the zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso signaling zzso After treatment with zzso an inhibitor of the zzso zzso protein zzso signaling pathway, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells had equivalent numbers of cells in zzso zzso These findings implied that zzso might be crucial for zzso suppression of cell cycle zzso
