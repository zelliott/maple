The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso is involved in cellular responses relevant to zzso including cell zzso invasion, survival, and zzso zzso zzso is a novel, zzso and selective zzso zzso The objective of this study was to characterize the relationship between zzso plasma zzso and tumor growth zzso in zzso melanoma and zzso colon cancer zzso and to understand the zzso zzso marker response requirements zzso zzso zzso associated with tumor growth zzso in zzso zzso Estimates of zzso plasma zzso required for tumor stasis obtained from fitting tumor data to indirect response models were comparable, at zzso and zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso This was consistent with comparable in zzso potency of zzso in both cell zzso The relationship between zzso plasma zzso and zzso zzso in the tumor was characterized in zzso zzso after oral doses of 35, 50, and 100 zzso Fitting zzso zzso to an indirect response model provided an zzso estimate of zzso zzso zzso zzso was further linked to zzso tumor volume data from nine different zzso dosing regimens using an integrated zzso zzso A simulated zzso marker response curve plot of K zzso constant describing tumor growth zzso versus zzso zzso generated using zzso parameters estimated from this model, showed a steep zzso zzso curve consistent with an estimated Hill zzso of approximately equal zzso A threshold of zzso zzso zzso is required for tumor growth zzso and a minimum of approximately zzso zzso zzso is required for stasis in zzso zzso treated with zzso
