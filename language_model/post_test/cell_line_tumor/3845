The development of protocols for the ex zzso generation of zzso cells zzso has led to intensive research into their potential use in zzso in the treatment of zzso In this study, we examined the efficacy of zzso zzso cell fusion hybrid vaccines in zzso an immune response against Lewis lung zzso zzso cells, as compared to other types of tumor zzso In addition, we also tested whether the efficacy of the vaccines was affected by the route of zzso Four different tumor vaccines were zzso zzso HC zzso zzso consisting of zzso hybrids; zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso DC without zzso zzso zzso LLC zzso tumor zzso We also compared four different routes of administration for each zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso therapy combined with adoptive zzso zzso immunity was assessed in zzso and the zzso zzso T zzso response as well as the expression of key zzso zzso and zzso were further evaluated using in zzso zzso 

Our data demonstrate that vaccination with HC hybrids provides more effective zzso protective immunity and significantly greater therapeutic immunity than vaccination with zzso DC or zzso Most zzso vaccination therapy with HC hybrids was more successful than combination zzso therapy for the induction of zzso zzso zzso harvested from mice zzso with HC hybrids demonstrated the greatest zzso T zzso zzso activity and their production of zzso was high, while their production of zzso was very zzso 

Our results suggest that vaccination therapy with zzso cell fusion hybrids provides more effective protection against lung zzso
