The study investigated the effects of zzso zzso and their combination on human zzso cancer zzso 

Six human zzso cancer cells were exposed to zzso zzso and their zzso zzso effects were measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso were studied by real-time zzso and DNA sequence zzso zzso interaction was studied using the combination index zzso Cell cycle distribution and zzso were determined by flow zzso zzso zzso was performed to assess the effects of drugs on zzso activity, and Western zzso was performed to assess the protein expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Six zzso cancer cells are all sensitive to zzso and zzso gene expression of cells was zzso related to zzso zzso The zzso zzso was observed in concurrent zzso combined with zzso and sequential zzso followed by zzso The combination of zzso and zzso modulated cell cycle and induced zzso zzso combined with zzso decreased zzso zzso expression and in zzso zzso zzso induced an zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso pathway, which was inhibited by zzso 

zzso is a promising agent, and zzso combined with zzso has a significantly synergistic effect on zzso cancer cells, which seems to present a strategy of zzso combined with zzso in zzso cancer zzso
