In the present work we examined the status of zzso organizing regions of zzso zzso zzso in hybrid cells obtained by fusion of the mouse zzso cells zzso and adult mouse zzso upon zzso of hybrid cells under different zzso We have shown that extended zzso of hybrid cells in medium supplemented with zzso zzso zzso zzso promotes the maintenance of zzso whereas under zzso conditions elimination of zzso zzso In zzso medium the number of active, zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso comparatively to that observed under selective zzso This observation directly indicates that zzso of the parental cell zzso in hybrid cells includes changes in the status of zzso zzso The number of active zzso depends on conditions of hybrid cells zzso and may be changed by either of the two major zzso elimination of zzso (under zzso zzso or by zzso of some zzso when the general number of zzso remains zzso (under selective zzso
