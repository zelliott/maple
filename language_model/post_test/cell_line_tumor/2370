zzso zzso has been a subject of research interest due to its potential multiple therapeutic zzso This study was to examine the distribution of zzso zzso zzso A and their zzso zzso in zzso zzso small zzso zzso liver, zzso zzso and prostate zzso and in pancreatic tumor in a zzso animal zzso In addition, we examined zzso stability of zzso in these zzso 

A mouse zzso model was prepared by injection of 3 zzso 10 human pancreatic cancer zzso cells zzso into nude zzso Mice were randomly allocated to control diet zzso and zzso zzso zzso diet zzso zzso 8 per zzso for 13 zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso A, and their zzso in mouse zzso were measured by zzso liquid zzso after zzso zzso and then zzso 

A substantial amount of zzso zzso was zzso to zzso A and its zzso in various zzso during zzso Whereas plasma contained predominantly zzso of zzso zzso and zzso A, both zzso and zzso were found in all other zzso investigated and in zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso zzso are found in target zzso suggesting strong potential for zzso zzso use as a preventive or zzso supplement for pancreatic zzso
