Recent reports indicate the existence of breast cancer cells expressing very high levels of the zzso zzso zzso a ubiquitous zzso zzso best known for zzso toxic action of zzso and related zzso Positive correlation between the degree of zzso zzso and states of increasing transformation of zzso zzso cells appears to occur in the absence of any zzso zzso zzso These observations have raised many questions such as why and how zzso is zzso in breast cancer and its zzso roles in the progression to advanced zzso zzso To address those questions, we hypothesized that zzso zzso occurs in cells experiencing deficiencies in normally required zzso zzso zzso zzso and the basic role of zzso in such cases is to guide the affected cells to develop orchestrated cellular changes aimed at substituting the normal functions of zzso At the same time, the zzso serves as the zzso of the cell survival program in the absence of zzso zzso 

We subjected two lines of Michigan Cancer Foundation zzso zzso zzso cells to 3 different types zzso interacting agents for a number of passages and followed the changes in the expression of zzso zzso The resulting zzso were analyzed for zzso changes and unique molecular zzso 

zzso cells continuously exposed to zzso zzso developed zzso that show zzso zzso with the characteristic zzso of increased zzso and distinct resistance to zzso When these chemically selected cell lines were treated with a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso both of the above abnormal cellular characteristics disappeared, indicating the pivotal role of zzso in expressing those cellular zzso The most prominent molecular characteristics of these zzso zzso zzso cells were found to be zzso of zzso and zzso Furthermore, we could demonstrate that suppression of zzso functions through zzso zzso or zzso causes the recovery of zzso zzso 

One of the main causes for zzso zzso in these zzso breast cancer cells appears to be the loss of zzso zzso This phenomenon is likely to be based on the mutually zzso relationship between zzso and zzso
