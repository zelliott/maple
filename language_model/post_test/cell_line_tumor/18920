zzso large zzso zzso zzso consists of at least 2 zzso zzso that is, the zzso center zzso zzso and the activated zzso zzso zzso It has been shown that zzso responds favorably to chemotherapy and expresses high levels of zzso a zzso zzso known to play a zzso role in zzso In comparison, zzso has lower levels of zzso zzso activated nuclear zzso and tends to be zzso to zzso Here, we report that the zzso gene is a zzso target of zzso As a result, high-level zzso expression and zzso are zzso detected in zzso and zzso normal zzso center B zzso Most importantly, zzso zzso by either zzso or small interference zzso in zzso cells zzso cell proliferation and triggers zzso These zzso are accompanied by decreased expression of several known zzso target zzso including zzso zzso and zzso and increased expression of the zzso cycle inhibitor zzso In addition to identifying zzso as a novel zzso target zzso our results define a second zzso pathway, zzso zzso which operates in zzso suggesting that zzso may be a new therapeutic target in these aggressive zzso
