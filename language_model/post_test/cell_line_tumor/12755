zzso zzso zzso zzso is clinically important for the metabolism of many therapeutic zzso zzso has two main point zzso sites leading to low zzso zzso Several zzso zzso are also important for the metabolism of chemical zzso and several studies have reported associations between zzso zzso and cancer zzso zzso on a potential association between zzso zzso and cancer zzso we conducted this study in two zzso Cell lines of various zzso zzso were screened in the first zzso A clinical investigation was then conducted to confirm the association with the candidate cancer in the second zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso was investigated in a total of 114 cell lines of five zzso zzso Based on this screening investigation suggesting an association with zzso tract cancer, we conducted a related study by recruiting 65 patients with zzso tract cancer and zzso patients with benign diseases as zzso 

Among the 114 cell lines investigated, zzso tract cancer was suggested to be most strongly associated with poor zzso of zzso Among 65 patients with zzso tract cancer, 18 zzso were poor zzso of zzso whereas 87 zzso of zzso control patients were poor zzso The zzso and zzso odds ratios for intermediate and poor zzso regarding the risk of zzso tract cancer were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso compared to extensive zzso 

A genetic zzso of zzso is associated with zzso to zzso tract zzso
