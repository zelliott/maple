The zzso caused by the viral delivery of pancreatic zzso zzso gene 1 zzso to the zzso liver limits its zzso We aimed to evaluate the feasibility of zzso zzso zzso with zzso in improving zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with the zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso delivery of zzso or zzso in zzso induced diabetic mice was achieved by zzso The sequential serum zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso On the zzso day after zzso the zzso efficiency in the zzso cells and the mice zzso was zzso and zzso zzso zzso At 1 zzso after zzso asides from zzso expression of insulin, the diabetic mice zzso with zzso had a significantly lower sugar zzso zzso zzso zzso 413 zzso 62 zzso p zzso zzso level than those zzso with zzso however, the difference diminished zzso No significant difference in the zzso levels was observed between the 2 zzso No mortality was noted in the mice zzso with zzso The zzso effect of zzso delivered by zzso was transient and associated with negligible zzso In studies on the short-term biological effects of zzso in zzso zzso is a potential alternative to viral delivery of zzso to the zzso zzso
