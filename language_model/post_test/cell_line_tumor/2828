zzso cell migration and zzso share many similarities with zzso trafficking, which is critically regulated by zzso and their zzso zzso is the most widely expressed zzso zzso in many different types of cancer and has been linked to tumor dissemination and poor zzso Several zzso zzso have been zzso A totally novel approach to discover zzso zzso zzso is the use of zzso zzso produce zzso zzso zzso to prevent zzso zzso and migration toward the infection site to escape clearance by innate immune zzso The aim of the current study was to find and identify the mechanism of a bacterial protein that specifically targets zzso a zzso zzso shared by zzso and cancer zzso 

Several zzso proteins were screened for their capacity to prevent binding of a zzso zzso against zzso 

zzso zzso 10 was found to bind zzso expressed on human T acute zzso zzso lymphoma, and cervical zzso cell zzso It zzso inhibited zzso calcium zzso and cell zzso 

zzso zzso 10 is a potential lead in the development of new zzso compounds preventing zzso by targeting zzso
