Loss of zzso protein expression is associated with shorter recurrence-free survival in breast zzso patients and increased zzso in zzso cell zzso Based on sequence analysis of zzso we identified 14 zzso fragments and investigated their ability to mimic the effects of zzso on zzso cell zzso and zzso Two of these peptides significantly increased zzso and impaired migration in the zzso zzso breast zzso cell line and in the zzso breast cancer cell line, both of which show little zzso expression of the zzso zzso We removed two zzso acids at a time from the N zzso of the shorter of these two peptides to identify the shortest zzso that still inhibited zzso The influence on tumor cell zzso was gradually lost and was no longer zzso when only six zzso acids zzso However, zzso of the zzso zzso of this zzso restored its effect on zzso and reduced tumor cell zzso via a zzso zzso zzso even at a low pH such as encountered in breast tumor zzso This zzso zzso zzso induced a rapid zzso calcium zzso whereas it did not affect the cellular levels of zzso zzso or active zzso The novel zzso zzso zzso is not only a valuable experimental tool but has also a potential role in zzso treatment of the 50% of human breast cancer patients that have reduced zzso zzso protein zzso
