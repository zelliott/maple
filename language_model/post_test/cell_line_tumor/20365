zzso zzso is responsible for zzso of zzso deaths and highly zzso zzso are more prone to form zzso zzso and acquire the drug zzso Here, a zzso system zzso has been constructed by modification of stealth zzso with a zzso cancer specific zzso using the unmodified stealth zzso zzso as the zzso The active targeted zzso presented satisfactory particle size (about 100 zzso and drug release characteristics in zzso zzso zzso cancer cells zzso and zzso and zzso cancer cells zzso were applied as tumor cell zzso The highly zzso cancer cells were found to zzso more zzso in a faster way than zzso through a zzso zzso proved by specific zzso zzso zzso technique indicated the integrity of zzso in zzso The significant targeting of zzso to highly zzso tumors was demonstrated in zzso and ex zzso in an zzso model as well as in a double zzso animal model with both zzso and zzso tumors in the same zzso zzso the active targeted drug delivery system was found to penetrate deeper into tumor mass and have a longer retention within the zzso zzso Further, zzso greatly facilitated the efficacy of zzso loaded in terms of zzso zzso tumor growth and inducing cancer cell zzso with only minor side zzso Together, the specific zzso hold great potential in the development of zzso for diagnosis and therapy of zzso zzso
