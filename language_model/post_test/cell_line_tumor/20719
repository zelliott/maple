The present study was conducted to evaluate in zzso zzso activity of two novel zzso zzso compounds, namely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso mice and in zzso zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso cell lines and zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso and BLT zzso shrimp zzso zzso zzso The test zzso compounds at the doses 2 and 4 zzso body weight showed promising biological activity, especially in decreasing tumor volume, viable zzso cell counts and body zzso These compounds prolonged the life span zzso zzso mean survival time zzso of mice zzso zzso The results for in zzso zzso against zzso cells showed the zzso compound zzso to have significant zzso activity with a zzso value of zzso zzso than zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and the zzso values of zzso and zzso compounds were found to be zzso and zzso zzso respectively in the BLT zzso The zzso and zzso results revealed that there was no significant zzso and zzso associated with the zzso administration to zzso
