zzso of zzso zzso interaction with rat brain membrane fragments was studied at 25 degrees C and at zzso zzso from 2 to 250 zzso At least two different ways of zzso interaction with the zzso were distinguished on the basis of zzso zzso zzso the binding sites characterized by zzso zzso can be zzso zzso the zzso binding sites were zzso identified and zzso As in both cases the bound zzso could be displaced by excess of zzso all these binding sites can be defined as zzso zzso In the zzso binding sites zzso of the zzso complex was observed, as is typical for interaction of zzso with zzso coupled zzso and the kinetic parameters for this interaction were similar with the appropriate data for the zzso receptors expressed in zzso zzso cells Therefore these sites could be assigned to the same zzso zzso in brain zzso while the zzso binding sites belong to other zzso zzso also interacting with zzso and its zzso The kinetic properties of the latter sites were not zzso in zzso
