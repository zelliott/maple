zzso zzso or deletion of the zzso and zzso zzso deleted on zzso 10 zzso gene in human cancer cells leads to a zzso active status of the zzso zzso zzso in the cells and has been linked to the lack of responses of the cells to the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso is strongly inhibited by zzso an orally active zzso currently being evaluated as an zzso agent in phase 1 and 2 clinical zzso To determine whether zzso may enhance the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cancer cells, we exposed zzso breast cancer cells (which contain zzso zzso zzso and zzso prostate cancer cells (in which the zzso gene is zzso to zzso and zzso alone and in zzso Treatment of the cells with zzso reduced baseline levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso and increased baseline levels of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso exposure of the zzso and zzso cells to zzso alone resulted in cell death in a zzso manner, which was enhanced by zzso zzso of zzso doses of zzso to zzso treatment also enhanced the zzso growth zzso The combination treatment enhanced the zzso of zzso of zzso zzso and zzso but offset the zzso of zzso that was activated by zzso treatment zzso Taken together, the data showed that zzso enhances the zzso activity of zzso in zzso cancer zzso Further evaluation of the combination treatment in zzso and clinical studies is zzso
