zzso and zzso zzso factors zzso have well-established roles in regulating cellular responses to zzso and zzso zzso Recent reports have linked these two protein families by demonstrating that zzso can regulate the activity of zzso and zzso Here we investigated the role of zzso a zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso activity in hypoxic zzso Our results show that in zzso zzso zzso cell lines, zzso did not alter zzso zzso or protein zzso whereas it predictably led to the zzso of zzso and the zzso of its target zzso In hypoxic models in zzso and in in zzso models of systemic zzso and zzso tumor growth, zzso of zzso protein with zzso or zzso of its activity with small zzso zzso impaired the zzso of zzso protein and the zzso increase of its target zzso In addition, zzso zzso and zzso proteins zzso and loss of zzso activity led to a zzso of zzso Taken together, our data suggest that zzso and zzso proteins interact in zzso cells and that zzso is a target of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso is necessary for zzso protein zzso and zzso of zzso target genes under hypoxic zzso
