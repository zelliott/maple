zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the mechanisms used by zzso cells to escape immune zzso Previously, we have shown that expression of zzso zzso and zzso respectively, renders zzso cells resistant to zzso B zzso death and zzso M zzso zzso To obtain better insight into the interaction between zzso and their target zzso we investigated the roles of zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso in the resistance to zzso and zzso death in further zzso Neither human zzso nor its zzso zzso zzso was capable of preventing zzso zzso in zzso or human cells, indicating that these zzso do not inhibit the zzso of zzso zzso in this zzso High expression of zzso or zzso did prevent zzso induced by human zzso zzso only zzso and not zzso was capable of zzso zzso zzso suggesting that a difference in zzso specificity exists between the mouse and the human zzso In agreement with this zzso zzso zzso was clearly less effective in inducing zzso in human zzso Similar species specificity was also observed for zzso and zzso when either their capacity to associate or the effectiveness of zzso zzso was zzso Our findings therefore indicate a species diversity that has a clear effect on mixed in zzso zzso target zzso
