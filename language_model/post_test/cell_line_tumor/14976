Treatment of rat brain zzso zzso cells with zzso fatty acid zzso prior to exposure to hydrogen zzso shows a strong protective effect of zzso against cell death resulting from zzso zzso This protective effect is obtained only for zzso administered as a free fatty acid and with an intact zzso zzso It is proposed that brain cells are rescued by zzso scavenging zzso zzso by zzso zzso within the cell zzso zzso processes outside the cell zzso such as protein zzso are not affected by zzso zzso fatty acids such as those present in fish oils and marine organisms are likely beneficial for consumption in reducing the risk of diseases that have been implicated to arise from zzso stress, such as Alzheimer's zzso
