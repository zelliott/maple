The DNA zzso inhibitor zzso zzso possesses zzso and zzso activities in various cancer zzso However, the zzso mechanisms underlying zzso zzso of zzso and zzso have not been thoroughly zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of zzso on the correlation between tightening of tight junctions zzso and zzso activity in zzso human gastric cancer zzso Our data indicated that the zzso effects of zzso on cell zzso and zzso were associated with increased tightness of the zzso which was demonstrated by an increase in zzso electrical resistance zzso zzso results indicated that zzso zzso the levels of the zzso zzso major components of zzso that play a key role in the control and selectivity of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso and -9 activity in the zzso cells was zzso inhibited by treatment with zzso and this was correlated with a decrease in zzso and protein zzso In addition, these effects were related to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso In conclusion, this study suggests that zzso and zzso are critical targets of zzso zzso of zzso in zzso human gastric cancer zzso
