It is important to identify the multiple sites of zzso activity in obese women with breast zzso In this study, we examined the effect of zzso human zzso on heat shock protein 70 zzso expression in zzso human breast cancer cells and in a breast zzso zzso model of nude zzso 

We cultured zzso human breast cancer cells and established nude mice bearing zzso of these cells, and randomly divided them into experimental and control zzso The experimental group was treated with human zzso while the control group was treated with the same volume of normal zzso A real-time reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso was developed to zzso the zzso expression of zzso in the zzso human breast cancer cells and in tumor zzso Western zzso analysis was applied to zzso the protein expression of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was done to assess the positive rate of zzso expression in the tumor zzso 

zzso activated zzso in a zzso manner in zzso zzso zzso significantly the expression of zzso at zzso and protein levels in zzso human breast cancer cells zzso zzso zzso There was no significant difference in expression of zzso zzso in the implanted tumors between the zzso group and the control group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed no significant difference in tumor zzso expression between the zzso group and the control group zzso zzso zzso 

A nude mouse zzso model can be safely and efficiently treated with human zzso by subcutaneous injections around the zzso zzso may be target of zzso in breast zzso zzso can significantly zzso the expression of zzso in a zzso manner in zzso
