zzso zzso actions of zzso have previously been shown for zzso cells from man, but much less is known in relation to zzso zzso Here, we report that mouse zzso zzso irrespective of their zzso zzso inhibit the proliferation of mouse zzso cell zzso The zzso activity was zzso by both zzso and zzso mouse zzso but not by mouse zzso zzso and zzso Growth of zzso cells was significantly inhibited during the zzso days of zzso growth, followed by a subsequent recovery of cell numbers prior to the stationary zzso We demonstrated that zzso binds to zzso cells, stimulates tumor necrosis factor zzso production and zzso zzso which is not dependent on NO or zzso We also demonstrated that zzso in zzso with zzso induced zzso production and zzso of zzso mouse zzso zzso Thus, the in zzso actions of zzso described may also play a regulatory role for mouse zzso in zzso
