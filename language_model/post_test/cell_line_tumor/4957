The role of zzso virus zzso in the zzso of breast cancer has been of long-standing interest to the zzso Breast zzso cells can be infected by zzso through direct contact with zzso zzso cells, and zzso infection has recently been shown to zzso breast cancer cells an increased resistance to zzso zzso In this study, we established zzso breast cancer zzso and zzso cells and demonstrated that zzso infection promotes zzso activity of breast cancer zzso zzso we showed that the zzso zzso and zzso cells exhibited increased zzso growth in soft zzso The increased colony formation capacity in soft zzso was associated with increased expression and zzso of zzso signaling zzso as evidenced by the findings that the treatment of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso inhibitor completely abolished the zzso zzso In the zzso breast cancer cells, the expression of zzso zzso genes including zzso zzso and zzso was zzso We next showed that zzso alone was sufficient to efficiently zzso zzso expression and promoted zzso activity in zzso and zzso cells by the use of both zzso and small interfering zzso zzso zzso we demonstrated that zzso zzso promotes the zzso activity of breast cancer cells through zzso of zzso signaling zzso
