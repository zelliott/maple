Cell zzso is vital in many zzso and pathological zzso such as zzso zzso wound healing, and zzso However, the time-consuming step in the evaluation of individual cell zzso is the analysis of hundreds of recorded images of cell cultures in general consisting of retrieving images, one at a time, and marking the positions of individual cells by a computer zzso zzso the aim of the present study was to develop a novel automatic procedure for the evaluation of cell zzso 

The procedure was tested on zzso and zzso and zzso cells engineered to express the green fluorescent protein by either transient zzso or zzso zzso allowing automatic recognition of cell coordinates on retrieved zzso 

The effects of serum growth factors, zzso compounds, and zzso of zzso factors on the zzso behavior of cultured cells were zzso Cell zzso was estimated by both manual and automatic marking of cell position and subsequently zzso parameters were zzso The results obtained by the two procedures were found to correlate zzso 

We developed a procedure allowing automatic video recording of sparsely seeded cells zzso with a zzso or zzso with a zzso virus expressing the enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso
