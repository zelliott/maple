To study the feasibility of zzso tumor cells zzso zzso zzso cells zzso in the zzso of tumor prevention via zzso test zzso 

Forty rats were randomly divided into 2 groups: experimental and control zzso Ten rats from each group were killed and zzso were isolated and zzso zzso zzso of in the study group, zzso zzso cancer cells of the line zzso were zzso zzso zzso were added at day zzso Two groups zzso with T zzso from the other zzso zzso on the 14th zzso Then observed the shape of zzso contrasted the proliferation and killing zzso 

In the study group, zzso could significantly stimulate T zzso zzso and produce tumor specific zzso T zzso zzso When the ratios of stimulating cells zzso to reaction cells zzso were zzso zzso 1:30 and zzso the stimulating index zzso in the study group were much higher than those in control group ( zzso When the ratios of SC is the same with zzso zzso zzso zzso the killing and wounding rate to tumor cells of study group zzso zzso zzso is significantly higher than those of control group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

DC could activate T zzso proliferation and produce zzso to kill and wound tumor cells zzso
