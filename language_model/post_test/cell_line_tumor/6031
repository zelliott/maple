We performed a zzso relationship zzso study of a novel aspirin zzso zzso which shows strong zzso activity in zzso and in zzso A series of zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and their zzso activity against human colon zzso and zzso and pancreatic zzso and zzso zzso cancer cell lines was zzso The zzso that we studied largely comprise organic zzso zzso bearing an zzso or zzso group zzso at the zzso or zzso position of the zzso ring and one of four different leaving zzso The nature of the zzso function, the leaving group, and the additional zzso affecting the electron density of the zzso ring, all were influential zzso of the zzso activity on cancer cell growth for each zzso zzso zzso also played a significant role in this zzso The mechanism of action of these compounds appears consistent with the notion that they generate either a zzso zzso or an zzso zzso (or an zzso zzso which then zzso with a zzso zzso their biological zzso Our zzso study provides an insight into the biological properties of this novel class of compounds and underscores their potential as zzso zzso
