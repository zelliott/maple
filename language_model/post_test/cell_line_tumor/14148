To explore novel cancer gene therapy by zzso zzso technique to suppress the zzso zzso zzso expression in colon zzso zzso zzso 

zzso information of zzso zzso was selected and two complementary zzso with hairpin loop were zzso zzso zzso expression zzso zzso was then constructed and zzso into the zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein expression was zzso determined by Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The construction of zzso zzso was successful and confirmed by restriction zzso analysis and DNA zzso The zzso level of zzso protein expressions was greatly reduced in zzso cells zzso with zzso as compared with those of zzso cells and the zzso control zzso zzso zzso 

zzso protein expression in zzso cell line can be suppressed using zzso zzso zzso zzso This approach may provide a novel gene therapy against zzso zzso
