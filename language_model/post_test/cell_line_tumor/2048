Despite advances in treatment and outcomes for patients with pediatric acute zzso leukemia zzso there continue to be zzso of patients who are zzso to standard chemotherapy and zzso stem cell zzso zzso novel gene targets for therapy are needed to further advance treatment for this zzso zzso interference technology has identified zzso as a potential therapeutic zzso zzso a member of the inhibitor of zzso zzso proteins and zzso passenger complex, is expressed in zzso zzso and zzso in relapsed pediatric zzso Our studies show that zzso is zzso expressed at high levels in multiple pediatric ALL cell zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso expression in pediatric ALL cell lines as well as primary zzso blasts reduces viability of these zzso This includes cell lines derived from patients with relapsed disease featuring zzso anomalies such as zzso Philadelphia zzso zzso zzso as well as a cell line carrying zzso from a patient with de zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso increases zzso zzso that can be rescued by zzso of zzso Finally, a screen of randomly selected primary patient samples confirms that zzso small interfering zzso and zzso drug, zzso effectively reduce viability of zzso zzso
