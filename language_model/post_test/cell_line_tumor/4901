The study was aimed to investigate the mechanism of proliferation zzso and zzso of zzso zzso cells induced by zzso zzso the cell proliferation was determined by zzso zzso zzso rate was determined with zzso double zzso and cell cycle was analyzed by flow zzso zzso after zzso cells were treated with different zzso of zzso the changes of zzso features of zzso cells were observed with zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined by Beckman zzso and zzso gel zzso was used to verify whether zzso can induce zzso of zzso zzso The results showed that zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso cells in a zzso zzso manner and caused a sustained arrest at zzso phase in zzso zzso the typical zzso zzso features appeared in zzso zzso the production of zzso zzso was zzso and the marked DNA zzso pattern of zzso fragmentation was zzso It is concluded that the mechanism of proliferation zzso and zzso of zzso cells induced by zzso is probably related with the zzso cell cycle zzso zzso may be a potentially zzso zzso drug useful to treat zzso zzso
