The zzso zzso zzso is a commonly used proliferation marker in research and zzso It has been recognized that the protein exists in two different zzso zzso that differ in one zzso In the current work, we present three new zzso zzso of human zzso consisting of two naturally occurring zzso and one zzso zzso Additionally, data is presented indicating that alternative zzso of the zzso zzso is common in tumor cell zzso zzso 93 zzso mainly consisting of brain tumor zzso we found evidence that long and short zzso can be expressed independently of each zzso zzso of zzso in human peripheral blood zzso cells revealed that short zzso appears earlier in the cell cycle than the long zzso and reaches its expression maximum when zzso of the latter sets zzso Finally, zzso of zzso culture cells with zzso 7 zzso for the long zzso zzso and not present in the short zzso in a zzso regulated expression system decreased the rate of cell proliferation without affecting the cell zzso In zzso we present evidence that the zzso zzso is zzso spliced resulting in at least five different zzso with different zzso
