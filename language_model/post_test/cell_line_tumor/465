zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso has been demonstrated to interact with multiple proteins involved in several zzso pathways such as DNA replication and zzso However, there have been fewer reports about whether these zzso proteins influence stability of zzso Here, we observed a physical interaction between zzso and zzso zzso zzso a new member of the zzso proteins that zzso zzso zzso zzso In several zzso human cancer cell lines and in normal human zzso cells, zzso and zzso formed a complex and their mutual binding fragments were zzso It was intriguing that zzso and zzso were zzso dependent on zzso of zzso which in turn induced degradation of zzso in response to zzso zzso but not in response to other forms of zzso zzso To further explore the link between zzso of zzso and degradation of zzso zzso against zzso was performed to mimic the zzso status of zzso to evaluate changes in the zzso of zzso zzso of zzso significantly promoted degradation of zzso suggesting that the zzso interaction of zzso may zzso protection from degradation for zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation by inducing zzso of zzso Moreover, secondary to degradation of zzso zzso zzso of DNA synthesis or cell cycle progression was zzso zzso our data demonstrate for the first time that zzso is protected by this newly identified partner zzso zzso which is related to DNA synthesis and cell cycle zzso
