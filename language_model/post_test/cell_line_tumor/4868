To investigate the zzso effects of zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso on colon zzso zzso cells in zzso and in zzso and their side zzso 

zzso cells were cultured with zzso zzso zzso The single or combined effects of zzso and zzso on zzso cells were examined by zzso zzso flow zzso The combined effects were evaluated by the zzso zzso The model of zzso zzso was established in nude zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 12 zzso either in combination or on their own, were injected into mice and the zzso effects and side effects were zzso 

zzso and zzso either combined or alone inhibited significantly the proliferation of zzso cells and induced obvious zzso Mean zzso growth zzso rate reached zzso zzso and the zzso rate at 48 h reached zzso zzso The combined effects were synergistic zzso at lower zzso zzso or zzso alone inhibited significantly the growth of zzso zzso and the zzso rates were zzso and zzso the drugs combined had more significant effect, the zzso zzso rate reaching zzso During the course of chemotherapy, no obvious side effect was zzso 

The combined effects of zzso and zzso on the growth of colon zzso in zzso and in zzso were superior to the effects when the agents were used zzso zzso combined with zzso had synergistic effects at lower zzso and promoted zzso but did not increase the side effects of zzso
