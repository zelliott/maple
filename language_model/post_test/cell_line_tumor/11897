The active copy of the imprinted gene zzso is turned off by inappropriate zzso in several pediatric tumors including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso controls in zzso the linked zzso Growth Factor 2 zzso zzso zzso an important growth zzso Recent work has suggested that zzso of a gene may lead to zzso of its associated zzso and that silenced genes can be zzso by increasing zzso zzso zzso 

Treatment of a zzso cell line which has a silent, zzso zzso gene with zzso zzso zzso zzso under conditions which gave zzso zzso of zzso 4, both globally and at the zzso gene itself could not reactivate zzso or affect the active zzso Growth Factor 2 zzso zzso but caused clear zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso gene known to respond to changes in zzso zzso In contrast, mild treatment of the cells with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso on its own was able to reactivate zzso Combining zzso treatment with zzso zzso gave a reduced rather than enhanced zzso These findings were confirmed in mouse primary liver and kidney zzso which maintain normal zzso where we also found that the silent zzso gene could not be zzso by zzso zzso 

These results suggest that DNA zzso rather than zzso zzso is the primary zzso of zzso of zzso in zzso
