Currently, zzso is approved as the zzso therapy for patients with locally advanced or zzso pancreatic zzso Unfortunately, because of pre-existing or acquired zzso of most of the tumor cells, zzso has failed to significantly improve the outcome for pancreatic zzso zzso The present study explored the possibility of zzso pancreatic cancer to zzso chemotherapy by combining the chemotherapy with the zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We designed two zzso zzso zzso using the human zzso reverse zzso zzso promoter for zzso zzso zzso Our data showed that treatment with the zzso systems resulted in high-level expression of zzso and TRAIL genes directly related to zzso zzso leading to a significant zzso of resistant pancreatic tumor zzso Furthermore, treatment with zzso and TRAIL zzso plus a zzso dose of zzso resulted in significant tumor zzso and zzso of the experimental zzso life, in contrast to the weak zzso in tumor growth observed when zzso alone was zzso Additionally, using an zzso tumor model, we showed the usefulness of a zzso zzso optical imaging for real-time evaluation of therapeutic zzso Together, these findings suggest that zzso zzso gene expression in combination with zzso may be a potential therapeutic strategy for treatment of pancreatic zzso
