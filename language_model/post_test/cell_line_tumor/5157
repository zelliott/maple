zzso cell zzso zzso represent a substantial clinical problem because of increases, frequent zzso and successive de zzso tumors, especially in organ transplant zzso To improve upon the current surgical and other zzso therapies, a validated zzso in zzso model of primary human SCC needs to be zzso Such a model will have obvious advantages over current cell line and animal based approaches, and may render the latter partly zzso In a first approach, an zzso technique of primary SCC zzso onto zzso zzso was used to emulate tumor expansion in an in zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed the formation of nests of zzso cells, mimicking an invasive zzso feature of primary zzso zzso analysis comprised an array of markers characteristic of zzso zzso proliferation zzso zzso zzso and zzso differentiation zzso zzso and zzso basement membrane zzso types IV and zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and SCC zzso zzso and zzso The generated human SCC models displayed disturbed differentiation and zzso associated with zzso but a low frequency of zzso positive zzso zzso membrane composition of the in zzso SCC model resembled that of normal zzso These results show for the first time that in zzso zzso of three-dimensional growth of primary zzso human SCC is zzso This model may provide a platform to develop refined preventive and zzso treatments and thereby gain understanding of SCC zzso
