We investigated the mechanism of human zzso zzso zzso in early diagnosis of zzso The zzso gene of zzso was cloned from the zzso zzso by zzso and expressed as a fused protein in the zzso zzso zzso The expressed zzso was zzso by zzso zzso column and the zzso protein was then used to zzso zzso zzso Three zzso cell lines zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso specific to zzso fusion protein were zzso The specificity and sensitivity of the zzso zzso were assessed by indirect zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso Finally, the zzso zzso expressed by zzso cell line was used to detect the expression of zzso in several tumor cell lines by indirect zzso and the specific zzso was zzso In conclusion, this study successfully constructed the zzso zzso zzso zzso and prepared zzso zzso zzso for further study of the structure and function of the zzso The result may also lay solid foundation for the research of the molecular mechanism of zzso in early diagnosis of zzso
