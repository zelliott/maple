Several lines of evidence indicate that zzso cellular zzso zzso may play a prominent role in synaptic dysfunction and zzso death in Alzheimer's disease zzso suggesting a potential benefit of drugs capable to stabilize zzso zzso We here investigated the effects of a panel of zzso zzso channel zzso on the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which zzso accumulates in the senile plaques of the brain of zzso zzso We found that, in primary and immortalized zzso cells in culture, zzso robustly zzso zzso (up to about zzso at 30 zzso of the highly zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso while leaving largely unaffected total zzso zzso An analogous effect was also observed in zzso as the administration of a single dose of zzso (10 zzso zzso induced a significant rise of zzso levels in plasma of zzso zzso The effect of zzso was independent of zzso of zzso zzso channels and zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso effect was largely zzso as neither depletion nor rise of zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso by showing that the effect of zzso on zzso production is distinct from its ability to block zzso zzso we provide evidence for a previously zzso effect of this long known zzso also used in clinical zzso
