We aimed to assess the zzso activity of zzso in breast zzso zzso The zzso for mechanism and patient zzso were also zzso 

The in zzso and in zzso properties of zzso were zzso The zzso expressions of 40 key zzso zzso genes at baseline or after treatment were analyzed to link with the zzso efficacy of zzso in a panel of breast cancer zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso exhibited activity against tumor cell migration, zzso cell tube formation, and zzso zzso In zzso we observed zzso zzso reduced tumor cell zzso ability, impaired tumor zzso and decreased zzso activity after the treatment of zzso zzso treatment displayed significant zzso activity in 10 of the 18 breast zzso zzso However, the zzso efficacy in most models did not correlate with the in zzso zzso results in the corresponding cell lines, suggesting the critical involvement of tumor zzso during zzso zzso In the tested breast zzso models, the baseline expressions of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso failed to predict the zzso response to zzso whereas several zzso zzso target zzso including zzso zzso and zzso strongly corresponded with the response with a P value less than zzso Many of the best molecular zzso of response were also significantly modulated following zzso zzso 

zzso showed zzso and zzso properties via zzso zzso The zzso zzso downstream genes may be used to predict the zzso activity of zzso and enrich for zzso among breast cancer zzso
