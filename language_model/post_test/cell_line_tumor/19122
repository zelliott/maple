The zzso association between cancer and exposure to ambient air pollution particles zzso with a 50% zzso aerodynamic diameter of 10 zzso zzso has been related to the ability of zzso and its constituent zzso zzso to cause zzso zzso species zzso DNA zzso However, there are no data on the molecular response to these zzso zzso In order to assess whether zzso zzso and zzso DNA damage induce zzso zzso zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso urban dust zzso carbon black zzso zzso CB zzso zzso zzso and zzso coated with zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso breakage of DNA was determined by comet zzso cell cycle status was zzso using flow zzso Nuclear extracts or zzso zzso were used for Western zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso binding protein zzso 1, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso caused both zzso and zzso DNA breaks, while other tested zzso caused only zzso DNA zzso zzso significantly altered cell cycle zzso zzso enhanced zzso after 1 and 6 h zzso and zzso zzso zzso increased zzso expression at 1 h zzso and zzso at zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso and zzso zzso species induce DNA damage, zzso zzso and proteins related to DNA repair, mimicking zzso zzso zzso
