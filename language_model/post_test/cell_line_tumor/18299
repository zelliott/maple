Cancer zzso zzso zzso were initially identified by their ability to elicit zzso zzso immune responses in patients with zzso The zzso genes are widely expressed in a variety of human zzso such as melanoma, breast cancer, lung cancer, zzso cancer, and zzso zzso however, their expression in pediatric brain tumors, such as zzso zzso has not been the subject of in-depth zzso The zzso proteins are members of the zzso family and have been shown to correlate with tumor development, aggressive clinical course, or resistance to zzso zzso The authors undertook this study to examine the expression and role of zzso proteins in human zzso cell lines and zzso 

From a zzso profiling study in which zzso genes in zzso cell lines were zzso the authors identified members of the zzso and zzso families as being highly zzso A series of zzso tumors was examined using both zzso and Western zzso analysis with zzso to the zzso family, zzso and zzso zzso 

Western zzso analysis showed expression of these 3 proteins zzso family, zzso and zzso in 62, 46, and zzso respectively, of zzso specimens zzso In addition, a correlation was observed between the expression of zzso and zzso genes and resistance of zzso cells to zzso zzso The functional significance of this correlation was examined in zzso zzso studies, and increased drug-induced zzso was observed in zzso zzso cells following treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso was found in zzso small interfering zzso cells treated with zzso but not in zzso cells treated with zzso alone at the same zzso 

These data show that zzso and zzso family members are expressed in zzso cell lines and zzso and that zzso of zzso and zzso genes by zzso increases zzso of zzso cells and zzso them to certain zzso agents such as zzso and zzso
