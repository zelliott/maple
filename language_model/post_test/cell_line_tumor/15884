The effects have been determined of a systematic zzso of the zzso chain geometry of a zzso analogue of zzso on the detailed molecular architecture of the resulting zzso zzso formed both in the absence and presence of 50 zzso zzso and of the zzso prepared from these zzso using either calf zzso or zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso studied involved zzso or zzso bonds at positions zzso or zzso and a compound zzso featuring an zzso at position zzso For all of these zzso examination by light scattering and zzso zzso zzso potential zzso and negative zzso electron zzso showed that there were no significant differences in the structures or charges of the zzso or of the resulting zzso regardless of the nature of the DNA zzso zzso were observed, however, between the complexes formed by the various lipids when examining the extent of zzso and release by gel zzso where the zzso appeared to complex the DNA more efficiently than all other lipids zzso Moreover, the zzso prepared from the zzso were the most effective in zzso of zzso breast cancer zzso As indicated through zzso zzso studies, the zzso also showed a higher zzso capacity and a more diffuse cellular distribution, possibly indicating a greater degree of zzso escape and/or nuclear zzso These observations suggest that the extent of zzso is the most important factor in determining the zzso efficiency of the complexes zzso At present it is unclear why the zzso were more effective at zzso DNA, although it is thought that the effective area per zzso occupied by the zzso zzso and zzso head groups, and therefore the density of positive charges on the surface of the zzso most closely matches the negative charge density of the DNA zzso From a consideration of the geometry of the zzso lipids it is anticipated that the head groups of the zzso would occupy a smaller area per zzso than the zzso or zzso
