zzso are key zzso molecules in the development of the nervous zzso They elicit diverse cellular responses such as zzso zzso survival and zzso zzso zzso bind to two different classes of cell surface zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso both of which are expressed by zzso zzso zzso zzso via zzso was shown to promote both survival and differentiation of zzso cells in zzso The expression of certain zzso receptors is considered to be a zzso zzso The zzso zzso is the founding member of the zzso family, which is best known for its function in the induction of zzso Its function in zzso is thus far poorly zzso We zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso cells by surface zzso zzso and applied zzso nerve growth factor zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso and zzso to these cell lines assessing their survival and proliferation in long-term zzso lasting 6 zzso zzso increased proliferation of zzso zzso cells, which express zzso but no zzso receptors on their zzso On the other hand, zzso cell proliferation was decreased after zzso treatment, even though these cells also express zzso but no zzso receptors on their zzso Interestingly, zzso proteins zzso and zzso as well as chemical zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso slowed down the proliferation of both cell lines in medium containing zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso zzso has diverse effects on zzso depending on the specific zzso zzso In addition, our studies point towards zzso or zzso zzso bodies as useful tools to influence the survival of zzso zzso
