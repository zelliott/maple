zzso zzso is a phenomenon in which cells previously exposed to zzso exhibit protection against subsequent noxious zzso We zzso that zzso may cause subtle protein zzso that persists at a zzso level, stimulating zzso zzso Human zzso cells zzso were exposed to zzso followed by quantitative analysis of the expression of several families of heat shock genes zzso total zzso Our data is consistent with a model of an early and delayed phase of zzso Different patterns of expression of the 84 genes were seen at 1 and zzso zzso zzso zzso of 45 of the 84 genes were elevated at zzso (or early zzso and remained zzso at zzso (or delayed zzso zzso of the remaining genes were either unchanged (13 zzso zzso zzso (17 zzso or zzso zzso (9 zzso We also demonstrated that zzso caused a slight yet zzso zzso of a model zzso These data indicate that brief zzso exposure promotes specific patterns of gene zzso leading to zzso which would enhance the cell's ability to tolerate a future injury that involves protein zzso
