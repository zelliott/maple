The aim of this study was to establish an zzso zzso model with high zzso of gastric cancer to the zzso which is more faithful to clinical zzso A human gastric zzso cell line, zzso was injected as a zzso suspension into the stomach of nude zzso The cells from some zzso zzso zzso were expanded in zzso and subsequently implanted to the stomach wall of nude zzso By repeating the in zzso zzso selection method for four rounds and cloning culture, we obtained a cell line designated zzso which developed zzso zzso in 13 of 13 zzso of mice, compared with only zzso of those implanted with parental zzso The zzso zzso in the zzso showed essentially the same zzso appearance as those induced by parental zzso zzso cell growth of zzso in zzso was faster than that of zzso zzso zzso demonstrated higher zzso of zzso than of zzso The adhesive ability of zzso cells to zzso was lower than that of zzso cells, whereas the ability of zzso cells to adhere to zzso was significantly higher than that of parental zzso zzso between zzso and their parental zzso cells were found in expression levels of various molecules by flow zzso and western zzso The findings indicated that zzso in the expressions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso in the expressions of zzso and zzso play an important role in the zzso zzso of human gastric zzso zzso The zzso cell line appears to be useful for investigating the mechanisms of zzso zzso and preventing zzso zzso of human gastric zzso
