zzso growth zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso and critical zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for zzso transformation and zzso These observations have spurred zzso drug discovery and development efforts for both biological and zzso zzso zzso The ability for one zzso to compensate for another to maintain tumor cell viability is emerging as a common resistance mechanism to zzso agents targeting individual zzso As zzso is structurally and functionally related to the insulin zzso zzso we asked whether zzso is zzso and whether zzso signaling contributes to resistance to zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso are zzso in a mouse zzso tumor zzso In human tumor cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso cross talk was observed following either zzso of zzso expression or treatment with a selective zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment resulted in a zzso increase in zzso which was associated with resistance to zzso of zzso and zzso In contrast, treatment with zzso a zzso dual inhibitor of zzso resulted in enhanced reduction in zzso relative to zzso zzso or zzso activated the zzso zzso and decreased sensitivity to zzso but not to zzso In tumor cells with an zzso zzso loop, both zzso and an zzso zzso reduced zzso whereas zzso was zzso Finally, zzso showed superior efficacy compared with zzso in human tumor zzso models in which both zzso and zzso were zzso zzso these data indicate that zzso zzso and zzso may provide superior zzso efficacy compared with targeting zzso zzso
