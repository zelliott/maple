zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso signaling is required for zzso and progression of many tumors but this zzso has not been well studied as a zzso factor or potential therapeutic target in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso In this paper, the association between the expression of zzso and zzso zzso and prognosis was investigated zzso in 100 surgically zzso zzso We then assessed the therapeutic effect of blocking zzso zzso signaling using dominant negative zzso zzso in zzso in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were detected in 60 and 50% of tumors, respectively, and were associated with invasion depth, zzso advanced tumor stage and zzso Patients with tumors expressing both zzso and zzso had a significantly shorter survival than those expressing either alone or neither in both single and zzso zzso zzso suppressed proliferation and zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso through blocking zzso zzso zzso We propose that detection of zzso in zzso may be useful for the prediction of recurrence and poor prognosis and for selecting patients for zzso zzso zzso blockade of zzso may be a useful zzso therapeutic for zzso
