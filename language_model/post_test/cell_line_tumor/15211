The zzso zzso zzso and their zzso regulators, the tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso are responsible for the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Among all zzso zzso appears to play a unique role since zzso is a zzso protein and, unlike the other zzso family members, is tightly bound to the zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be able to induce zzso cell zzso As little is known about the underlying mechanisms, we set out to investigate the zzso effect of zzso in human zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells led to a strong zzso induction of zzso zzso as reflected by a zzso increase in zzso 3 and 7 activity compared to control zzso or zzso cells, whereas zzso zzso failed to induce zzso zzso increased zzso of death zzso zzso and the zzso 3 and 7 was observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso was observed in zzso cells, indicating a death zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso led to a further induction of zzso after stimulation with zzso zzso and zzso Most interestingly, zzso was associated with a decrease in zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and serum deprivation of zzso cells resulted in a distinct enhancement of zzso pointing to an impaired signaling of zzso survival zzso Finally, zzso treatment of zzso zzso zzso led to the release of zzso from the surface of zzso cells and to a significant decrease in zzso indicating that the binding of zzso is necessary for zzso zzso 

The results demonstrate that exclusively cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells through zzso zzso of death zzso signaling and blockade of survival signaling zzso
