We report zzso the identification of a small zzso zzso zzso which displays potent and zzso zzso of lethal viral zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso Valley and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Using mouse models of Ebola virus, we further demonstrate that zzso can protect animals from an otherwise lethal infection when used either in a zzso or therapeutic zzso A single treatment, administered 1 day after infection, is sufficient to protect animals from lethal Ebola virus zzso zzso zzso also identified zzso activity against divergent virus families, which supports a hypothesis that zzso interferes with a common zzso zzso by different zzso These findings suggest zzso may provide an opportunity for targeting viral zzso
