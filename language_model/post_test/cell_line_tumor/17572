The membrane fusion activity of zzso zzso virus zzso is carried by the zzso zzso and controlled by the peripheral zzso zzso We show here that all zzso zzso of the virus form zzso zzso complexes that can be disrupted by treatment with zzso heat or zzso or by zzso zzso zzso mapping indicated that these conditions induced zzso of the zzso by zzso a zzso group in a zzso zzso motif in zzso This resulted in zzso of zzso from the zzso The active zzso was hidden in zzso virus but became accessible for zzso by either zzso depletion or zzso zzso The zzso inhibited zzso virus fusion and zzso zzso treatment of zzso zzso resulted in zzso of the zzso zzso and rescue of virus zzso Further studies showed that virus fusion was specifically inhibited by high and enhanced by low zzso of zzso These results suggest that zzso is stabilized by zzso and that zzso binding triggers a cascade of reactions involving zzso zzso zzso exposure, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which lead to fusion zzso
