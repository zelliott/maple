zzso zzso zzso zzso was investigated with tumor growth and zzso experiments in mice by the use of zzso a highly potent specific inhibitor of zzso zzso with zzso inhibited tumor zzso in nude or zzso mice, following subcutaneous injection of 2 human and 2 zzso zzso zzso induced a considerable lag period in the appearance of tumor growth, compared with zzso saline (PBS) treatment, but had no effect on established tumor zzso growth in zzso or on tumor growth in zzso zzso treatment induced central necrosis of the tumor zzso compared with no effect with PBS zzso Greater protection was noted with longer duration of zzso zzso seeding into blood was examined with green fluorescent protein zzso tumor zzso zzso inhibited seeding into the blood as well as systemic zzso which varied from complete protection to zzso to zzso in the blood and zzso to zzso in the zzso zzso inhibited spontaneous zzso from zzso implanted tumor by reducing the number of tumor zzso in the zzso Mouse survival in animals injected zzso with highly aggressive zzso cells revealed 5 of 5 deaths of zzso animals on day 40 compared with no deaths with zzso treatment, with zzso of survival with zzso treatment of 16 days to more than 31 zzso Thus, zzso zzso contributes to tumor zzso seeding, and spontaneous zzso A potent zzso agent should be of clinical benefit to patients with zzso
