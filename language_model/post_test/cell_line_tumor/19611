The zzso which occurs in a small subset of acute zzso zzso zzso and is associated with a dismal zzso creates a zzso zzso zzso factor with transforming zzso 

We used zzso difference analysis to identify candidate zzso target zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso expression model system were then used to evaluate the ability of zzso to zzso target gene zzso 

We identified zzso zzso zzso as a gene zzso expressed in ALL cell lines with and without zzso expression and demonstrated that zzso ALL cell lines expressed high levels of zzso protein and had a drug zzso zzso Although zzso zzso is regulated by zzso via interaction with a DNA response element that shares significant zzso with the optimal zzso binding site, zzso did not directly activate zzso of reporter genes under control of zzso promoter elements in transient zzso zzso However, zzso expression was induced in a zzso independent manner by zzso zzso and truncated zzso zzso consisting of those portions of zzso present in zzso fusion zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso may play a critical role in defining the clinical zzso of zzso with a zzso suggesting zzso zzso of zzso activity as a rational therapeutic strategy for this chemotherapy resistant zzso of zzso
