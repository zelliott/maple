In addition to zzso zzso promoter function, zzso zzso zzso zzso induce the accelerated zzso of mature zzso zzso the mechanism zzso this transcript zzso is unknown but depends on the 3' untranslated region zzso of zzso zzso Using zzso human breast cancer cells zzso the zzso stability factor zzso was shown to support zzso transcript integrity, bind and zzso associate with a zzso zzso element within the zzso transcript 3' zzso zzso with zzso zzso activity, and zzso with zzso zzso also zzso with zzso in an zzso manner and within 6 hours of exposure to a zzso inhibitor dose, that does not significantly alter zzso zzso levels or zzso binding to zzso zzso Cellular zzso transcript levels decline while remaining physically associated with zzso zzso of zzso protein by small interfering zzso partially suppressed the zzso transcript zzso induced by either zzso or zzso zzso zzso Three novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and shown to inhibit zzso with zzso to zzso greater selectivity over their binding and zzso of zzso Unlike more potent zzso zzso these zzso zzso produced zzso growth arrest of zzso breast cancer cells by accelerating the zzso of mature zzso zzso without zzso zzso promoter zzso In sum, these findings point to the therapeutic potential of zzso and zzso zzso contrasting zzso stability effects induced by zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso and show that zzso transcript stability mechanisms include zzso targets for the development of novel zzso zzso
