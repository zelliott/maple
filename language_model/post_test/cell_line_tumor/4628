zzso zzso have been regarded as a new kind of cancer zzso however, their therapeutic efficacy needs to be further zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso tumor cells have been shown to zzso induce zzso T cell zzso To increase efficacy of zzso zzso to induce zzso immune response, we modified the zzso by protein transfer of SEA zzso with a highly zzso zzso domain zzso and designated those zzso zzso as zzso We found the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso cell line were round zzso with the sizes of zzso zzso limited by a zzso zzso Interestingly, the inner structure of the zzso were visible under the transmission electron zzso those zzso inner structure has not been described by other zzso zzso with zzso inhibited tumor growth and prolonged survival of the mice challenged with parental tumor cells more significantly than with zzso zzso and even more than with the mixture of zzso and zzso The results of mixed zzso reaction zzso showed that the increased zzso zzso zzso and specific zzso T zzso zzso could be effectively induced from the zzso zzso of the mice zzso with zzso In zzso depletion experiments showed that zzso T cells are the main zzso cells, and both zzso T cells and zzso cells are also involved in the zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso surface anchored with zzso can efficiently induce zzso zzso thereby resulting in more potent zzso of tumor zzso Our data provide an efficient and novel approach to tumor zzso by protein modification of zzso zzso
