In the quest for markers of expression and progression for prostate cancer zzso the majority of studies have zzso on molecular data exclusively from primary zzso Although expression in zzso is zzso a lack of correlation with secondary zzso potentially limits their zzso zzso and zzso zzso targets were identified by examining expression profiles of prostate cell lines using zzso zzso Those genes identified were verified on zzso cell lines and zzso samples from both primary and secondary zzso using real-time zzso western zzso and zzso zzso coding for an integral membrane zzso zzso was the most significantly ( zzso zzso marker in both primary and zzso zzso specimens compared with benign zzso zzso at both zzso and protein zzso In primary zzso zzso was more highly expressed in lower grade zzso 6) zzso than in higher grade zzso zzso zzso zzso was prominent throughout zzso from a variety of secondary sites in zzso and zzso specimens from both zzso and zzso zzso As a result of its prominent expression in both primary and secondary zzso together with its established role as a zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso may be useful as a potential marker and therapeutic target for zzso zzso
