zzso is involved in regulating zzso zzso in cooperation with zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso that are essential for zzso zzso Its role in zzso transformation was previously zzso It has been reported that transformation of zzso is associated with altered expression of zzso molecules suggesting the potential zzso of zzso in melanoma development and zzso To shed light on this issue, the expression and the role of zzso in melanoma zzso was investigated by zzso and molecular zzso zzso was zzso both at the zzso and the protein levels in zzso zzso and zzso cell lines compared with normal zzso A subsequent analysis in primary and zzso melanoma specimens confirmed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed in 53 of 59 zzso and 12 of 12 zzso primary melanoma and melanoma zzso zzso while, low expression of zzso was detected in 12 of 20 zzso benign zzso A significant correlation of zzso zzso was observed with most of known negative melanoma zzso factors, including zzso involvement zzso zzso zzso and thickness zzso zzso zzso zzso by analyzing the large series of melanoma samples in the Xu zzso we identified the zzso factor zzso among genes positively correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and experimental data of the present study indicate that the extent of zzso expression zzso with melanoma zzso
