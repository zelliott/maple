This study is the first to investigate the zzso effect of zzso in human breast zzso zzso zzso zzso reveal that zzso zzso zzso cells by blocking cell cycle progression in the zzso phase and inducing zzso Cell cycle blockade is associated with increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso at zzso 15, resulting in increased stability of zzso by decreasing zzso and zzso double zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso phase arrest was also associated with decreases in the amounts of zzso B, zzso A, zzso and zzso and increases in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso The specific zzso inhibitor caffeine significantly decreased zzso zzso arrest by zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell death is associated with changes in the expression of zzso and zzso decreasing levels of zzso and zzso and subsequently triggering the zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso of cells with zzso inhibitor blocked zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso cell zzso These findings suggest that zzso may be a promising zzso agent against human breast zzso
