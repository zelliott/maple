A major challenge in developing zzso therapies is tumor intrinsic zzso and the emergence of zzso zzso Recently, such resistance is considered to be associated with inflammatory changes in the tumor zzso However, no information has been acquired about the effect of zzso on tumor zzso in this zzso We established two tumor models zzso to zzso treatment and sought to determine the role of inflammatory changes in the development of tumor zzso to zzso zzso 

Three zzso tumor zzso models were treated with zzso zzso or high-dose zzso for 10 zzso The effect of zzso on tumor growth was observed, and tumors zzso to zzso treatment were zzso zzso zzso were carried out to assess the presence of zzso zzso cells in the peripheral blood and in the zzso zzso zzso levels in peripheral blood were measured using the zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the tumor was evaluated using zzso 

LLC and zzso tumors were defined as animal models of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were inherently recruited into the peripheral blood and the tumor zzso in the LLC zzso mice, and levels of serum zzso and zzso were increased along with the progression of tumor zzso In the zzso zzso mice, zzso zzso cells were zzso recruited by zzso into the peripheral blood and the tumor zzso Additionally, high levels of zzso and zzso in serum and high expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in tumor tissue were found in zzso zzso mice after zzso zzso 

A tumor can grow inherently or zzso with zzso to zzso treatment in zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells and inflammatory zzso may play an important role in the development of tumor zzso to zzso zzso
