zzso zzso is a decoy zzso for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso While zzso is essential for zzso and zzso breast cancer migration into bone, TRAIL promotes breast cancer zzso We analyzed the expression of zzso and TRAIL and its zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso In both cells, zzso zzso levels and protein zzso were zzso and zzso enhanced by zzso zzso and suppressed by zzso In contrast to zzso cells, zzso abundantly expressed TRAIL zzso which was enhanced by zzso and inhibited by zzso TRAIL activated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and decreased cell numbers of zzso but had no effect on zzso zzso Gene zzso zzso directed against zzso resulted in a zzso higher zzso rate compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, TRAIL induced significantly less zzso in cells cultured in zzso media zzso zzso compared to cells exposed to TRAIL in fresh medium lacking zzso zzso zzso zzso and these protective effects were reversed by blocking zzso with its specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The association between cancer cell survival and zzso production by zzso cells was further supported by the finding, that zzso of zzso zzso using zzso or zzso prior to TRAIL exposure resulted in decreased and increased rate of zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso by breast cancer cells is modulated by zzso and zzso and may represent a critical resistance mechanism that protects against zzso zzso
