zzso PET has difficulty distinguishing tumor from inflammation in the clinic because of the same high zzso in zzso and inflammatory zzso In contrast, zzso acid zzso do not accumulate in inflamed zzso and thus provide an excellent opportunity for their use in clinical cancer zzso In this study, we developed a new zzso acid zzso zzso zzso by zzso reactions and performed its zzso zzso 

zzso was prepared by zzso of zzso zzso salt and zzso on zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was determined in normal mice and the incorporation of zzso into tissue proteins was zzso In zzso competitive zzso experiments were performed with zzso zzso cell zzso zzso PET imaging was performed on zzso and inflammation mice and compared with zzso zzso 

The overall zzso zzso yield of zzso was zzso zzso zzso with a synthesis time of 60 zzso the zzso purity was more than zzso zzso studies demonstrate high zzso of zzso in liver, zzso zzso and blood at the early phase, and fast clearance in most zzso over the whole observed zzso The zzso studies in zzso cells suggest that zzso is transported by the zzso acid transport system zzso zzso and zzso zzso displays good stability and is not incorporated into proteins in zzso PET imaging shows that zzso can be a better potential PET zzso for zzso tumor from inflammation than zzso and zzso zzso with high zzso zzso ratio zzso of tumor to inflammation at 60 zzso zzso 

Using zzso derivatives as zzso the new zzso zzso was achieved with good yield and zzso zzso and the biological evaluation results of zzso showed that it was a hopeful zzso for PET tumor zzso
