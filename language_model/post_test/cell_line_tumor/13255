zzso modifications regulate physiology either by directly modulating protein function or by zzso immune recognition of zzso zzso is a zzso modification formed by the conversion of zzso zzso into the zzso zzso acid by protein zzso zzso zzso family zzso We have identified mast cells as a major source of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso by the inflammatory zzso signal zzso zzso zzso activity and robust protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso is sensitive to zzso zzso and protein zzso C zzso and zzso regulates the expression of the zzso zzso and zzso transcripts in mast zzso Further, the zzso zzso and its zzso zzso proteins are released from mast cells on zzso with zzso zzso expression is closely linked with inflammation in zzso arthritis zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso proteins are found in the zzso fluid of zzso zzso In addition, zzso is associated with the development of zzso to zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso of mast cells may play a role in inflammation by providing zzso and zzso zzso access to the zzso zzso
