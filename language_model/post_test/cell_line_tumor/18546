The zzso zzso zzso B has been implicated in tumor progression by virtue of its increased zzso and protein levels, as well as its zzso at the invading front of the zzso In this study, we examined whether blocking zzso B expression in human zzso zzso cells affects zzso zzso zzso of human zzso cells with a zzso containing zzso zzso B zzso showed decreased migration rates in zzso and zzso zzso Analysis showed a reduction in zzso protein and zzso activity in the zzso B zzso zzso zzso Regarding zzso in zzso we found that the zzso medium of zzso cells with zzso zzso B expression reduced zzso interaction of human zzso zzso cells, resulting in the disruption of zzso network zzso Furthermore, a marked reduction in zzso development was seen in an in zzso zzso air zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso zzso B zzso Taken together, these results provide evidence that zzso of zzso B expression can suppress zzso zzso
