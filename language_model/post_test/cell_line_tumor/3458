We have employed an inverse engineering strategy based on quantitative zzso analysis to identify changes in zzso protein abundance that correlate with increased specific zzso zzso zzso production zzso by engineered zzso myeloma zzso zzso Four homogeneous zzso cell lines differing in zzso were isolated from a pool of primary zzso The zzso of each zzso zzso cell line was analyzed at zzso growth phase by two-dimensional gel zzso zzso and individual protein spot volume data derived from digitized gel images were compared zzso To identify changes in protein abundance associated with zzso zzso were screened for proteins that exhibited either a linear correlation with cell line zzso or a zzso change in abundance specific only to the cell line with highest zzso Several proteins with altered abundance were identified by mass zzso zzso exhibiting a significant increase in abundance with increasing zzso included molecular zzso known to interact directly with nascent zzso during their folding and assembly zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that in all cell lines zzso light chain was more abundant than heavy chain, indicating that this is a likely prerequisite for efficient zzso zzso In zzso these data reveal both the zzso responses and molecular mechanisms enabling zzso cells in culture to achieve high-level zzso zzso zzso zzso
