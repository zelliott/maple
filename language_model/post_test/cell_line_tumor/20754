zzso zzso zzso are an attractive tool for targeting and delivering particle zzso for therapy or imaging zzso The labeling of zzso with metal zzso requires zzso agents and can cause loss of binding to their zzso The aim of the present approach was to design an zzso flow zzso zzso zzso to evaluate zzso capacity of zzso of the therapeutic zzso zzso and to verify the most promising candidate in a competitive radioactive binding zzso The final setup for flow zzso assessment of cellular binding capacities of zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso is based on zzso the selection of a robust cell line model zzso the definition of zzso zzso zzso for the zzso reference zzso zzso plus zzso of a reasonable zzso control, and zzso the calculation of relative zzso affinities based on the flow zzso zzso Two zzso zzso out of the three cell lines with different total and cell surface expression levels of zzso turned out to be adequate models but the application of one cell line was sufficient to estimate reduced binding capacities of zzso relative to zzso Only zzso zzso zzso exhibited a zzso signal comparable to zzso zzso and was applied for zzso with zzso zzso binding affinity of this zzso was proven in a competitive radioactive zzso zzso We conclude that the flow zzso zzso is reliable and that the relative binding capacity of zzso is neither affected by zzso modification with zzso zzso zzso zzso with a final zzso ratio of 5 nor by subsequent zzso zzso thus qualifies for zzso treatment testing as a prerequisite for therapeutic zzso
