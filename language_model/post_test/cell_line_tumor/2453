zzso is one of the most abundant zzso in the root extracts of zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso which have been reported to have zzso zzso This study evaluated the zzso activity of zzso on human zzso zzso zzso cells both in zzso and in zzso In zzso the zzso zzso showed that zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso cells in both zzso and zzso manners with its 50% zzso concentration zzso ) at 48 h being zzso zzso zzso zzso Terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso detected the characteristics of cell zzso in zzso cells and the zzso rates of treated groups were increased in a zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso could block the cell cycle arrest at zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso the zzso and protein expression of zzso but zzso that of zzso The zzso zzso protein was also detected in treated zzso The experiment in zzso showed that zzso significantly suppressed the growth of zzso zzso zzso and induced the zzso of zzso determined by zzso The results indicate that zzso has significant zzso effects on zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso
