zzso brain tumors have been proved to be resistant to standard treatments and therefore require new therapeutic zzso zzso a recently described member of the inhibitor of zzso protein family, is zzso in several human brain tumors, primarily zzso but is zzso in normal zzso The authors hypothesized that the expression of zzso zzso could be exploited for treatment of zzso by targeting the tumors with gene therapy zzso 

Following confirmation of zzso expression in zzso cell lines, an zzso zzso containing the zzso promoter and the reporter gene zzso was tested in established and primary zzso cells, normal zzso cells, and normal human brain zzso High levels of reporter gene expression were observed in established tumor and primary tumor cell lines and low levels of expression in zzso and normal human brain zzso To test zzso zzso the authors constructed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso E1 gene expression and an zzso zzso zzso These zzso could efficiently replicate within and kill a variety of established zzso tumor cells, but were inactive in a normal human liver organ zzso Finally, zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited the growth of zzso zzso in zzso 

Together these data indicate that the zzso promoter is a promising zzso promoter for zzso targeting of zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso The strategy of using zzso may thus translate into an experimental therapeutic approach that can be used in human clinical zzso
