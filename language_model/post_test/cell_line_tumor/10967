zzso zzso is formed following lung injury and inflammation and may contribute to the development of pulmonary zzso zzso turnover is altered in patients with pulmonary fibrosis, resulting in zzso zzso zzso mainly due to decreased zzso zzso type II zzso cells zzso repair the injured zzso zzso by zzso over the provisional zzso zzso We hypothesized that repairing zzso zzso cells zzso the underlying zzso zzso by release of zzso activity, and that the degree of zzso zzso zzso zzso repair on zzso To test this hypothesis we studied zzso zzso wound repair in zzso using a modified zzso wound repair model with human zzso zzso zzso cells cultured on a zzso zzso In presence of the inflammatory zzso zzso wounds increase by zzso in 24 hours mainly due to detachment of the cells, whereas in zzso medium wound areas decreases by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Increased levels of zzso zzso and zzso in the cell zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells indicate zzso of zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso In presence of low zzso of zzso zzso including specific blocking zzso zzso zzso zzso repair in zzso was improved, whereas in presence of high zzso of zzso zzso a decrease was observed mainly due to decreased spreading and migration of zzso These findings suggest the existence of a zzso optimum at which zzso zzso repair in zzso is most zzso In conclusion, zzso released by zzso alters zzso zzso repair in zzso by modulating the underlying zzso zzso
