The human zzso zzso cell line is one of the first generated cell lines and is used in various areas of biomedical zzso zzso of its protein expression is limited and no comprehensive study on the zzso of this cell line has been reported to zzso zzso technology was used in order to zzso the proteins of the zzso cell zzso Total protein extracts were separated by two-dimensional gel zzso zzso and zzso by zzso laser zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso following zzso zzso with zzso and, finally, protein identification was carried out by zzso mass fingerprint zzso and post source zzso zzso zzso zzso 3,000 spots were excised from two zzso gels and were zzso resulting in the identification of 237 different gene zzso The majority of the identified proteins were zzso regulatory proteins and zzso zzso while zzso markers and zzso were also zzso Our findings include 11 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso related to the zzso state of the zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso database provides the basis for future protein zzso
