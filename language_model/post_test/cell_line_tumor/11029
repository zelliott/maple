The current research was designed to determine the effect of zzso in treatment of experimental zzso zzso zzso arthritis was induced in Lewis zzso The zzso administration of zzso zzso and zzso injection of zzso zzso were started on day 25 zzso and continued until final assessment on day zzso During this period, clinical examination was taken zzso The zzso type II zzso zzso zzso and zzso oxide synthesis were zzso The zzso and zzso were then removed for zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of ART and zzso were assessed using zzso cell zzso Data showed that zzso injection of ART to zzso rats induced a significant reduction in paw zzso This beneficial effect was associated with a significant decrease in zzso zzso response compared with zzso zzso zzso assessment showed a reduced inflammatory cell zzso in zzso of treated zzso tissue zzso and bone erosion in the zzso were markedly reduced following ART zzso Furthermore, our zzso results paralleled our zzso zzso zzso analysis of ART showed greater zzso compared with zzso Treatment with ART significantly diminished NO formation in treated rats compared with zzso zzso Our data shed light on the therapeutic efficacy of zzso in experimental zzso arthritis compared with a choice drug zzso and it may be offered as a zzso drug in treatment of zzso zzso
