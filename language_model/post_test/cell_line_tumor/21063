To investigate the effects of zzso zzso extract zzso on suppressing proliferation and inducing zzso of mouse zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cells cultured in zzso were divided into 5 groups: blank control group, zzso in high, zzso low dose groups and zzso zzso zzso cells were cultured in media with serum containing different zzso of zzso and blank zzso The proliferation of zzso cells was determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso Fluorescence zzso was zzso to observe the zzso of zzso cells by zzso with zzso zzso The cell cycle and zzso were analyzed by flow zzso zzso 

The zzso of serum containing zzso on the proliferation of zzso cells in zzso was zzso in a dose and time dependent zzso The typical zzso changes of zzso were observed after incubation with zzso serum in high dose for 48 zzso Among the various zzso of cell cycle, the percentage of cells in S phase decreased significantly, while the percentage of cells in zzso phase zzso zzso serum showed positive effect on cell zzso The zzso rate of blank control group, zzso in low, zzso high dose groups and zzso group were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso containing serum can inhibit proliferation and induce zzso of zzso cells in zzso
