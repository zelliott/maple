zzso has long been known to facilitate zzso To pinpoint the steps where zzso might play a role in the zzso we used three-dimensional zzso of direct infusion of zzso labeled zzso to observe the interaction of tumor cells with zzso and zzso in isolated lung zzso zzso cells arrested in the pulmonary zzso were associated with a zzso composed of both zzso and zzso Initially, the cells attached to the pulmonary vessels were zzso Over the next 2 to 6 hours, they spread on the vessel zzso The associated zzso was zzso zzso with tumor cell zzso To assess the importance of zzso formation, we inhibited zzso with zzso a potent inhibitor of zzso The number of tumor cells initially arrested in the lung of zzso mice was essentially the same as in control zzso However, tumor cell spreading and subsequent retention of the tumor cells in the lung was markedly inhibited in the zzso zzso These associations of the tumor cells with zzso were independent of tumor cell expression of zzso zzso This work identifies tumor cell spreading onto the vascular surface as an important component of the zzso cascade and implicates zzso in this zzso
