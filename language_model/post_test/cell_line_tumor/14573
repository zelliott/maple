zzso a zzso zzso zzso that enhances the zzso potential of zzso cells, has been suggested to be a marker of poor prognosis in breast zzso The zzso potential of zzso cell populations has been recently recognized and, zzso distant zzso are largely composed of zzso cells in breast cancer patients zzso to zzso zzso new therapeutic strategies aimed at zzso zzso may zzso regulate the dissemination of tumor cells and formation of zzso Here, we reveal that suppression of zzso protein expression is a crucial event in the molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso effects of the zzso drug zzso in zzso zzso zzso breast cancer zzso First, we confirmed that, among the different molecular classes of breast cancer, zzso breast cancer cells were significantly more sensitive to the zzso effects of zzso Second, we observed a positive correlation between the growth zzso activity of zzso and the relative enrichment in cells bearing the zzso zzso Third, zzso indirect zzso imaging zzso revealed that zzso protein levels were drastically decreased in the presence of zzso zzso of zzso Fourth, to preliminary assess the clinical relevance of zzso zzso effects we took advantage of the recently developed ROCK online interface zzso a publicly accessible portal that allows rapid integration of breast cancer functional and molecular profiling zzso When we evaluated the impact of zzso expression on distant zzso survival zzso in zzso gene expression breast cancer zzso zzso survival analyses and zzso tests comparing zzso for zzso and zzso breast zzso revealed that patients with zzso tumors tended to have a shorter zzso These findings, altogether, suggest that the ability of zzso to suppress the zzso zzso promoter and breast cancer stem cell marker zzso may open a novel molecular avenue in the therapeutic management of zzso zzso of zzso zzso breast zzso naturally enriched with zzso zzso cell zzso
