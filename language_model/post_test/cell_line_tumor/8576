Long zzso zzso zzso zzso have been shown to be novel regulators for both zzso and zzso One of them, zzso was regulated by zzso and contributed to zzso in mouse embryonic zzso However, the impact of such regulation on zzso cancer zzso remains to be zzso 

Total zzso was extracted from zzso cell lines and snap fresh frozen zzso samples from 2 zzso patient zzso The expression of zzso was zzso by quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction zzso 

We discovered that the expression level of zzso was increased by elevated zzso zzso induced by zzso in zzso colon cancer zzso The expression level of zzso was significantly zzso zzso zzso lower in zzso tumor tissue when compared with the paired normal tissue from the same zzso There was no significant correlation of zzso with zzso status zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso showed a higher level of zzso than tumors in the colon zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso in patients with stage III tumors was significantly higher than in those with stage I tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso were significantly associated with higher zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso 2 and 3) and vascular invasion zzso zzso zzso 

These results indicate that zzso may contribute to zzso disease zzso
