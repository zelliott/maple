The presence of zzso motifs within the proteins provides the synthetic biologist with the opportunity to zzso novel proteins through the programming of these zzso Here we describe a method that enables one to combine multiple zzso motifs to generate a zzso protein zzso With this method, a set of sense and zzso zzso zzso were zzso These zzso were mixed and zzso so that the zzso DNA consisted of zzso zzso of multiple zzso created from the zzso assembly of the sense and zzso zzso With this zzso method, we prepared a protein library from the zzso motifs shared among zzso family zzso Among the 41 clones created, zzso of clones had a stable, presumably folded expression product in human cells, which was zzso by zzso and western zzso The proteins obtained varied with respect to both the number and the order of the four zzso The method enables zzso zzso of DNA blocks that coded motif zzso and the frequency of each motif within a library can be adjusted in a zzso zzso This motif programming has a potential for creating a library with a large proportion of zzso zzso
