The zzso zzso plays a critical role in the degradation of proteins involved in tumor growth and has therefore become a target for cancer zzso In order to discover novel zzso of this pathway, a cellular zzso reporter of zzso activity was zzso Human zzso colon cancer cells were engineered to express a 4 zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso rapidly zzso via the zzso zzso and designed zzso zzso zzso Following treatment with reference zzso zzso the zzso protein accumulated in zzso zzso cells and a zzso increase in zzso zzso signal was measured, as compared to zzso zzso The screening of over 30,000 compounds using this zzso zzso zzso led to the identification of zzso B as a novel inhibitor of the zzso zzso Indeed, zzso B induced an increase in zzso from zzso zzso cells, at zzso also producing an zzso of zzso proteins and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B did not inhibit zzso activities of zzso zzso and zzso with cellular zzso zzso activities at zzso to zzso higher zzso than that required to induce significant increase in zzso and zzso of zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso B proved to be zzso triggered zzso in zzso zzso cells and induced the zzso protein zzso characteristic of the zzso signaling zzso zzso the use of the zzso zzso zzso allowed the identification of a novel inhibitor of the zzso zzso that might interfere with zzso functions in a different way from reference zzso zzso
