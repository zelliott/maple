Any zzso in the human neural cell zzso zzso zzso zzso gene might cause various types of serious neurological syndromes in humans, characterized by increased zzso mental zzso and various zzso of the nervous zzso Such zzso zzso often cause severe abnormalities or even fatalities, and the reason for this may be a disruption of the adhesive function of zzso resulting from a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso studies using zzso zzso cells demonstrated that zzso carrying the zzso zzso in the zzso type III zzso zzso most likely is located within the zzso zzso zzso but it is less well expressed on the cell zzso One zzso zzso in the fourth zzso domain, was chosen from six zzso zzso and zzso at zzso zzso and zzso at zzso zzso and zzso at zzso in the zzso zzso to study in detail the functions of zzso zzso , such as the zzso traffic and degradation, because only a single band at 200 zzso was detected in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed predominantly in the zzso but not on the cell zzso In addition, this zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso at some sites in the zzso domain and thus becomes zzso by zzso via the zzso degradation zzso These observations demonstrate that the zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso domain may cause the zzso zzso because of a loss of expression on the cell surface resulting from zzso to the zzso zzso
