zzso breast zzso which lack zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso account for approximately zzso of breast zzso but occur more commonly in African zzso The poor survival outcomes seen with zzso breast zzso patients are, in part, due to a lack of therapeutic zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso is zzso in 50% of zzso breast zzso but zzso zzso have not been effective in patients with zzso breast zzso However, zzso zzso has been shown to reverse resistance to zzso zzso We examined the combination effects of zzso zzso with zzso zzso in zzso breast cancer in zzso and in zzso The combination of zzso zzso by using zzso and zzso zzso with zzso resulted in significantly greater zzso than the single agents alone and these effects were synergistic in zzso The combination of zzso and zzso significantly decreased growth of zzso breast zzso in zzso compared with either agent zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso activated zzso in zzso breast cancer cells in zzso The combination of zzso and zzso zzso resulted in increased zzso in some, but not all, zzso cell lines, and these zzso effects correlated with a decrease in activated zzso translation initiation factor zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso could sensitize a subset of zzso breast zzso to zzso zzso Given the paucity of effective targeted agents in zzso breast zzso these results warrant further zzso
