The zzso human embryonic zzso cell line zzso readily zzso into zzso when exposed to zzso acid in zzso These zzso show characteristic zzso with long processes and they express zzso markers zzso and zzso zzso zzso can regulate zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso and zzso receptors zzso Little is known, however, about the role of zzso zzso receptors zzso in these zzso Here we show that zzso zzso express functional zzso which is involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso activity at early stages of differentiation leads to fewer zzso and a reduction in miniature zzso zzso currents zzso Furthermore, cells cultured in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso show reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but increased zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso During normal zzso development, the edited zzso renders zzso zzso zzso The increased zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso is due to the reduced expression of zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso activity at early stages of differentiation is likely to play a role in the development of zzso zzso zzso
