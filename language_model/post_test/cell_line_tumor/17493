zzso and zzso zzso are two zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso that act as an inhibitor and a zzso of cell zzso zzso In zzso prostate zzso both these zzso are zzso at the zzso level, but only zzso protein levels are zzso We used an experimental model consisting of zzso a normal immortalized prostate cell line, and zzso and zzso two prostate zzso cell lines, to investigate both the zzso and zzso processes of zzso and zzso zzso regulation played the key role for the reduction in zzso and zzso zzso expression in cancer cells, as zzso and zzso zzso zzso were comparable in normal and cancer zzso zzso translation rate decreased in cancer cells in agreement with the decrease in zzso levels, whereas zzso translation rate increased more than zzso despite the reduction in zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso proteins were zzso more rapidly in cancer than in normal cells, and zzso experiments showed that zzso and/or rates of zzso and zzso protein maturation differ in cancer versus normal zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso zzso increased both zzso and zzso protein levels, the former in normal but not in cancer cells and the latter in both cell types, albeit at a higher extent in cancer than in normal zzso Interestingly, zzso of the zzso zzso zzso increased expression of zzso zzso protein without affecting zzso protein levels in cancer zzso These results show that zzso zzso and zzso zzso the last involving the zzso zzso pathway, contribute to the selective loss of zzso zzso a very efficient inhibitor of cell zzso in prostate zzso zzso
