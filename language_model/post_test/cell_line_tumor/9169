zzso are equipped with regulatory systems that display a variety of zzso behavior ranging from simple stable steady states, to switching and zzso to zzso Earlier work has shown that zzso in protein zzso or gene expression levels are related to the presence of at least one negative feedback loop in the regulatory zzso Here, we study the dynamics of a very general class of negative feedback zzso Our main result is that, when a single negative feedback loop dominates the zzso behavior, the sequence of zzso and zzso of the zzso exhibit a pattern that uniquely identifies the interactions of the zzso This allows us to devise an zzso to zzso test whether observed zzso time series are consistent with a single underlying negative feedback loop, and if so, zzso reconstruct the precise structure of the loop, zzso the zzso nature of each zzso This method applies even when some variables are missing from the data set, or if the time series shows zzso like zzso zzso We illustrate the relevance and the limits of zzso of our method with three examples: zzso zzso zzso gene expression in zzso and zzso binding of zzso at the zzso zzso zzso
