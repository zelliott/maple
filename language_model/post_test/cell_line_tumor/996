Two upstream regions of the human zzso zzso gene regulate its zzso the minimal promoter zzso and the zzso zzso The activity of the minimal promoter is essential for zzso zzso zzso in prostate zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso factor is, in turn, essential for the activity of the zzso Here we report that the zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for the zzso activity of the zzso and for the expression of the zzso zzso gene in zzso cells and for activated zzso in zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso activates zzso gene expression through zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cells that do not typically express zzso in zzso zzso In zzso cells the zzso form of zzso interferes with the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso The results suggest that the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in the zzso of zzso which, in turn, leads to zzso or activated zzso from the zzso zzso
