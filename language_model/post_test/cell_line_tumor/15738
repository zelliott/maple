The zzso structure, theoretical and experimental in zzso zzso properties using the zzso zzso and zzso acid, as well as preliminary in zzso pharmacological activities of zzso and zzso zzso zzso 18, 19, 21, and 23, is zzso In the in zzso zzso activity, for the zzso radical test, only zzso bearing free zzso groups gave the best zzso zzso values, zzso 13 and 14 showing the highest values in this zzso In the zzso analysis, the most potent radical scavenger was zzso zzso 21, followed by the zzso zzso zzso 10 and zzso Interestingly enough, the zzso zzso 7 zzso gave a low zzso value zzso in the zzso test, or was inactive in the zzso zzso zzso the ability to zzso the zzso zzso all the zzso studied proved active in this experiment, showing high values in the zzso range, the most potent being zzso zzso The theoretical calculations for the prediction of the zzso power, and the potential of zzso confirm that zzso 9 and 10 are among the best compounds in electron transfer zzso a result that is also in good agreement with the experimental values in the zzso zzso The calculated energy values for the reaction of zzso zzso zzso with the zzso predict that the most zzso zzso will take place between zzso 9, 10, and 21, a fact that would be in agreement with their zzso observed scavenger zzso The in zzso pharmacological analysis showed that the zzso profile of the target molecules was in general low, with values ranging from zzso to zzso in human zzso cells stressed with a mixture of zzso being zzso 18, and zzso the most zzso as they show values in the range zzso
