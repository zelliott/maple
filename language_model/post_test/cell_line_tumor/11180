Two zzso zzso zzso 2 and 3 that were zzso with zzso and zzso respectively, and their corresponding zzso complexes zzso and zzso were zzso and fully zzso zzso gel zzso studies on zzso DNA zzso indicated that both zzso complexes exhibited potent zzso activities under zzso conditions, most probably via an zzso zzso zzso zzso indicate that zzso and zzso exhibited comparable zzso efficiency with the zzso complex of their zzso analog zzso The finding that compounds 2 and 3 showed higher zzso zzso abilities than compound 1, suggests that strong metal zzso does not necessarily lead to an enhancement in the zzso efficiency of a zzso zzso In addition, three zzso complexes displayed moderate zzso activities toward three tumor cell zzso
