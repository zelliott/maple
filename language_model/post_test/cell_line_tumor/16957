One of the major limitations of cancer gene therapy using zzso human zzso zzso is rapid Ad zzso from systemic zzso To eliminate this, zzso ultrasound contrast agents, or zzso zzso were zzso with zzso zzso to three distinct tumor zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso for systemic targeting of a previously generated zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso was loaded in the targeted zzso and confirmed by zzso zzso zzso loading capacity was estimated by functional zzso as zzso zzso zzso plaque forming unit zzso per zzso zzso zzso Ad particles were effectively zzso by treatment with human zzso The zzso zzso were injected zzso in mice bearing zzso tumors zzso 1) and compared with two control groups: zzso zzso zzso zzso 2) and free Ad zzso 3) administered under the same zzso Two days after administration the blood levels of zzso embryonic alkaline zzso zzso reporter in zzso 1 mice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly higher ( zzso than those in zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The targeted Ad delivery was also confirmed by zzso zzso Thus, Ad delivery by targeted zzso holds potential as a safe and effective system for systemic Ad delivery for the purpose of cancer zzso
