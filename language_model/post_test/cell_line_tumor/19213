zzso induced stress and DNA damage have been associated with various human zzso conditions, including cancer and zzso Complex DNA damage such as zzso breaks zzso and zzso zzso zzso induced clustered DNA zzso zzso zzso or more DNA zzso within a short DNA zzso of zzso zzso on opposing DNA zzso are hypothesized to be zzso zzso challenging the repair mechanisms of the zzso To evaluate the induction and processing of complex DNA damage in breast cancer cells exposed to zzso zzso doses, we measured zzso breaks zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso cells as well as zzso zzso human breast zzso For the detection and measurement of zzso zzso and zzso we used the alkaline zzso gel zzso zzso zzso and an adaptation of zzso gel zzso with zzso coli repair zzso as DNA damage zzso Increased levels for most types of DNA damage were detected in zzso cells while the processing of zzso and zzso was deficient in these cells compared to zzso zzso Furthermore, the total zzso capacity of zzso cells was lower compared to their zzso zzso These findings point to the important role of complex DNA damage in breast cancer and its potential association with breast cancer development especially in the case of deficient zzso zzso
