Loss of zzso zzso expression in breast zzso zzso zzso is zzso of poor prognosis in breast cancer, but its function has not been zzso Our study tested the hypotheses that loss of zzso expression in breast zzso was associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer, through promotion of breast cancer cell zzso zzso zzso expression was zzso assessed in zzso breast zzso zzso expression in primary breast zzso was zzso by western zzso zzso zzso chamber zzso determined zzso ability to promote invasion of breast cancer zzso The impact of zzso zzso of zzso in zzso was evaluated using invasion zzso and zzso zzso zzso Loss of zzso expression in breast zzso was significantly associated with decreased breast zzso and zzso survival zzso zzso zzso Mean survival was 72 months zzso zzso versus zzso months zzso zzso This was confirmed in zzso zzso zzso expression was significantly decreased in zzso compared to normal zzso zzso zzso zzso and was associated with increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso promoted significantly increased invasion of zzso and zzso breast cancer cells from zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and from 37% to zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso cells led to the formation of organized cohesive structures when cultured with zzso media from zzso but resulted in a zzso appearance in the presence of zzso media from zzso zzso zzso accompanied by loss of zzso expression in zzso zzso Our data confirm that loss of zzso zzso in breast cancer predicts poor zzso At a functional level, zzso zzso are capable of significantly increasing the invasive capacity of breast cancer zzso
