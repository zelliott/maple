To identify genetic changes involved in the progression of breast zzso we did zzso array comparative zzso zzso zzso on a panel of breast tumors, including 10 zzso zzso in zzso zzso 18 invasive breast zzso and two zzso zzso zzso We identified 49 minimal commonly amplified regions zzso that included known zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and several zzso zzso and zzso regional copy number zzso With the exception of the zzso zzso zzso the overall frequency of copy number zzso was higher in invasive tumors than that in zzso with several of them present only in invasive zzso zzso of candidate zzso was confirmed by quantitative zzso in breast zzso and cell zzso To identify putative targets of zzso we developed a method combining array zzso and serial analysis of gene expression zzso data to correlate copy number and expression levels for each gene within zzso Using this approach, we were able to distinguish a few candidate targets from a set of zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso identified four putative zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The amplification of all four candidates was confirmed by quantitative zzso and zzso in zzso zzso but only zzso and zzso were zzso in breast tumors with zzso amplification compared with a panel of normal zzso zzso zzso These results show the power of combined array zzso and zzso analysis for the identification of candidate zzso targets and identify zzso and zzso as novel putative zzso in breast zzso
