zzso infection with zzso virus zzso is a zzso zzso in several zzso and zzso cell zzso At present, there are no zzso zzso that specifically target zzso zzso infection or zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso DNA binding protein that is consistently expressed in zzso tumors and required for stable maintenance of the viral zzso in zzso zzso zzso is also thought to provide cell survival function in zzso infected zzso In this work, the authors describe the development of a zzso zzso screening zzso method using a homogeneous zzso polarization zzso zzso monitoring zzso binding to its zzso DNA binding zzso An zzso zzso was developed using another zzso DNA binding zzso zzso and its zzso DNA binding zzso The authors demonstrate that zzso binding to a zzso DNA probe provides a robust zzso with a Z factor consistently greater than zzso A pilot screen of a zzso library of zzso compounds identified 3 structurally related molecules that selectively inhibit zzso but not zzso All 3 compounds had activity in a zzso zzso specific for the disruption of zzso zzso repression zzso One of the compounds was effective in reducing zzso zzso copy number in zzso zzso zzso zzso These experiments provide a proof of concept that zzso zzso of zzso can be identified by zzso zzso of compound zzso Further screening in conjunction with medicinal chemistry zzso may provide a selective inhibitor of zzso and zzso zzso zzso
