zzso zzso coli zzso leading causes of zzso morbidity and mortality in developing countries, are zzso pathogens that elaborate zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso which elicit zzso zzso zzso The molecular events permitting efficient delivery of zzso remain zzso Here, we characterize the role of zzso interaction as it relates to the delivery of zzso by zzso zzso of bacteria from target zzso zzso zzso by zzso filters prevented zzso of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso cell contact is required for efficient toxin zzso Likewise, a zzso strain bearing a zzso in the zzso zzso gene was deficient in delivery of zzso relative to the zzso zzso zzso Although zzso zzso via the type II zzso system zzso was responsive to a variety of environmental factors, neither toxin release nor delivery depended on zzso zzso of genes zzso zzso or the zzso zzso of green fluorescent protein to zzso (a component of the zzso system for zzso and to zzso demonstrated that both zzso and toxin are distributed at one pole of the zzso zzso zzso zzso delivery may occur in a polarized fashion with transfer of zzso toxin upon close interaction with host cells, preventing zzso of zzso
