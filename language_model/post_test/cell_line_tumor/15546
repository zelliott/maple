zzso zzso as zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been reported to block cancer growth by inducing zzso phase arrest in many cancer zzso However, no detailed studies have been performed to distinguish between these two zzso of cardiac zzso zzso Furthermore, the underlying mechanisms involved in this cell cycle arrest process are still not zzso Here, we report that zzso and other cardiac zzso zzso induce zzso arrest by the zzso of zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso imaging results demonstrate that zzso cells exhibit a marked delay in entering zzso at an early stage and are then arrested at zzso or induced entry into zzso This zzso change is attributed to the zzso of zzso We also show that zzso and the zzso of sodium pump reduce zzso at least in part, through zzso of the nuclear zzso factors, zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso B zzso These findings suggest that cardiac zzso induce zzso arrest and zzso through zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso demonstrating that zzso and zzso are critical targets of cardiac zzso in exerting their zzso zzso
