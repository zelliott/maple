Although zzso has been found to be implicated in zzso breast zzso in zzso women, the molecular mechanisms involved are yet to be zzso Recently, the zzso gene zzso has been recognized as a target gene for zzso in breast zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of zzso on the expression of zzso and on the zzso activity of its promoter in zzso breast cancer zzso We also studied the potential involvement of zzso (a negative regulator of zzso main signaling zzso zzso in the expression of zzso zzso Our results showed a significant increase in the zzso zzso increase of zzso and protein expression levels of zzso 24 h zzso treatment, which was followed by a significant decrease at 48 and 72 h (of zzso In zzso a zzso zzso zzso revealed an initial strong binding of zzso to the zzso promoter, which was no longer detected after 24 zzso zzso network proteins and zzso zzso zzso status were not found to contribute to the expression of zzso zzso Furthermore, a protein zzso zzso detected an enhanced zzso binding to the long zzso of zzso zzso zzso 48 and 72 h after zzso administration, thus zzso zzso to zzso zzso In conclusion, our findings suggest, for the first time to our knowledge, that the effect of zzso on the zzso gene zzso is limited by the zzso role of zzso in the zzso zzso signaling zzso in zzso breast cancer zzso
