zzso zzso is currently administered to patients with zzso zzso melanoma and those who are at risk for recurrence following surgery for high-risk zzso Signal zzso and zzso of zzso 1 zzso is a zzso factor that is activated by zzso and is thought to mediate the majority of its zzso zzso Loss of zzso has been found in zzso melanoma zzso We developed a zzso melanoma cell line in a zzso zzso We also zzso zzso melanoma cells with a zzso form of zzso to induce its zzso Using the resulting cell lines and zzso mice, we tested whether zzso could exert an zzso effect on melanoma cells in the absence of zzso signal zzso 

A melanoma tumor was induced in zzso mice via the application of zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso oil zzso zzso zzso analysis confirmed that the resulting tumor was a zzso zzso zzso analysis, zzso flow zzso and zzso analysis were used to confirm the lack of zzso in the zzso cell line zzso In addition, the zzso protein was zzso in zzso melanoma cells by stable zzso with a zzso construct zzso zzso zzso The effects of zzso on these cell lines were studied in zzso and in zzso 

zzso was not expressed in the zzso zzso melanoma cell zzso Treatment with zzso did not lead to zzso of zzso Cell proliferation zzso revealed that while zzso did not exert an zzso effect on this cell line, it was capable of zzso the survival of zzso zzso mice bearing 1 zzso zzso zzso tumor cells in the zzso position zzso zzso 20, P zzso zzso as compared to zzso zzso Also, the survival of zzso mice (as compared to zzso zzso was not affected by the zzso of zzso in zzso tumor zzso 

This data suggests that zzso can enhance survival in an animal model where zzso signal zzso and gene regulation is absent within the tumor but is present within the zzso This data also indicates that the zzso of zzso within the tumor does not significantly enhance the effects of zzso administered zzso in this zzso These findings indicate that the bulk of the zzso actions of zzso may be derived from its effects on host zzso
