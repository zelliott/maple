The zzso zzso is an attractive target for zzso of zzso zzso We tested a unique zzso zzso zzso zzso for its ability to redirect activated T cells zzso to target zzso zzso 

zzso were generated from normal human peripheral blood zzso cells zzso by stimulating the zzso with zzso and expanding the T cells in the presence of zzso 2 zzso for 14 zzso zzso were armed with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso prior to zzso zzso zzso were tested for its zzso specificity to zzso expressed on cancer cell lines and zzso expressed on zzso zzso zzso were further tested ex zzso for their zzso against zzso positive tumor targets and its ability to induce zzso response upon binding to zzso 

zzso expression in zzso cells was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso binding of zzso to the tumor targets as well as to zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited specific killing of zzso positive zzso cell lines significantly above unarmed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly higher levels of zzso zzso and zzso compared to unarmed zzso zzso zzso 

These zzso findings support the potential of a novel zzso approach to target T cells to zzso
