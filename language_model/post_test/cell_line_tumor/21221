zzso properties of zzso solutions of newly zzso compounds, zzso zzso zzso with zzso tails of 12 zzso and 16 zzso carbon zzso determined as a function of concentration by means of direct methods, are reported zzso zzso zzso zzso and sound zzso were measured at zzso K, allowing for the determination of apparent and partial zzso zzso volumes, and zzso Changes in zzso quantities upon zzso were derived using a zzso zzso From a comparison with the corresponding zzso compounds zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the role played in the zzso process by the zzso zzso zzso was zzso it enhances the zzso character of the zzso and lowers the change in zzso of zzso formation by about zzso zzso zzso By comparing the volume of zzso with those of zzso and zzso the volumes taken up by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso groups were found to be 133 and 99 zzso zzso zzso Regarding the interaction with zzso zzso it seems that the sugar zzso of the zzso zzso compound gives rise to hydrogen bonds with the oxygen atoms of the zzso zzso shifting the phase transition of zzso from a zzso gel to a zzso liquid crystal to lower zzso zzso zzso significantly greater changes than zzso in the structure of zzso suggesting the formation of zzso The interaction is strongly enhanced by the presence of zzso Neither compound interacts strongly with DNA or zzso it, as shown by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Only zzso is able to deliver little DNA inside cells when zzso with zzso as shown by the transient zzso zzso This might be related to the ability of zzso to form zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
