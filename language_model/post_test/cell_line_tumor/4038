zzso is one of the type II zzso zzso zzso and is known to be involved in cancer zzso Increased zzso expression has been reported in a variety of human zzso and its association with poor prognosis has been highlighted in some cancer zzso However, its exact role in cancer progression and its effect on patient survival in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso are still zzso We performed zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso samples after zzso validation and evaluated the association of its expression with zzso parameters and zzso High zzso expression was observed in zzso % zzso of zzso samples and more frequently in zzso stage and in poorly differentiated zzso Both overall survival zzso and zzso survival zzso were significantly lower for patients with high expression of zzso than for patients with low expression zzso zzso rate, zzso vs zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso rate, zzso vs zzso zzso zzso High zzso expression was an independent zzso factor for zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso (95 % confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso and for zzso zzso zzso (95 % zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, higher expression of zzso is an independent zzso factor involved in the progression of zzso which suggests that zzso is a factor in zzso tumor progression and also a potential molecular therapeutic zzso
