We have earlier described the zzso zzso zzso zzso that was rendered zzso by deletion of the zzso domain zzso of the zzso zzso zzso this deletion causes zzso activity in drug-resistant cells displaying nuclear zzso zzso We hypothesized that the zzso activity of zzso could be further improved by introducing the zzso motif in the fiber zzso and by deletion of the zzso zzso protein zzso In this study, the in zzso and in zzso zzso activity of zzso was investigated zzso on two pancreatic cancer cell lines zzso and zzso alone and in combination with zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso imaging was established to study the therapeutic response in zzso In addition, to confirm the specificity of zzso for zzso a zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso was zzso This zzso zzso expression system allows us to measure zzso replication by real-time zzso in the absence of zzso zzso The results confirmed the zzso dependency of zzso and showed that zzso has potent activity against human pancreatic cancer cells in zzso and in zzso which was zzso by the addition of zzso However, although high replication capacity was measured in zzso and in zzso complete tumor zzso was not zzso indicating the need for further improvements to treat pancreatic cancer zzso
