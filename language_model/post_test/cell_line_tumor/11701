zzso and zzso zzso 4 zzso play an important role in zzso zzso is also expressed in the human zzso cell line zzso zzso which has a high zzso ability and potential for spontaneous pulmonary zzso zzso stem cells zzso contribute to the formation of the tumor zzso and promote zzso However, mechanisms underlying the promotion of zzso growth and pulmonary zzso by zzso are still zzso Our study zzso the human zzso and zzso cells into the zzso vein of nude zzso The total number of tumor zzso per lung was significantly increased in the zzso group compared to the other groups zzso zzso cells alone and zzso zzso at week zzso Moreover, a high number of zzso zzso was present also at the zzso zzso sites in the zzso Using zzso zzso we found that zzso cells migrate towards zzso while the zzso inhibitor zzso decreased the migration potential of zzso cells towards zzso Furthermore, upon treatment with zzso zzso zzso expressed and zzso higher levels of zzso as determined by zzso western zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso cells, zzso expressed and zzso higher zzso levels, while zzso dramatically decreased the zzso zzso by zzso However, zzso expression on zzso cells was not significantly increased in the zzso zzso Additionally, zzso increased the proliferation of both zzso and zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso growth and pulmonary zzso are promoted by zzso through zzso
