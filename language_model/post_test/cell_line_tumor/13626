A small zzso zzso zzso was previously isolated from the zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso features of this natural product have never been zzso In present study, we described the zzso activities of zzso We found that zzso can decrease the viability and invasive potency of multiple cancer cell zzso Further zzso investigation demonstrates that cell cycles are arrested at zzso phase and the arrest is induced by zzso cell cycle zzso A zzso flow zzso analysis also shows that zzso can trigger massive zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso cancer cells is characterized by zzso of zzso membrane potential zzso and positive zzso zzso Finally, results from invasion zzso suggest that zzso can suppress tumor cell invasion independent of zzso zzso these data establish that zzso can effectively inhibit cancer cell growth and zzso prompting its potential use in cancer zzso
