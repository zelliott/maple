zzso of magnetic fields zzso on cancer cells may depend on cell type and exposure zzso Gene expression levels are different among cancer zzso However, the effect of zzso on cancer cells with different gene expressions is still zzso In this study, the cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were exposed to a zzso zzso zzso parameters of zzso were zzso Furthermore, the potential of the zzso to influence cancer cell growth with zzso zzso expression was zzso Cell proliferation and cell cycle were detected using the zzso zzso and flow zzso Cell zzso was observed by transmission electron zzso zzso cells with zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were generated by zzso construction and zzso zzso showed that exposure to a zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells, but not zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso effect of the zzso on zzso cells was lower zzso than that of zzso cells zzso Analysis of the cell cycle showed that exposure to the zzso led to a significant increase in the S phase in zzso cells, but not in zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso was modified in zzso cells exposed to the zzso These results suggest that exposure to a zzso zzso zzso zzso could inhibit tumor cell proliferation and disturb the cell zzso The zzso of zzso expression in cancer cells may be related to the zzso effect of the zzso on these zzso
