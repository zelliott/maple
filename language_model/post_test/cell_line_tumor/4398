The zzso zzso surrounding tumor zzso performs critical roles ranging from supporting tumor cell proliferation to inducing zzso and zzso zzso it is critical to understand the cellular components and signaling control mechanisms that zzso the zzso of zzso zzso Previous studies have individually implicated zzso growth factor zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso signaling in prostate cancer progression and the initiation and maintenance of a zzso zzso however, both pathways are frequently found to be zzso in cancer zzso Using zzso transgenic mouse models for zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso crosses between these lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso we describe zzso synergistic acceleration of zzso zzso associated with a pronounced zzso zzso zzso zzso surrounding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso found both in in zzso and zzso zzso Both mouse and human zzso zzso exhibited increased transforming growth zzso zzso signaling adjacent to zzso zzso likely contributing to zzso Furthermore, elevated zzso zzso signaling was associated with higher zzso scores in zzso human zzso mirroring zzso zzso Our findings establish the importance of the zzso signaling axes as driving forces behind zzso zzso in aggressive prostate zzso deepening their relevance as therapeutic zzso
