A new zzso cell line, zzso was derived from a primary zzso of human zzso zzso breast zzso The line consisted of zzso cells with occasional appearance of more differentiated zzso cells apparently involved in zzso zzso The zzso cells, population doubling time 34 zzso are dependent on the zzso growth zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated a stable zzso zzso with several genetic zzso zzso analysis of zzso in zzso revealed zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear protein zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso and other proteins indicative of a pattern of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso by zzso array also pointed to the character of zzso zzso In contrast, dominant cells in the human original tumor showed the zzso character zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, cells with the zzso profile similar to that of cultured zzso cells were found in minor clusters in the patient's tumor zzso The zzso cells formed limited tumors in zzso zzso The cells in mouse tumors were organized in primitive zzso structures consisting of 1-3 large central zzso cells zzso surrounded by peripheral zzso cells zzso The large central cells gradually zzso forming a zzso Apparently, zzso cells are able to partially differentiate in zzso as well as in zzso Our results indicate that zzso cells were derived from a zzso population of common zzso of zzso and zzso cells that were immortalized in an early stage of zzso
