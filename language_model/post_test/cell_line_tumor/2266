zzso a member of the zzso protein family, is involved in zzso and cellular differentiation by acting as a crucial zzso factor, but its role in cell cycle zzso remains zzso In the present study, zzso and zzso two cell cycle regulators, are shown to be zzso at the zzso and protein levels by zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, we demonstrate that the activities of zzso and zzso promoters were suppressed by the zzso of zzso levels and that zzso zzso promoter activities through a mechanism involving direct binding of zzso to the zzso Furthermore, it was identified that the site at zzso to zzso within the zzso promoter is responsible for zzso repression of the promoter zzso It was found that zzso zzso of zzso resulted in the suppression of cell cycle progression in zzso and zzso zzso zzso these data indicate that zzso and zzso are the downstream targets of zzso and zzso may be a cell cycle zzso by regulating the expression of cell zzso genes in liver cancer zzso
