To survive, cells must rapidly repair zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to increase cell survival in some cases and produce cell death in other zzso An zzso zzso zzso has been reported to decrease the probability of zzso zzso zzso Here we report that zzso damage produces zzso zzso as zzso by zzso blue zzso color change in rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is affected by duration of zzso deprivation and length of exposure to, and concentration of, zzso agents such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by 10 zzso to 50 zzso zzso or 100 zzso to 2 zzso zzso increases the probability of zzso zzso zzso whereas higher zzso of zzso decrease zzso probability and also damage zzso zzso We also show that antioxidants zzso zzso or reducing agents zzso decrease zzso zzso such as protein zzso A, zzso zzso and zzso factor zzso reported to enhance zzso in other zzso also enhance zzso in this zzso zzso In brief, our data show that zzso damage produces zzso zzso that increases the probability of zzso zzso which is strongly correlated with cell survival in other zzso Our results may provide new insights into the zzso and treatment of zzso neurodegenerative disorders, such as Parkinson's, zzso and Alzheimer's zzso
