zzso and their receptors have been studied in several solid tumor models as zzso of zzso In turn, inflammation has been implicated in the promotion and progression of tumors, and as such, zzso have been proposed as novel molecular targets for zzso While the expression of these molecules has been described in tumor cells, zzso cells, zzso and zzso less attention has been paid to the expression profile of these molecules by T zzso in the periphery or zzso the zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso zzso model, we aimed to better characterize the differential expression of zzso and/or their receptors in the host and in the tumor zzso and specifically, in the T cells of zzso mice compared to normal control zzso We found that T zzso from zzso mice express the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso
