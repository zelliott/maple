zzso zzso and zzso are important zzso zzso zzso which directly interact with zzso and target zzso for zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The interplay between zzso zzso zzso and zzso has not been reported, except the interaction between zzso and zzso Here, we reported that there were interactions between these four proteins independently of zzso The protein levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso changed when any two of them were zzso Our data also showed that the integrity of zzso zzso finger domain was crucial for its ability to elevate the protein levels of zzso and zzso Any two of these four proteins could inhibit zzso zzso activity zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibited zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso by zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso zzso and zzso might inhibit zzso activity zzso in zzso
