zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is a member of system zzso zzso essential for cells maintenance and zzso However, the role of zzso remains illegible in gastric cancer zzso In this study, we found that zzso was zzso zzso in both zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso and human zzso zzso The expression characteristic of zzso in zzso was significantly associated with zzso features such as tumor size, zzso zzso zzso local invasion and zzso zzso By suppressing the expression of zzso in zzso cells, the cell cycle was arrested in zzso phase, and the ability of cell proliferation was significantly decreased in zzso Moreover, the cell migration and invasion of zzso cells was significantly impaired by knocking down zzso Thus, our results suggest that zzso may function as an zzso in zzso which provides us a new zzso in zzso and perhaps a potential target for zzso zzso diagnose and therapeutic zzso
