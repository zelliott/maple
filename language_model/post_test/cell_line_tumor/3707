zzso zzso is a global human pathogen causing diseases ranging from blinding zzso to pelvic inflammatory zzso To explore how innate and zzso immune responses cooperate to protect against systemic infection with zzso zzso zzso we investigated the role of zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso in the stimulation of zzso zzso zzso T zzso We found that zzso zzso infection of zzso and zzso is far less productive than infection of zzso zzso the typical targets of zzso However, despite the limited replication of zzso zzso within zzso and zzso infected zzso and zzso process and present zzso zzso zzso T cell zzso in a zzso zzso These findings suggest that although zzso zzso is a zzso zzso some zzso expressed in infected zzso and zzso are processed in the host cell zzso for presentation to zzso T zzso We also show that even though zzso zzso replicates efficiently within zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso zzso presentation by zzso cells is essential for initial stimulation of zzso zzso zzso T zzso However, when zzso infected with zzso zzso ex zzso were zzso transferred into zzso mice, they failed to prime zzso zzso zzso T zzso We propose a model for zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells zzso zzso acquire zzso zzso zzso by engulfing zzso infected zzso zzso and then present the zzso to T cells via a mechanism of zzso
