zzso the frequency of T cell zzso to unrelated peptides is essential to understanding T cell responses in infectious and zzso zzso Here we used 15 mouse or human zzso T cell clones (11 zzso 4 zzso in conjunction with a large library of defined synthetic peptides to examine nearly 30,000 zzso zzso class I interactions for zzso We identified a single zzso consisting of an zzso zzso recognizing a zzso zzso at relatively low zzso We failed to identify any zzso between the synthetic peptides in the panel and zzso zzso T cells raised to viral or zzso These findings provide the best estimate to date of the frequency of T cell zzso to unrelated peptides ( approximately zzso explaining why zzso between unrelated pathogens are infrequently encountered and providing a critical zzso for understanding the scope of zzso
