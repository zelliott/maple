zzso between the zzso zzso human zzso leukemia virus type 1 zzso and zzso cells zzso are poorly zzso We show here that zzso zzso form zzso and are infected upon zzso with zzso zzso We examined the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso expressed in zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to bind with high affinity to various viral envelope zzso including human zzso virus zzso and zzso C virus, as well as to the cellular receptors zzso and zzso After zzso zzso and zzso cells, we found that zzso zzso zzso zzso were able to decrease the number and size of zzso zzso Moreover, expression of the zzso in zzso lines dramatically enhanced the ability to fuse with zzso zzso Interestingly, in contrast to the envelope zzso zzso of zzso and other zzso that of zzso does not bind directly to zzso The zzso role of the zzso in zzso zzso formation is zzso by its interaction with zzso and zzso as demonstrated by use of zzso directed against these zzso zzso Altogether, our results indicate that zzso zzso zzso infection and fusion of zzso through an zzso zzso
