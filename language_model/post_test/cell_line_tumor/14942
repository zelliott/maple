Several studies in the past have formed zzso zzso zzso of primary zzso in suspension zzso Unfortunately, primary zzso in a suspension environment tend to lose their differentiated function over time, generally due to damage from fluid zzso stress and eventual zzso zzso We have therefore created a novel suspension culture system, by seeding zzso rat zzso cells, a zzso cell line, in a zzso tissue culture polystyrene zzso plate placed atop an zzso shaker to create zzso zzso To provide stability to the formed zzso we used a zzso zzso bovine serum zzso zzso dissolved in the cell culture medium and/or coated on zzso surfaces placed in suspension zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso coating of culture surfaces resulted in uniform and zzso zzso with little zzso settling or zzso of cell colonies in either zzso or suspension zzso In zzso suspension systems, zzso size scaled with the amount of zzso dissolved in culture zzso In zzso zzso cultures, the zzso rat zzso production levels were enhanced by addition of zzso within culture zzso Thus, both addition of zzso to culture medium and application of zzso as a surface coating appear to be meaningful avenues for tailoring zzso zzso and zzso This zzso plate suspension culture system may be a valuable tool for high zzso investigations of liver cell behavior in a stable, uniform, zzso zzso zzso
