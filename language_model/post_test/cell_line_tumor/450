The zzso of a series of new zzso A derivatives with a zzso zzso zzso to the zzso bond of the zzso zzso have been investigated with regard to zzso zzso induction and cancer cell growth zzso zzso differences in zzso activity were observed between different zzso depending on the nature of the zzso at the zzso of the zzso zzso The most potent compounds showed comparable activity with the natural product zzso zzso Modeling studies provide a preliminary rationale for the observed zzso
