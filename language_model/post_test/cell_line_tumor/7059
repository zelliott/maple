zzso zzso zzso is a cancer with zzso poor responses to current therapeutic zzso This study evaluates whether zzso a novel zzso agent, is effective against human zzso cell lines and a zzso model of human zzso 

Cell growth zzso and viability zzso were performed on zzso zzso and zzso cell lines after zzso exposure to zzso zzso zzso Cell cycle analysis with zzso zzso terminal zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso electron zzso and response to the general zzso inhibitor zzso were performed on zzso cell lines after zzso exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso mice were given zzso injections of 20 zzso zzso zzso cells, followed by zzso zzso zzso or 20 zzso 3 zzso for up to 3 zzso zzso were assessed at day zzso All statistical tests were zzso 

A zzso exposure of zzso cells to zzso showed zzso of zzso zzso and 50% viability at zzso zzso zzso V zzso for zzso revealed significant increases in zzso binding after zzso exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which was significantly inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso cells exposed to zzso zzso zzso for zzso h showed terminal zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso consistent with zzso as well as structural evidence of zzso via electron zzso In zzso there were significant tumor reductions (62 to zzso zzso for all dosage regimens compared with zzso controls zzso zzso In addition, all control animals exhibited zzso and zzso tumors while treated animals did zzso 

zzso has significant zzso activity against zzso in zzso and in zzso in part, due to tumor cell zzso These findings warrant further study for potential clinical zzso
