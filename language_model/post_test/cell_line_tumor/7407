Some zzso have targeting selective zzso effects act on cell zzso but studies on this field were restricted by lack of zzso zzso This study was to establish a tumor cell membrane model, and isolate specific zzso zzso 

zzso peptides zzso and zzso were chosen as positive control peptides to zzso the artificially zzso tumor zzso cell membrane model, zzso display system was used to isolate specific zzso peptides from a designed random DNA library with affinity to membrane zzso zzso effects of the isolated peptides on zzso cell lung cancer cell line zzso were analyzed with zzso zzso 

After zzso successive selection with improved membrane model zzso zzso and zzso display system, some sequences of peptides were zzso In zzso experiment confirmed that some of them showed zzso effects on zzso cells, 50% zzso concentration zzso of peptides zzso and zzso of zzso cells were zzso zzso zzso zzso while on normal human zzso cell line zzso were more than 100 zzso 

zzso zzso peptides may be screened out by suitable tumor cell membrane model and zzso display system, which will help to develop new zzso zzso
