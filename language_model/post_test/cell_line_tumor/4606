Many zzso influence cell behavior by a zzso signaling cascade that promotes the stabilization and nuclear zzso of zzso zzso which then associates with zzso family members to activate target zzso The zzso zzso zzso binding protein zzso can bind to zzso and inhibit zzso signaling in zzso In contrast, studies in zzso indicate a positive role for zzso and the closely related protein zzso as zzso binding zzso zzso We address this zzso by demonstrating that in addition to its negative role, zzso has an essential positive role in zzso signaling in zzso zzso binds directly to the zzso of zzso zzso the fly zzso and is recruited to a zzso zzso zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso In a human zzso cancer cell line, we show that zzso and zzso can inhibit zzso signaling and demonstrate that human zzso can bind directly to zzso in zzso Our results argue that zzso has an zzso zzso role as a buffer regulating zzso zzso zzso to this interaction, it also has an essential role in zzso the zzso activity of zzso
