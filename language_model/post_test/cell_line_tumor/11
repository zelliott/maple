Despite substantial improvements in childhood cancer survival, drug resistance remains problematic for several zzso zzso zzso The urgent need to access novel agents to treat drug-resistant disease should be expedited by zzso evaluation of zzso zzso models during the early stages of drug development in adult cancer zzso 

The novel zzso zzso zzso is activated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso widely expressed in adult zzso zzso to a potent DNA zzso zzso In acute viability zzso against zzso zzso and Ewing's zzso cell lines zzso zzso values ranged from zzso zzso and drug potency correlated both with zzso levels and drug-induced zzso However, zzso between zzso and zzso or zzso was only seen in low zzso expressing cell zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso values ranged from zzso zzso and drug potency did not correlate with zzso zzso In zzso Ewing's zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in mice zzso induced zzso 24 h after a single zzso injection zzso zzso and daily dosing for 5 days delayed zzso growth relative to zzso 

The demonstration of zzso efficacy against zzso zzso cell lines, which was performed zzso with the adult Phase 1 zzso suggests that this agent may have clinical usefulness in childhood zzso
