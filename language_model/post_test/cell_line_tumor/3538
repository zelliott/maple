Pulmonary zzso frequently develop in patients with aggressive zzso cancer, yet investigation of this process at the molecular level suffers from the poor availability of human zzso tumor tissue and the absence of suitable animal zzso To address this, we developed progressively more zzso human zzso cancer cell lines and an in zzso zzso zzso model, and we successfully used these to identify genes of which the expression levels change according to the degree of pulmonary zzso zzso By initially zzso injecting the poorly zzso zzso human zzso cancer cells into nude mice, and then serially reintroducing and zzso the human tumor cells from the zzso mouse lung tumors, three zzso human lines with increasingly zzso zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso To identify the genes associated with the most zzso zzso the zzso complement from the parental and zzso cells was evaluated with zzso zzso In doing so, we found 121 genes to be progressively zzso during the transition from zzso to zzso whereas 43 genes were progressively zzso As expected, many of the genes identified in these groups could, according to the ascribed functions of their protein product, theoretically participate in tissue invasion and zzso In addition, the magnitude of gene expression changes observed during the zzso transition correlated with the in zzso propensity for earlier lung colonization and decreased host zzso To additionally define which genes found in the experimental system were of relevance to human zzso cancer lung zzso we evaluated gene expression profiles of 23 primary human zzso tumors of various stages and grades, and then we compared these gene expression profiles to the altered profiles in our model cell zzso Here we found that the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso were consistently and progressively zzso when viewed as a function of tumor stage in zzso of patients versus the zzso potential seen in the mouse lung zzso The strong correlation of these four markers between the experimental and clinical situations helps validate this system as a useful tool for the study of lung zzso and defines targets of therapy that may reduce the zzso of this process in zzso
