zzso zzso zzso is a novel zzso agent expressed in some zzso of normal and zzso cells, including acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso expression zzso with increased circulating zzso T cells in patients with zzso at zzso In zzso zzso zzso cells increase the number of zzso zzso T cells expressing surface zzso and zzso zzso and this effect is completely zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells obtained from zzso with zzso zzso cells act as T regulatory zzso cells because they do not zzso do not produce zzso zzso and inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso cells results in the conversion of zzso into zzso T cells, which is completely zzso by zzso Moreover, in mice, zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso the expansion of bona fide zzso cells by conversion of zzso T zzso this effect is zzso by zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso cells induce zzso tolerance by directly converting zzso T cells into zzso zzso cells through an zzso zzso
