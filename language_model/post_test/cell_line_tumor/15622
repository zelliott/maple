The objective of the study was to evaluate the utility of zzso a replication competent, zzso zzso zzso virus zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso as primary treatment for zzso tumors and to further assess its ability to reduce tumor recurrence following zzso zzso is the most effective therapy for zzso zzso but is not possible in the majority of the zzso Furthermore, recurrence is common after zzso most often in the remnant liver and likely because of microscopic residual disease in the setting of zzso host cellular immune zzso We zzso that, unlike other gene transfer approaches, direct injection of liver tumors with replication competent, zzso zzso expressing zzso will not only provide effective control of the parent zzso but will also elicit an immune response directed at residual tumor cells, thus decreasing the risk of cancer recurrence after zzso zzso Morris zzso established in Buffalo rat zzso were injected directly with zzso particles of zzso zzso an zzso zzso identical to zzso but without the zzso zzso or with zzso Following tumor injection, the parent tumors were zzso and measured and the animals were challenged with an zzso injection of zzso tumor cells, zzso the clinical scenario of residual microscopic zzso In zzso zzso against Morris zzso cells was similar for both viruses at a zzso of infection of 1 zzso ratio of viral particles to target zzso with zzso tumor cell kill by day zzso zzso induced high-level expression of zzso in zzso zzso after 4 days in zzso Furthermore, a single zzso injection of zzso but not zzso induced marked zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both viruses induced a significant local immune response as evidenced by an increase in the number of zzso zzso and zzso zzso although the peak of zzso zzso was later with zzso compared with zzso zzso and zzso reduced parent tumor volume by zzso ( zzso and zzso ( zzso respectively, compared to control zzso Treatment of established tumors with zzso but not with zzso significantly reduced the number of zzso tumors after zzso of the parent tumor and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in control animals, zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso therapy combined with local immune stimulation with zzso offers effective control of parent zzso tumors and also protects against microscopic residual disease after zzso The ease of use of this combined zzso approach, which appears to be superior to either approach alone, suggests that it may have clinical zzso both as primary treatment for patients with zzso tumors and also as a zzso strategy for reducing recurrence after zzso
