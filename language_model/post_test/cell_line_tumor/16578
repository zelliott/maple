zzso lung zzso zzso and selective pulmonary artery zzso zzso are experimental surgical techniques to deliver high-dose chemotherapy selectively to the lung for the treatment of lung zzso zzso with zzso zzso has shown to be feasible in clinical studies but can only be used once because it is zzso zzso as an zzso technique can be repeated several times, but no results have been reported so zzso zzso and efficacy of zzso with MN were studied in a zzso lung zzso model and compared it with zzso and intravenous zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso rats were zzso into three groups: IV zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso MN and zzso zzso zzso zzso Every treatment group was again zzso in three groups: 15 zzso treatment, 30 zzso treatment and 30 zzso treatment with 30 zzso zzso Blood and tissue samples were taken for MN zzso 

zzso zzso rats were zzso into five groups: control, sham zzso IV zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso MN and zzso zzso zzso zzso At day 0, bilateral lung zzso were zzso and treatment followed at day zzso At day 28, rats were sacrificed and pulmonary zzso zzso zzso thirty zzso rats were zzso into five groups: control, sham zzso IV zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso At day 0, zzso zzso were induced with treatment at day zzso zzso were death due to disease or survival up to 90 zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso resulted in significantly higher left lung MN zzso compared with IV zzso zzso zzso 

zzso (30 zzso 22 zzso and zzso (20 zzso 9 zzso resulted in significantly less zzso compared with IV zzso zzso 17 zzso P zzso zzso zzso median survival of zzso zzso zzso 8 zzso was equal to zzso MN (71 zzso 10 zzso but significantly longer compared with IV (54 zzso 7 zzso P zzso zzso zzso 

zzso with MN for the treatment of zzso lung zzso in rats is equally effective to zzso but resulted in a significantly better survival compared with IV zzso As zzso can be applied as a minimally invasive zzso zzso continued research with this technique is zzso
