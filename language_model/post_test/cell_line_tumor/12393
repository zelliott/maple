The aim of this study was to investigate the protective effect of zzso towards zzso DNA damage in the zzso gel zzso zzso zzso None of the zzso zzso zzso tested in the presence or absence of zzso zzso zzso caused DNA damage per zzso Combined treatments of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso reduced the zzso effects of the zzso in a zzso zzso The protective effect of the three zzso tested was higher towards zzso zzso DNA damage than against zzso The greatest protective effect towards zzso zzso DNA damage was shown by zzso (1 zzso zzso and by zzso (1 zzso zzso and zzso (1 zzso zzso towards zzso (in presence of zzso zzso However, in absence of zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso exerted the most drastic reduction towards zzso zzso DNA damage, and zzso (1 zzso zzso towards zzso Our results indicate that zzso protect zzso cells against the DNA damaging effect of zzso and zzso two zzso compounds that occur in the zzso
