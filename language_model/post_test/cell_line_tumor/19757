zzso are highly lethal zzso that cannot be cured by currently available zzso zzso is a recently introduced zzso agent that has yielded a significant benefit in the treatment of high-grade zzso However, either de zzso or acquired zzso occurs frequently and has been attributed to increased levels of zzso zzso or to the loss of mismatch repair zzso However, very few zzso zzso zzso zzso or are mismatch zzso suggesting that other mechanisms may be involved in the resistance to zzso The purpose of the present study was to generate zzso zzso from a human zzso cell line zzso and to use large-scale zzso and zzso analyses to study the molecular basis of acquired zzso zzso Two independently obtained zzso zzso exhibited no zzso to other zzso agents zzso and zzso and shared genetic zzso such as loss of a zzso region and loss of amplification of zzso 4 and zzso zzso The zzso zzso were compatible with zzso selection of zzso resistant cells in the parental zzso cell zzso zzso analysis showed that 78 out of 17,000 genes were zzso expressed between parental cells and both zzso zzso None are implicated in known resistance mechanisms, such as DNA repair, whereas interestingly, several genes involved in differentiation were zzso The data suggest that the acquisition of resistance to zzso in this model resulted from the selection of less differentiated zzso resistant cells in the parental zzso
