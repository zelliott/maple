The mechanisms by which zzso zzso zzso zzso exerts cellular effects are not fully zzso To zzso these mechanisms, we systematically and zzso assessed the activities of human group zzso zzso and X zzso on originating and neighboring cells using zzso zzso zzso in various mixed cell zzso When zzso cells zzso expressing each of these zzso were mixed with zzso zzso cells, group V and X zzso showed strong zzso zzso activity, whereas group zzso zzso exhibited much lower zzso zzso The zzso activity of group V zzso was highly dependent on the presence of cell surface zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso cells that express zzso group V zzso led to the zzso of group V zzso and its zzso action on neighboring human zzso and zzso zzso Similarly, zzso of human zzso zzso cells, zzso caused large increases in zzso acid and zzso C4 release from neighboring human zzso zzso these studies show that group V and X zzso can act zzso on zzso cells and suggest that group V zzso released from neighboring cells may function in triggering the zzso of inflammatory cells under zzso zzso
