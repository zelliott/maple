We have previously shown that zzso 7 zzso expression is increased during the acquisition of resistance to zzso in colon cancer zzso Now we have analyzed the implication of zzso and zzso pathways in the zzso of zzso in the zzso human colon cancer cell lines zzso and zzso zzso derived from the zzso and zzso zzso cells, zzso 

zzso treatment increased zzso expression and induced its zzso in all the cell zzso However, zzso zzso was only zzso in the zzso and zzso cells, with a marked increase in the zzso zzso protein ratio in the zzso zzso zzso To determine the contribution of zzso and zzso to the expression of zzso we performed zzso zzso zzso zzso only prevented the induction of zzso by zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso viability of zzso zzso cells under zzso zzso was zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso induced contradictory effects, decreasing zzso and zzso expression in control and zzso zzso zzso cells but increasing zzso and zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso is zzso achieved in colon cancer cell lines, as a result of zzso and zzso zzso on zzso gene zzso Taken together, our results point out the disparity of effects that zzso and zzso blocking therapeutic strategies may exert on zzso expression depending on the cellular context and remark the importance of a better knowledge of zzso regulation to improve chemotherapy effectiveness in colon zzso
