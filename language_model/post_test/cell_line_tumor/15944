New derivatives based upon the zzso and zzso scaffolds were zzso All compounds were evaluated for their ability to inhibit zzso in zzso and numerous compounds with zzso values in the low zzso range were identified including compounds derived from zzso zzso with high potency versus zzso were then evaluated for zzso activity against other zzso to assess zzso zzso zzso zzso 14 showed a selectivity index of zzso for zzso zzso by zzso versus zzso Meanwhile, zzso 45 demonstrated strong potency for zzso of zzso with an zzso value of 11 zzso representing the most potent zzso inhibitor thus far zzso zzso experiments differentiated between active and inactive zzso and revealing the zzso zzso and zzso zzso for potent zzso zzso Many zzso including potent zzso zzso were able to inhibit the growth of the zzso breast tumor cell line with low zzso zzso
