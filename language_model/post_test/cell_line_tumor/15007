The zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso has become increasingly recognized for its role in the differentiation and activity of immune cell zzso however, its role in regulating the activity of natural killer zzso cells has not been zzso Here, we show that zzso expression is induced in zzso zzso cells upon zzso zzso We show that in the absence of zzso zzso cells have reduced zzso activity and reduced capacity to control zzso tumor formation in zzso despite having normal development and maturation zzso Although zzso was first identified to bind the zzso compound zzso zzso is now known to bind a variety of natural zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We show that zzso of zzso with an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso production and zzso zzso Further, administration of zzso in zzso enhances zzso cell control of tumors in an zzso zzso and zzso zzso Finally, similar effects on zzso cell potency occur with zzso dietary zzso potentially explaining the numerous associations that have been observed in the past between diet and zzso cell zzso Our studies introduce zzso as another regulator of zzso cell activity in zzso
