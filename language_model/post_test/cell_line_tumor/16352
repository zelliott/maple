zzso zzso has become an important therapeutic strategy for cancer treatment but, like other current targeted therapies, benefits experienced for late-stage zzso can be curtailed by inherent zzso or by acquired drug resistance, requiring a need for better zzso understanding of such zzso Numerous zzso studies have demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso suppress primary zzso growth and zzso However, it has been recently reported that short-term zzso and zzso zzso can paradoxically accelerate zzso zzso and zzso in certain zzso Here we zzso compare the effects of both zzso and small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting the zzso pathway, using short-term therapy in various mouse models of zzso Our findings demonstrate that zzso zzso of zzso zzso molecules does not promote zzso in contrast to selected small zzso zzso zzso at zzso drug zzso In particular, a zzso zzso zzso zzso which most profoundly zzso zzso also increased lung vascular zzso and promoted zzso cell zzso zzso zzso but not zzso treatment, attenuated zzso barrier function in culture and caused a global zzso of protein zzso zzso including molecules important for maintaining zzso zzso zzso Together these findings indicate that, rather than a specific consequence of zzso the zzso zzso pathway, pharmacological zzso of the zzso zzso can have zzso and drug zzso zzso on the host zzso These findings also advocate for the continued identification of mechanisms of resistance to zzso and for therapy development to overcome zzso
