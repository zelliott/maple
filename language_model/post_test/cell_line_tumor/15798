Although herbs have long been alternatively applied for cancer treatment in China, its treatment effects and their potential mechanisms have not been sufficiently zzso The zzso herb zzso zzso zzso is commonly prescribed to cancer zzso In this study, the zzso effect of SS and its molecular mechanisms have been zzso 

The effect of SS on cell proliferation was studied by cell growth zzso and flow zzso on breast cancer cell lines zzso and colon cancer cell line zzso The role of SS in zzso was studied by flow zzso DNA fragmentation zzso and zzso membrane potential zzso zzso of proteins associated with cell cycle and zzso was determined by Western zzso zzso The in zzso effect of SS was tested in nude mouse cancer zzso 

Cell growth zzso showed that SS effectively zzso tumor cell growth in a zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that SS could arrest the cell cycle at zzso checkpoint, which is associated with DNA damage and zzso of zzso The zzso effect of SS was demonstrated by zzso zzso zzso and zzso membrane potential zzso In zzso experiments show that the efficiency of SS alone group was superior to zzso or to zzso and SS zzso No obvious body weight loss or blood toxicity was observed in SS tested zzso 

Our data demonstrates that SS is a potential herb for cancer treatment by zzso tumor growth via induction of zzso and arrest of the cell cycle at zzso zzso
