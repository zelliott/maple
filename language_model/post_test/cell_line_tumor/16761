zzso of zzso tumor DNA in the blood has offered promise as a cancer zzso but practical clinical zzso have been zzso by the lack of a sensitive and accurate method for zzso that is also simple, zzso and readily zzso Here we present an approach that uses next-generation sequencing to zzso the small fraction of DNA molecules that contain zzso zzso within a background of normal DNA in zzso Using layers of sequence zzso designed to distinguish true zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso we achieved a detection sensitivity of approximately 1 zzso in 5,000 zzso In addition, the attachment of modular zzso tags to the DNA fragments to be zzso facilitated the simultaneous analysis of more than 100 patient zzso As zzso we showed the successful use of this method to follow zzso changes in circulating tumor DNA levels in patients with zzso cell lung zzso Our findings suggest that the deep sequencing approach described here may be applied to the development of a practical diagnostic test that measures zzso DNA levels in zzso
