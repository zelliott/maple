In the present study, we have used the gene expression data available in the zzso database in an attempt to identify zzso molecular zzso Of 129 genes with more than zzso difference found by comparison of nine zzso with five normal brain zzso libraries, 44 increased their expression in zzso Most corresponding proteins were involved in zzso zzso immune zzso zzso resistance, zzso zzso zzso formation, zzso or zzso zzso Among them, 16 genes had a high expression both in zzso and in zzso cell lines suggesting their expression in transformed zzso Other 28 genes had an increased expression only in zzso not in zzso cell lines suggesting an expression possibly originated from host zzso Many of these genes are among the top transcripts in activated zzso and involved in immune response and zzso This altered pattern of gene expression in both host and tumor cells, can be viewed as a molecular marker in the analysis of zzso progression of zzso tumors, and as possible clues for the mechanism of zzso Moreover, several genes zzso in zzso produce zzso zzso thereby providing possible therapeutic zzso Further characterization of these genes will thus allow them to be exploited in molecular zzso of zzso tumors, diagnosis, zzso and zzso zzso
