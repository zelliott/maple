zzso is a zzso collected by bees from plant buds and zzso which is further processed through the activity of bee zzso zzso has been shown to possess many biological and pharmacological properties, such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Due to this zzso profile, this zzso can become an alternative, economic and safe source of natural zzso zzso action has been reported in zzso and in zzso for zzso extracts or its isolated zzso however, Portuguese zzso has been little zzso The aim of this work was to evaluate the in zzso zzso activity of Portuguese zzso on the human colon zzso cell line zzso assessing the effect of different zzso zzso zzso and ethanol zzso of a zzso ethanol extract on cell zzso zzso metabolism and zzso 

zzso from zzso do zzso zzso was extracted with ethanol and zzso zzso in zzso with increasing zzso zzso and zzso To assess cell zzso cell proliferation and cell death, zzso B, zzso incorporation zzso and zzso zzso zzso were used, zzso zzso metabolism was estimated using specific zzso 

All zzso samples exhibited a zzso effect against tumor cells, in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the most enriched in zzso compounds, appears to be the most active, both in terms of zzso of viability and cell zzso Data also show that this zzso involves zzso in tumor cell zzso zzso seen by a decrease in zzso consumption and zzso zzso 

Our results show that Portuguese zzso from zzso do zzso zzso can be a potential therapeutic agent against human zzso zzso
