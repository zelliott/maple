One of the major risk factors for zzso is the plasma level of zzso zzso zzso which is a product of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the essential component that provides structural stability to zzso zzso zzso translated zzso is partially zzso in the zzso zzso zzso forming nascent zzso zzso These particles are further modified to form fully mature zzso in the zzso zzso zzso the transport of nascent zzso from the zzso to the zzso represents a critical step during zzso maturation and zzso and in regulating serum LDL cholesterol zzso Our previous studies showed that zzso exits the zzso in coat complex II zzso zzso but the cohort of related factors that control trafficking is poorly zzso 

zzso levels of zzso protein 12 zzso an zzso protein known to assist zzso transport of zzso were manipulated by using a zzso small interfering zzso and a zzso expression zzso in the rat zzso cell line, McArdle zzso zzso zzso decreased the zzso and zzso pools of zzso an effect that was attenuated in the presence of an zzso zzso zzso zzso also significantly reduced zzso of the most zzso zzso species and led to the zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso with these data, zzso zzso increased zzso recovery and zzso zzso Images obtained from zzso zzso revealed zzso of zzso and zzso further supporting a direct link between zzso function and zzso trafficking from the zzso 

zzso plays a critical role in zzso the zzso exit and zzso of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso would influence plasma zzso zzso
