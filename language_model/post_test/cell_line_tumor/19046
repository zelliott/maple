zzso recognition toward specific cells is a key issue for effective disease, such as cancer, diagnosis and zzso Although many molecular zzso such as zzso and zzso can recognize the unique molecular signatures of cancer cells, some of these zzso only have relatively weak binding zzso This results in poor signaling and zzso cell zzso Here, we use zzso zzso zzso as a zzso for zzso binding by multiple zzso on the rod to increase both the signal and binding strengths of these zzso in cancer cell zzso Up to 80 zzso zzso can be attached on a 12 zzso zzso 56 zzso zzso resulting in a much stronger zzso signal than that of an individual zzso zzso zzso The molecular assembly of zzso on the zzso surfaces also significantly improves the binding affinity with cancer cells through simultaneous zzso interactions with the cell membrane zzso This leads to an affinity at least zzso higher than the intrinsic affinity of the original zzso zzso As determined by flow zzso zzso an enhancement in zzso signal in excess of zzso is obtained for the zzso cells compared with those labeled by individual zzso zzso zzso the molecular assembly of zzso clearly shows potential applications for the zzso of cells with low density of binding sites, or with relatively weak binding zzso and can thus greatly improve our ability to perform cellular imaging and zzso This is an excellent example of using zzso to develop advanced molecular zzso with greatly improved properties for cellular zzso
