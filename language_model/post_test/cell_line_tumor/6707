Chemical zzso based on the zzso zzso cleave DNA zzso and/or zzso with or without added zzso We report here the novel DNA zzso properties of the highly zzso zzso zzso complex, together with the results of zzso toward selected cancer cell zzso The copper complex zzso zzso zzso DNA efficiently without any zzso and shows high zzso toward zzso zzso leukemia and zzso human zzso zzso cancer cell lines that are sensitive and resistant to zzso The zzso values obtained for the copper complex in the sensitive cell lines are in the range of zzso and for the zzso leukemia cell line, this value is even zzso
