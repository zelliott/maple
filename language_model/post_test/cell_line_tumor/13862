zzso resistance following initial chemotherapy is commonly associated with zzso gene zzso for zzso zzso zzso interference of zzso gene expression was used as a strategy to reverse zzso zzso resistance zzso Here we report that zzso small interfering zzso zzso at zzso as low as 10 zzso (about zzso zzso can decrease zzso expression and increase zzso in the zzso resistant zzso zzso When zzso cells were zzso zzso with zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso was reduced by about zzso drug zzso increased by about zzso and the zzso for zzso was reduced from zzso to zzso zzso These results provide evidence that zzso of zzso could be an alternative to zzso zzso with the advantage of avoiding zzso suppression with a lower effective dosage than using a single zzso duplex, offering a potential therapeutic application of zzso
