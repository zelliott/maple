The sustained growth of tumors zzso zzso As one of the potent zzso vascular zzso zzso has been widely used in zzso therapy for zzso zzso is normally administered in chemotherapy for lung cancer but accompanied with serious side zzso In the current study, we investigated a novel zzso therapeutic strategy to both improve toxic effects on lung cancer cells and reduce damages to normal cells in the zzso zzso 

In zzso we zzso LLC cells with zzso and collected zzso Western zzso analysis of the zzso revealed expression of zzso In zzso to fully investigate the suppression effect on zzso lung cancer of the combination therapy, we injected zzso human zzso zzso zzso plus a low dose of zzso zzso zzso The tumor volume and survival time were zzso zzso was apparently inhibited within the tumor zzso and on the zzso zzso Assessment of zzso cells by the zzso zzso was conducted in the tumor zzso 

The combination treatment significantly suppressed the tumor growth and prolonged survival time of the zzso LLC tumor zzso This zzso activity was associated with decreased zzso density and increased zzso index of tumor zzso 

According to the results in this study, zzso human zzso zzso in combination with a low dose of zzso demonstrated apparent synergistic zzso activity without marked zzso Thus, these observations may provide a rational alternative for lung cancer zzso
