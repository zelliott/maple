To clarify the molecular basis of acquired zzso zzso resistance in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso we used zzso zzso zzso A zzso cell line zzso which shows a zzso increase in resistance to zzso and a zzso decrease in zzso zzso compared with the parental zzso zzso cell line, was generated from zzso by exposure to increased zzso of zzso By zzso zzso analysis, we identified 44 genes with significantly different expression levels between zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, 15 of these 44 genes zzso zzso zzso almost all of which were zzso in zzso zzso Our present data suggest that many zzso genes may be involved in the acquired resistance to zzso in zzso and that such information may allow us to better understand the mechanism of zzso zzso
