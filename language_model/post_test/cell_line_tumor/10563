zzso of zzso immunity has been previously demonstrated in zzso zzso zzso However, only a limited number of zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified, and few of which are associated with zzso zzso Here, we identified zzso zzso 3 zzso as a zzso through screening of a random zzso library in the zzso display zzso zzso of zzso markedly promoted cell zzso attenuated zzso and zzso expressions in zzso zzso cells, and permitted the cells to grow in zzso zzso in zzso expression in high-grade zzso cells consistently demonstrated its zzso potency by modulating the protein levels of cell cycle zzso When the expressions of zzso and zzso were compared in cancer zzso zzso zzso studies indicated that zzso zzso was highly expressed in zzso of the zzso cancer zzso In contrast, it was rarely detected in zzso zzso and normal zzso zzso showing its higher specificity zzso to zzso zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, experiments using pharmacological zzso to block zzso zzso expression revealed that zzso of zzso and zzso were critically required for its biological activity, suggesting that they are the downstream signaling zzso of zzso These data were further supported by zzso studies, showing zzso of zzso with zzso in zzso of the zzso tumor samples stained positive for zzso zzso our findings indicate that zzso is a novel zzso zzso zzso of zzso promotes zzso cell cycle zzso zzso survival advantages to cancer cells for growth and zzso the zzso conditions of patients with zzso zzso
