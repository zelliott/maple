zzso zzso yields two distinct zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso varying their zzso structure in human zzso cancer, in which zzso expression is commonly zzso In this study, we characterized the function of these zzso in modulating zzso cancer zzso zzso expression of either zzso or zzso in zzso zzso cancer cells reduced expression of zzso zzso and zzso while increasing zzso and enhancing zzso zzso zzso with these zzso properties, zzso and zzso each diminished invasive behavior in zzso and reduced tumor growth and zzso in zzso zzso these effects contrasted with those produced by expression of these zzso zzso in zzso in which they both zzso cell zzso Moreover, in zzso tumors generated by zzso of zzso and zzso cells expressing that same zzso there was no significant effect on tumor zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells yielded higher zzso expression that, in the presence of zzso zzso enhanced tumor zzso Together, our findings highlight the importance of cellular context in assigning growth properties to growth factor zzso zzso More specifically, they show how alternative zzso of zzso yields zzso critical to the zzso actions of zzso that exert distinct zzso effects in zzso zzso
