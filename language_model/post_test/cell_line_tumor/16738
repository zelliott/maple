The present study aimed to investigate the influence of zzso interference with a zzso inducing zzso zzso gene on gastric zzso zzso cell zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression were also zzso 

Two zzso zzso zzso were constructed, and zzso into human gastric zzso zzso cells, expression before and after zzso being detected using zzso and western zzso zzso The expression of 15 zzso genes was detected using zzso zzso and zzso rates of zzso were assessed by flow zzso 

The expression levels of zzso zzso genes were significantly zzso and the zzso rate of zzso was significantly increased after zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso gene zzso can increase the zzso rate of gastric zzso cells, and inhibit the expression of zzso zzso zzso There is a correlation between the signaling pathways of zzso and zzso
