To compare the zzso in zzso between zzso and zzso human zzso cancer zzso cells, and to explore the feasibility of zzso in research about zzso mechanisms of agents, zzso cells were exposed to zzso (6 zzso for 6 zzso Then, the cells were collected and zzso and global proteins were extracted by zzso zzso two-dimensional zzso was conducted with the zzso zzso as zzso the gels were stained with zzso blue and zzso between gels were compared by zzso Eventually, 11 spots with significant differences were selected and excised and the proteins were identified by zzso and zzso zzso The results revealed that exposure to zzso could notably increase expressions of some zzso such as zzso family, zzso family, zzso zzso family, and zzso zzso while expressions of some other proteins zzso such as zzso family, zzso Those proteins were involved in cellular energy zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which suggested that zzso of those zzso processes might be involved in zzso mechanism of zzso
