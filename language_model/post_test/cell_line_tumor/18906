Almost all drugs used in zzso zzso virus zzso and zzso therapies require membrane proteins to get into the cell to develop their proper zzso Nevertheless, little is known regarding the expression and activity of specific carriers involved in the zzso of these drugs in immune zzso Here, we assessed the zzso levels, protein expression profile, and activity of the gene families zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Both zzso and zzso were abundant in primary zzso with a preferential activity of zzso A significant zzso in zzso expression zzso and activity zzso was seen under stimulation of primary T zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso and immature zzso zzso cells predominantly expressed zzso a functional zzso in zzso Finally, in immune cells, zzso showed a more zzso expression profile and a lower activity than human zzso zzso zzso although zzso of zzso also occurred upon zzso zzso Overall, the expression and activity of most of the studied zzso emphasize their relevance in relation to zzso and zzso zzso The identification of the zzso involved in each specific drug zzso in immune cells could help to zzso pharmacological therapeutic zzso
