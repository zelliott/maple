zzso zzso zzso is the initial and zzso zzso for zzso acid zzso zzso of the zzso gene is regulated by zzso zzso nuclear receptors and zzso zzso growth factor 7 zzso zzso from activated zzso zzso cells zzso during chronic liver zzso regulates zzso survival and liver zzso In the carbon zzso zzso zzso mouse liver, we demonstrated that the expression of zzso was largely decreased while the expression of zzso was significantly zzso We further demonstrated that zzso inhibited zzso gene expression in zzso zzso study by short interfering zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed that the suppression of zzso expression by zzso was zzso by zzso and its downstream zzso signaling zzso The zzso zzso zzso restored zzso expression in zzso cells treated with zzso medium from zzso In zzso the data suggest that zzso is a novel regulator of zzso expression in zzso and may prevent zzso from accumulating toxic zzso acids during liver injury and zzso
