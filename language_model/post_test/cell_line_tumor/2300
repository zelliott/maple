The purpose of this study is to develop a specific and efficient targeted gene therapy candidate approach for zzso zzso Several promoters of human zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso genes were cloned from human zzso DNA and evaluated for zzso zzso potential in human zzso zzso zzso cells by dual zzso zzso One zzso promoter zzso zzso showed the highest efficiency and zzso and was used to control the expression of a zzso active zzso zzso which could trigger zzso without zzso of its upstream cascade elements once expressed in a cell, in an zzso zzso zzso and its zzso efficacy was zzso In zzso infection with zzso showed zzso could be specifically expressed in zzso cells, resulting in efficient zzso of zzso zzso and subsequent zzso of zzso zzso In zzso nude mice zzso model, zzso administration of zzso significantly inhibited tumor growth without obvious loss of body weight and obvious zzso zzso In zzso our study showed the specific and efficient zzso potential of zzso and this makes it a new candidate approach of targeted gene therapy for zzso zzso cell zzso which needs further systematic zzso
