Members of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso family represent validated targets for zzso therapy and zzso zzso have also shown efficacy in pancreatic zzso We here described in detail molecular forms of the zzso zzso released by pancreatic cancer zzso We found peptides specific for the zzso in the zzso of five pancreatic cancer cell zzso zzso from cultured cancer cells are widely used as sources for serum zzso zzso 

The detailed analysis of zzso forms in zzso of human pancreatic cancer cells is a compilation of results from mass zzso zzso and Western zzso with zzso and zzso domain specific zzso 

zzso cancer cells zzso a 110 zzso soluble form of the zzso zzso representing the zzso binding zzso zzso zzso and presumably released by zzso zzso At the same time, as constituents of zzso the zzso is released as full-length intact zzso zzso zzso and as a 65 zzso processed form, the zzso remnant zzso that zzso to the zzso zzso zzso 

The detailed characterization of diverse zzso forms released by pancreatic cancer cells in zzso and presumably in zzso bears important implications for functional studies, for the validation of soluble zzso as a serum zzso and for the design of targeted zzso
