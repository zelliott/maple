zzso zzso virus zzso has recently gained attention for its zzso ability in cancer zzso Initially, we hypothesized that zzso infection could increase immune recognition of cancer cells through induction of the immune zzso zzso Here we show that zzso infection leads to a robust induction of zzso zzso zzso however the subsequent surface expression is zzso zzso Thus, zzso lines up with human zzso zzso and zzso which actively zzso the immune system by zzso affecting zzso surface zzso zzso infection caused an active suppression of zzso surface zzso affecting both zzso and zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso and zzso zzso The classical immune escape mechanism of zzso zzso the M protein blockade of zzso zzso zzso was not involved, as the zzso zzso strain, zzso which possess a defective M zzso prevented zzso surface expression similarly to zzso zzso The zzso zzso down zzso of zzso expression did not involve zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso the escape zzso suggesting that zzso affect zzso expression at an early zzso zzso Our results show that zzso possess an escape zzso which could affect the immune recognition of zzso infected cancer zzso This may also have implications for immune recognition of cancer cells after combined treatment with zzso and zzso zzso
