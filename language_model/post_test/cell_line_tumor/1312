We previously reported that the zzso form of zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso is a potent zzso agent efficient against numerous tumor cell lines in zzso and in zzso In acute toxicity studies, doses of zzso equivalent to zzso of the parental drug were completely zzso zzso direct effect on zzso cell growth, zzso zzso certain type of cells to tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso In this study, we evaluated the effects of zzso on zzso prostate cancer zzso zzso inhibited both the growth of zzso cells in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso of tumor growth was accompanied with cell cycle arrest in G zzso 1 phase and established a persistent zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso reverted sensitivity of zzso cells to TRAIL but not to zzso Treatment of cells with zzso induced transient zzso of zzso and zzso This, however, did not represent the primary mode of action of zzso as elimination with specific zzso did not compromise the zzso efficacy of the zzso However, permanent zzso of zzso of the zzso zzso which is the downstream target of both signaling zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with zzso sensitivity to TRAIL and reduction of zzso inhibitor of zzso protein zzso In zzso NO modification of zzso led to a new chemical entity with stronger and more zzso zzso activity than the parental zzso
