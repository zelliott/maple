zzso zzso zzso zzso are emerging as a promising biological target for cancer and zzso Using a zzso zzso we tested the zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso natural zzso a widespread group of natural products with well-known zzso and zzso zzso Since zzso regulate the expression of the zzso factor zzso we also evaluated the zzso potential of the compounds on zzso zzso Only four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso showed zzso zzso activity with zzso values of zzso whereas a number of compounds inhibited zzso zzso zzso with zzso values in the range of zzso zzso Interestingly, three zzso zzso 12 and zzso inhibited both zzso zzso activity and total zzso activity of classes I, II and zzso zzso modeling and zzso studies were performed to shed light into dual activity and to draw zzso relationships among zzso zzso To the best of our knowledge this is the first study that provides evidence for zzso as potential drug targets for natural zzso The dual zzso potential of the selected zzso on zzso and zzso was investigated for the first zzso This study demonstrates that zzso can serve as lead compounds in the development of dual zzso against both targets in the treatment of inflammation and zzso
