zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso also known as zzso is a member of the zzso growth factor zzso family, which binds directly to zzso and zzso and zzso zzso Because zzso signaling has been implicated in various zzso mechanisms, the effect of zzso (which has at least nine zzso due to alternative zzso in zzso is zzso One zzso zzso inhibited cell growth in terms of DNA synthesis and cell numbers in vascular zzso cells specifically, whereas zzso and beta had no zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso by zzso zzso cells inhibited zzso cell growth, and zzso expressed in zzso cells by zzso infection suppressed cell growth in a zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso did not have this zzso The zzso zzso which had the zzso domain but not the zzso domain, inhibited proliferation of zzso zzso zzso prevented zzso of the zzso tumor zzso protein and caused zzso arrest in zzso zzso Both zzso and delta zzso displayed zzso activity in the chick zzso zzso membrane in zzso These results suggest that the active site of zzso is localized outside of the zzso domain but within the zzso region, including the zzso domain, of zzso
