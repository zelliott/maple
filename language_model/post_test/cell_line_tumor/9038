Many tumors are stiffer than their surrounding zzso This increase in zzso has been zzso in part, to a zzso zzso of zzso II light chain zzso To characterize this mechanism further, we studied zzso light chain zzso zzso the main zzso that zzso zzso II light zzso We anticipated that increases in zzso expression and activity would contribute to the increased zzso of cancer zzso However, we find that zzso zzso and protein levels are substantially less in cancer cells and zzso than in normal zzso zzso with this zzso cancer cells contract zzso collagen zzso much more slowly than normal zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso or zzso zzso did not affect the zzso gel zzso while zzso partially and zzso D zzso inhibited zzso Live cell imaging of cells in collagen gels showed that zzso D inhibited zzso projections that formed between cells while a zzso inhibitor had no effect on these zzso These data suggest that zzso II zzso is zzso in regulating the mechanical properties of zzso
