zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso the cellular zzso of zzso and is zzso in most zzso The altered expression of zzso may influence the sensitivity of tumor cells to zzso This study investigated whether the zzso of zzso expression to sensitize head and neck cancer cells to the chemotherapy drug zzso in zzso zzso zzso was used to block activity of zzso zzso and zzso was used to knock down its zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso were used to detect expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was used to carrying zzso to zzso zzso expression in zzso cells for zzso and flow zzso analyses of cell viability and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to assess the changes in zzso levels in zzso zzso It showed that zzso zzso and protein were expressed in zzso cells, and zzso protein was localized on the cell zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso treatment under both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso inhibited tumor cell growth in zzso and induced them to undergo zzso zzso also suppressed tumor cell zzso of zzso into the zzso Our findings suggest that zzso of zzso activity and expression can sensitize zzso cells to zzso treatment in both zzso and hypoxic zzso These data could be further verified in animal zzso before potential application as a clinical zzso or zzso therapy of head and neck cancer with zzso
