The aim of this study was to estimate the distribution and density of a representative set of zzso and zzso receptors on gated natural killer zzso cells, as well as on their bright and dim subsets, and to correlate the zzso expression with zzso cell activity for healthy individuals on zzso zzso zzso We show that in 43 healthy controls zzso cell activity against zzso target cells was zzso zzso zzso by standard zzso release zzso The expression of receptors on zzso cells and their zzso was analyzed by flow zzso The zzso zzso zzso subset constituted zzso while the regulatory zzso zzso subset constituted zzso of zzso zzso We show the distribution of zzso zzso zzso and zzso receptors on zzso zzso cells in peripheral blood zzso zzso on gated zzso cells, and on the zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso killer zzso receptors zzso there is a significant positive correlation of zzso and zzso expression with zzso zzso We show the zzso of change in zzso zzso zzso together with the stronger target binding capacity of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that after zzso of zzso with zzso the expression of zzso a zzso marker, on zzso cells and zzso is time dependent and significantly higher on the zzso zzso zzso zzso The novel data obtained regarding expression of zzso cell zzso and zzso receptors for healthy individuals may aid in detecting changes that are associated with various zzso
