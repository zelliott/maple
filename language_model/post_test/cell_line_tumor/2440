zzso is an integral membrane protein localized to the late zzso and plasma membrane that is thought to function as a zzso of cholesterol transport from zzso zzso to the plasma membrane and/or zzso The protein consists of two distinct zzso an zzso zzso domain that shares zzso with the zzso protein and a zzso zzso acute regulatory protein zzso zzso transfer zzso domain that binds zzso To further characterize the zzso zzso full-length and truncated proteins were zzso in cells and the effects on zzso trafficking and zzso zzso were zzso To gain insight into zzso function, affinity zzso and mass zzso techniques were used to identify potential zzso interacting zzso Of the 15 candidate proteins identified, zzso was chosen for further zzso We show that zzso interacts with zzso in zzso as well as in zzso and that the strength of the interaction is dependent on the zzso zzso Furthermore, blocking the interaction through the use of a zzso zzso or zzso zzso delays the trafficking of zzso to the late zzso and also results in the zzso of zzso zzso to the cell zzso Taken together, these studies have determined that zzso is a novel zzso binding protein and indicate that zzso plays a role in the zzso trafficking of zzso Furthermore, these studies suggest that zzso may be the link by which zzso exerts its effects on the zzso zzso zzso
