zzso is a zzso compound which possesses zzso zzso It has been shown to induce cell death in a variety of cancer cells, however, its effect on zzso human oral cancer cells zzso zzso has not been zzso to zzso The low water zzso of zzso which leads to poor zzso however, has been highlighted as a major limiting zzso In this study, we zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and investigated the effects of zzso on zzso zzso The results showed zzso induced zzso in zzso cells but exhibited low zzso to normal human zzso zzso zzso and normal human oral zzso zzso zzso triggered DNA zzso fragmentation and subsequent zzso Compared to zzso zzso cells, a more zzso amount of zzso zzso was found inside the treated zzso zzso zzso suppressed the protein and zzso expression levels of zzso Both the activity and the expression levels of zzso and zzso were elevated in the treated zzso zzso The zzso zzso was blocked by specific zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso agent zzso zzso zzso increased zzso oxygen species zzso production, zzso the protein expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the protein levels of zzso Our results suggest that zzso triggered the intrinsic zzso zzso through regulating the function of multiple drug resistance protein 1 zzso and the production of zzso oxygen species zzso in zzso zzso zzso could be potentially zzso in the treatment of zzso human oral zzso
