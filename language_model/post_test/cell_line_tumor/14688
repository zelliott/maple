zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were prepared and characterized by zzso analysis, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and mass zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso was determined and zzso Three zzso zzso create a zzso zzso coordination sphere around the zzso zzso Additionally, a short zzso distance of zzso was found in the structure resulting in the expanded zzso environment of a distorted square zzso The zzso entities are bound to each other by the bridging organic zzso Thus a two-dimensional coordination zzso is created with water molecules located between the zzso In contrast to zzso the zzso complex contains an additional zzso zzso in the coordination zzso Moreover, in the zzso complex the zzso zzso binding site is shifted to the zzso of the zzso zzso Free zzso are zzso inactive against human zzso and zzso cancer cell lines and mouse zzso zzso The silver zzso complexes exhibit a very strong activity against these zzso (The introduction of the zzso groups to the ring slightly increases resistance only against the zzso cell zzso In contrast, the silver complex of zzso shows only a weak activity which may be related to the presence of the zzso zzso group in the composition of the compound and/or the different binding site of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso parameters are promising for the future application of the complexes as zzso
