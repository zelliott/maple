Some chemical zzso of zzso zzso zzso expression also zzso the activity of zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein responsible for catalyzing the first reaction in zzso zzso The effect of altered zzso activity on zzso expression has generally been attributed to changes in the composition of zzso zzso generated downstream in the zzso zzso pathway, but the precise mechanism remains poorly zzso A generally accepted model for zzso zzso of the zzso gene involves zzso signaling zzso by proteins including the zzso zzso zzso whose interaction with the 90 zzso Dalton heat shock zzso zzso is essential for maintaining a high affinity zzso zzso zzso Because zzso zzso expression is important in the zzso of environmentally relevant compounds to zzso derivatives capable of zzso cellular zzso binding to zzso represents an important regulatory point in the zzso zzso In the present study, based on evidence that indicates zzso 1 of zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso both zzso zzso zzso and capacity for proliferation were evaluated using the wild type zzso zzso human brain cancer cell line and its zzso counterparts expressing green fluorescent zzso fusion zzso Exposure to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in the zzso of zzso from a primarily zzso domain to sites of focal zzso zzso zzso for zzso which was dispersed throughout the cell, became primarily zzso while the distribution of zzso remained zzso When compared to the wild type, cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso had significantly attenuated levels of zzso zzso zzso as determined by quantitative reverse zzso zzso Although all the zzso cell lines exhibited zzso zzso response in dose response zzso with the potent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso only the zzso cell line designated - zzso which was zzso with a zzso deletion of zzso retained its zzso capacity at the highest zzso doses used in this zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso as a green fluorescent fusion protein has a modulating effect on the zzso of zzso This is possibly due to zzso interacting with zzso to zzso zzso interaction, and altering downstream events such as in zzso the zzso and zzso activity of zzso This is supported by the fact that the zzso zzso cell line, with much lower capacity for zzso zzso exhibited sustained zzso response to high doses of zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso wild zzso zzso the effect zzso by zzso on the zzso signaling zzso is an important underlying factor contributing to zzso in zzso gene expression and consequently, zzso response to environmentally relevant compounds that pose risk to human zzso
