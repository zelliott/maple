zzso cancer zzso is characterized by zzso expression of several tumor zzso or zzso zzso The objective of this study was the identification and characterization of zzso as a potential tumor zzso in zzso 

zzso of expression of zzso were examined in human zzso cell lines and zzso using zzso and in zzso zzso zzso was zzso or suppressed to assess the effects on the growth of human zzso cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso to assess the effects on human zzso zzso 

We identified zzso as a potential tumor zzso in zzso zzso of zzso is zzso in zzso prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso of zzso decreased while zzso of zzso increased cell zzso zzso and zzso growth of zzso cells in zzso zzso of zzso expression enhanced the ability of zzso zzso cells to grow in zzso conditions in zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso delivery significantly reduced tumor burden in zzso of human zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso expression is zzso in clinical zzso specimens compared to their matched benign zzso while the expression of zzso a master regulator of zzso zzso processing, is zzso in clinical zzso zzso 

These results demonstrate that zzso zzso is zzso in zzso and functions as a tumor zzso and is a potential therapeutic target for zzso
