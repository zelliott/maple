zzso zzso is a novel member of the zzso family, recently implicated in the regulation of cell cycle progression and/or zzso zzso The present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of zzso on tumor cell growth and zzso in human gastric cells in zzso zzso zzso was zzso into human gastric cancer cell line zzso and expressed with a zzso expression zzso zzso The effects and mechanisms of zzso zzso on cell growth, cell cycling and zzso were zzso Compared to control zzso zzso of zzso zzso inhibited the growth of zzso cells and enhance their zzso to zzso zzso and zzso The zzso effects of zzso zzso could be due to zzso arrest and zzso zzso zzso induced zzso arrest and zzso involved zzso of zzso and down regulation zzso and zzso The results indicated that zzso of zzso zzso protein may promote efficient growth zzso and enhance zzso to zzso agents in human gastric cancer cells by inducing zzso cell cycle arrest and zzso
