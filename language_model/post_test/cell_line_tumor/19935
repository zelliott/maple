We have shown recently that zzso zzso zzso zzso share a zzso ethane zzso with zzso zzso zzso a zzso inhibitor of the zzso zzso which enabled us to establish that zzso zzso were potent zzso of zzso and blocked the formation of foam zzso In the present study, we have tested whether this structural similarity means that zzso zzso is an zzso zzso We report that zzso zzso bound to zzso and zzso with an zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso studies using molecular modeling of zzso zzso with the X-ray structure of the zzso showed that zzso zzso fits well into the zzso binding site known for zzso Despite having high three-dimensional structural similarities with the pure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we showed that zzso zzso is an zzso of zzso for zzso and cellular zzso These data showed that zzso zzso was an zzso zzso zzso and that the size and the chemical nature of the side chain were critical for zzso versus zzso activity on zzso This new molecular mechanism of action for zzso zzso has to be taken into account in understanding better its pharmacological zzso Moreover, these data give new structural insights into the understanding of zzso versus zzso activities of zzso zzso and also for the conception of new drugs with a dual zzso zzso and zzso zzso potential and their evaluation in different zzso where both targets are involved, such as zzso Alzheimer's disease, and zzso
