zzso zzso dependent cell zzso zzso is a recently described zzso independent innate zzso zzso It differs from the traditional zzso dependent zzso zzso in that zzso zzso not zzso are critical to the zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso is still unclear and further investigation is needed to determine any role it may play in maintaining cellular zzso and development of zzso The current knowledge about this zzso is limited only to the zzso effects of some zzso zzso zzso zzso agents such as zzso zzso and zzso can inhibit this zzso process in cultured zzso There is little known, however, about biologically active agents available in the cell which can inhibit zzso Here, we show that zzso of a cellular protein called zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso results in a significant decrease in cell zzso to zzso suggesting that zzso is an zzso inhibitor suppressing this zzso of zzso Previous work has associated zzso and cancer development, indicating that this finding will help to open the doorway for further study on the mechanism of zzso and the role it may play in cancer zzso
