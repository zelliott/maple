We have developed an zzso system suitable for assessment of compound action on the zzso zzso of the widely expressed zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso in the rat zzso cell line zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso developed for measurement of functional zzso In order to investigate the mechanisms linking zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso we have also studied zzso zzso in a human zzso cell line that zzso expresses zzso zzso responses displayed similar zzso and potency in the two cell zzso The zzso signal generated by zzso of zzso receptors in these cells is zzso primarily by zzso zzso However, there is a substantial zzso of the zzso response by zzso indicating that zzso also play a key role in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the response by zzso A could indicate an active zzso release role for zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso markedly zzso but does not zzso the zzso response to zzso suggesting further complexity to the zzso pathways activated by zzso zzso In comparing zzso zzso in zzso and native cells, there is a striking overall similarity in zzso expression pattern, zzso zzso and the effect of zzso on the zzso zzso This indicates that the zzso zzso cell line is a very useful model system for studying zzso pharmacology and zzso mechanisms, and for investigating the zzso zzso downstream zzso
