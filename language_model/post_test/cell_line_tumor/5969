Recently we described a zzso model of zzso ligament zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, which resulted in conversion of normal zzso into zzso zzso zzso and in zzso transition zzso of zzso zzso We have found a zzso high zzso zzso expression in zzso cells in normal and in zzso zzso In our hypothesis a zzso zzso expression in zzso regulates gene expression in zzso during zzso zzso were performed between zzso zzso and zzso cells with and without zzso zzso zzso zzso processing was investigated in zzso cells, tumor cells and zzso zzso were treated with zzso zzso signaling was investigated by western zzso and zzso zzso genes were analyzed by real-time zzso zzso cells produced zzso active zzso its zzso was zzso in zzso zzso during zzso which induced zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso Several zzso including zzso regulatory factor 1 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso were induced in zzso during zzso The most enhanced induction was found for zzso and zzso Treatment of zzso zzso with zzso reproduced a zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso A further proof was achieved by zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso expression of zzso in the tumor cells leads to zzso gene expression changes in zzso zzso which are involved in tumor zzso
