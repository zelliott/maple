zzso is an zzso zzso critically involved in stress responses, cellular metabolism and, zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso represents the first zzso zzso functionally regulated by zzso and zzso we and others previously found that zzso promotes cell survival by zzso zzso zzso zzso These results were further supported by the fact that zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso were observed in zzso zzso Nevertheless, zzso zzso function is also implicated in zzso pathways under different cellular zzso and its effects on zzso factors such as members of the zzso family and zzso directly zzso zzso zzso These studies validate the importance of the zzso activity of zzso but how zzso activity is regulated in zzso is not well zzso Here we show that zzso zzso in breast cancer 1) acts as a native inhibitor of zzso in human zzso zzso repression of zzso leads to increasing levels of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, depletion of zzso zzso by zzso interference zzso stimulates zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso these effects can be reversed in cells by zzso zzso of zzso zzso Our study demonstrates that zzso promotes zzso zzso through specific zzso of zzso
