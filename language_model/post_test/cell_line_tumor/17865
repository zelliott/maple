We show that the times separating the birth of benign, zzso and zzso tumor cells can be determined by analysis of the zzso they have in zzso When combined with prior clinical zzso these analyses suggest the following general conclusions about zzso zzso zzso It takes approximately 17 years for a large benign tumor to evolve into an advanced cancer but zzso years for cells within that cancer to acquire the ability to zzso zzso it requires few, if any, selective events to transform a highly invasive cancer cell into one with the capacity to zzso zzso the process of cell culture ex zzso does not introduce new zzso zzso into zzso tumor cell zzso and zzso the rates at which point zzso develop in advanced zzso are similar to those of normal zzso These results have important implications for understanding human tumor zzso particularly those associated with zzso
