zzso the molecular zzso of cancer and increasing the number of drugs and their targets are critical to cancer zzso In our attempt to unravel novel zzso associated zzso we previously conducted protein expression profiling of the zzso model, which comprises a series of zzso cell lines that mimic different stages of breast cancer zzso zzso expression was found to increase during breast cancer zzso Here, we attempted to confirm the relevance of zzso in clinical breast cancer and understand the functional role and mechanism of zzso in breast cancer zzso zzso data show that zzso expression was elevated in zzso zzso in zzso and invasive zzso zzso compared with normal zzso in zzso of the 26 matched cases zzso zzso of zzso expression in tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso and subsequent correlation with clinical data revealed that zzso expression was significantly associated with tumor size, grade, and zzso status zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso reduced zzso and zzso zzso proliferation and zzso zzso the zzso zzso signaling pathways revealed that zzso knock down did not affect overall downstream zzso zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso Instead, zzso of zzso resulted in a reduction of overall zzso D1 zzso a reduction of zzso increase in zzso D1 expression and an increase in zzso cell population compared with control zzso
