zzso is a zzso factor that plays important roles in multiple physical and pathological zzso including cell growth, cell cycle regulation, and zzso To better characterize zzso function in zzso zzso we established stable zzso cell clones expressing different levels of zzso These clones were then characterized for cell growth, cell cycle zzso zzso and zzso in gene zzso zzso of zzso promoted zzso of the zzso cancer cells in zzso zzso zzso increased zzso to S phase transition, which was accompanied by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and reduced protein levels for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis combined with expression zzso in different cell systems identified a number of additional genes that are potentially regulated by zzso including zzso zzso and zzso These findings suggest that the zzso zzso factor plays an zzso role in the zzso zzso cancer cell line through the regulation of a subset of zzso
