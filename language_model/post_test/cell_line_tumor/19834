Recently, it has been reported that zzso transplantation into patients with Type 1 diabetes may achieve insulin independence for a year or longer zzso et zzso zzso transplantation in seven patients with type 1 diabetes zzso using a zzso zzso regimen, N zzso J zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the amount of donor zzso tissue is zzso therefore, multiple approaches are being explored to generate zzso cells in zzso Some promising results have been obtained using mouse and human stem cells and zzso cells zzso et zzso From stem cells to beta zzso new strategies in cell therapy of diabetes zzso zzso 4 (2001) zzso zzso et zzso zzso cells derived from adult zzso potential for the treatment of diabetes zzso Am J zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso In zzso zzso of human zzso from expanded zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso U S A, 97 zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso production by human embryonic stem cells, 50 (2001) Diabetes zzso However, the efficiency of obtaining populations with high numbers of differentiated cells has been zzso In order to improve the efficiency of producing and selecting zzso cells from zzso cells, we have designed a novel zzso specific and zzso responsive promoter system designated zzso zzso This artificial promoter system exhibits significant zzso activity not only in zzso zzso zzso cells but also in isolated human zzso The zzso zzso construct shows no activity in zzso cells in low zzso conditions (2 zzso zzso but demonstrates significant activity and zzso specificity in high zzso conditions (16 zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso shows significant promoter activity in differentiated zzso cells that can produce insulin after zzso A and zzso zzso Here, we describe a novel zzso specific and zzso responsive artificial promoter system designed for analyzing and sorting zzso zzso cells that have differentiated from stem cells or other zzso zzso
