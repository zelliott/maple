zzso plays an important role in cancer zzso We have reported that the zzso zzso cells exhibit zzso and functional changes compared to zzso cells neighboring to normal zzso However, the molecular mechanisms as well as the maintenance of these changes remain zzso Here we showed that through zzso with breast cancer cells for at least three to four passages, breast normal zzso zzso zzso gained persistent activity for promoting cancer cell invasion, partly via zzso zzso zzso with zzso type 1 zzso 1 zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that the DNA zzso pattern in the zzso promoter has no zzso Instead, the loss of zzso binding to the zzso promoter and the resulting decrease of zzso zzso zzso zzso may account for the zzso of zzso zzso the lack of zzso binding and the zzso zzso on the zzso promoter were sustained in cancer zzso zzso after removal of cancer zzso These results suggest that cancer cells are capable of inducing zzso zzso to zzso zzso persistently for their invasion and the effect is zzso zzso
