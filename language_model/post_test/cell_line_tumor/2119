The reduction of zzso to zzso the most potent zzso in human, is zzso by zzso zzso type 1 zzso A promising approach for the treatment of zzso diseases is the reduction of zzso zzso formation by zzso of zzso For the zzso zzso of the zzso a zzso approach was applied and enhanced by a focused synthesis that resulted in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of 12 led to the zzso 30, which is a highly active and selective human zzso zzso as well as a highly potent and selective inhibitor of zzso from zzso zzso It shows no affinity to the zzso receptors zzso and zzso and good zzso activity zzso Thus, compound 30 shows good properties for further zzso studies and might be a candidate for the in zzso proof of concept in zzso zzso
