zzso exerts direct zzso effects in tumors and also zzso a zzso stress response in tumor cells via the zzso zzso target of zzso zzso zzso zzso the combination of zzso and zzso therapy with zzso inhibitor zzso zzso might exert zzso effects on tumor zzso 

zzso of radiation combined with zzso inhibitor zzso were studied on proliferation of zzso colon cancer zzso human pancreatic cancer zzso and human zzso vascular zzso cells in zzso In zzso tumor growth of subcutaneous colon cancer CT 26 and zzso pancreatic cancer zzso was assessed after zzso zzso (5 zzso 2 or 5 zzso 4 zzso with or without the addition of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso was administered until the end of experiments beginning before or after zzso 

A single dose of 2 zzso reduced in zzso proliferation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso vascular zzso cells zzso zzso The zzso inhibitor zzso (10 zzso suppressed proliferation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Combination of even low zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso radiation significantly reduced proliferation of zzso zzso whereas additive effects of zzso and radiation on tumor cells were seen only at the highest zzso zzso In zzso zzso introduced before zzso (5 zzso 2 zzso improved tumor growth control in mice zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso 210 zzso versus 636 zzso P zzso zzso versus zzso zzso turned out to possess a zzso effect on zzso 

zzso cells seem to be most sensitive to combination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso tumor growth delay using the zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso in zzso therefore might rely on combined zzso and zzso zzso
