The zzso plays an important role in the exchange of zzso but also of immune cells between blood and the underlying zzso The zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso is zzso located at zzso junctions and has been claimed to support zzso zzso In this study we show that the zzso zzso zzso recognizes the zzso portion of zzso zzso Making use of zzso we found zzso highly expressed and widely spread on zzso cells in the analyzed zzso zzso In contrast to humans that express zzso also on T cells or zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso albeit at low levels was only found on a subset of zzso zzso The zzso against zzso zzso is useful for zzso sorting of primary zzso cells not only from the liver but from various other zzso In zzso no evidence was seen that the formation and integrity of zzso zzso or the zzso migration of T cells was affected by zzso binding to zzso or by zzso of the zzso This makes the zzso zzso an excellent tool especially for the ex zzso isolation of zzso zzso cells intended to be used in functional zzso
