We demonstrate here that zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso in prostate zzso zzso zzso is zzso correlated with its zzso in adjacent blood zzso zzso zzso in prostate cancer cell line zzso via small interfering zzso acid zzso increased but its zzso suppressed the expression of zzso factors such as vascular zzso growth factor zzso -C and zzso and zzso inhibitor collagen zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso in zzso cells increased but zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso relation was found for zzso zzso of zzso zzso suppressed but that of zzso increased the zzso zzso zzso zzso microscopically the majority of zzso blood vessels was structurally zzso exhibiting zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In some zzso areas, invasion of single tumor cells into the zzso blood vessels was zzso These data show that disappearance of zzso zzso in zzso is accompanied by its zzso in adjacent zzso which apparently zzso with vascular zzso and increased zzso of prostate zzso Strategies to either conserve the zzso zzso or to target zzso zzso might be useful for an zzso therapy of prostate zzso
