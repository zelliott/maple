zzso used for breast cancer zzso treatment differ among each other for the ability to affect zzso zzso zzso activity and thereby inhibit zzso cell functions and zzso We used zzso zzso zzso for a comprehensive definition of the gene pathways affected by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells, a suitable model to investigate zzso and zzso actions in zzso zzso The expression of zzso genes was significantly affected by zzso in these zzso in zzso analysis reveals that 86 among them include one or more potential zzso binding site within or near the promoter and that the binding site signatures for zzso zzso and zzso zzso factors are significantly enriched in the promoters of genes induced by zzso treatment, while those for zzso protein and zzso in those zzso by the hormone, pointing to novel zzso zzso of secondary responses to zzso in BC zzso Interestingly, expression of 176 zzso zzso was unaffected by any of the zzso tested, despite the fact that under the same conditions the zzso and cell cycle zzso activities of zzso were zzso On the other hand, of zzso zzso genes identified here, 52 were unresponsive to zzso and zzso responded specifically to only one of the compounds tested, revealing zzso and clearly distinguishable effects of the different zzso in BC zzso As some of these differences reflect zzso of the mechanism of action of the zzso tested, we propose to exploit this gene set for characterization of novel hormonal zzso and selective zzso zzso zzso zzso and as a tool for testing new associations of zzso more effective against zzso
