Most of the DNA damage produced by zzso radiation is repaired by the base zzso repair zzso zzso To determine whether the zzso genes were zzso by low doses of zzso radiation, we investigated their expression in zzso human zzso cells by measuring zzso levels using real-time quantitative zzso No induction at the zzso level of any of the base zzso repair zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or accessory protein zzso zzso zzso or zzso was found at zzso doses ranging from 1 zzso to 2 zzso in a zzso zzso As has been measured in other cell lines, a zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso levels was observed in zzso cells in the dose range of zzso to zzso zzso We also examined zzso zzso activity on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and found no increase in extracts of zzso cells after zzso doses of zzso zzso These data were zzso by Western zzso analysis of zzso and zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso are also not zzso at the zzso level after zzso radiation zzso
