zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the most common high-grade zzso in bone and soft tissue and, due to its zzso the prognosis of the disease is zzso zzso is a zzso zzso inhibitor that was initially developed as a zzso inhibitor for chronic zzso leukemia zzso zzso also selectively zzso zzso growth factor receptors zzso and zzso We examined the expression of zzso and zzso in human zzso cell lines, and the effect of zzso on cell zzso 

Four human zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was analyzed using reverse zzso chain reaction, and the zzso effect of zzso on cell proliferation was analyzed using the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was expressed in zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso zzso were expressed in zzso zzso and zzso All three of these zzso were absent in zzso zzso inhibited cell proliferation of zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso and zzso manner, but cell proliferation of zzso was not inhibited by zzso at zzso of 10 zzso or zzso 

zzso significantly inhibited proliferation of the three human zzso cell lines that expressed zzso of target zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso on cell proliferation in these three cell lines might be due to decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso might be a potent zzso agent for human zzso
