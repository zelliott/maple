To perform a zzso zzso of zzso fragments of a mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso zzso zzso ' zzso acid zzso via the zzso groups in the hinge zzso to the zzso site of the zzso 

zzso was zzso using a simple zzso zzso First, stable zzso was produced by zzso zzso zzso with free zzso in the hinge region was then obtained by zzso reduction of zzso Second, a zzso zzso of zzso to zzso BAT was performed in a zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso had approximately zzso free zzso groups per zzso after zzso zzso The zzso efficiency and the chemical yield were approximately zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the initial concentration of zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso all maintained reasonable zzso zzso zzso labeling of the zzso under standard conditions did not impair the zzso of zzso 

This is a simple and efficient method for producing zzso zzso of zzso which can be used to make zzso zzso for further diagnostic and therapeutic zzso
