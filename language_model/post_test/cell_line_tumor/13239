zzso zzso zzso 2) is a zzso protein with unusual zzso zzso As with other zzso the zzso zzso 2 zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso filament assembly and remains at the barbed end, modulating zzso The unique feature of zzso is its ability to sever filaments and enhance zzso which requires the zzso zzso Physiologically, zzso acts in the zzso zzso and is zzso in two human diseases, focal and zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we investigate the effects of mutating two zzso zzso found to be key in other zzso zzso and zzso Surprisingly, neither zzso zzso barbed end zzso as judged by zzso and total internal reflection zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso causes tight capping of a subset of zzso whereas zzso causes slow zzso of all zzso The zzso zzso has a minor zzso effect on zzso activity but causes almost complete abolition of severing and zzso zzso The zzso zzso has relatively small effects on zzso zzso and zzso In cells, the zzso zzso causes zzso zzso around the zzso zzso to a similar extent as wild type, whereas the zzso zzso causes no measurable zzso The inability of zzso to induce zzso zzso in cells is explained by its inability to promote robust zzso zzso in the presence of capping zzso These results highlight an important point: it is dangerous to assume that zzso of zzso zzso zzso will have equivalent effects in all zzso The work also suggests that both zzso have effects on the mechanism of zzso zzso
