zzso zzso a zzso was investigated for its ability to protect against zzso zzso induced zzso by employing zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell survival zzso confirmed the efficacy of zzso supplementation in attenuating zzso zzso zzso with zzso significantly ( zzso inhibited zzso DNA damage zzso olive tail moment and % tail zzso thereby demonstrating zzso zzso zzso Also, zzso with zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso stress, zzso zzso influx and inhibited zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells demonstrated a significant ( zzso increase in the zzso and zzso levels followed by a significant ( zzso decrease in zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso induced zzso cell death by zzso was demonstrated by zzso zzso zzso and DNA fragmentation zzso and further confirmed by western zzso zzso The present findings indicated the protective effect of zzso against zzso induced zzso which may be attributed to its zzso zzso and zzso zzso potential zzso because of its free radical scavenging ability, which reduced the zzso stress and in turn facilitated the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso
