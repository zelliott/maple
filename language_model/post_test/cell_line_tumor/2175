zzso studies have shown that zzso exposure to zzso cement particulate matter is associated with adverse health risk for zzso The underlying mechanisms, however, are poorly zzso To examine the effect of zzso nine blinded zzso zzso zzso zzso were assessed with regard to their induction of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in human primary zzso cells zzso from zzso zzso as well as from zzso lung zzso zzso cells zzso It was demonstrated that the cement specimens did not act zzso as assessed by the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso expression was zzso in contrast to an unchanged zzso At the transcript level the zzso and induced zzso and zzso gene expression was not influenced by cement zzso To discover the mechanism by which cement influenced the zzso expression the following experiments were zzso zzso exposure experiments have shown that the release of zzso was suppressed by cement zzso Furthermore, the incubation of zzso with zzso specimens under zzso condition led to a loss of zzso zzso An zzso masking of zzso by free soluble components of respiratory zzso cells was zzso Thus, the decrease of zzso protein content after cement exposure seems to be a result of the zzso of zzso protein to cement particles and the zzso of zzso zzso In conclusion, due to absent zzso and inflammatory effects of zzso specimens in both human zzso and zzso cell models it remains open how cement exposure may lead to the respiratory adverse effects in zzso
