zzso semiconductor quantum dots zzso are a new class of fluorescent label with wide-ranging applications for cell zzso The electron density and zzso composition of these materials permit the extension of their use as zzso in conventional electron zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here we illustrate the feasibility of using zzso zzso as zzso tags by labeling a nuclear protein on cell sections and obtaining zzso zzso and zzso zzso We also show that zzso zzso can be employed in conjunction with zzso for zzso of proteins at the zzso zzso Furthermore, by obtaining cadmium zzso maps of zzso zzso distributed on a nuclear structure, we demonstrate the potential of zzso for zzso of multiple proteins when used in combination with zzso
