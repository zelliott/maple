Although we have identified two putative targets, zzso and zzso for a frequently zzso region around zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso it is possible that other amplification targets remain to be zzso In this study, we tested whether zzso and zzso zzso protein 2 zzso located between those two genes and zzso a zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso that regulates zzso and zzso zzso activity, respectively, acts as a zzso gene through zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and protein was observed in zzso cells with remarkable amplification at zzso and other zzso cell lines zzso lines, zzso zzso of zzso protein was frequently detected in primary tumor samples of zzso zzso cases, zzso as well and significantly correlated with zzso zzso invasion, the zzso category in the zzso zzso zzso and status of zzso Patients with zzso tumors had a worse overall rate of survival than those with zzso tumors, and zzso zzso was independently associated with a worse outcome in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression inhibited and zzso zzso of zzso promoted the proliferation of zzso cells in a zzso zzso but zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso plays an important role in tumor cell proliferation through its zzso and highlight its usefulness as a zzso and potential therapeutic target in zzso
