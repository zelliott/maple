zzso cell zzso fusion hybrid zzso that facilitate zzso presentation represent a novel powerful strategy in cancer zzso zzso studies have demonstrated that zzso promotes specific zzso immunity zzso by T cells in several types of zzso In the present study, we investigated the zzso immunity derived from vaccination of fusion hybrids between zzso and engineered zzso myeloma cells zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The expression zzso zzso was generated and zzso into zzso myeloma cells and then bone zzso zzso were fused with engineered zzso zzso The zzso immunity derived from vaccination of the fusion hybrid zzso was evaluated in zzso and in zzso 

zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso mice with zzso hybrid induced a zzso dominant immune response and resulted in tumor zzso zzso of mice with engineered zzso hybrid zzso stronger zzso zzso zzso T zzso zzso responses in zzso as well as more potent protective immunity against zzso tumor challenge in zzso than zzso with the mixture of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso immunity zzso by zzso tumor cell vaccination in zzso appeared to be dependent on zzso zzso 

These results demonstrate that the engineered fusion hybrid vaccines that combine zzso zzso zzso tumor cells with zzso may be an attractive strategy for cancer zzso
