We have previously described zzso zzso zzso which forms soluble inclusion complex with zzso Here we further investigated the effect of zzso and zzso inclusion complex zzso on cellular cholesterol levels in a mouse mast cell line, zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso removes cellular cholesterol forming inclusion complexes, while zzso lack of cellular cholesterol was replenished by the addition of zzso without zzso Reduction and zzso of cellular cholesterol in zzso and/or zzso zzso cells, respectively, were demonstrated by zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso rather than free zzso and free cholesterol was efficiently incorporated into zzso cells and its incorporation was inhibited by incubation at low temperature, or with sodium zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells have been confirmed to express zzso cassette (ABC) zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso reduction by zzso zzso the zzso and protein expression of zzso and zzso but not of zzso zzso loading by zzso restores the diminished zzso and zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso However, both zzso and zzso had no effect on zzso activity measured by the zzso 123 zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso of cholesterol levels with zzso or zzso led to zzso or zzso of zzso and zzso expression in zzso zzso
