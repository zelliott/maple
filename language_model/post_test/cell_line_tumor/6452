zzso play essential roles in the development, zzso and survival of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso expression have been implicated in a variety of neurodegenerative zzso zzso of zzso zzso factor zzso has been implicated in deficits of long-term zzso and zzso and may contribute to the development of Alzheimer's disease zzso In this study, we used complementary pharmacological and molecular approaches to evaluate the role of zzso and zzso two members of the zzso zzso associated with zzso in regulating zzso expression in zzso zzso cells and primary zzso Our data revealed that zzso an inhibitor of both zzso and zzso increased the levels of zzso zzso whereas the zzso inhibitor zzso did not, suggesting that zzso exerts negative control over zzso zzso This was supported by experiments in which zzso depletion of zzso led to an increase in zzso In contrast, zzso with zzso active zzso resulted in an zzso of zzso zzso confirming the zzso role of zzso in the regulation of zzso Interestingly, zzso with the dominant active zzso of zzso zzso the upstream zzso of zzso resulted in a modest increase in zzso zzso zzso our data suggest that zzso and zzso exert opposite effects on zzso expression and support the hypothesis that an imbalance of these two signaling pathways may contribute to the pathology of diseases in which zzso zzso is zzso
