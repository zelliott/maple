Fluorescent quantum dots zzso zzso have the potential to revolutionize biological imaging, but their use has been limited by difficulties in obtaining quantum dots that are water soluble and zzso The objectives of our research were to develop a methodology for zzso of zzso zzso quantum dots zzso in zzso zzso that mimics the natural zzso core and to study their interactions with cultured zzso cell lung cancer cells zzso We found that zzso zzso can be efficiently zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso has a particle size approximately 80 zzso and appears physically zzso The zzso zzso interacts well with zzso The intensity of cellular zzso imaging increases with the cell incubation time, indicating more zzso were taken up by the cells, zzso Two types of zzso zzso confirm that zzso are primarily localized in the zzso but not in the nucleus of the zzso
