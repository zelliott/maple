The zzso transmission of a zzso in the zzso zzso coli zzso gene leads to cancer of the zzso tract upon zzso zzso of the remaining zzso in familial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso result in truncated products that have primarily lost the ability to properly regulate the level of the zzso factor zzso However, zzso cancer cells from zzso patients always retain a truncated zzso product and the reasons for this strong selective pressure are not zzso We describe here the surprising property for the zzso zzso zzso binding protein zzso to promote the zzso of truncated zzso through binding to the 15 zzso acid repeats of truncated zzso zzso can bind to either first, third or fourth 15 zzso acid repeats, but not to the zzso zzso zzso requires both zzso zzso of truncated zzso as well as zzso zzso The analysis of the position of the zzso along the zzso sequence in zzso from zzso patients reveals that the presence of the first 15 zzso acid repeat is almost always selected in the resulting truncated zzso zzso This suggests that the sensitivity of truncated zzso to zzso by zzso constitutes an essential facet of zzso zzso
