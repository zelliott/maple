zzso zzso a zzso zzso containing five zzso zzso of human zzso generated by zzso zzso has been already identified by zzso et zzso with relation to zzso and proliferation of zzso zzso To investigate zzso activity of zzso human zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli zzso the zzso of human zzso obtained from cloning zzso zzso by zzso was inserted into an expression zzso zzso to construct a zzso expression zzso zzso zzso zzso efficiently expressed in zzso coli zzso after zzso induction was monitored by zzso and Western zzso with an zzso zzso zzso and an zzso tag zzso The expressed zzso accounted for approximately zzso of the total bacterial proteins as estimated by zzso and existed mainly as inclusion zzso The inclusion bodies were washed, zzso zzso and zzso to a purity of zzso as estimated by zzso zzso and the final zzso yield of zzso in zzso coli system was approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was tested on chicken zzso zzso zzso zzso and a large number of newly formed blood vessels were significantly zzso In the present study, we demonstrated that zzso zzso effectively inhibited zzso of the chicken zzso in a zzso manner through zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso inhibited zzso cell proliferation but not zzso zzso For the first time, these findings demonstrate that the zzso produced by a zzso expression system effectively inhibited zzso of the chicken zzso in a zzso manner and specially suppressed in zzso the proliferation of human zzso vein zzso zzso This fact derived from the present study further suggests the zzso can be used for zzso therapy of zzso
