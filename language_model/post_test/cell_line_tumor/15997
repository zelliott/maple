zzso an zzso produced by zzso species zzso was recently found to have zzso zzso Here we examined whether zzso has zzso activities against solid zzso zzso inhibited the growth of mouse and human zzso zzso in nude zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and vessel formation in the zzso zzso also showed zzso zzso activities in zzso zzso grafted in mice, but not in zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso zzso zzso and the transcripts of zzso target genes including vascular zzso growth factor in zzso zzso and in various zzso cell zzso Based on the reported literature, unsuccessful efforts were made to determine the mechanism underlying the action of zzso zzso zzso was found to cause the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso but to reduce mature zzso levels in zzso cells and zzso Such an effect of zzso was not observed in cell lines derived from normal cells, and was cell zzso even among cancer cell zzso 

Our results suggest that zzso could be developed as an zzso agent to target zzso in some zzso including zzso It is also suggested that the zzso zzso zzso is a novel therapeutic target for controlling zzso pathological zzso
