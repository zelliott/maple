In this study, zzso zzso were used to characterize gene expression changes zzso in prostate cancer cells by zzso them on type I zzso The results clearly reveal changes in the expression of genes associated with cellular zzso cellular zzso gene zzso and gene translation which are indicative of cells that are actively zzso Together these results suggest that these changes in the gene expression profiles zzso by type I collagen may influence the zzso capacity of prostate cancer cells in the bone zzso and facilitate development of prostate cancer bone zzso Additionally, the zzso approach provides an invaluable tool to determine and track changes in gene expression in numerous disease states including prostate zzso This technology is certain to facilitate discovery of new therapeutic gene zzso
