zzso zzso growth factor zzso is a primary stimulant of zzso and is a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is beneficial in combination with chemotherapy for some breast cancer zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso of zzso affects tumor growth seems to involve more than its effect on zzso zzso In general, increased immune cell zzso into breast tumors zzso a worse zzso We have shown previously that zzso a mouse zzso zzso that prevents zzso from binding to zzso zzso 2 zzso decreases tumor growth, zzso and zzso zzso into pancreatic tumors and therefore hypothesized that zzso a fully human zzso that zzso zzso would similarly affect breast tumor growth and immune cell zzso In this study, we show that zzso therapy with zzso zzso or zzso zzso the growth of established zzso zzso breast tumors in severe combined zzso zzso mice, reduces tumor zzso density, limits the zzso of zzso zzso but is associated with elevated numbers of zzso zzso In addition, we found that treatment with zzso reduced the number of zzso zzso cells in the tumor compared with tumors from zzso zzso These results show that selective zzso of zzso with an zzso zzso is sufficient for effective blockade of the zzso activity of zzso in breast cancer zzso These findings further define the complex molecular interactions in the tumor zzso and provide a zzso tool that may be relevant to the treatment of breast zzso
