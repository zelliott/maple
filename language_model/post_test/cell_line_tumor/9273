zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso proteins are critical regulators of zzso cell zzso differentiation and zzso zzso functional activity can be zzso regulated by zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso Additionally, limited zzso zzso of full-length zzso proteins zzso generates zzso truncated forms zzso in different cell zzso which have significantly reduced zzso activity due to the lack of the zzso zzso Previously, it has been shown that zzso generated by an unidentified nuclear zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso cell differentiation and is zzso expressed in acute zzso zzso To better understand this regulatory mechanism for zzso function, we have zzso the zzso zzso from the immature zzso cell line zzso and identified it by zzso analysis as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso can specifically cleave full-length zzso to generate zzso and this activity can be inhibited by zzso zzso zzso in an in zzso zzso zzso zzso preparation of nuclear and zzso extracts from immature zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso in the presence of a specific inhibitor for zzso results in the identification of zzso zzso These studies indicate that nuclear zzso does not naturally exist in immature zzso cells and is artificially generated from zzso during the preparation of extracts due to the abundance of zzso in these zzso Therefore in contrast with earlier studies, our data suggest that zzso rather than zzso is the active form in immature zzso zzso
