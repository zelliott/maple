Mouse zzso 2 zzso a zzso zzso zzso is thought to play some important roles in fatty acid zzso zzso and it is therefore thought that the level of zzso of the zzso gene is under tight zzso zzso of the tissue expression profiles revealed that zzso is expressed in the liver, zzso small zzso brain, zzso zzso zzso tissue and zzso When the zzso promoter was cloned and zzso it was revealed that zzso zzso protein 1) and zzso could bind to a zzso box, that zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 could bind to an E zzso box, and that zzso could bind to an zzso zzso factor zzso element in the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that all of these zzso factors contributed zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso zzso and zzso are indispensable factors for zzso of the zzso gene zzso To our knowledge, this is the first study in which zzso factors that interact with a zzso family gene have been zzso The results of the present study have provided some clues for understanding the molecular mechanisms regulating zzso gene zzso and should be useful for studies aimed at zzso of zzso functions of zzso
