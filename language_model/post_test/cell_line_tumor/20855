This article deals with an in zzso study of the effect of zzso and low intensity ultrasound exposure on the viability of human zzso zzso cells zzso The effect on the viability of 103 cell experimental group samples under the influence of separate and combined zzso and ultrasound far field exposure was zzso zzso cells in individual experimental groups were followed at time intervals of 0, 24, 48 and 72 hours following zzso Another objective of the study was to investigate the effect of the experimental protocol on the combined effect of zzso and ultrasound zzso The effect of the concurrent application of zzso and ultrasound exposure was compared with that in which zzso was added to the cell suspension after ultrasound zzso The results of this work confirmed the zzso of zzso and possible stimulation of cancer cells by low intensity zzso However, it was found that ultrasound exposure enhances the action of zzso on the viability of zzso cells and that the effect is dependent on the experimental zzso In this case the concurrent application of zzso and ultrasound was found to be more effective zzso zzso zzso
