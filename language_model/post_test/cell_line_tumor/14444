zzso artificial zzso results in complete tumor rejection in several mouse zzso Type I zzso zzso exert zzso effects through an array of molecular functions on zzso cells, tumor zzso and immune system zzso The fact that zzso zzso zzso induce tumor zzso in mice deficient in the unique zzso for Type I zzso zzso ) indicated potential for treatment zzso Indeed, combination of zzso injections of mouse zzso and zzso injections of zzso zzso zzso as seen on subcutaneous zzso derived from the zzso colon zzso which is resistant to each treatment if given zzso zzso activity was achieved both against zzso directly injected with zzso and against distant zzso zzso zzso in bone zzso zzso prepared with zzso and zzso mice concluded that expression of the zzso for Type I zzso is mainly required on cells of the zzso zzso zzso effects correlated with a remarkable cellular zzso of the tumor draining zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contained more zzso and conventional zzso cells zzso that more readily zzso zzso numbers of both DC zzso zzso correlated with the tumor zzso Numbers of zzso T cells specific for a dominant tumor zzso were increased at zzso by each separate treatment but only with slight zzso due to the zzso Combined zzso effects of the therapeutic strategy were also seen on subcutaneous zzso tumors established for 24 days before treatment zzso The described strategy is realistic because zzso agents of each kind are clinically available and zzso equivalent procedures in humans are zzso
