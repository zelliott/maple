According to recent findings that beside zzso traditionally considered as zzso several other tumor types show different behavior in the two zzso indicating the possible role of zzso factors in the course of these zzso The possibility that zzso factors may influence the clinical course of human zzso melanoma is suggested by the higher survival rate in zzso zzso zzso women or men of any zzso However, investigations on the sex hormone zzso status of human zzso zzso and experiments attempting to support the zzso results yielded conflicting zzso In our human melanoma cell lines we failed to detect steroid receptors at protein level, while quantitative zzso demonstrated that their zzso expression level was orders of magnitude lower compared to the positive control cell zzso Sex hormones did not influence the in zzso features of the human melanoma cells zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso was present both at zzso and protein level, although zzso was effective in zzso only at high zzso Our previous experiments showed that zzso injection of human melanoma cells resulted in a significantly higher number of liver colonies in male than in female zzso zzso We now show that this difference zzso during the first zzso After injection into the tail vein we did not observe zzso difference in the efficiency of pulmonary zzso zzso the pattern of zzso formation after zzso injection, we have found differences between the two sexes in the zzso or number of colonies only in the case of the liver but not in other zzso We concluded that the observed phenomenon is specific to the zzso therefore we investigated the effects of zzso an zzso zzso of zzso produced mainly in the liver, with an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso effectively inhibited melanoma cell proliferation by inducing zzso and an arrest in the zzso zzso The mechanism of action involved zzso zzso damage and zzso zzso as zzso In zzso mice, zzso was effective in reducing primary tumor weight and the number of liver colonies after zzso injection of human melanoma cells, and causing significantly higher rate of zzso cells in the zzso
