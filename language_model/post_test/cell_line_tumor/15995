The design, zzso and biological evaluation of a series of hybrids and zzso of the zzso zzso agents zzso zzso and zzso is zzso A zzso zzso scaffold was prepared by adapting earlier synthetic routes directed towards zzso and zzso taking advantage of the distinctive structural and zzso similarities between these two zzso marine natural zzso zzso endeavors towards zzso novel zzso hybrids led to the adoption of a late-stage diversification strategy and the construction of a small library of zzso zzso along with the first triple hybrids bearing the zzso of zzso or zzso attached through an zzso zzso Biological zzso of the zzso activity of these compounds in a series of human cancer cell lines, including the zzso zzso cell line, allowed the proposal of various zzso zzso This led to the identification of a potent zzso zzso hybrid 12 and its zzso zzso zzso 38, accessible by an efficient total synthesis and with a similar biological profile to zzso
