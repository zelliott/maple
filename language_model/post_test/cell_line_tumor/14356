zzso zzso zzso is notorious for the zzso which are in close association with zzso zzso zzso membrane protein 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to induce zzso and differentiation in zzso zzso Then, can it repress the cancer zzso zzso zzso To zzso this issue, the present study was zzso zzso cell line zzso and zzso cell line zzso were used as in zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso were cultured with or without 3 zzso zzso for 48 zzso Then the survival cells were collected to investigate their potential of colony formation, attachment, invasion, and zzso Both zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso were used to detect the changes of zzso zzso The changes of zzso were examined by zzso zzso and Western zzso The results were as zzso zzso the colony formation zzso rate zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells vs zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso the rate of attachment zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso the invasion zzso rate zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the migration zzso rate zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso were all significantly different between the two cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso The reduction of zzso was found in zzso groups, more evident in zzso zzso Thus, we conclude that zzso can reduce zzso potential of zzso cells, involving zzso of zzso zzso zzso were also reduced in this process and seemed to enhance zzso activity of zzso
