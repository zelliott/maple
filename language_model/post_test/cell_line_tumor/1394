zzso zzso are a class of characteristic compounds, exclusively produced by zzso They are attracting increasing attention due to their wide range of biological activities, including zzso zzso and zzso properties as well as zzso zzso A is a zzso zzso that has previously been isolated from zzso zzso and other zzso species and has been shown to exert zzso zzso In the present study we found that the zzso zzso zzso species produces zzso A and through an in zzso cell growth zzso zzso zzso A was shown to induce a reduction in cell viability of breast cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The effect was considerably increased in all cell lines in a synergistic manner when the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso was added zzso Fluorescence zzso confirmed the zzso effect of zzso A, and cell cycle analysis indicated enhanced cell division failure when combining this zzso inhibitor with the checkpoint zzso
