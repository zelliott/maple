Von zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso is associated with clear cell zzso cell zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso has been proposed to regulate the expression of several proteins including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso and zzso zzso has been characterized in zzso however, clinical studies are zzso We evaluated the impact of zzso genetic zzso on the expression of several zzso protein targets in paired normal and tumor zzso 

The zzso gene was zzso in 23 zzso patients and zzso transcript levels were evaluated by zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein targets were determined by Western zzso in 17 paired patient zzso 

zzso genetic zzso were identified in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of tumors respectively and their expression is independent of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression was variable in zzso and had no association with zzso genetic zzso 

As expression of these proposed zzso targets can be achieved independently of zzso zzso (and possibly by zzso zzso this data suggests that other zzso targets may be more crucial in zzso zzso
