zzso zzso is one of the leading drugs in the treatment of zzso but extensive metabolism to zzso zzso can limit its therapeutic zzso In this study we investigated whether zzso itself can provoke zzso resistance that may further disrupt zzso zzso For this purpose, we developed resistance to zzso as well as zzso in 2 human leukemia cell lines zzso and zzso by zzso exposure to increasing zzso of zzso and zzso zzso both leukemia cell lines displayed marked levels of resistance to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The underlying mechanism of resistance in the zzso cells was a marked decrease zzso zzso in reduced folate carrier zzso cellular zzso of zzso This was associated with zzso zzso of the zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the molecular basis for the resistance to zzso was due solely to a marked decreased zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso activity, which zzso more than zzso zzso resistance upon a short-term exposure to this zzso This is the first demonstration that zzso can provoke distinct zzso of zzso resistance compared with the parent drug zzso The implications of this finding for zzso efficacy and strategies to circumvent zzso resistance are zzso
