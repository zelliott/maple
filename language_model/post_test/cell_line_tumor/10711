zzso data showed that zzso zzso induce zzso and a switch towards zzso differentiation in human zzso zzso To test the hypothesis whether survival and differentiation of zzso cells are under control of zzso zzso we examined zzso expression of zzso cells and compared the in zzso effects of zzso zzso with those of zzso We discovered that zzso zzso suppress both zzso differentiation and growth of zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso also inhibit the in zzso growth of zzso zzso zzso obtained from zzso zzso blood with high selectivity for the zzso zzso Interestingly, the observed effects could not be related to zzso even though zzso and zzso displayed opposing effects regarding cellular growth and differentiation of zzso zzso Our data suggest that the effects of zzso drugs are related to a zzso binding site, controlling the fate of zzso zzso cells towards differentiation and cell zzso Since the observed effects are not zzso through zzso the zzso relevance of our data remains zzso so zzso Nevertheless, the identification of the still unknown binding zzso might disclose new insights into regulation of zzso differentiation and cell zzso
