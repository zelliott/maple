zzso are tiny zzso molecules which serve as important zzso regulators of gene zzso zzso expression of zzso has been observed in human zzso indicating that zzso may function as zzso or as tumor zzso To date, the zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso and its zzso the zzso zzso are among those which are zzso expressed in human zzso In this study, we examined and confirmed the zzso of these clusters in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso At least 50% of the tumor samples showed a greater than zzso increase in the expression for zzso and for the zzso cluster when compared with the corresponding paired zzso zzso zzso studies for the zzso zzso which includes zzso zzso and zzso showed that the expression of the cluster is necessary for cell proliferation and for zzso zzso In tumors with high expression of this zzso reduced expression of the zzso protein zzso a zzso target, was zzso We further identified the zzso factor zzso as a target gene for zzso and zzso and it is likely that one of the roles of the zzso cluster is to prevent excessively high zzso zzso which may then cause zzso We conclude that there is zzso expression of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso cluster and the zzso cluster in zzso zzso The consistent zzso of the zzso cluster and its role in cell proliferation and zzso growth points to the zzso potential of this zzso
