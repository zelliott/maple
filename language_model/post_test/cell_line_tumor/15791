zzso is a cell surface zzso zzso for zzso and is implicated in tumor invasion and zzso zzso zzso of zzso plays a critical role in the migration of tumor cells and is regulated by factors present in the tumor zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso growth zzso However, molecular mechanisms underlying the zzso zzso on zzso remain poorly zzso In this study, we demonstrated that cholesterol depletion with zzso which disintegrates membrane zzso zzso enhances zzso shedding zzso by a zzso and zzso 10 zzso and that cholesterol depletion disorders zzso zzso to the zzso zzso We also evaluated the effect of long term cholesterol reduction using a zzso agent and demonstrated that zzso enhances zzso shedding and suppresses tumor cell migration on a zzso zzso Our results indicate that membrane zzso organization regulates zzso shedding and propose a possible molecular mechanism by which cholesterol reduction might be effective for preventing and treating the progression of zzso zzso
