This study aims to zzso reduce the major zzso complex class I zzso zzso surface expression of cancer cells by exposure to zzso zzso stress and a zzso zzso A zzso system is developed and tumor cells are injected at different flow zzso The bottom surface of the zzso system is zzso with zzso zzso specific for the zzso molecules with a simple method based on zzso zzso The zzso promote binding between the bottom surface and the zzso molecules on the tumor cell zzso The cells are injected at an zzso flow rate, then roll on the bottom surface and are subjected to zzso zzso The stress is localized and enhanced on the part of the membrane where zzso proteins are zzso since they stick to the zzso of the zzso The localized stress allows a stripping effect and zzso reduction of the zzso zzso It is shown that it is possible to specifically treat and recover zzso cells without damaging the biological zzso zzso zzso expression on treated and control cell surfaces is measured on tumor and healthy zzso After the cell rolling treatment a clear reduction of zzso levels on the tumor cell membrane is observed, whereas no changes are observed on healthy cells zzso The zzso reduction is investigated and the possibility that the developed system could induce a loss of these molecules from the tumor cell surface is zzso The percentage of living tumor cells zzso that remain after the treatment is zzso The changes induced by the zzso system are analyzed by zzso cell sorting and zzso zzso zzso tests show a relevant increased zzso of natural killer zzso cells on zzso tumor zzso
