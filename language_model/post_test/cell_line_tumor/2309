Resistance to zzso zzso of tumor cells represents a major hurdle to efficient cancer zzso Although resistance is a characteristic of tumor cells that evolve in a low oxygen environment zzso the mechanisms involved remain zzso We observed that zzso of certain hypoxic cells take on an enlarged appearance with reorganized zzso In these cells, we found that a major zzso protein regulating metabolism and zzso the zzso zzso channel 1 zzso was linked to zzso when in a truncated zzso but active zzso The formation of truncated zzso which had a similar channel activity and zzso dependency as zzso was zzso zzso zzso and could be inhibited in the presence of the zzso antibiotics zzso and zzso known zzso of zzso Its formation was also zzso upon cell zzso and associated with cell survival through binding to the zzso protein zzso zzso cells containing zzso were less sensitive to zzso and zzso cell death, and zzso of zzso or treatment with the zzso antibiotics restored zzso zzso zzso was detected in tumor zzso of patients with lung zzso and was found more frequently in large and late-stage zzso Together, our findings show that via induction of zzso zzso zzso selective protection from zzso that allows maintenance of zzso and cell survival in zzso zzso may also hold promise as a zzso for tumor progression in zzso zzso
