zzso virus zzso the naturally attenuated member of the zzso encephalitis virus zzso complex, was tested extensively in clinical trials as a live zzso vaccine and was found to induce a zzso durable immune zzso however, it retained a low residual zzso in mice and zzso In order to zzso or reduce this property, zzso zzso that produced a small plaque size or zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells were generated using zzso One of these zzso zzso clone zzso exhibited a more than zzso reduction in replication at the zzso temperature in both mouse and human zzso cells and lacked zzso zzso for highly sensitive zzso zzso The zzso zzso possessed five zzso acid zzso in the structural protein E and one change in each of the zzso proteins zzso and zzso Using reverse zzso we demonstrated that a zzso substitution in zzso as well as a single zzso change in E significantly impaired the growth of zzso in zzso cells and reduced its peripheral zzso for zzso zzso This study and our previous experience with zzso zzso indicated that a decrease in viral replication in zzso cells might serve as a predictor of in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The combination of seven zzso identified in the zzso zzso zzso provided a useful foundation for further development of a live attenuated zzso zzso An evaluation of the complete sequence of virus recovered from brain of zzso mice zzso with zzso zzso identified sites in the zzso zzso that promoted zzso
