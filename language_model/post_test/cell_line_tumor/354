We hypothesized that zzso function regulates cell cycle checkpoint zzso and zzso Human pancreatic tumor cells zzso zzso were depleted of zzso DNA zzso degrees ) by zzso cells in the presence of zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA was verified by zzso amplification of total DNA using primer pairs specific for zzso zzso Loss of zzso DNA decreased zzso efficiency and the percentage of cells in S zzso zzso cultures were zzso with 2, 4 and 6 zzso zzso rate: zzso zzso of zzso radiation and harvested for determination of cell zzso growth and cell cycle phase zzso zzso degrees cells were zzso compared to zzso cells, with a zzso factor zzso of zzso Although cell growth was significantly inhibited in zzso zzso cells compared to zzso control cells, the zzso in zzso degrees cells was zzso In addition, zzso DNA depletion suppressed zzso zzso checkpoint zzso which was accompanied by increases in both zzso B1 and zzso These results suggest that zzso function may regulate cell cycle checkpoint zzso and zzso in pancreatic cancer zzso
