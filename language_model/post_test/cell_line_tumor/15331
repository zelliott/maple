To enhance the zzso production by zzso zzso zzso for evaluating its zzso zzso 

Response surface methodology was employed to enhance the production of red zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and evaluated for the zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines by zzso zzso 

Based on the response surface methodology, it could be concluded that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso extract zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were required for the maximum production of zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the medium with the above tested features increased the zzso yield by zzso zzso zzso showed the potential zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines with the zzso value of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The study revealed that the maximum amount of zzso could be produced to treat zzso
