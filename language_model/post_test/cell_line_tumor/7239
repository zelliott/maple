zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is currently used to investigate migration and proliferation of zzso zzso In principle, zzso is retained by the cells and is shared by the daughter cells at each division, resulting in zzso flow zzso zzso zzso with each cell generation zzso around half the zzso intensity of the previous zzso However, zzso zzso of zzso loading results in overlapping peaks, thereby limiting its use with cancer cell zzso 

We used zzso zzso cancer cells loaded with zzso at the time of zzso 24 h later cells were treated with an zzso drug zzso Potential pitfalls of the analysis were zzso and a procedure of evaluation of zzso zzso was applied to fix the peak positions with good approximation in zzso zzso were fitted by a series of zzso with each representing cells in a given zzso 

zzso of zzso on zzso cells were analyzed in terms of the time course of the percentage of cells that remained zzso or entered the second, third, and subsequent division zzso A simple algorithm, which combined flow zzso data with the absolute cell number independently measured by Coulter counter, provided an estimate of the zzso outcome of the starting cell population by zzso cells that remained zzso those able to divide at least once, or those that had zzso 

We assessed experimental and data zzso procedures for a zzso measurement of zzso activity of drugs in cancer cell zzso A quantitative level was achievable but required a strict procedure for control of the experimental data, which was not zzso
