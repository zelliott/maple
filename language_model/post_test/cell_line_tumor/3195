Lung zzso is the leading cause of zzso deaths among both men and women in the zzso Despite recent advances in diagnosis and treatment, the mortality rates with an overall zzso survival of only zzso This high mortality is probably attributable to early zzso Although several well-known markers correlated with zzso prognosis in lung zzso patients by zzso was reported, the molecular mechanisms of lung zzso development are still not zzso To explore novel molecular markers and their signaling pathways will be crucial for aiding in treatment of lung zzso zzso 

To identify novel lung zzso zzso genes and to clarify the underlying molecular mechanisms of these targets in lung cancer zzso we created a zzso scheme consisting of zzso three gene expression profile zzso including zzso lung zzso secondary zzso tumors zzso benign tumors, and a series of invasive cell zzso Among the novel targets identified, zzso was zzso in lung cancer zzso and is associated with cell migration and zzso Furthermore, we employed two zzso strategies to identify in which zzso zzso was zzso Lung zzso array profiles and tissue zzso zzso zzso data showed that zzso and zzso as well as zzso and zzso exhibit positive zzso zzso zzso of lung cancer cells with zzso results in an increase in zzso protein expression and enhances complex formation with zzso Treatment with zzso and zzso zzso affects cell migration and invasion by zzso the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso zzso formation of the zzso complex, further supporting the participation of zzso in the zzso zzso 

This finding set the stage for further testing of zzso as a new therapeutic target for treating lung cancer and may contribute to the development of new therapeutic strategies that are able to block the zzso zzso in lung cancer zzso
