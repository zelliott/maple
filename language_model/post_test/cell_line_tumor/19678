The therapeutic effect of zzso zzso a zzso compound from the zzso of zzso zzso has not yet been examined in zzso We used human zzso zzso cells to explore the efficacy of zzso for inducing zzso and identifying zzso mechanisms involved in this zzso zzso blue dye exclusion test showed decrease in cell viability with increasing dose of zzso Wright zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, zzso and zzso features of zzso in zzso cells exposed to 25 zzso and 50 zzso of zzso for 24 zzso Treatment with zzso activated zzso zzso of zzso as Western zzso showed zzso of zzso and zzso of Bid to zzso Besides, zzso caused an increase in zzso ratio, and zzso release of zzso zzso Second zzso zzso of zzso zzso binding protein with low zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicating involvement of zzso zzso as zzso Down regulation of the nuclear factor zzso B zzso increased expression of inhibitor of nuclear factor zzso B alpha zzso zzso and decreased expression of zzso proteins zzso such as zzso and zzso in zzso cells following zzso treatment suggested suppression of survival zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was detected in generation of 35 zzso and 20 zzso active fragments, zzso zzso and zzso activities zzso zzso zzso zzso at specific sites to generate 145 zzso zzso break down product zzso and 120 zzso zzso zzso Our results strongly suggest that zzso induced both zzso and zzso zzso mechanisms for induction of zzso in zzso zzso
