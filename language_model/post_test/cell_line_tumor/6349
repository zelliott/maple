zzso and infection play an important role in the zzso of many zzso zzso receptors zzso are a class of pattern recognition receptors that recognize zzso components of microbes and trigger the immune response against invading zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso recognizes zzso zzso zzso DNA sequences which are the surrogate for viral zzso zzso may react to tumor development and progression during chronic inflammation that involves the tumor zzso In order to study the role of zzso in cervical cancer, we analyzed the zzso expression in different types of zzso infection cervical cancer zzso Then we detected if zzso sequences influenced the zzso expression and the sensitivity to zzso zzso of these cervical cancer cells in zzso The expression of zzso zzso and protein in zzso zzso and zzso cells was detected by zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso was used to examine the zzso expression changes induced by zzso zzso of the cervical cancer cells to zzso zzso was measured by zzso It was observed that the expression of zzso zzso and protein was increased gradually in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Low doses of zzso increased the zzso expression only in zzso zzso cells, but not in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, low dose of zzso significantly increased the sensitivity of zzso zzso cells, but not that of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These results indicated that zzso may serve as a protective agent in zzso negative cervical cancer zzso It was concluded that zzso could improve the sensitivity to zzso in zzso negative cervical cancer cells and might represent a potential therapeutic option in clinical zzso
