In the search for new derivatives of zzso with high activity and/or the ability to overcome the drug resistance barrier of cancer cells, some new zzso of zzso containing the zzso zzso in the zzso group zzso at the zzso position of zzso zzso have been zzso In order to estimate the influence of the zzso of the zzso group on the biological properties of the new derivatives of zzso three zzso zzso namely zzso zzso and zzso both R and S zzso and their zzso were zzso These new compounds were tested for their zzso activity in zzso against the cells of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cancer zzso The resistance index zzso values were obtained using the cells of the sensitive zzso zzso zzso human cancer cell lines, as well as their resistant zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso All obtained derivatives appeared to be able to overcome the drug resistance barrier of cancer zzso
