zzso are naturally occurring compounds that continue to attract considerable interest because of their zzso and zzso zzso They have been reported to inhibit the synthesis of the zzso zzso oxide zzso and to induce the expression of zzso zzso This study examines the mechanisms by which zzso zzso zzso an increase in cellular zzso zzso levels using a cell line zzso expressing a zzso reporter gene driven by zzso elements zzso The zzso increase in cellular zzso levels was partially inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso oxygen species zzso mediate the zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment induced zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso pathway, which was also inhibited by zzso These findings suggest a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso However, whereas zzso triggered the zzso factor 2 zzso zzso response, zzso with zzso did not decrease zzso zzso activity, showing that this zzso is not dependent on zzso Moreover, pharmacological zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso pathways showed a role for zzso and zzso in zzso the zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that the zzso increase in zzso levels results from a combination of zzso and zzso zzso
