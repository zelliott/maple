zzso a widely used inhibitor of zzso zzso and zzso was recently described to induce zzso zzso and cell death in colon and zzso cancer cells lines and, therefore, this effect was supposed to be specific for transformed cells and to open therapeutic zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso and the structurally related inhibitor zzso induce zzso gene expression and zzso formation in various cancer and zzso cell lines of human, zzso mouse and zzso zzso This effect seems to induce defective zzso leading to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso Using further zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso zzso is not sufficient for the zzso zzso In line with these results, expression of a zzso zzso of zzso which significantly increases activity of the zzso zzso under zzso conditions, does not block zzso zzso formation, indicating that lack of zzso activity is not necessary for this zzso Obviously, the induction of zzso zzso formation by zzso and zzso is due to zzso effects of these zzso on zzso protein zzso such as zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso zzso transient zzso formation indicating that the zzso zzso is essential for preventing zzso and that zzso of this zzso by zzso could be the reason for the early part of the effect zzso
