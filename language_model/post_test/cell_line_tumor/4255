The role of zzso zzso in zzso immunity is zzso Using zzso breast cancer model we demonstrate zzso increase of zzso zzso at both the zzso and protein levels in primary tumors and zzso lungs during cancer zzso Administration of zzso accelerated tumor growth and development of lung and liver zzso which was associated with increased zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso that expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso innate zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso Higher zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso conventional zzso cells zzso was present in zzso tumors of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells were markedly reduced after zzso treatment, while zzso zzso zzso mice had increased zzso of these zzso natural killer zzso cells compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso promoted zzso cell proliferation and zzso which was attenuated in the absence of zzso zzso mice given zzso had increased percentages of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and alternatively activated zzso zzso and higher circulating levels of zzso and zzso A significantly reduced zzso cell, but not zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice was observed and the zzso tumor progression was not affected when zzso T cells were in zzso zzso We show a previously zzso role for zzso in promoting breast cancer progression through increased zzso zzso of zzso cells and by diminishing innate zzso zzso zzso zzso may be considered as an important zzso in the regulation of breast cancer zzso
