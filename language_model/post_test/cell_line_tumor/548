Recent studies have found that in addition to promoting cellular invasion, zzso of zzso zzso zzso is associated with the initial stages of cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso has been reported to be highly expressed in tumor cells and induce production of zzso from zzso zzso zzso adjacent to the tumor zzso The expression of zzso in tongue zzso cell zzso zzso was investigated in this zzso It was found that zzso was expressed at the cell membrane throughout the entire zzso in tongue zzso zzso zzso localized zzso to the cell membrane in a highly invasive tongue SCC cell line zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed at a high level in zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso was expressed in zzso but harder to be detected in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso production of zzso zzso was highly expressed in tongue zzso and could induce local production of zzso These data indicate that zzso might play an important role in tongue SCC progression and zzso
