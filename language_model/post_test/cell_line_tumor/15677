Alzheimer's disease zzso causes progressive, zzso cortical and zzso dysfunction leading to abnormal intellectual capacity and zzso We propose a novel protective treatment for zzso pathology with zzso acid zzso zzso a zzso found in food grains and a key signaling zzso in zzso zzso We evaluated the protective and beneficial effects of zzso acid against zzso zzso pathology in zzso cells and the zzso mouse zzso In zzso cells, zzso treatment with zzso acid provided complete protection against zzso precursor zzso zzso zzso by attenuating levels of increased zzso zzso hydrogen zzso zzso zzso zzso and moderately zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso In a tolerance zzso wild type mice were treated with zzso zzso acid in drinking water for 70 zzso zzso acid was well zzso zzso activity, brain copper and iron levels, and brain zzso zzso and zzso levels were unaffected by the zzso There was a significant increase in brain levels of zzso zzso and a decrease in zzso zzso with zzso acid zzso In a treatment zzso 12-month old zzso and wild type mice were treated with zzso zzso acid or vehicle for 6 zzso Brain levels of copper, iron, and zinc were zzso The effects of zzso acid were modest on the expression of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso 1, the ratio of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso to zzso soluble zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso acid may provide a viable treatment option for zzso
