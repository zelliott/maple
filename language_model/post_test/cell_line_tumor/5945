Most cancer cells zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso can promote this zzso program to render cells zzso zzso Although manipulation of zzso metabolism may provide a means to specifically eliminate cancer cells, zzso links between cell metabolism and zzso remain poorly zzso Here, we examined the role and zzso regulation of the zzso zzso family protein zzso in cell death upon zzso of zzso zzso zzso In the presence of adequate zzso activated zzso prevented the loss of zzso expression and protected cells from growth factor zzso zzso zzso associated with and inhibited the zzso zzso family protein zzso contributing to cell zzso However, suppression of zzso metabolism led to induction of zzso decreased expression of zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso shows clinical promise, but zzso zzso can promote zzso zzso zzso of zzso metabolism or zzso overcame zzso resistance in diffuse large B cell zzso zzso Together these data show that zzso protein synthesis is tightly controlled by metabolism and that manipulation of zzso metabolism may provide a mechanism to suppress zzso expression and sensitize cancer cells to zzso
