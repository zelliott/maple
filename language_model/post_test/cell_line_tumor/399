In this study, we created a clinically relevant model using zzso mice zzso with human bone fragments in both right and left zzso and show that the human bone implants are viable and functional for more than 6 zzso To investigate the growth and zzso behavior of breast cancer, human primary breast tumor specimens were transplanted into human bone zzso under only the right zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Some of the zzso tumors proliferated extensively with massive zzso and also zzso to the initially zzso left flank bone zzso We show for the first time that this mouse model can be used to distinguish between primary breast tumors that do or do not zzso and zzso to zzso human bone implants that were initially zzso
