zzso zzso signaling contributes to zzso resistance in chronic zzso leukemia zzso limiting the efficacy of current therapeutic zzso In this study, we investigated the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso a key component of the zzso zzso signaling pathway, in zzso and its role in zzso Gene expression profiling identified enhanced expression of zzso and downstream pathways in zzso compared with healthy B zzso zzso showed increased expression and zzso of zzso zzso signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3, and zzso signal regulated zzso 1/2 in zzso compared with healthy B cells, suggesting enhanced zzso of these zzso in zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso of zzso downstream targets and induced zzso in primary zzso zzso With respect to zzso factors, zzso zzso exerted stronger zzso effects in zzso and zzso zzso zzso effects of zzso zzso also associated with zzso protein zzso potentially predicting response to zzso Combination of zzso with zzso zzso II or zzso increased zzso compared with zzso therapy zzso We observed no zzso drug resistance for zzso zzso as described for zzso zzso zzso zzso further enhanced efficacy of zzso zzso Our data provide zzso insight into the recently observed therapeutic effects of the zzso inhibitor zzso in zzso Combination of zzso zzso with zzso might be a novel treatment option particularly for zzso patients with poor prognosis and should be further evaluated in clinical zzso
