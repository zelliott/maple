zzso zzso zzso zzso has demonstrated zzso activity associated with a favorable toxicity profile and is now being investigated in several clinical zzso However, its plasma levels in patients have been far lower than the effective concentration required to induce zzso (usually 10 zzso This result has led to the synthesis of derivatives with better zzso zzso zzso potential as an zzso agent prompted us to zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and compare it to the parent compound for zzso potential in zzso The zzso of zzso was zzso to zzso greater than that of zzso against cancer cell lines derived from various zzso In zzso zzso cells zzso zzso exhibited about a zzso stronger zzso than did zzso zzso CHANG liver cells were unaffected by either zzso or zzso zzso zzso using DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso suggested that the potent zzso effect of zzso is zzso by zzso the exact mechanism appears to differ among cancer cell zzso In zzso zzso with zzso cells, zzso selectively activated zzso and zzso but was a weaker zzso for all 3 zzso of zzso than either zzso zzso acid or zzso Overall, these data suggest that zzso may be a promising zzso with enhanced zzso activity and reduced zzso
