zzso and DNA damaging effects of zzso zzso and zzso zzso two structurally related zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso Both zzso induced zzso in human acute zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induction by zzso and SAN in these cells was accompanied by zzso and zzso zzso and an increase in the zzso zzso zzso An zzso in the percentage of zzso cells possessing zzso in active form after their treatment with zzso or SAN was in parallel to a corresponding increase in the fraction of zzso zzso The involvement of zzso in zzso induction by both zzso was supported by zzso C zzso in zzso with an accompanying decrease in zzso C content in the zzso zzso At the same time, two zzso under study differed drastically in their cell cycle zzso effects, since only zzso arrested zzso cells in zzso zzso It was shown earlier, that zzso in contrast to zzso does not interact directly with zzso This fact is in line with DNA damaging effects of the zzso detected in the zzso zzso Nevertheless, zzso activity of zzso even slightly exceeded that of zzso
