Drug delivery systems with improved tumor penetration are valuable assets as zzso zzso A zzso zzso system with zzso zzso capable of forming an acid zzso linkage with the chemotherapy drug zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated efficacy as delivery vehicles with an zzso of zzso zzso against two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging showed that the zzso zzso were rapidly zzso by zzso zzso Fluorescence lifetime imaging zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso particles were zzso as intact complexes with the majority of the zzso released from the particle four hours post zzso zzso of the zzso particles was significantly enhanced by zzso in the absence of zzso indicating a role for zzso and its receptors in their zzso However, zzso of zzso dependent and independent zzso and zzso as well as membrane cholesterol depletion had no effect on zzso particle zzso In three-dimensional zzso zzso tumor zzso which more closely resemble a solid zzso the zzso zzso showed a significant improvement in efficacy over free zzso as evidenced by decreased zzso zzso Drug penetration studies in zzso demonstrated the ability of the zzso zzso to fully penetrate into a zzso tumor zzso while zzso only zzso to a maximum distance of 50 zzso The zzso zzso represent a promising therapeutic delivery system for the treatment of solid tumors due to their unique enhanced penetration ability combined with their improved efficacy over the parent drug in zzso
