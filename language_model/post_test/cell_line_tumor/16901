The processes of zzso zzso zzso and class switch zzso introduced by zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso are key steps for creating a pool of diversified zzso in zzso center B cells zzso Unfortunately, zzso can also accidentally introduce zzso at bystander zzso particularly within the zzso regulatory regions of zzso relevant to diffuse large B cell zzso zzso Since current methods for zzso sequencing such as zzso zzso and zzso only target zzso in coding regions, to date zzso promoter zzso have been studied only in a handful zzso We designed a novel approach zzso zzso tools with next generation sequencing technology to identify regulatory zzso targeted by zzso zzso We observed increased numbers of zzso associated sequence zzso hotspots in zzso cells as compared to primary normal zzso center B zzso Many of these zzso hotspots map to genes that have not been reported before as zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso all of which have potential roles in B cell survival, zzso and zzso zzso In addition, using zzso and zzso as examples, we demonstrated that zzso sites identified in these zzso regulatory regions greatly altered their zzso activities in a reporter zzso Our approach provides a first cost-efficient, zzso method to identify regulatory zzso and zzso zzso zzso
