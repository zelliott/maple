zzso encodes the zzso zzso for a zzso zzso that is expressed on zzso zzso In this study we show that the zzso to zzso region of the zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso early zzso zzso was isolated in a zzso zzso screen using the zzso to zzso region of the zzso promoter as zzso zzso zzso protein was able to bind within the zzso to zzso region that zzso a shorter binding site for zzso zzso zzso of zzso activated the zzso promoter specifically in zzso cells, zzso zzso of zzso with small interfering zzso zzso also zzso expression of zzso In zzso zzso does not physically interact with zzso zzso and zzso mobility shift analyses of zzso zzso and zzso revealed that zzso competes with these zzso proteins for binding to overlapping sites in the zzso zzso Although zzso and zzso are zzso expressed in zzso and zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso revealed differential occupancy of the zzso promoter by these zzso In zzso zzso and zzso cells, occupancy of the zzso promoter by zzso is zzso Upon differentiation of zzso cells and subsequent zzso of zzso zzso zzso occupancy zzso In contrast, occupancy by zzso remains low in zzso cells exposed to zzso zzso We propose that zzso of zzso expression following differentiation of zzso cells is zzso through increased binding of zzso binding to the zzso zzso
