The zzso zzso exhibit a zzso zzso property in the heart and kidney while less is known about the effect of this class of drugs on zzso zzso We studied the effects of three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso in zzso human zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso activity, DNA zzso zzso zzso and the number of zzso positive cells consistent with the induction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso demonstrated a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso directly inhibited the zzso activity of zzso zzso 9 while zzso did not; however, none of the zzso zzso that were examined directly blocked zzso 2 or 3 zzso In isolated zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso c release while zzso did zzso We conclude that zzso and zzso zzso protect zzso cells against zzso zzso through a dual action on the zzso and on zzso 9 in a cell type and an zzso paradigm where the conventional zzso of zzso zzso transition such as zzso A and zzso acid demonstrate no zzso
