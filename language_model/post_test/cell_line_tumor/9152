zzso zzso is zzso in human zzso zzso diseases, including cervical zzso Although zzso E6 and zzso zzso have been zzso linked to cervical zzso their effects on zzso gene expression are zzso Increased levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso synthesis were detected in zzso zzso and zzso cervical cancer cells zzso and zzso compared with an zzso cervical cancer cell line zzso zzso E6 and zzso zzso induced zzso zzso by zzso the zzso growth factor zzso zzso protein zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in part, by inducing the release of zzso an zzso zzso The zzso effects of zzso E6 and zzso were zzso by enhanced binding of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso element zzso of the zzso zzso The potential contribution of zzso and zzso to zzso zzso and zzso induction of zzso was also zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that E6 and zzso zzso induced the recruitment of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso element binding zzso zzso to the zzso zzso In contrast, E6 and zzso inhibited the binding of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complex to the zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso blocked zzso and zzso stimulation of the zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso E6 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by inducing a zzso zzso To our knowledge, this study also provides the first evidence that zzso can function as a zzso of zzso gene zzso
