zzso zzso is characterized by late diagnosis due to lack of early symptoms, extensive zzso and high resistance to zzso zzso Recently, a zzso of cells within pancreatic zzso termed cancer stem cells zzso has been characterized and zzso to be the drivers for pancreatic cancer and responsible for zzso zzso Further studies on pancreatic zzso are therefore of particular importance to identify novel diagnosis markers and therapeutic targets for this dismal zzso zzso the zzso zzso of pancreatic cancer zzso zzso cells was isolated from a human pancreatic zzso cell line zzso and demonstrated zzso increased invasion ability compared to zzso zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso zzso we identified a zzso expressed set of zzso between these two zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, exhibit distinctly strong binding to zzso zzso The zzso extracted by zzso affinity zzso were consequently analyzed by zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso were identified, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of tissue zzso showed that zzso was significantly associated with late-stage pancreatic zzso and zzso was exclusively zzso with zzso in a small population of zzso zzso However, zzso expression was dramatically decreased along with tumor zzso zzso present on the zzso membrane of zzso cells and vessels in early stage zzso Our findings suggest that these zzso may provide potential therapeutic targets and promising zzso markers for pancreatic zzso
