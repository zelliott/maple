A zzso copper complex of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso previously tested on zzso zzso cell lines has been recently zzso to evaluate its behavior on different zzso and human zzso cell lines and has been zzso in zzso and in zzso with its zzso counterpart zzso On zzso zzso zzso cell line in zzso both compounds significantly inhibit cell proliferation at zzso zzso although the zzso compound is more zzso Despite this zzso they lack in zzso activity on zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso human cell lines, with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso M, respectively, but it is inactive on zzso Moreover, it alters significantly the cell cycle of zzso and zzso lines and decreases the zzso activity of zzso To verify if other zzso copper complexes show relevant biological activity new complexes with zzso zzso zzso have been zzso and characterized using zzso zzso Three of them, namely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were also characterized by X-ray zzso These complexes are zzso and all three present a square zzso zzso geometry with the zzso showing an zzso zzso zzso Their biological activities have been tested in zzso on zzso zzso and zzso cell lines to ascertain their effectiveness in comparison to the corresponding zzso complex zzso zzso 1 shows weak proliferation zzso on all three cell lines, but it does not induce zzso and it does not inhibit zzso activity, compound 2 is not effective at low concentration and is toxic at higher zzso compound 3 zzso zzso cell growth better than complex 1 but it does not exert any other biological zzso
