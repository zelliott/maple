The present study aimed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of combining vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso blockade using zzso zzso inhibitor zzso with zzso for the treatment of zzso zzso zzso The in zzso effects of the treatments were determined in a rat zzso zzso model, in which zzso was generated by zzso artery zzso zzso Compared with zzso alone, zzso combined with zzso significantly prolonged the animal survival, reduced the tumor size, induced more tumor tissue necrosis and zzso and zzso the expression of von zzso zzso The mechanism was explored in zzso using zzso zzso and zzso cell lines, zzso zzso combined with zzso decreased the expression of zzso and zzso receptors in both cell lines and suppressed the cell viability by induction of cell cycle arrest and promotion of zzso zzso of zzso form zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso D1 were detected with the combined zzso zzso zzso zzso cells to the zzso effect of zzso on forming zzso zzso The zzso of tumor cells was inhibited by zzso and the combined approach, with zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, in the zzso cells, the combined treatment inhibited the zzso cell zzso with suppressed zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso combined with zzso achieved a better therapeutic efficacy than zzso alone through enhancing zzso zzso cell effect and preventing the zzso of zzso zzso
