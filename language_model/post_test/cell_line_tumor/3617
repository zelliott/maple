In this study, we show the feasibility of a new type of cell based zzso which uses zzso in zzso real time detection of zzso changes in living cells exposed to toxic chemical zzso We used a high power zzso zzso laser to measure the time dependent changes in the zzso spectrum of individual living human lung cells zzso cell line) treated with a toxic agent zzso zzso 250 zzso zzso Individual cells were monitored by zzso zzso over a total time span of zzso zzso with 30 zzso sampling zzso During this period of time, the zzso cells were maintained in a purpose designed temperature controlled cell chamber, which allowed the cells to be maintained in zzso zzso The time dependent changes in the zzso zzso were correlated with the sequences of events that occur during cell zzso The molecular mechanisms involved in cell death are indicated by the decrease in the magnitude of zzso zzso corresponding to proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso and DNA zzso by zzso in the zzso zzso zzso bonds zzso To support these conclusions, viability tests and Western zzso analysis of zzso protein were carried zzso This technique could overcome the limitations of other detection systems available, since the specific time dependent zzso changes in the living cells can be used for the identification and zzso of a large range of toxic zzso This technique could also be used with cellular zzso for high zzso in zzso zzso testing of pharmaceuticals and in zzso monitoring of the growth of engineered zzso
