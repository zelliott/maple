The zzso involving zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso which leads to zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 79 zzso has been implicated in survival after exposure to zzso radiation in zzso zzso We found that depletion of zzso zzso of zzso compromises the response to zzso radiation, leading to increased zzso and a zzso checkpoint zzso The zzso in zzso function was also associated with increased sensitivity to zzso drugs and defective formation of zzso zzso in mouse cells, suggesting a zzso in zzso zzso repair analogous to that seen in zzso In budding zzso zzso is important for the recruitment of the checkpoint signaling protein zzso to sites of zzso breaks zzso However, in zzso cells, zzso (the zzso zzso in addition to zzso recognizes a different zzso zzso and some studies argue that it is zzso and not zzso that is the preferred target for zzso We show here that depletion of zzso specifically reduced zzso of zzso without affecting zzso of zzso Thus our data suggest that the observed defects in the radiation response of zzso cells are associated with reduced zzso and not with zzso
