zzso cancer therapy relies on the fact that several bacterial species are capable of targeting tumor tissue and that bacteria can be genetically engineered to selectively deliver therapeutic proteins of interest to the targeted zzso However, the challenge of bacterial cancer therapy is the release of the therapeutic proteins from the bacteria and entry of the proteins into tumor zzso This study employed an attenuated zzso zzso to selectively deliver the zzso targeting domain of zzso zzso as a potential therapeutic cargo zzso and examined its zzso zzso To release zzso from the bacteria, a novel bacterial zzso system of zzso origin was zzso To facilitate the entry of zzso into the tumor cells, the zzso was fused to zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso derived from a zzso zzso channel zzso The gene zzso zzso and the zzso zzso genes were placed under the control of zzso , a promoter activated by zzso We demonstrated that zzso zzso molecules expressed by the zzso were zzso in cultured tumor cells and in mice with zzso colon zzso
