The zzso activity of zzso against zzso prostate cancer cells in zzso and the possible mechanism were zzso After zzso treatment, the effect of zzso on the proliferation of prostate cancer zzso cells was assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed to analyze the cell cycle and the induction of zzso of tumor zzso A zzso reporter gene zzso was used to determine the effects of zzso on the activities of zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso The results showed zzso could effectively inhibit the proliferation of zzso cells in zzso ( zzso zzso were arrested at zzso zzso After zzso treatment, the percentage of zzso cells was significantly higher than in control group ( zzso The results of the zzso zzso revealed that zzso selectively inhibited the activities of the zzso and zzso signaling pathways in zzso cells zzso It was suggested that zzso could exert zzso activity against zzso prostate cancer cells in zzso by zzso cellular proliferation and inducing zzso which was probably contributed to the zzso of zzso factors zzso and zzso
