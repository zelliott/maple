Breast cancer accounted for 15 per cent of total cancer deaths in female patients in zzso Although significant progress has been made in treating zzso breast cancer patients, there is still no effective therapy targeting late-stage zzso breast zzso except for the conventional chemotherapy zzso Until effective therapy for zzso zzso zzso the identification of zzso for the early detection of zzso zzso continues to hold the key to successful management of breast cancer zzso Our study concentrated on the low molecular weight zzso region of the serum protein and the information it contains for identifying zzso that could reflect the ongoing zzso state of all zzso zzso to technical difficulties in harvesting zzso species, studying these zzso has been challenging until zzso In our study, we have recently developed zzso zzso technologies to separate small zzso from the large proteins in zzso We used zzso zzso chips, with a highly periodic zzso and uniform pore size distribution, to isolate zzso proteins and peptides from the serum of nude mice with zzso human breast cancer lung zzso By zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso and zzso analysis, we were able to identify protein signatures unique to different stages of cancer zzso The approach and results reported in this study possess a significant potential for the discovery of zzso zzso that may significantly enhance personalized medicine targeted at zzso breast zzso
