The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso translation initiation factor zzso a protein essential for cell zzso Using zzso predictions and reporter gene zzso we have identified a zzso element within the zzso zzso region zzso that contains a number of target sites for zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso in several prostate cancer cell lines compared with normal prostate zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and/or zzso in zzso prostate cancer cells reduced zzso zzso and protein expression and inhibited cell zzso We observed synergistic growth zzso with the combination of zzso and zzso and zzso a pharmacological zzso zzso Finally, we identified a significant inverse relationship between the expression of zzso or zzso and zzso in a cohort of human prostate cancer zzso Our results suggest a novel role for zzso and zzso in the control of prostate cancer cell growth via the regulation of zzso expression and zzso zzso
