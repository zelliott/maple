zzso III zzso which was recently cloned and identified, exhibits zzso zzso activity toward a zzso zzso with zzso forming the zzso zzso zzso or zzso Though zzso has not been found in the gastric zzso a large amount of transcript was detected in our previous zzso To increase our knowledge of zzso expression and its product zzso we examined the exact zzso of zzso in human gastric zzso using a newly developed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso specifically detected the zzso that zzso the zzso gene into zzso cells, and the terminal zzso zzso yielded on the cell surface was recognized by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was localized in the zzso region of surface zzso cells in gastric zzso and zzso positively stained the zzso zzso by the zzso In contrast, in the cells of the zzso compartment in the zzso zzso and a few cells in the zzso zzso zzso was observed in the zzso position of the nucleus, where no zzso zzso was zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso did not overlap with the zzso zzso By measuring the binding activity of zzso using automated frontal affinity zzso zzso we found zzso to bind most strongly zzso among the sugar chains zzso Neither zzso nor zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso expression of zzso is essential for the formation of zzso on the surface zzso cells and that zzso and zzso are novel differentiation markers of surface zzso cells in the gastric zzso
