zzso zzso are rapidly zzso at the end of S phase, and a zzso zzso in the 3' untranslated region is a key zzso of zzso zzso zzso This sequence is the binding site for zzso binding protein zzso which helps to recruit components of the zzso degradation machinery to the zzso zzso 3' zzso zzso is the only protein whose expression is cell cycle regulated during S phase and whose degradation is temporally correlated with zzso zzso zzso Here we report that chemical zzso of the zzso zzso zzso or zzso of zzso by small interfering zzso zzso increases the zzso stability of all five core zzso zzso and the stability of zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso via the zzso zzso in the N zzso zzso zzso of zzso results in zzso of zzso in the zzso We show that zzso can act along with protein zzso 2A zzso in zzso to zzso a zzso in a zzso zzso sequence in the zzso zzso binding domain, thereby zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso and zzso act to coordinate the degradation of zzso by the zzso zzso system and the zzso degradation of the zzso zzso by regulating complex zzso
