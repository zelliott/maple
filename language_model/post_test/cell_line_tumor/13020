Loss of the zzso band of zzso 16 is a frequent genetic event in breast cancer, and the candidate tumor zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in breast cancer by zzso zzso zzso zzso and association with better zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso breast cancer expresses a higher level of zzso suggesting a role of zzso in zzso breast zzso In this study, we examined whether and how zzso affects the zzso function in breast cancer zzso We found that zzso inhibited zzso gene transcription, cell growth, and proliferation in zzso breast cancer zzso In zzso and in zzso zzso experiments revealed that zzso zzso physically with the zzso and that multiple zzso in both zzso and zzso proteins zzso the zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that zzso inhibited zzso function by selectively competing with the steroid zzso zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso for binding to the zzso These findings not only support the concept that zzso plays a zzso role in breast cancer, they also provide a mechanism for how zzso functions as a tumor zzso in breast zzso
