Recent zzso studies reported that zzso treatments affect the expression of zzso zzso factor zzso zzso in a way that is dependent on treatment zzso by selective zzso of different zzso zzso However, no data are available for the human zzso zzso We studied the effect of different zzso on zzso zzso expression in human zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cells were treated with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso for different time lengths zzso 24, 48 zzso zzso of total zzso zzso was analyzed by reverse zzso zzso and levels of different zzso transcripts were detected by zzso zzso with specific zzso zzso treatment (6 zzso with zzso or zzso reduced total zzso whereas long-term treatment zzso zzso significantly increased total zzso zzso zzso These changes were accounted for by differential regulation of zzso IV and zzso zzso zzso showed no significant zzso 

This is the first study showing zzso changes in the expression of total and specific zzso transcripts in human cells following zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso induction of zzso by zzso could be a feature common to zzso and humans and encourage the use of zzso cells as a tool for investigation of drug effects on human zzso
