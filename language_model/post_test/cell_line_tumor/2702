zzso is associated with zzso duct zzso and the subsequent development of zzso Although this is likely caused by adult zzso zzso and its zzso products zzso the precise molecular mechanisms remain zzso To evaluate the effect of zzso zzso infection on differential gene expression in host zzso we examined the zzso of changes in gene expression in the human zzso cell line zzso treated with zzso at different zzso Using complementary DNA zzso containing zzso human genes of known function, we initially identified 435 genes altered by zzso zzso Of these, 31 were zzso and 35 were zzso more than twofold in a zzso manner following zzso zzso zzso of these genes by function revealed that several were involved in the cell cycle, zzso protein zzso zzso signal zzso cell structure, and zzso zzso These findings should provide a fundamental basis for further analysis of the molecular pathways and mechanisms involved in zzso zzso infection of host zzso
