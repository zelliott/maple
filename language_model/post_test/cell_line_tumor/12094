zzso tumor cells that grow in zzso or in zzso as a solid tumor were used to compare and contrast zzso profiles with or without exposure to two doses of zzso zzso zzso growing zzso cell cultures and tumors (1 zzso zzso were treated with 0, 2, or 10 zzso and zzso was collected 1, 3, 6, 12, and 24 h after zzso Growth under in zzso conditions increased the expression of genes associated with the unfolded protein response zzso including zzso zzso like, and zzso Growth in zzso indicated that the zzso genes were not zzso whereas genes such as zzso alpha and zzso alpha B were significantly zzso zzso genes of zzso were found to be significantly modulated under either growth condition by radiation zzso Gene expression was not dose zzso Sixty percent of these genes exhibited similar zzso under both in zzso and in zzso zzso however, zzso of the genes were modulated by radiation under in zzso conditions zzso zzso profiles for the same tumor cells can zzso dependent on growth conditions, zzso the influence that the tumor zzso exerts on gene expression for both growth of solid tumors and their response to radiation zzso
