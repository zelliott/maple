We characterized zzso toxicity in human zzso zzso cells as a direct effect of zzso on cell reductive power, measured as zzso and zzso cell zzso In cell zzso with 100 or 500 zzso zzso the zzso of zzso inside the cell reached a maximum after 6 zzso The decrease in cell viability was zzso and zzso respectively, after 24 zzso and was not altered by zzso zzso with zzso zzso was zzso to zzso by zzso zzso and, at 500 zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso potential and oxygen zzso This zzso concentration caused only a slight increase in cell zzso in the absence of zzso but a dramatic decrease in zzso and zzso cell content and a zzso decrease in total cell zzso and zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso a product of zzso zzso was found to be a zzso inhibitor and a strong zzso of zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso We conclude that zzso may affect zzso and zzso zzso zzso When the zzso zzso of zzso and oxidized zzso are similar, zzso triggers a zzso cycle with zzso that leads to its own zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso zzso by zzso was assessed in zzso zzso zzso concentration decreased at the same time as zzso zzso zzso The break in cell zzso zzso not excluding the involvement of free oxygen zzso could be sufficient to explain the toxicity of zzso in zzso zzso
