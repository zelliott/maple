zzso zzso zzso is one of the most aggressive zzso diseases and is highly resistant to conventional zzso zzso a major zzso zzso derived from the zzso of zzso zzso has been reported a few zzso zzso However, the mechanisms of zzso effects are not well understood and its detailed activities on zzso cells have not been zzso Our results suggest that zzso exhibited zzso against zzso zzso cells, but not against zzso zzso and zzso a normal human liver cell zzso In addition, consistent with the induction of zzso phase cell population in flow zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso of zzso by western zzso analysis, as evidenced by the appearance of cell cycle arrest, were observed in zzso cells treated with zzso Our results demonstrated zzso induced zzso stress and zzso acting through multiple signaling zzso by the zzso of zzso Bid, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the protein expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso dramatically by zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso resulted in a diffuse zzso zzso zzso and the strong fluorescent spots, representing zzso The significant reduction of the migration in zzso cells and the zzso zzso formation of zzso by zzso were also zzso These observations reveal that the therapeutic potential of zzso in treating zzso zzso cells, containing copies of zzso B virus zzso zzso
