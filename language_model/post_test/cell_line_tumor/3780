Despite the use of new generation target specific drugs or combination treatments, zzso caused by defective zzso signaling remains a major challenge in cancer zzso A common zzso zzso in drug-resistant tumor is the failure of cancer cells to undergo zzso zzso zzso due to impaired signaling of zzso family zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso compounds appear to be effective in killing such tumor zzso An zzso cellular platform of zzso sensors in zzso and zzso deficient background allowed us to identify several potential zzso zzso compounds from a limited zzso compound zzso zzso zzso sensor probe targeted at the nucleus enabled accurate and automated zzso yielding a zzso of zzso Some of the positive hits showed promising activity against drug-resistant human cancer cells expressing high levels of zzso or zzso Using this approach, we describe zzso zzso and zzso as the most potentially valuable drug candidates for addressing zzso caused by zzso expression of zzso family proteins in tumor zzso The screen also enables the zzso of zzso zzso events along with zzso zzso in zzso manner in live mode, allowing characterization of zzso zzso zzso
