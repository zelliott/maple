zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso deleted on zzso 10) are found in sporadic zzso and zzso syndrome patients, zzso Recent identification of naturally occurring cancer and zzso zzso within the zzso motifs of zzso zzso referred to as zzso zzso zzso has revealed that these zzso disrupted the zzso zzso and zzso activity of zzso However, very little is known about the underlying mechanisms of zzso zzso zzso in zzso Here we show that these zzso impair zzso function both zzso and zzso On the one hand, zzso zzso zzso lose their zzso activity and the effect of zzso of zzso zzso On the other, the zzso zzso zzso results in a significantly decreased nuclear zzso protein level and zzso activity, enhanced production of zzso oxygen species, induction of zzso zzso zzso as well as dramatically increased DNA zzso breaks zzso When compared with zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso has reduced zzso in zzso and decreased protein expression levels in zzso Our data, thus, reveal a novel mechanism of zzso in patients with zzso or zzso zzso affecting zzso zzso zzso zzso qualitative and quantitative impairment of zzso due to the loss of its zzso activity, and nuclear zzso resulting in rapid zzso protein degradation, suppression of zzso zzso activity, loss of protection against zzso stress as well as zzso of spontaneous DNA zzso
