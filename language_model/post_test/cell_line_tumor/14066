zzso are zzso projections possessing zzso activity that participate in tumor cell zzso We demonstrate that zzso of zzso and zzso identifies a subset of zzso zzso termed zzso zzso that we find to be closely associated with the plasma membrane at active sites of focal degradation of the zzso zzso in zzso breast cancer zzso zzso of zzso activity in cells by zzso with zzso activated zzso or zzso inactive zzso results in a dramatic increase or decrease, respectively, in the number of these structures associated with changes in the number of sites of active zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso does not prevent zzso of zzso at the zzso however, zzso zzso zzso is zzso Thus, elevated zzso at zzso complexes is specifically associated with the zzso activity of zzso Further, zzso complexes are zzso zzso and zzso distinct from focal zzso as determined by zzso of focal zzso zzso zzso which is not present in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso blocks zzso activity, but does not block zzso zzso Thus, zzso but not zzso are highly correlated with zzso invasion, and sites of zzso activity can be identified by the formation of zzso zzso
