Combined delivery of chemical drug and therapeutic gene has been introduced as an efficient method for the treatment of zzso such as zzso In this study, zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso small interfering zzso zzso were zzso into zzso zzso cells using a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso which are composed of zzso and zzso formed zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso drug, was loaded into the zzso core of the zzso forming zzso zzso zzso zzso In gel zzso zzso zzso formed a stable complex with zzso In zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso complex had the highest zzso efficiency into zzso cells at a zzso weight ratio zzso In addition, the zzso complexes had higher delivery efficiency than zzso or naked zzso zzso expressions were remarkably decreased by zzso of the zzso or zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso delivered zzso more efficiently into the cells than zzso zzso zzso zzso delivered both zzso and zzso efficiently into the zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso may be useful for combined delivery of zzso and chemical drug into cancer zzso
