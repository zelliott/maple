The oceans remain a major source of natural compounds with potential in zzso In particular, during the last few decades, marine zzso have been in focus as producers of interesting zzso compounds, especially for the treatment of zzso In this study, the zzso potential of extracts from zzso eight marine zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were assessed in eight human tumor cell zzso First, a crude extract was obtained by zzso zzso and from it, three zzso were separated in a zzso column zzso The crude extract and zzso were tested in eight human cancer cell lines for cell zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso release zzso zzso Eight point nine percent of the strains revealed strong zzso zzso showed moderate zzso and zzso zzso showed low zzso The results obtained revealed that the studied zzso of marine zzso are a promising source of novel compounds with potential zzso activity and highlight the interest in also exploring the smaller zzso and zzso zzso of zzso
