zzso also known as zzso or zzso represents a new class of zzso drugs which has been shown to zzso inhibit the growth and/or progression of human zzso including head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso Although it has been logically hypothesized that zzso is a major target of zzso the underlying mechanism by which zzso zzso tumor cell growth is zzso Here we found that zzso zzso activated the zzso cascade and induced zzso in human zzso cell zzso Although zzso could inhibit zzso zzso the zzso of zzso was not sufficient to initiate zzso in zzso zzso Using zzso and zzso approaches, we found that zzso zzso by zzso induced zzso zzso zzso stress and zzso oxygen species zzso in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso significantly suppressed zzso zzso and zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso could not induce the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our results suggest that in addition to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso might directly induce zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso in zzso cells, providing novel insights into the zzso zzso zzso
