zzso zzso cells zzso produce large amounts of type I zzso in response to invading zzso but can also suppress immune responses and promote zzso In this study, we show that in mice, these functions are attributable to two distinct zzso subsets, one of which gives rise to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso when zzso with zzso zzso induce zzso and promote protective zzso zzso By contrast, zzso zzso zzso negligible amounts of zzso induce zzso zzso T cells, and fail to promote zzso zzso Although newly formed zzso in the bone zzso are zzso and are capable of producing zzso after these cells traffic to peripheral zzso they lose zzso expression and the ability to produce zzso We propose that newly generated zzso mobilized from the bone zzso rather than zzso zzso are the major source of zzso in infected zzso
