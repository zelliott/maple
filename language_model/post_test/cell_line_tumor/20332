zzso is a zzso protein and zzso of a zzso zzso complex that zzso zzso zzso and zzso but whose function is zzso Using zzso zzso and cellular approaches, we determined that zzso is a direct regulator of zzso A Tudor domain in zzso recognized zzso zzso at zzso or zzso and a zzso form of this Tudor domain could associate with the two zzso sites on zzso with enhanced zzso indicating a zzso zzso Association with zzso promotes stabilization and zzso of zzso by diminishing zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso contributes to zzso of zzso in response to DNA damage, and zzso expression of zzso in different cell lines leads to zzso changes that are hallmarks of zzso zzso zzso our work establishes that zzso functions as an zzso of zzso zzso that zzso and activates zzso
