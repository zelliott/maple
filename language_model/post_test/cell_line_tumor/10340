Previous studies have demonstrated that zzso has the zzso activity in human zzso cell lung cancer zzso This study was aimed to investigate the efficacy of single use of zzso and that of concurrent or sequential administration of zzso and zzso in zzso cell lines that are resistant to zzso zzso 

zzso cell lines with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were exposed to either zzso or zzso or both based on various sequential zzso After exposure, the cell viability was measured by zzso zzso cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow zzso and zzso in signaling zzso were determined by zzso 

zzso exhibited zzso growth zzso in zzso cell lines and arrested cell cycle at zzso phase, whereas zzso arrested at S zzso Although single or concurrent use of zzso and zzso has some zzso effects, the sequential administrations of both drugs remarkably enhanced zzso zzso When cells were exposed to zzso followed by zzso zzso was zzso The molecular basis of this zzso is that the signaling pathways that were initially activated by zzso exposure were efficiently suppressed by the subsequent exposure to zzso In contrast, the reverse of this sequential administration resulted in zzso which may be due to differential effects on cell cycle zzso 

zzso as a single agent exhibits zzso effects in zzso in zzso cell lines with zzso zzso and zzso zzso but the sequential administration of zzso followed by zzso is superior to zzso followed by zzso and concurrent zzso
