Development of zzso is a frequent side effect of zzso of patients with zzso zzso We have recently reported that bacterial zzso an zzso of zzso zzso 5 zzso can protect zzso and primates from acute radiation syndrome caused by total body zzso Here we analyzed the zzso efficacy of zzso zzso under conditions of local, single dose or zzso radiation zzso 

Mice received either zzso zzso 15, 20, or 25 zzso or zzso zzso zzso dose up to 30 zzso of the zzso area with or without subcutaneous injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso before zzso 

zzso significantly reduced the severity of zzso and zzso accelerated tissue recovery, and reduced the extent of radiation induced weight loss in mice after a single dose of 15 or 20 zzso but not 25 zzso of zzso zzso was also protective from cumulative doses of 25 and 30 zzso delivered in two (10 + 15 zzso or three (3 zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso While providing protection to normal zzso zzso did not affect the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso grown zzso in zzso Use of zzso also zzso a radiation independent growth zzso effect upon zzso tumors demonstrated in the mouse zzso model of human lung zzso zzso 

zzso combines properties of supportive care zzso zzso and zzso agent, both zzso via zzso of zzso signaling in the normal zzso or the zzso zzso
