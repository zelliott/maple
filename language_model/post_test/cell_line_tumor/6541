The tumor zzso protein zzso is not only involved in defending cells against zzso insults but is also implicated in differentiation zzso a function that it shares with the zzso protein beta zzso We previously reported an zzso of both factors in the zzso differentiation process of human zzso zzso cells, termed zzso zzso zzso of a zzso marker, the zzso zzso promoter, was antagonized by zzso Here we report that zzso in turn zzso the zzso activity of zzso Competition for limiting amounts of zzso zzso zzso was ruled out as the underlying mechanism of zzso Physical interaction between zzso and zzso was demonstrated in zzso and in zzso and shown to depend on the zzso zzso of both zzso In gel shift experiments, zzso reduced complex formation between zzso and its response zzso zzso zzso strongly inhibited binding of zzso zzso from zzso zzso cells to the zzso region in the zzso zzso zzso The observed negative zzso between zzso and zzso is likely to impact expression of their respective target zzso
