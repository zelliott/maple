Aurora zzso A has been emerging as a key therapeutic target for the design of zzso zzso For the purpose of finding biologically active and novel compounds and providing new ideas for zzso we performed virtual screening using commercially available zzso A three-dimensional common feature zzso model was developed with the zzso program provided in the zzso software package, and this model was used as a query for screening the zzso A zzso zzso zzso model was developed as a filtering system, which was able to zzso active and inactive zzso Eventually, a zzso virtual screening procedure was conducted by applying the common feature zzso and the zzso model in succession to discover novel potent zzso zzso A total of 68 compounds were selected for testing of their in zzso zzso activities against various human cancer cell zzso Based on the activity data, we have identified zzso compounds that warrant further zzso Several compounds have a high zzso rate (above zzso at 10 zzso and a zzso lower than 5 zzso for the cell lines zzso and zzso zzso zzso for these compounds identified hits with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has the highest activity zzso zzso zzso zzso The hits obtained from this screening scheme could be potential drug candidates after further zzso
