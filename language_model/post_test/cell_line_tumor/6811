zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso were examined for their ability to induce zzso DNA damage in zzso zzso zzso Using the alkaline comet zzso we showed that zzso and zzso zzso zzso were able to induce the DNA damage in zzso zzso zzso With both compounds, formation of zzso zzso oxygen species zzso was detected using flow zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso cells by zzso III zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso to determine the formation of oxidized zzso or oxidized zzso showed a significant increase of the extent of DNA zzso This indicated that zzso DNA damage occurs in zzso zzso cells after exposure to zzso and zzso This assumption was further substantiated by the fact that the spin zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso decreased DNA damage zzso Furthermore, addition of the zzso zzso zzso caused a decrease in the DNA damage induced by zzso or zzso indicating that zzso is involved in zzso DNA zzso zzso of the cells with the iron zzso zzso zzso zzso and with the copper zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also decreased DNA damage in cells treated with 200 zzso zzso or 200 zzso zzso while the calcium zzso zzso acid zzso zzso (10 zzso decreased only DNA strand breaks in cells exposed to zzso This suggested that zzso are involved in the formation of DNA strand zzso Using zzso and Western zzso lower zzso of the expression of the zzso gene and of the zzso protein was observed in cells treated with zzso and zzso cells showed a marked reduction in the expression of zzso gene and zzso zzso Taken together, our finding indicated the mechanisms of induced zzso DNA damage in zzso zzso cell by zzso and zzso are different, although both tested compounds are zzso
