This study aims to evaluate zzso zzso in a zzso transgenic mouse model expressing human zzso for potential clinical zzso 

zzso was zzso to zzso Multiple zzso quality zzso and imaging experiments were zzso The human zzso zzso was expressed in B cells of transgenic mice zzso The mice groups studied were: zzso control zzso mice, zzso that received zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso received zzso zzso of cold zzso prior to zzso of zzso and zzso without zzso zzso zzso zzso alone received zzso Small animal PET was used to image mice at various time points zzso 1, 2, 4, 24, 48, and zzso The zzso software was used to determine the human equivalent dose for individual zzso 

zzso was obtained with a specific activity of zzso zzso purity zzso and zzso zzso At zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with and without zzso was zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso Liver zzso with and without zzso was zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The human zzso of highest dose zzso with and without zzso are zzso cells at zzso and the zzso at zzso zzso 

PET imaging with zzso in zzso transgenic mice provided human zzso data for eventual applications in zzso zzso zzso
