The chicken zzso zzso protein zzso zzso has the important ability to induce zzso zzso in a variety of human cancer zzso Recently the first human zzso zzso was isolated from a human skin zzso It shows significant structural and zzso resemblance to zzso and encodes a zzso of zzso Using overlapping zzso we constructed a synthetic human zzso zzso zzso fused to green fluorescent protein in order to compare its zzso function in various human cancer cell lines to zzso zzso displayed a similar zzso expression pattern as observed for zzso marked by zzso to the nucleus of cancer cells, although it is predominantly located in the zzso of normal human zzso Furthermore, expression of either zzso or zzso in several cancer cell lines triggered zzso at comparable zzso These findings indicate a potential zzso role for zzso
