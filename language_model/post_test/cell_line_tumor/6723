zzso zzso occurs through unknown mechanisms in certain neurodegenerative disorders characterized by increased and sustained synaptic levels of zzso In the present studies, we examined the effects of treatment of zzso zzso cells with zzso to understand the participation of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells either with zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in a significant increase in the production of zzso oxygen species (by approximately zzso and cell death ( approximately zzso while antagonism of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso significantly reversed (to approximately zzso of control zzso these zzso zzso of zzso in zzso treated cells zzso preceded changes in zzso zzso zzso as measured by zzso zzso concentration and leakage of zzso c into the zzso zzso zzso suggesting a possible staging of toxic events as a result of zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso of cellular zzso properties with zzso zzso zzso showed an zzso effect on zzso acid cycle metabolism via zzso receptors after treatment with zzso suggesting a direct role for zzso zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso The present studies provide novel insight into a possible zzso staging of zzso events that are zzso by zzso of zzso zzso
