zzso of zzso cell zzso such as zzso result in suppression of zzso zzso and can achieve zzso effects depending on the type of tumor zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate whether local zzso of zzso could serve to diminish tumor growth of zzso cancer in zzso 

We examined the capability of zzso gene transfer in zzso and therapeutic effects of zzso zzso expressing zzso on tumor growth using an zzso human zzso tumor zzso 

We found that zzso zzso zzso containing green fluorescent zzso alone or in combination with zzso were capable of efficient and stable gene transfer to a variety of human zzso tumor cell zzso The production and zzso of zzso from zzso zzso human zzso cancer cells was confirmed by Western zzso and competitive zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso green fluorescent protein control zzso and zzso zzso cells was performed in zzso models to establish zzso zzso zzso long-term expression of zzso was achieved in zzso zzso zzso tumors, and it was associated with decreased zzso and zzso of tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not affect the intrinsic production of basic zzso growth factor and vascular zzso growth zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso gene transfer might represent an effective strategy for expression of zzso peptides to achieve zzso of human zzso cancer proliferation and tumor zzso
