zzso expression of zzso and zzso proteins has well-established functions in zzso and zzso zzso We describe zzso expression in 6 zzso cancer zzso cell lines, 18 controls and 125 zzso zzso In addition, a zzso cohort of 53 paired normal colon and zzso was also zzso zzso of zzso zzso was assessed by quantitative real-time zzso and correlated with protein expression by flow zzso zzso western zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso of zzso was seen in over 50% of cases zzso whereas many of the remainder showed zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was more prevalent in stage II compared to stage III zzso zzso Low zzso expression significantly correlated with poor survival zzso zzso zzso appeared to explain the loss of zzso expression as zzso of the zzso zzso island strongly correlated with low zzso expression ( zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso could be induced by treatment with zzso zzso Our findings identify zzso as a potential zzso marker in zzso Although therapies targeting high zzso expression seem plausible in zzso the loss of expression in advanced disease suggests a potential risk that targeted therapy, by selecting for loss of zzso might contribute to disease zzso
