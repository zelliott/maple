zzso zzso potential zzso 1 zzso is a zzso zzso channel expressed in human lung zzso We show that zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso causes zzso zzso zzso stress and cell death in human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment caused calcium release from the zzso and altered the zzso of growth zzso and DNA zzso transcript 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in a manner comparable with zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso responses and zzso zzso and zzso red inhibited cell surface zzso activity, but they did not prevent zzso stress gene responses or zzso zzso paralleled zzso translation initiation factor 2, zzso 1 zzso zzso and the induction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso caused cell death independent of zzso treatment, and cells selected for stable zzso of a zzso zzso zzso exhibited reduced zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso via the zzso pathway, or stable zzso of the zzso zzso zzso also inhibited cell zzso Treatment of the zzso human embryonic kidney zzso cell line with zzso zzso did not initiate zzso stress zzso Likewise, zzso an inactive analog of zzso failed to cause zzso calcium release, an increase in zzso zzso and zzso We conclude that zzso of zzso zzso and stimulation of zzso expression via the zzso zzso represents a common mechanism for zzso by zzso zzso zzso These findings are significant within the context of lung inflammatory diseases where elevated zzso of zzso zzso zzso are probably produced in sufficient quantities to cause zzso zzso and lung cell zzso
