The role of titanium dioxide zzso as a means to zzso enhanced stability into calcium zzso zzso zzso has been well zzso Several different methods have been used to create such zzso hybrid layers on a range of zzso This paper reports the properties of a zzso system created by the zzso deposition of zzso onto a titanium surface and the subsequent zzso diffusion of zzso through the porous zzso zzso The role of temperature in determining the surface contribution from zzso has been zzso zzso zzso up to 600 degrees C did not exhibit any hybrid nature in the uppermost surface, however the zzso zzso to 700 degrees C did show the presence of both zzso and zzso zzso The surfaces zzso to 800 degrees C were predominantly zzso zzso It was also observed that the zzso ratio decreased with increasing zzso temperature and that the coating zzso to 700 degrees C had a value of zzso zzso zzso which was closest to zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso that were zzso to 700 degrees C displayed a zzso hybrid nature, specifically in their uppermost surface and supported the growth and proliferation of zzso cells more readily when compared to the zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso
