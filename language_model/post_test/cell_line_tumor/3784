zzso zzso zzso one of the most common primary zzso brain tumors, was characterized by zzso and tumor cells zzso zzso and zzso combination treatment gained much attention because of the potency in dual zzso of both the tumor proliferation and the tumor zzso In this study, a zzso and tumor cell dual targeting delivery system was developed through modification of zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso in which zzso zzso was targeting zzso cells and zzso was targeting zzso To evaluate the potency in zzso treatment, zzso was loaded into zzso In zzso zzso zzso and zzso could enhance the corresponding cells zzso and human zzso vein zzso zzso zzso and zzso In zzso zzso showed high zzso in both cells and increased the zzso on both zzso In zzso zzso could effectively deliver zzso to zzso with higher intensity than zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed best zzso effect with a median survival time of 35 days, which was significantly longer than that of zzso and unmodified zzso zzso treatment with zzso could avoid the zzso of zzso in zzso site, which was crucial for the tumor zzso After the treatment, there was no obvious change in normal zzso of zzso
