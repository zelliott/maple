The zzso factor zzso has an important role in the zzso of zzso signaling and thereby regulates zzso in a wide variety of human zzso However, the mechanisms controlling zzso protein expression and stabilization are incompletely zzso In this study, we show that the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso both at the zzso and protein zzso zzso activated zzso prolonged the zzso of zzso and increased its nuclear zzso accompanied by attenuated zzso of zzso zzso zzso a protein zzso lying downstream of zzso zzso zzso the effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso and zzso failed to augment the zzso of zzso lacking zzso zzso sites, indicating that zzso zzso zzso by controlling targeting zzso zzso and zzso of zzso The significance of zzso stabilization was demonstrated in experiments showing that zzso of zzso paralleled higher protein level of zzso in several multiple zzso zzso cells relative to normal B zzso Moreover, combined treatment with zzso and zzso zzso led to an enhanced zzso of zzso zzso Thus, our results indicate that zzso cascade positively regulates zzso stabilization and zzso its degradation via zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso
