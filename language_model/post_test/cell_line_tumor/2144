zzso zzso are small zzso zzso involved in zzso gene regulation that have crucial roles in several types of tumors, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso in zzso and is regarded as a relevant diagnostic marker for this type of zzso A zzso search revealed that zzso zzso binds to the 3' untranslated region zzso of zzso an important member of the transforming growth factor zzso zzso signaling zzso The zzso zzso is a negative regulator of zzso zzso cell growth, and the mechanism by which zzso cancer cells evade its zzso signal remains zzso We questioned whether the zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso can contribute to zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso confirmed the direct binding of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with a locked zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly increased zzso levels in the human zzso zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso Moreover, suppression of zzso increased the cellular response to the zzso zzso zzso significantly decreasing the proliferation zzso The zzso of zzso in normal rat zzso zzso cells decreased zzso levels and disrupted zzso signal zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells also significantly increased cell proliferation in the absence of zzso hormone and zzso resistance to zzso zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso of zzso most common zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso Our results confirm the zzso role of zzso in zzso zzso cells and contribute to knowledge regarding the zzso of zzso signal zzso by zzso in zzso
