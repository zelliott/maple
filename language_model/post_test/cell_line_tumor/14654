We have previously shown that zzso zzso T cells from healthy donors are zzso to zzso cell lines and primary zzso zzso In this report, we examined the therapeutic effect of zzso infusion of zzso zzso T cells on human minimal and established zzso tumor zzso in zzso nude zzso zzso was used to determine the presence of zzso zzso on cell lines and tumors, and blocking studies were used to determine the effect of these zzso on zzso T cell zzso zzso zzso T cells were prepared by zzso culture in zzso human serum zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity of the cell product was assessed using in zzso zzso zzso against the zzso cell line zzso in suspension and in adherent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells were of the zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso and effectively killed zzso cells in zzso zzso were prepared using a zzso cell line following zzso with a zzso zzso gene to monitor tumor zzso Mice treated with zzso T cells showed slower progression of both new and established zzso zzso versus mice that received vehicle only as determined by zzso zzso over zzso Median survival was improved in all zzso T cell treated groups between 32 and 50 days by zzso zzso zzso cells expressed zzso and zzso although blocking of these reduced in zzso zzso of zzso T cells to zzso by only 33 and zzso zzso These studies show that zzso zzso T cells can mediate killing of new or established zzso zzso reduce tumor zzso and constitute a potentially effective novel zzso strategy against zzso
