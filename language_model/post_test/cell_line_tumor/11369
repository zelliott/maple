zzso acid zzso is a zzso for topical zzso zzso The effectiveness of topical zzso can be limited by its zzso The aim of this study was to develop a novel zzso delivery approach using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A modified double emulsion zzso evaporation method was used to prepare zzso loaded zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso IX zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso toward a human skin zzso cell zzso cell line were zzso 

The mean particle size of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso with a zzso index of zzso The zzso efficiency was zzso and zzso loading capacity was zzso When zzso was dispersed in zzso zzso it turned into an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could be taken up by zzso cell zzso cells and localized in the zzso The zzso IX zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso were more effective than free zzso of the same zzso 

zzso zzso provide a promising zzso delivery strategy for topical zzso therapy of skin zzso cell zzso
