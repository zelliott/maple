Occupational exposure to zzso zzso zzso zzso compounds is associated with increased risk of pulmonary zzso In the present study we have investigated zzso expression of zzso receptors family in zzso cells after exposure to zzso zzso Treatment with 10 zzso or 300 zzso of zzso induced zzso cell death within zzso Based on data obtained by zzso cell death detection method and zzso zzso the concentration of 10 zzso was chosen to study the expression of zzso receptors zzso Such concentration reflects a condition of acute toxicity in which cells survived up to zzso Real time quantitative zzso has been performed to analyze the expression profiles of zzso family genes following zzso zzso The expression of zzso and zzso receptors was significantly reduced after zzso and zzso of treatment while zzso zzso was significantly increased and zzso zzso returned to zzso value after zzso Instead, zzso zzso was zzso after zzso returned to zzso level after zzso and increased its level after zzso Exposure to zzso did not change expression level of zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso The present data suggests that expression changes in zzso receptors might have a role in the zzso effects induced by this zzso zzso
