zzso zzso zzso channels are expressed not only in excitable cells but also in zzso cells such as zzso zzso Recent studies have demonstrated that several zzso of zzso channels are expressed in zzso tumor cells, including human gastric cancer cells, and are associated with cell zzso In the present study, we examined the expression of zzso in human gastric cancer cell lines and the effects of suppressed expression of zzso on cell proliferation and cell cycle zzso We found that zzso zzso and protein are expressed in the human gastric cancer cell lines zzso and zzso Moreover, zzso small interference zzso zzso treatment inhibited gastric cancer cell zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that suppressed expression of zzso induced a zzso transition block of cell cycle zzso These results reveal that zzso plays a role in the proliferation of the human gastric cancer cell lines zzso and zzso and can be considered as a therapeutic target for human gastric zzso
