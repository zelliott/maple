zzso zzso zzso are the focus of extensive research for combined molecular imaging and zzso In this study, we showed that the zzso dye zzso has optical and zzso generation properties similar to those of zzso green zzso but with improved in zzso and in zzso zzso The fluorescent zzso of zzso has a lower quantum yield than zzso but less dependence of the zzso peak location on zzso zzso demonstrated degradation zzso approximately double those of zzso under all temperature and light conditions in zzso zzso In zzso applications, zzso generated lower peak temperatures than zzso zzso after zzso laser zzso However, there was no significant difference in zzso zzso with both zzso causing significant cell growth zzso at zzso zzso 5 zzso Fluorescent images of cells with 10 zzso zzso were similar to zzso zzso In rats, zzso resulted in a significantly more intense zzso signal and significantly higher organ dye content than for zzso 24 hours after intravenous dye administration zzso zzso zzso Our study shows that zzso is a feasible agent in experimental models of imaging and zzso and could be an alternative to zzso when greater stability, longer image collection times, or more predictable peak locations are zzso
