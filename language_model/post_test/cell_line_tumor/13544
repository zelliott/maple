We showed that zzso is active against primary acute leukemia cells, including zzso acute zzso zzso zzso Here we studied the activity of zzso against zzso cells using 3 cell lines zzso zzso zzso and 10 primary zzso ALL zzso We found that: zzso zzso was effective in reducing zzso cell zzso at zzso ranging from 53 to 73 zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cellular compartments were zzso to zzso higher than in normal cells, thus indicating a preferential intake in zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed a slight to strong zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the combination of zzso allowed a dose reduction of each compound up to zzso and zzso respectively, while the combination of zzso up to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with loss of plasma membrane integrity, irreversible opening of zzso transition zzso disruption of zzso potential, zzso of oxygen consumption and increase of zzso zzso oxygen zzso These data indicate zzso as a candidate for treatment of zzso zzso to overcome resistance to zzso alone and to target zzso cells through zzso zzso
