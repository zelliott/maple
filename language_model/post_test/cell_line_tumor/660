zzso are repetitive zzso DNA sequences found at the end of zzso that protect the ends from zzso end to end zzso and recognition as damaged zzso zzso activity can be detected in zzso to zzso of human tumors, which zzso zzso to prevent zzso or cellular zzso Previous reports showed the efficacy of the novel zzso template zzso zzso as a potential zzso zzso The objective of the present study was to zzso the molecular effects of zzso in zzso breast cancer cells and to determine whether zzso could be used in zzso combination therapy for breast zzso We observed that zzso reduced zzso growth rates without a significant effect on breast cancer cell viability within the first 14 days in zzso In addition, zzso altered cell zzso zzso filament organization, and focal zzso formation in zzso zzso zzso the cellular response to zzso significantly zzso the effects of the zzso stabilizer zzso in zzso breast cancer cell growth in zzso and in zzso compared with zzso alone or a mismatch control zzso plus zzso Furthermore, in zzso zzso invasive potential was significantly inhibited with zzso and zzso These data support a rationale for potentially combining zzso with zzso for the treatment of breast cancer in the clinical zzso
