The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of interactions between tumor cells and zzso during zzso in human gastric zzso zzso zzso into tumors and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was assessed in 72 archival specimens of gastric zzso for comparison with tumor zzso The zzso expression of zzso was examined by zzso in 6 gastric zzso cell lines and in fresh biopsy specimens from 18 zzso zzso of representative zzso factors, vascular zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso cell growth factor zzso was also zzso zzso expression in tumor cells increased with the depth of tumor invasion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as did zzso density and zzso zzso zzso counts correlated with vessel counts, and both were significantly higher in zzso than in negative zzso Of the 6 gastric zzso cell lines, 2 zzso expressed zzso zzso In 6 zzso of 18 biopsy samples, zzso zzso was expressed at higher levels in tumor zzso than in normal zzso zzso protein was expressed by gastric zzso cells, whereas zzso protein was expressed mainly by zzso zzso zzso zzso expression correlated significantly with zzso but not zzso expression in gastric zzso These results suggest that zzso produced by human gastric zzso cells plays a role in zzso via zzso recruitment and zzso
