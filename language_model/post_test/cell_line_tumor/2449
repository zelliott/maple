Seven zzso previously isolated from zzso zzso or obtained by zzso namely the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso for their ability as zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso Cell viability zzso zzso evaluation of zzso and zzso analyses of zzso activity in zzso cells were carried zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso it was demonstrated that the zzso zzso tested significantly reduced viability of zzso zzso zzso evaluation of zzso cells using zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso were strong zzso of zzso In fact, zzso cells developed zzso changes of zzso including zzso zzso nuclear fragmentation and formation of zzso zzso However, zzso 2 and 7 were the most promising compounds in this study, inducing zzso and zzso increases in zzso cells as compared to zzso zzso activity zzso confirmed the zzso zzso
