The ability of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to decrease lung zzso zzso cell functions (including zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso has been previously zzso Specifically, results demonstrated decreased lung zzso zzso cell zzso synthesis on 23 zzso zzso zzso compared to traditional zzso zzso However, zzso different cell lines could have different behaviors on similar zzso Thus, to investigate the zzso of zzso zzso zzso to inhibit numerous cancer cell functions, here, breast zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were determined on different zzso zzso surface zzso To isolate surface zzso effects from all other surface properties, zzso surfaces with various zzso but similar chemistry and zzso were zzso zzso Atomic force zzso zzso verified the varied zzso on the zzso surfaces prepared in this zzso zzso results demonstrated for the first time significantly decreased breast zzso cell functions (including decreased proliferation rate, increased zzso and decreased zzso zzso on 23 zzso featured zzso surfaces compared to all other zzso surface zzso zzso zzso zzso 300 and 400 zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, healthy breast zzso cells proliferated more zzso on the 23 zzso featured zzso surfaces compared to all other zzso zzso In zzso these results provided further insights into understanding the role zzso surface zzso can have on cancer cell functions and, more importantly, open the possibility of using zzso zzso for a wide range of zzso zzso medicine applications (without resorting to the use of zzso
