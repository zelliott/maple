Twenty zzso and related zzso zzso from zzso zzso were evaluated for their zzso activity on human liver cancer cells and normal liver zzso Eight zzso selectively inhibited the growth of liver cancer zzso and zzso cells without affecting the survival of normal liver zzso zzso The zzso relationship analyses indicated that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the zzso parts and the zzso zzso consisting from zzso to zzso units are important for this zzso Among the active zzso zzso B zzso and zzso zzso showed the most potent zzso activity against zzso cells in a zzso and zzso zzso The selective zzso activity is attributed to the different cellular responses zzso and zzso levels, cell cycle arrest and zzso between tumor and normal liver zzso Exposure to 2 and 3 selectively led to cell cycle arrest and zzso in zzso cells together with the increased zzso zzso and the decreased zzso zzso zzso
