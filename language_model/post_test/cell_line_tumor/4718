The effects of 1 zzso zzso M zzso zzso (2 zzso were determined on cell zzso and cell division cycle zzso 2 zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed an increase in zzso cells zzso when compared to the zzso zzso cells after 18 h of exposure to 2 zzso zzso control cells did not show any hallmarks of zzso after 18 h of exposure to zzso zzso Only zzso of 2 zzso cells showed characteristics of zzso zzso increased zzso hallmarks of zzso were observed in zzso cells after zzso h of 2 ME zzso When compared to the zzso in zzso cells, zzso of cells were in zzso Furthermore, zzso of cells were blocked in zzso after zzso h of 2 ME exposure compared to zzso of zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso activity was statistically significantly increased zzso ( zzso in 2 zzso cells when compared to zzso zzso The present preliminary study suggests that the zzso observed in zzso cells and the increase in zzso zzso activity caused by 2 ME are consistent with zzso hallmarks of zzso arrest and disrupted zzso zzso formation, thus leading to induction of zzso in zzso zzso
