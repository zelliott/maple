zzso isolation of a zzso strain zzso zzso zzso an zzso fungus obtained from the marine zzso plant zzso zzso which was fermented on three different culture media, resulted in the isolation and identification of seven known compounds, 2, 3, and 5-9, from a medium containing zzso zzso while a new compound, zzso B (10) was obtained from the medium containing zzso zzso In addition, two new zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were isolated and identified from the rice solid zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were the major components in zzso extracts of all these culture media, while compounds 1 and 4, 5 and 6, and 10 were only present in the extract of respective culture zzso The structures of these compounds were zzso by detailed zzso analysis, and the absolute zzso of 1 was determined by CD zzso zzso 9 and 10 exhibited zzso activities toward five tested bacterial zzso while compounds 5, 6, and 8 selectively inhibited zzso zzso coli, and zzso zzso and compound 3 showed moderate activity against zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, compound 10 zzso inhibited the growth of zzso zzso and zzso tumor cell lines with zzso values of 4, 5, and 7 zzso zzso
