In patients without zzso zzso and vascular invasion must be noted to make the diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso zzso Some patients are initially diagnosed as zzso zzso zzso but develop zzso indicating the original zzso was zzso A diagnostic marker for zzso that appear to be zzso by conventional zzso is urgently zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The objective of this study was to determine whether zzso is zzso in zzso and if measures directed against it could reduce the invasive activity of zzso zzso 

The expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in surgical specimens of normal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was determined using zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein expression levels of zzso growth factor zzso zzso cell lines was measured by zzso with and without cell signaling zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso This was also done after exposure to zzso interference zzso directed against zzso 

zzso analysis of zzso zzso revealed significant increases in signals for zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso compared with zzso or normal zzso or zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso of zzso of zzso with those of all of zzso zzso mainly in zzso cells in normal and zzso cells in zzso and zzso their zzso were to some extent more intense in the zzso than zzso or zzso In zzso cells, zzso signals for zzso were zzso by zzso growth factor zzso and the zzso increases in zzso were prevented by zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso interference targeted against zzso reduced the invasive activity of zzso cells and was associated with zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

These results provide in zzso evidence for zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso evidence for zzso zzso induction via the zzso zzso and zzso zzso They suggest the involvement of zzso in the zzso of zzso cells via regulation of zzso
