zzso compounds are attractive target for the design of new zzso zzso We have previously described a series of zzso and zzso zzso which exhibit different zzso of zzso together with human zzso zzso The present study details the preparation of further, distinct series of zzso zzso zzso and examines their in zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso Two structurally related compounds, zzso and zzso were tested in parallel as positive zzso The zzso relationships indicated zzso substitution may lead to a different mechanism of zzso zzso which have zzso side chains terminating in basic groups such as zzso showed zzso activity in several cell zzso The exact mode of zzso binding may be dictated by the zzso placement of zzso side zzso zzso for zzso zzso as potential zzso agents are zzso In addition, we further delineate the nature of the zzso for this class of compounds, which provides a rational basis for the zzso zzso
