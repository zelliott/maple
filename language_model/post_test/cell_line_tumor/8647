The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and the therapeutic efficacy of a novel zzso system that uses zzso iron oxide zzso and zzso oil zzso to improve the selective zzso zzso drug delivery to an zzso induced zzso zzso 

This animal study was approved by our institutional animal care and use zzso Fifteen rabbits with zzso zzso zzso were treated with zzso delivery of 4 different zzso zzso alone zzso A, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B, zzso zzso zzso a zzso complex zzso C, zzso zzso zzso and a zzso complex zzso D, zzso zzso zzso The infused zzso dose was 1 zzso for all zzso The serum zzso concentration was measured at 0, 5, 30, 60, and 120 minutes after the zzso To assess the distribution of the zzso magnetic resonance zzso scans were performed at day 7 after the delivery, when zzso zzso scans were performed in addition to MR in group B and D to assess the distribution of zzso After the completion of follow-up imaging, all the animals were zzso to measure the zzso zzso concentration and to assess tumor viability through zzso zzso 

Groups C and D demonstrated significantly lower MR signal zzso which zzso corresponded to zzso deposition, in the tumor areas than did groups A and zzso Group D exhibited the lowest serum zzso concentration at all time points up to 180 minutes after the delivery, suggesting minimal passage of zzso into the systemic zzso The zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso for group A, zzso zzso for group B, zzso zzso for group C, and zzso zzso for group zzso The proportion of viable tumor cells were zzso for group A, zzso for group B, zzso for group C, and zzso for group zzso 

The zzso system developed using zzso and zzso can result in better drug targeting when it is used for zzso delivery to liver zzso The results of this study warrant further investigation of this potential clinical treatment of advanced liver zzso
