Giant cell tumor of bone zzso presents with numerous zzso zzso giant cells that are principally responsible for the extensive bone zzso by the zzso Although the precise zzso of zzso remains uncertain, the zzso of giant cells is partially due to the high expression of the zzso zzso of nuclear zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso Here, we have investigated whether zzso zzso protein zzso plays a role in the zzso of zzso zzso results revealed zzso expression in the zzso cells of the zzso and that its zzso the zzso hormone type 1 zzso zzso is expressed by both the zzso cells and giant zzso zzso and Western zzso analyses confirmed the expression of zzso and zzso by isolated zzso cells from five patients presenting with zzso Treatment of zzso zzso cells with varying zzso of zzso zzso significantly increased both zzso gene expression and the number of zzso cells formed from zzso zzso cells in zzso experiments, whereas zzso of zzso with a zzso zzso decreased zzso gene zzso These results suggest that zzso is expressed within zzso by the zzso cells and can contribute to the abundant zzso expression and giant cell formation within the zzso
