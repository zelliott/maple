A zzso zzso biological response modifier zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated to be a potent zzso zzso and zzso zzso in our previous zzso We here report the zzso activity of zzso on zzso zzso zzso The zzso when injected into mice enhanced the migration of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso when treated by zzso in zzso had increased expression of zzso and zzso and enhanced zzso zzso zzso oxide production, zzso zzso and tumor cell zzso The administration of zzso into zzso zzso mice zzso systemic zzso production in a zzso manner and prolonged the survival of zzso zzso zzso is thus a potent zzso of zzso zzso and the in zzso observed zzso properties of activated zzso might account for the in zzso zzso properties of zzso Our research findings may have therapeutic implications in tumor zzso
