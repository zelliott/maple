Fifteen zzso complexes zzso were zzso by treatment of zzso zzso with zzso The zzso activity of these compounds was examined against four different human tumor cell zzso Their zzso relationships for zzso activity are zzso All of these compounds exhibited activity against zzso cell line and showed good activity against zzso cell line except zzso and zzso On the other hand, compounds zzso and zzso are more active than the other compounds against zzso cell zzso The zzso group at the zzso of zzso ring seems to decrease the zzso activity and the zzso zzso at the zzso position of the zzso ring shown the highest zzso The zzso zzso dominates the control of the stability of zzso
