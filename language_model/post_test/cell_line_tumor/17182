zzso zzso at advanced stages or with zzso status are mainly treated by zzso chemotherapy, such as zzso However, a novel strategy to reduce the minimally effective dose is required to prevent severe adverse effects that limit the effectiveness of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso of zzso that can promote zzso zzso and enhance their zzso at not only sites of inflammatory zzso but also of zzso The present study applies zzso gene therapy to treat cervical zzso To achieve zzso expression of zzso zzso expression zzso was constructed using the human zzso reverse zzso gene zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso into cervical cancer zzso cells did not affect their proliferation either in zzso or in zzso However, when combined with a zzso low dose of zzso tumor formation was obviously reduced in clones zzso with zzso but not in control zzso zzso examination revealed that a substantial number of zzso infiltrated the tumor sites of zzso cells, but not of zzso These findings suggest that zzso expression zzso cervical cancer cells to an otherwise ineffective low dose of zzso possibly by inducing the migration of zzso to eradicate tumor zzso This system may be a novel strategy for chemotherapy combined with zzso therapy against otherwise intractable cervical zzso
