The zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso modulated by positive or negative regulators plays a critical role in controlling the growth and survival of prostate cancer zzso Although numerous positive regulators have been identified, negative regulators of zzso are less well zzso We report here that zzso functions as a negative zzso zzso through direct zzso zzso zzso of zzso suppressed zzso promoter activity in zzso and zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso expression by zzso interference enhances zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso In zzso and in zzso interaction studies revealed that zzso binds to both the zzso and the zzso domain of the zzso zzso proteins interfere with the zzso zzso activity both in zzso and in zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso at its zzso domain is involved in zzso interaction and zzso Together, these findings not only provide a novel role of zzso in controlling zzso zzso activity but also uncover the mechanism underlying zzso zzso repression of the zzso
