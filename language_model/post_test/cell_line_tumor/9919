One of the major difficulties in the treatment of zzso zzso cancer zzso is the high rate of zzso zzso This is thought to be due to the survival of a population of zzso cells within the zzso the zzso cancer stem cells zzso that are able to zzso the tumor following zzso zzso the identification of a zzso that can target the zzso is one of the main steps in improving overall survival of zzso cancer zzso The objective of this study was to determine the effect of zzso a novel zzso zzso on zzso The efficacy of this compound was evaluated in zzso and mature zzso cancer cell zzso lines isolated from zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso were treated with increasing zzso of zzso zzso zzso and cell growth was monitored by zzso time in zzso zzso using the zzso zzso Cell viability was measured using the zzso 96 zzso zzso was determined by zzso zzso 8 and 9 zzso The components of the zzso cascade were characterized by western zzso zzso zzso was able to significantly inhibit cell growth and decrease cell viability of zzso as well as zzso cells in a dose and time dependent zzso This effect was due to the induction of zzso which is characterized by zzso zzso zzso and zzso degradation, and zzso zzso This study describes a novel compound that can target the zzso These findings may provide vital aide in improving overall survival in patients with zzso
