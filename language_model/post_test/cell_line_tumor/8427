zzso cancer zzso can appear on the zzso and in zzso zzso liver, and zzso suggesting both zzso and zzso spreading of the primary zzso While zzso agents have been shown to reduce both long-term zzso and zzso the role of zzso in zzso zzso is ill zzso We investigated the zzso and molecular mechanisms of zzso colon zzso cell recruitment to zzso under zzso flow, ex zzso zzso zzso were formed by zzso zzso zzso whole blood over immobilized zzso or zzso zzso zzso were formed by zzso zzso whole blood over zzso or zzso collagen in the presence of zzso zzso colon zzso cells zzso were zzso either during or following zzso zzso or zzso zzso The degree of transient tumor cell interactions zzso rolling, and zzso and the number of firmly zzso tumor cells were zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso formed on either zzso or zzso supported zzso cell interactions and zzso under zzso zzso or zzso supported a greater degree of zzso cell interactions and zzso compared with zzso zzso or zzso respectively, demonstrating that zzso promoted zzso cell recruitment under zzso Interestingly, in the absence of zzso we observed zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso The addition of zzso zzso to zzso resulted in a doubling of the number of interacting and bound zzso zzso Since zzso often accumulate and activate zzso our findings suggest that zzso may play a role in zzso zzso to sites of zzso
