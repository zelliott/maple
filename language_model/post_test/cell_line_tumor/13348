Using zzso zzso signatures as zzso of individual patient outcome has been a goal ever since the introduction of zzso Here, we addressed whether analyses of zzso zzso at the zzso level can improve on the zzso power and zzso accuracy of zzso expression profiles using zzso as a zzso 

In a patient cohort zzso 113 primary zzso specimens expression profiling using zzso analyses was performed to define zzso signatures using various zzso zzso Alternative transcript use was calculated from relative zzso zzso zzso of alternative transcripts was achieved using zzso and zzso zzso 

Both zzso derived from the gene or the zzso levels resulted in prediction zzso zzso for both zzso and overall survival and proved as independent zzso markers in zzso zzso Alternative transcript use was most prominently linked to the amplification status of the zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

As zzso zzso prediction yields comparable, but not significantly better, prediction accuracy than gene zzso zzso zzso zzso seem to be sufficiently precise for predicting outcome of zzso zzso However, zzso analyses provide added knowledge by identifying alternative transcript use, which should deepen the understanding of zzso zzso
