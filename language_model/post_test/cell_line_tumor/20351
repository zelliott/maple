zzso zzso zzso expression profiles have recently been associated with sporadic zzso zzso suggesting that zzso can contribute to tumor zzso zzso are small zzso zzso that inhibit zzso expression of target zzso by binding to target sequences usually located in the zzso In this study, we investigated the role played by zzso a zzso associated with different human zzso in sporadic zzso zzso and its interaction with the zzso tumor zzso gene zzso hydrocarbon zzso protein zzso zzso expression was evaluated in zzso zzso and normal zzso samples using zzso screen zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We show that zzso expression was significantly zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso We found that human zzso is a target of zzso since zzso inhibited in zzso zzso expression to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso control in a zzso zzso and reduced zzso zzso zzso expression to 53 zzso zzso of the zzso control in human zzso However, we did not observe a negative correlation between zzso and zzso expression in the human tumor zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso zzso inhibited cell proliferation in human zzso and rat zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso is zzso in zzso zzso and may act as a tumor zzso We have identified and confirmed zzso as a zzso target zzso zzso data in human samples suggest that the expression of zzso and zzso could be influenced by a combination of zzso factors as well as zzso mechanisms zzso by the zzso zzso
