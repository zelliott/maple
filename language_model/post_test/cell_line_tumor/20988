The drug-resistant lung cancer cell line zzso which has been previously established by exposure to an zzso drug zzso has an increased copy number in the zzso locus zzso In addition, the zzso regions also exhibit zzso copy numbers, making the copy number profile of zzso 7 zzso In this study, we tested whether the zzso zzso cycle model can explain such copy number zzso An analysis using zzso in zzso zzso zzso with a painting probe demonstrated that the zzso zzso designated zzso zzso was derived from an intact zzso zzso Using zzso comparative zzso zzso zzso we examined the copy number profile in detail and divided zzso zzso into seven zzso Based on copy numbers of each segment, which were determined using zzso and zzso analysis, we constructed a formation model for the complicated copy number zzso zzso zzso cycles and the zzso by healing of broken ends were zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso of the segments observed in zzso zzso agreed well with those predicted from the zzso zzso addition was also zzso zzso In all, it could be concluded that the complicated copy number zzso found in zzso zzso is generated from the intact zzso 7 by the repeated zzso zzso
