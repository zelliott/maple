In zzso factors produced by bone zzso zzso zzso cells are instrumental in orchestrating the zzso process of B zzso Bone zzso proteins zzso are zzso zzso previously found to regulate zzso stem zzso In the present study, we have explored the role of zzso in human B zzso zzso 

In zzso B zzso of zzso B zzso cells from human zzso was evaluated in the presence or absence of zzso in zzso or long-term zzso on zzso zzso cells, by tracking zzso zzso B zzso cells or by zzso of zzso zzso DNA synthesis in the zzso cell line zzso was measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was determined by Western zzso analysis, whereas zzso of zzso zzso levels and zzso zzso zzso levels were measured by real-time and conventional zzso zzso 

By in zzso zzso of zzso B zzso cells or zzso of zzso cells, we found that zzso inhibited B zzso by zzso cell zzso Furthermore, in zzso B zzso as well as in zzso cells, zzso rapidly induced zzso of zzso followed by an zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrated that human bone zzso zzso cells express zzso zzso whereas B zzso cells did zzso 

We suggest that zzso produced by the zzso may participate to fine-tune the balance between zzso zzso and differentiation in human B zzso cells during zzso B zzso
