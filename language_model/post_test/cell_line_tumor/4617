A major feature of the zzso repertoire is strong zzso zzso presented by zzso zzso are irrelevant for recognition by a subset of zzso T zzso To characterize zzso zzso at the molecular level, we forced the expression of a zzso chain isolated from a zzso zzso zzso T cell zzso The zzso zzso repertoire in the transgenic mouse was zzso zzso However, analysis of essential zzso contacts formed during the recognition of zzso zzso showed that fewer contacts with zzso were established by the transgenic zzso chain, and that this was compensated by additional contacts formed by zzso zzso zzso Thus, reduced interaction with the zzso appears to be a zzso feature of the zzso zzso zzso In addition, these findings demonstrate that zzso to peptides is preferred over the zzso to zzso during the formation of the zzso zzso
