The 20 S zzso is a zzso zzso zzso complex responsible for most of cellular zzso and its reduced activity is thought to be associated with zzso of zzso or zzso zzso resulting in a number of neurodegenerative diseases, including zzso lateral zzso spinal and zzso muscular zzso Parkinson disease, and zzso zzso The 20 S zzso of zzso zzso are structurally simple and zzso powerful and thought to be an evolutionary precursor to zzso zzso We successfully reproduced the zzso zzso in a functional state in zzso cells, and here we show that the zzso zzso effectively accelerated zzso degradation of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins of familial zzso lateral sclerosis and spinal and zzso muscular zzso respectively, and reduced the cellular zzso of these zzso zzso Further, we demonstrate that zzso zzso can also degrade other neurodegenerative zzso proteins such as zzso and zzso Our study showed that zzso zzso can degrade zzso proteins whose toxic gain of function causes zzso and reduce protein cellular zzso
