Many cellular responses are triggered by zzso drugs or pathogens binding to zzso zzso but it can be challenging to identify which receptors are bound by a given zzso Here we describe zzso a zzso zzso with three zzso that binds zzso containing an zzso group, a second that binds zzso receptors on living cells and a zzso tag for zzso the zzso peptides for identification by quantitative mass zzso We validated this zzso zzso zzso technology using insulin, zzso zzso zzso growth factor, the therapeutic zzso zzso and two zzso targeting zzso In some cases, we could also determine the approximate zzso sites on the zzso Using zzso to label intact mature zzso zzso we identified the cell surface proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as binding factors on human zzso This technology enables the identification of receptors for many types of zzso under zzso conditions and without the need for genetic zzso
