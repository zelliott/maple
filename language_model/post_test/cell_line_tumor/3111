zzso zzso Nuclear zzso zzso is a novel zzso for multiple nuclear zzso zzso was previously identified using bovine zzso zzso factor 1) as the bait in a zzso zzso screening of a human zzso zzso zzso expression zzso To understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate the expression of human zzso zzso in this study, functional analysis of the zzso zzso region of the human zzso gene revealed that the zzso region is the minimal promoter of the human zzso zzso zzso shift and zzso analyses demonstrated the specific binding of zzso zzso Factor zzso protein to the human zzso promoter zzso In zzso experiments zzso was shown to repress promoter activity of zzso gene in a zzso zzso These results indicate that r zzso specifically bind to promoter region and zzso regulate the zzso of the human zzso zzso
