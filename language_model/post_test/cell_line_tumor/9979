The novel zzso influenza A zzso virus zzso causes the current zzso Its tissue zzso and replication in different cell lines are not well zzso 

Compare the growth characteristics of cell lines infected by zzso seasonal influenza A zzso zzso and avian influenza A H5N1 zzso viruses and the effect of temperature on viral zzso 

zzso effect zzso zzso expression by zzso zzso and viral load profile by quantitative zzso in 17 cell lines infected by zzso zzso and H5N1 were zzso zzso of their replication efficiency in chick zzso was zzso The effect of temperature on viral replication in zzso canine kidney zzso cells was determined by zzso at 33 degrees C, 37 degrees C and 39 degrees C for 5 consecutive zzso 

zzso zzso in cell lines derived from different zzso or zzso and host species with comparable viral load to zzso Among 13 human cell lines tested, zzso has the highest viral load for zzso zzso showed a low viral load with no zzso or zzso expression in pig kidney cell zzso H5N1 demonstrated the most diverse cell zzso by zzso and zzso zzso and the highest viral replication efficiency in both cell lines and zzso zzso All three viruses demonstrated best growth at 37 degrees C in zzso zzso 

Cell line growth characteristics of zzso zzso and H5N1 appear to correlate clinically and zzso with involved anatomical sites and zzso Low replication of zzso in zzso suggests that this virus is more adapted to human than zzso
