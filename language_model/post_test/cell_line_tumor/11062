zzso arm zzso is the second most frequent target of loss of zzso in breast cancer and is, therefore, a candidate to contain one or more classic zzso zzso genes zzso zzso at zzso was identified as a zzso in zzso breast cancer, but zzso in zzso breast cancer remain zzso Several genes have been suggested as potential candidates zzso zzso zzso and zzso but no zzso zzso could be identified in these genes and they thus fail to fit the classic two-hit model for a zzso With the completion of the human zzso new candidate genes can be zzso Besides zzso zzso a zzso could, at least in a subset of the zzso be zzso suppressed or even zzso zzso candidate genes for expression and zzso zzso could thus identify the zzso 

zzso candidates zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso were studied for zzso and deletion zzso and for expression differences using quantitative zzso in a panel of zzso cell lines and primary zzso with and without loss of zzso 

None of the genes showed zzso or obvious expression zzso zzso expression increased with zzso zzso 

Apparently, the underlying zzso at zzso zzso are complex or the zzso remain to be zzso Multiple mechanisms, such as zzso promoter zzso or zzso might lead to the zzso of a zzso
