zzso zzso cells zzso are zzso adult stem cells which are recruited to the tumor zzso zzso and influence tumor progression through multiple zzso In this study, we examined the effects of zzso on the zzso capacity of zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso It was found that zzso medium increased the zzso migration, and efficiency of zzso formation of zzso cells in zzso When zzso with zzso into the mouse zzso fat pad, zzso cells showed enhanced tumor growth and generated increased spontaneous lung zzso Using in zzso zzso color-coded imaging, the interaction between zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells was zzso As few as five zzso cells could give rise to tumor formation when zzso with zzso into the mouse zzso fat pad, but no tumor was formed when five or ten zzso cells were implanted zzso The zzso of zzso potential was further supported by gene expression analysis, which showed that when zzso cells were in contact with zzso several zzso cancer zzso and tumor promoters were zzso Moreover, in zzso zzso zzso imaging of zzso revealed that zzso created a zzso environment which enhances the ability of zzso cells to colonize and zzso In conclusion, this study demonstrates that the promotion of zzso cancer progression by zzso was achieved through the generation of a zzso zzso to increase zzso zzso These findings also suggest the potential risk of enhancing tumor progression in clinical cell therapy using zzso Attention has to be paid to patients with high risk of breast cancer when considering cell therapy with zzso
