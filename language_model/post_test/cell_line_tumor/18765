Two obstacles limiting the efficacy of nearly all cancer gene therapy trails are low gene zzso efficiency and the lack of tumor zzso Fortunately, a zzso zzso zzso zzso was developed that could overcome these limitations, because it was capable of efficiently and selectively destroying tumor cells lacking functional zzso In an attempt to appraise the efficiency and safety of this approach, a novel zzso zzso zzso containing a zzso expression cassette was constructed in this zzso The study in zzso demonstrated that zzso has the ability to replicate in and lyse only the zzso human tumor cells such as the human zzso cells zzso and human zzso cells zzso but not in the human zzso cells zzso with functional zzso zzso this zzso fusion gene driven by the zzso zzso and zzso could be used as an effective selective marker and reporter in zzso and zzso zzso and also zzso as a selective marker could minimize contamination of the zzso virus by the zzso Additionally, it was found that the zzso could be useful for studying the selective replication of zzso zzso in zzso it could be used as a zzso to study the ability of the zzso zzso to spread and to zzso distant tumor cells in any tumor bearing animal model by zzso as a zzso This may help determine the safety of using any zzso zzso in cancer gene zzso
