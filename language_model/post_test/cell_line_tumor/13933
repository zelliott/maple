A human zzso cancer cell line, which zzso to mouse zzso and establishes zzso zzso was used to evaluate the cooperative effect of an zzso gene therapy combined with zzso The zzso zzso cell line zzso was genetically modified by zzso zzso zzso delivery of zzso fluorescent zzso zzso high-level expression of zzso protein enabled in zzso imaging of zzso dissemination of zzso zzso Both external and internal imaging, along with zzso showed migration of zzso injected human zzso cancer cell line to mouse zzso Using this model, we evaluated the effect of zzso virus zzso expression of a zzso zzso either alone or in combination with zzso zzso A single zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso human zzso with zzso substitution zzso showed sustained expression of zzso zzso zzso gene therapy inhibited zzso growth of zzso cancer and resulted in zzso long-term zzso zzso A single cycle of zzso treatment combined with zzso zzso gene therapy resulted in zzso of the animals remaining tumor free for zzso days, which was significantly better than zzso and/or zzso Combination treatment delayed tumor appearance in zzso of the animals, wherein the residual tumors were smaller in size with limited or no zzso zzso These studies suggest that zzso gene therapy of zzso in combination with zzso is a useful method to inhibit zzso dissemination of zzso zzso
