zzso is a tumor zzso gene that is zzso in families with breast and zzso zzso Several zzso zzso zzso are found in different zzso but their zzso zzso and functions are poorly understood at the zzso We previously described zzso zzso zzso zzso to induce zzso and function as a tumor zzso of triple negative breast, zzso and prostate zzso In this study we have analyzed the function of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and compared them to the zzso zzso protein using several criteria like studying expression in normal and tumor cells by zzso protection zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis, zzso regulation of biological relevant proteins and growth suppression in breast cancer zzso We are demonstrating for the first time that zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins are localized to the zzso repress zzso zzso activity and possess zzso activity on breast cancer zzso These results suggest that the zzso 9, 10, and 11 sequences zzso zzso which contain two nuclear zzso signals, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso zzso repression domain are not absolutely required for zzso zzso and growth zzso function of these zzso Since zzso dysfunction is a hallmark of cancer, we can speculate that the zzso zzso of zzso proteins may be functionally significant in regulating both the zzso DNA damage as well as zzso activity of zzso proteins and zzso causes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2009 zzso zzso
