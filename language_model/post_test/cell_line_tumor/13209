zzso a potent zzso used for the prevention of zzso zzso has been recognized as a tumor zzso zzso Its limitation in clinical application for cancer therapy, however, arises from its strong zzso activity, which causes associated adverse zzso In this study, we show the structural correlation of zzso a previously developed zzso zzso zzso with its influence on zzso blockade and its decreased zzso zzso zzso was characterized as having average seven molecules of sodium zzso zzso to one zzso of zzso zzso zzso This study showed that the zzso of sodium zzso selectively blocked interaction with zzso III zzso while enhancing the binding with zzso This resulted in zzso to have negligible zzso activity but potent zzso zzso Following up on this finding, we showed that the zzso effect of sodium zzso zzso was due to its unique structure, that is, the zzso core hindering the zzso zzso unit of zzso with its bulky and rigid structural characteristics while the terminal zzso group interacts with zzso to produce stronger zzso In addition, we showed that zzso was localized in the zzso especially on the zzso zzso One explanation for this might be that zzso was delivered to the tumor via zzso
