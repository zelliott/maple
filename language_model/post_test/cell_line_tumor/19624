zzso interference zzso occurs naturally in plant and animal cells as a means for modulating gene zzso This process has been zzso manipulated to achieve targeted gene zzso in cells, zzso and animals, using a variety of zzso zzso Here, we tested the hypothesis that zzso based on zzso zzso virus zzso could be used for zzso of reporter zzso and zzso expression zzso We found, unexpectedly, in our initial zzso that placement of zzso expression zzso downstream from a zzso II zzso zzso reporter gene inhibited reporter expression but not zzso zzso Through a series of intermediate zzso zzso we found that placement of the zzso expression cassette relative to the Rev response element and the pol II expression cassette was critical for efficient zzso and reporter gene zzso These results suggested that zzso factors, including zzso structure and recruitment of competing zzso machinery, may affect gene expression from zzso zzso In a second series of studies, we show that target sequence zzso can be achieved in cells zzso by zzso zzso zzso reporter genes and 3' untranslated region resident zzso The zzso zzso zzso expression zzso will find broad use given the extensive zzso of zzso zzso zzso for many cell types in zzso and in zzso
