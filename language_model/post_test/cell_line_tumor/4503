We present zzso a short zzso sequence zzso or zzso that is situated in the zzso region of the zzso zzso nerve growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in water and shows a zzso and zzso switching of zzso from zzso zzso to zzso as evidenced by dynamic light zzso transmission electron zzso and atomic force zzso The zzso change was associated with a transition in the secondary zzso The zzso zzso have inner zzso compartments and are stable at zzso but zzso rapidly at zzso The zzso response of the zzso was exploited for the delivery of a zzso zzso drug, zzso which resulted in enhanced zzso for both zzso and drug-resistant zzso zzso zzso release of the drug was confirmed by zzso cell sorting analysis, zzso zzso and zzso zzso
