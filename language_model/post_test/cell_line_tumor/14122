zzso related protein zzso is the primary factor in zzso zzso of zzso and is highly zzso by breast zzso The zzso zzso zzso processing and zzso to give rise to mature zzso zzso one of which is zzso zzso zzso containing a nuclear zzso sequence zzso in zzso acids zzso The current study investigates whether the zzso in zzso zzso is important in breast cancer zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso containing zzso significantly increased growth of zzso and zzso cells zzso and zzso of control respectively in serum zzso independent of zzso whereas zzso which lacks the zzso did zzso zzso zzso zzso to the nucleus, whereas zzso remained zzso and a zzso zzso was not zzso In comparison, no growth influence or zzso was seen in zzso breast cells zzso zzso in zzso calcium zzso were observed in breast cancer cells zzso with both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively for zzso zzso whereas zzso turnover was not zzso Both nuclear zzso and calcium zzso were attenuated in the presence of zzso but not with zzso or zzso zzso zzso Our studies indicate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso is dependent on both zzso and nuclear zzso to induce growth in breast cancer zzso These findings highlight the importance of zzso zzso and its zzso in breast cancer growth and may provide potential targets for future therapeutic zzso
