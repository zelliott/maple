The protein zzso zzso zzso is an appealing therapeutic cancer target for its well described involvement in the zzso zzso Nevertheless, very little is known about zzso role in zzso In the attempt to identify the protein target of this zzso we have devised a model system based on the use of highly invasive zzso colon cancer cells zzso zzso We used zzso difference gel zzso combined with the zzso zzso zzso Diamond selective for zzso proteins to monitor changes in the zzso status of possible zzso zzso whose zzso level was zzso affected by zzso zzso were identified by zzso Two proteins were found to be significantly zzso in this condition, the zzso protein zzso and zzso factor zzso zzso has already been described as having a proactive role in cancer zzso through control of its zzso status, and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso and human zzso vascular zzso cells is the subject of a separate paper by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 2008, zzso zzso The combination of zzso difference in gel zzso and zzso Diamond was hence confirmed successful in analyzing changes of protein zzso which enable the identification of zzso zzso
