zzso zzso hot spot locus zzso zzso is a nuclear enriched long zzso zzso zzso in the mouse zzso and expressed in zzso liver, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, derived from mouse zzso cells, resulted in zzso of expression of genes belonging to cell zzso cell signaling and development, and zzso among which many were of the zzso signaling zzso A weighted gene zzso network generated nine zzso zzso which included zzso a key zzso factor involved in zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling upon zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated by zzso nuclear zzso zzso interaction, occupancy of zzso at the promoters of zzso target zzso and zzso zzso Northwestern zzso and zzso zzso experiments identified zzso as one of the interacting proteins of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso resulted in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of both zzso zzso and zzso prevented the nuclear zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso on zzso treatment in zzso zzso This study shows that zzso zzso plays a negative role in zzso signaling in mouse zzso cells through its interaction with zzso
