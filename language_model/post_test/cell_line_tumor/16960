zzso Forest virus zzso zzso are promising tools for cancer gene therapy because they ensure a high level of zzso expression and a rapid and strong zzso zzso However, broad tissue zzso and transient expression make it more difficult to develop an optimal cancer treatment zzso In this study, we have compared the distribution of zzso zzso particles zzso and naked viral zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso mice as a consequence of different zzso administration zzso The high potential of zzso zzso as a zzso approach for the development of therapeutic treatment was zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso provided primary brain targeting in both zzso and zzso tumor mouse models, but local zzso zzso revealed a high expression level in zzso Moreover, we observed the zzso tumor targeting of zzso at a reduced viral dose on zzso and zzso zzso virus zzso whereas the dose increase led to a broad virus distribution in zzso To prolong zzso zzso we have tested several zzso and zzso zzso zzso A detailed evaluation of zzso distribution and zzso properties could have an impact on cancer gene therapy clinical trial safety and zzso
