zzso zzso zzso zzso is an aggressive zzso zzso of zzso origin associated with zzso zzso Because zzso has limited response to conventional chemotherapy and zzso the prognosis is very zzso Several researchers have reported that zzso such as zzso zzso play an important role in the growth of zzso Previously, it was reported that zzso acid zzso inhibited the production and function of zzso and transforming growth factor zzso in experiments using lung zzso We investigated whether zzso had an zzso effect on the cell growth of zzso the origin of which was zzso cells similar to lung zzso using a subcutaneous zzso mouse zzso We estimated the zzso growth and performed quantitative zzso of zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso levels both of cultured zzso cells and cells grown in mice with or without the administration of zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso zzso In zzso studies disclosed that the administration of zzso reduced 1) zzso levels of zzso zzso receptors and zzso and 2) zzso proliferation and zzso migration of zzso zzso These data may provide a rationale to explore the clinical use of zzso for the treatment of zzso
