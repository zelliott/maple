In contrast to the well-established relationship between zzso and the zzso zzso the potential link between zzso and zzso zzso has been less extensively zzso We now identify a pool of zzso that extend zzso into zzso contacts and are inhibited by zzso that block the dynamic activity of zzso zzso zzso in the presence of low zzso of zzso and following expression of a zzso zzso zzso dynamic zzso zzso the ability of cells to concentrate and accumulate zzso at zzso zzso as assessed both by quantitative zzso zzso and zzso recovery after zzso zzso analysis, but did not affect either transport of zzso to the plasma membrane or the amount of zzso expressed at the cell zzso This indicated that dynamic zzso allow cells to concentrate zzso at zzso contacts by regulating the regional distribution of zzso once it reaches the cell zzso zzso dynamic zzso were necessary for zzso II to accumulate and be activated at zzso adhesive zzso a mechanism that supports the focal zzso of zzso We propose that this population of zzso represents a novel form of zzso cooperation, where zzso zzso recruit dynamic zzso that, in turn, support the local concentration of zzso molecules by regulating zzso II activity at zzso zzso
