Human zzso protein 10 zzso zzso gene symbol zzso is an zzso zzso zzso that contains binding zzso for both the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso has been recently demonstrated to be a potent zzso protein in zzso Whether zzso exerts its zzso function through binding to zzso zzso or both, is not zzso To clarify this issue, we created expression zzso for zzso of zzso that exhibit partial zzso or total zzso loss of binding to zzso or loss of binding to zzso zzso and zzso The zzso human melanoma cell line was zzso with these expression zzso and stable clones were selected and zzso zzso into nude zzso As expected, tumor cells zzso zzso zzso showed remarkable reduction in tumor growth compared to control zzso tumor zzso Surprisingly, zzso of zzso resulting in partial loss of zzso binding zzso or loss of zzso binding zzso did not significantly alter the ability to inhibit tumor zzso This tumor growth zzso was associated with a reduction in zzso density, leading to the observed increase in both tumor cell zzso and zzso In contrast, expression of the zzso zzso failed to inhibit melanoma tumor zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso is essential for the tumor zzso activity of zzso We conclude that the zzso 22 zzso acid zzso of zzso is essential for both zzso binding and zzso
