Atomic force zzso zzso can be used to study mechanics at the zzso Biological surfaces and zzso have typically zzso surfaces, both mechanically and zzso When studying such surfaces with zzso one needs to collect a large amount of data to make statistically sound zzso It is zzso and zzso to process each force curve zzso The analysis of an averaged raw force data is a simple and time saving option, which also averages out the noise and measurement artifacts of the force zzso being zzso Moreover, some biomedical applications require just an average number per biological zzso Here we investigate such zzso study the possible artifacts due to the zzso and demonstrate how to minimize or even to avoid zzso We analyze two ways of doing the zzso over the force data for each particular distance zzso 1, the most commonly used zzso and over the distances for each particular force zzso zzso We derive the errors of the methods in finding to the true average rigidity zzso We show that both methods are accurate (the error is zzso when the zzso of the surface rigidity is small zzso When the zzso is large zzso method 2 zzso the average rigidity zzso by a factor of 2, whereas the error of method 1 is only zzso However, when analyzing the different surface chemistry, which reveals itself in the changing long-range forces, the accuracy of the methods behave zzso method 1 can produce a noticeable averaging artifact in the zzso of the long-range forces; whereas method 2 can be successfully used to derive the averaged long-range force parameters without zzso We exemplify our conclusions by the study of human cervical cancer and normal zzso cells, which demonstrate different degrees of zzso
