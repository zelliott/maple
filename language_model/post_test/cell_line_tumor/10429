In the last few years, significant advances have been made toward understanding the joint action of zzso zzso chemicals zzso A number of studies have demonstrated that the combined effects of different types of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso can be predicted by the model of concentration addition zzso However, there is still limited information on the effects of zzso of large numbers of chemicals with varied structural features, which are more representative of realistic human exposure zzso The work presented here aims at filling this zzso Using a breast cancer cell proliferation zzso zzso we assessed the joint effects of five zzso containing between 3 and 16 zzso agents, including compounds as diverse as zzso hormones zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso CA was employed to predict mixture effects, which were then compared with experimental zzso The effects of two of the zzso tested were zzso being accurately predicted by zzso However, for the three other zzso CA slightly overestimated the experimental zzso In view of these results, we hypothesized that the zzso were due to increased metabolism of zzso zzso in the mixture zzso We investigated this by testing the impact of two such zzso on the zzso and expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and, consequently, a reduction in the levels of zzso zzso in the mixture could contribute to the shortfall from the zzso prediction that we zzso
