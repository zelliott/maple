zzso zzso plays an important role not only in the zzso barrier function of tight junctions zzso but also in migration and zzso of cancer zzso Previous reports show that zzso zzso is significantly related to the zzso behavior in several cancer types whereas its significance in zzso cancer zzso is not fully zzso The present study comprised 119 patients who underwent surgery for zzso as well as 3 cell lines derived from human zzso The correlation of gene expression with clinical parameters in patients was assessed by zzso experiments using 3 cell zzso Patients with high zzso expression were statistically shown to have a relatively better zzso and those with low zzso expression showed poorer overall survival and zzso survival than those with high zzso The assessment of zzso zzso in the 3 cell lines demonstrated that the zzso zzso resulted in a statistically significant increase in cell zzso In conclusion, the present data strongly suggest that zzso expression is a zzso factor in zzso zzso
