An zzso zzso based on an immobilized zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso probe was successfully developed for the selective detection of human zzso zzso type 16 zzso A zzso zzso capture probe was designed to recognize a specific 14 zzso region of zzso type 16 zzso zzso The zzso label zzso zzso was zzso attached to the zzso of the zzso probe through an zzso zzso The probe was immobilized onto a zzso zzso zzso carbon zzso via a zzso zzso zzso using zzso as a zzso zzso zzso with the target DNA was studied by measuring the zzso signal response of the zzso label using zzso zzso zzso The zzso curve exhibited a linear range between zzso and zzso zzso with a limit of detection and limit of zzso of 4 and 14 zzso zzso This DNA sensing platform was successfully applied to detect the zzso type 16 DNA from a zzso amplified zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso sample derived from the zzso type 16 positive human cancer cell line zzso and failed to detect the zzso zzso cell zzso The sensor probe exhibited very high selectivity for the complementary 14 base zzso over the zzso zzso with sequences derived from zzso types 18, 31 and zzso The proposed sensor provides an inexpensive tool for the early stage detection of zzso type 16, which is an important zzso for cervical zzso
