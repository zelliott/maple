zzso relevant mouse models of human zzso zzso are needed to evaluate new therapeutic strategies against zzso In this study, we characterized transgenic mice with bilateral adrenal zzso On the basis of information from the zzso gene expression profiles, we examined the zzso effects of zzso and zzso zzso zzso alone and in combination with zzso on adrenal zzso We showed that intravenous injection of zzso or zzso zzso alone inhibited tumor growth in a zzso manner, as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging zzso However, zzso zzso did not exhibit greater zzso effect than zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the adrenal tumor zzso with abundant zzso coverage was a less leaky structure for zzso Combination therapy with zzso or zzso zzso plus zzso strongly suppressed tumor growth and delayed tumor regrowth than treatment with zzso or zzso zzso alone, even at a lower dose of zzso Dynamic zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso treatment increased blood flow in the zzso indicating that zzso treatment changes the tumor vascular environment in a manner that may increase the zzso effect of zzso In conclusion, the combination of zzso and zzso zzso growth zzso of adrenal zzso in transgenic zzso These findings will provide helpful insights into new treatments for zzso
