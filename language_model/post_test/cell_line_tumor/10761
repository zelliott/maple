zzso zzso factors comprise a family of 5 closely related zzso DNA binding proteins that play pivotal and zzso roles in embryonic zzso To investigate the function of zzso zzso analyzed its expression during zzso and generated zzso zzso In line with the specific expression pattern of zzso in the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso mice failed to maintain the zzso inferior, a zzso of the zzso zzso as a consequence of increased zzso cell zzso To identify specific zzso target genes in cells of the developing zzso zzso we performed whole zzso analysis of zzso expression zzso This approach identified a set of 12 putative target genes being expressed in the developing zzso including the zzso factors zzso zzso zzso and zzso Using zzso zzso zzso we showed that some of these genes are direct targets of zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso occupies and activates the zzso and zzso zzso In addition, known zzso target genes were zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Despite the absence of a central part of the auditory pathway, the presence of zzso responses to sounds in the zzso of zzso mice indicates that auditory information from the zzso still reaches the zzso In zzso our data define zzso as an important zzso factor, specifying gene expression patterns required for the development of the zzso zzso
