Most zzso in zzso precursor proteins zzso linked to early onset familial Alzheimer's disease zzso increase the production of zzso peptides ending at zzso 42 zzso which are released from zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells expressing zzso human zzso zzso were more resistant to zzso treatments than cells expressing zzso human zzso zzso Preventing zzso production with an zzso zzso zzso which blocks zzso zzso of zzso or by treatment with a zzso inhibitor increased the resistance of zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso or zzso medium from zzso zzso cells did not diminish their resistance to zzso Preventing zzso from entering the zzso zzso pathway, where most zzso peptides are generated, by retaining zzso in the zzso zzso zzso compartment zzso increased the resistance of zzso cells to zzso and did not alter the resistance of zzso zzso zzso gene zzso after zzso treatments was much stronger in zzso cells than in zzso or zzso zzso In contrast, upon induction of zzso stress, cells expressing zzso zzso or zzso had comparable levels of zzso zzso zzso an unfolded protein response zzso We conclude that zzso especially zzso zzso zzso the zzso function of its precursor protein and zzso cells to zzso and possibly other, zzso zzso
