Cancer cells acquire disruptions in normal signal zzso pathways and zzso mechanisms that would trigger zzso in normal zzso These abnormalities include zzso instability, zzso zzso and growth factor independent zzso zzso cancer cells likely require a block in zzso in order to zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso provides a block in zzso that is frequently observed in cancer zzso We have developed methods for the detection and analysis of zzso dependence and here apply them to acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso that zzso blocks in the intrinsic zzso pathway, indicated a dependence on zzso of both ALL cell lines and primary zzso This dependence predicted that zzso would be zzso with select zzso zzso family zzso a prediction confirmed by the isolation of zzso complexes with zzso Furthermore, the zzso profiling and protein analysis predicted that ALL cell lines and primary cells would be sensitive to zzso as a single zzso Finally, zzso profiling and protein studies accurately predicted a relative degree of sensitivity to zzso antagonism in cell zzso The ALL cells studied exhibit zzso zzso supporting clinical trials of zzso zzso in ALL as single agents or combination zzso
