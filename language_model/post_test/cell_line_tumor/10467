zzso cell transfer zzso of tumor zzso or genetically engineered T cells can cause durable responses in patients with zzso zzso Multiple clinically modifiable parameters can comprise this therapy, including cell dose and zzso in zzso zzso zzso and common zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the relative contributions of each these individual components to the magnitude of the zzso response have yet to be zzso 

To systematically and zzso appraise each of these zzso we employed the zzso mouse model treating large, established zzso melanoma zzso In addition to cell dose and magnitude of in zzso zzso zzso we also evaluated the relative efficacy of central memory zzso zzso memory zzso and stem cell memory zzso zzso on the strength of tumor zzso as well as the dose and type of clinically available zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

We found that cell dose, zzso differentiation status, and viral vaccine zzso each were correlated strongly and significantly with the magnitude of tumor zzso Surprisingly, although the total number of zzso doses was correlated with tumor regression, no significant benefit to prolonged zzso zzso administration was zzso Moreover, the specific type and dose of zzso zzso only moderately correlated with zzso 

zzso these findings zzso some of the key zzso of successful ACT zzso for the treatment of cancer in mice and further show that zzso zzso offer a similar ability to effectively drive zzso zzso function in zzso
