zzso cells zzso loaded with killed zzso tumors can zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells in zzso thereby providing an option to overcome human zzso zzso restriction inherent to loading DC vaccines with zzso We have vaccinated 20 patients with stage IV melanoma with zzso zzso zzso loaded with killed zzso zzso melanoma cell zzso zzso were generated by zzso zzso with zzso zzso stimulating factor zzso zzso stimulating zzso and zzso zzso and activated by additional culture with tumor necrosis factor and zzso zzso A total of 8 vaccines were administered at monthly zzso The first patient was accrued December 2002 and the last November zzso Fourteen patients were alive at 12 months, 9 patients were alive at 24 months, and 8 patients are alive as of January zzso The estimated median overall survival is zzso months with a range of 2 to zzso zzso zzso were safe and zzso They zzso in 2 patients who failed previous therapy, durable objective clinical responses, 1 complete zzso zzso and 1 partial zzso zzso lasting 18 and 23 months, zzso Three out of 13 analyzed patients showed zzso immunity to melanoma zzso recognized by zzso T cells zzso tissue differentiation zzso Two of 3 patients showed improved immune function after zzso demonstrated by improved zzso of zzso zzso or zzso proliferation in response to zzso derived zzso In one of these patients, vaccination led to zzso of zzso zzso immunity specific to a novel zzso from zzso zzso suggesting that zzso of melanoma zzso by DC vaccine had zzso Thus, the present results justify the design of larger follow-up studies to assess the clinical response to DC vaccines loaded with killed zzso tumor cells in patients with zzso zzso
