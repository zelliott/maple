Two novel zzso zzso zzso 3 and 4 as zzso zzso for zzso were zzso and their interaction with different zzso zzso Compared to a previously reported first set of zzso (1 and 2) the significant extension and increased rigidity of the central part of the structure resulted in a switch of DNA binding mode from zzso zzso studied derivatives 1 and 2 with a zzso and flexible zzso to minor groove binding of the two novel zzso zzso 3 and zzso These two compounds interact strongly with zzso but only zzso with zzso The newly incorporated zzso zzso within the central part of the structure of 3 and 4 were able to control by zzso and zzso effects the alignment of the molecules within zzso structurally different forms of DNA minor zzso zzso even small differences in the position of the attached zzso within the groove were reflected in different zzso zzso In addition, 3 and 4 revealed intriguing in zzso selectivity among various human zzso cell zzso
