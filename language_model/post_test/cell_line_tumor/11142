Recent studies have suggested the zzso of zzso zzso as strategy to prevent zzso zzso In this study, the zzso and zzso effects of different zzso zzso drugs zzso all of them are reported zzso zzso were investigated in human skin melanoma zzso zzso Using zzso proliferation zzso we showed that 50 and 100 zzso of zzso zzso reduced proliferation of the melanoma cells at zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso As determined by zzso zzso the drug was only toxic to the cancer cells at 100 zzso zzso zzso also inhibited the cell proliferation by about zzso at 240 and zzso zzso and was only slightly toxic to the zzso Neither aspirin zzso nor zzso zzso exhibited zzso or zzso effect on the cancer zzso zzso effects of the above zzso with dietary zzso acid zzso on zzso growth of the melanoma cells were further zzso Each of the zzso at doses zzso zzso was incubated simultaneously with the melanoma cells and 160 zzso of zzso for 72 zzso zzso from zzso zzso showed that both zzso and zzso starting from 20 zzso exhibited additive effects on the zzso growth zzso zzso also enhanced the zzso growth zzso by zzso at zzso zzso To our surprise, although zzso did not suppress the melanoma growth, the drug at zzso zzso enhanced the zzso growth zzso by zzso zzso zzso from these studies suggest that the zzso effects of zzso may not be explained solely by their zzso zzso Further studies are therefore required to understand their modes of action, before they could be used alone or in combinations with other agents for cancer zzso
