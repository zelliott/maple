The zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a crucial role in the repair of DNA zzso breaks zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso a key protein of HR, possesses a unique activity: DNA strand exchange between zzso DNA zzso Recently, using a zzso screening zzso we identified compound 1 zzso which specifically zzso the DNA strand exchange activity of human zzso Here, we analyzed the mechanism of zzso and found that 1 zzso zzso binding to zzso We then examined the effect of 1 on zzso and DNA repair in the zzso The results show that 1 zzso zzso and increases cell sensitivity to DNA zzso We propose to use 1 for analysis of cellular functions of zzso Because zzso and zzso agents are commonly used in zzso therapy, specific zzso of zzso may also help to increase killing of cancer zzso
