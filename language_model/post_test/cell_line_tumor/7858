Gallic acid, a natural agent present in a zzso of fruits and vegetables, has been of potential interest as an zzso zzso zzso we evaluated its efficacy in zzso zzso and zzso human prostate cancer zzso zzso 

Cell viability was determined by zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso efficacy was assessed by zzso and zzso zzso growth in nude mice given normal drinking water or one supplemented with zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was performed in tumor zzso for in zzso zzso zzso and zzso effects of zzso zzso 

Gallic acid decreased cell viability in a zzso manner in both zzso and zzso cells largely via zzso zzso In tumor studies, zzso acid feeding inhibited the growth of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in nude zzso zzso analysis revealed significant zzso of tumor cell zzso induction of zzso and reduction of zzso density in tumor zzso from zzso zzso mice as compared to controls in both zzso and zzso zzso 

Taken together, our findings show the zzso efficacy of zzso acid and provide a rationale for additional studies with this zzso agent for its efficacy against zzso
