zzso of zzso zzso zzso a complicated form of zzso zzso zzso a disorder principally defined by the zzso of upper motor zzso Using a zzso zzso against zzso to gain insight into the function of the zzso zzso we show that the zzso zzso is present in two main zzso of 85 zzso and 100 zzso and 75 zzso and 85 zzso in human and zzso respectively, with restricted zzso zzso zzso studies on human and mouse zzso sections and in zzso cell studies indicate that zzso is likely to possess both nuclear and zzso zzso The nuclear expression of zzso closely mirrors that of the zzso zzso nuclear zzso marker zzso a component of the zzso zzso is also enriched at the zzso within zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso protein zzso dynamic zzso changes in zzso human zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso displays a nuclear and diffuse zzso profile, whereas zzso zzso accumulates in the zzso network and subsequently zzso discrete zzso along zzso in terminally differentiated zzso zzso Investigation of these zzso zzso reveals that a large proportion zzso with the synaptic zzso marker zzso zzso is also enriched in zzso structures and in synaptic zzso zzso
