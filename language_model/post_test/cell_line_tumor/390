zzso is a tumor zzso zzso Its translated product has an important function in zzso zzso and DNA repair zzso zzso zzso due to zzso treatment may lead to loss of such zzso To address a potential drug target of zzso for zzso treatment, we investigated the zzso characterization and functional consequences of the zzso region of human zzso after in zzso zzso with zzso To analyze the zzso specificity of zzso damage, the measurement for sensitivity of zzso zzso to restriction zzso zzso and zzso and sequence gel analysis was zzso The results suggested that the zzso favorably occurred at the zzso and the zzso zzso An increase in drug zzso resulted in increased zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso affected the transition temperature of the zzso gene zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso of DNA zzso was shifted to a lower transition temperature at lower zzso zzso However, at higher drug zzso the zzso peaked at a slightly higher transition temperature with predominantly increased heat specific zzso Reduction in cellular DNA repair of zzso zzso DNA, using host cell zzso zzso was a consequence of an increase in zzso levels on the reporter zzso The zzso zzso slightly enhanced the zzso of the reporter gene in the absence of zzso binding zzso The zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso when tested in zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso to zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso activity was dramatically diminished in the presence of a second expression zzso containing multiple zzso zzso The data provide the first evidence for direct interaction of zzso with zzso and raise the possibility of zzso as a therapeutic target for platinum zzso zzso
