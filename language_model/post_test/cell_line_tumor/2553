A series of zzso derivatives zzso have been designed and zzso and their biological activities were also evaluated as potential zzso and zzso zzso Among all the compounds, zzso showed the most potent activity in zzso which inhibited the growth of zzso and zzso cell lines with zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also exhibited significant zzso zzso activity zzso zzso zzso simulation was performed to position compound zzso into the zzso structure active site to determine the probable binding zzso The results of zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated that compound zzso possessed good zzso zzso zzso compound zzso with potent zzso zzso activity may be a potential zzso zzso
