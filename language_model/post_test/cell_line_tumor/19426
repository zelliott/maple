zzso are regulated by gene zzso transcription, and zzso Thus far, few studies have simultaneously assessed all 3 levels of zzso Using real-time quantitative zzso chain reaction zzso zzso we determined changes in gene copy number, zzso and mature zzso levels for the largest set of primary zzso zzso zzso to zzso We detected zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso changes in zzso and mature zzso We identified 68 zzso zzso This defines the zzso signature of zzso and shows that zzso regulation of zzso as well as mature zzso levels contribute zzso information that can be used for the zzso of human zzso
