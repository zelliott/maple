Development of zzso agents that enhance innate immune responses represents a promising strategy for combating infectious zzso In the present studies, we screened a series of 71 zzso acid zzso derivatives for their ability to induce zzso tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso production and identified six such compounds, including one compound previously shown to be a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The two most potent compounds zzso 1, zzso acid zzso compound 2, zzso acid zzso were selected for further zzso These compounds induced de zzso production of zzso in a zzso and zzso manner in human and zzso zzso cell lines and in primary zzso These compounds also induced zzso of zzso zzso production of zzso oxygen species, and zzso in human and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso production was zzso zzso and analysis of the cellular target of these compounds showed that they were zzso zzso and that this response was blocked by zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso modeling showed a high degree of similarity for low-energy zzso of these two compounds to the current zzso model for zzso zzso ( zzso zzso zzso zzso 2005 zzso Overall, these compounds represent novel zzso zzso that induce zzso a response distinct from those induced by other known zzso and zzso zzso
