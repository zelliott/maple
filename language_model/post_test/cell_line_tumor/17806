zzso zzso in the zzso growth factor zzso zzso gene are associated with the therapeutic response to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in patients with advanced zzso cell lung cancer zzso The response rate to these drugs remains low, however, in zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso Combination therapies with zzso and zzso agents are considered a therapeutic option for patients with zzso expressing zzso zzso We investigated the zzso effect of the combination of the oral zzso zzso and the zzso zzso in zzso cells of differing zzso zzso The combination of zzso and zzso showed a synergistic zzso effect in zzso in all zzso cell lines zzso Combination chemotherapy with zzso and zzso in zzso also had a synergistic zzso effect on zzso zzso regardless of the absence or presence of zzso zzso zzso inhibited the expression of the zzso factor zzso resulting in the zzso of zzso zzso at the zzso and protein zzso These observations suggest that zzso zzso of zzso zzso is responsible, at least in part, for the synergistic zzso effect of combined treatment with zzso and zzso and provide a basis for clinical evaluation of combination chemotherapy with zzso and zzso in patients with solid zzso
