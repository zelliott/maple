zzso growth zzso zzso is a zzso zzso involved in the regulation of cell zzso differentiation and zzso zzso zzso In search for novel genes zzso the zzso function at downstream zzso we performed a zzso zzso analysis and identified 60 genes whose expression is regulated by zzso in the liver cancer cell line zzso Among them, we report here zzso zzso like 4 zzso as a novel target of zzso zzso and provide experimental evidence for its expression regulation and zzso zzso was found to be the only member of zzso family whose expression is induced by zzso in zzso zzso zzso mapping of the zzso promoter indicated that the zzso regulation of zzso expression is zzso through the binding of zzso zzso factor to a zzso region of the zzso This was confirmed by the zzso zzso zzso that captured zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso cells resulted in zzso of cell zzso through zzso in the presence of zzso zzso In zzso zzso suppressed the expression of zzso and zzso zzso and the activity of zzso These results suggest that zzso may function as a negative feedback regulator of zzso in cell invasion by zzso the metabolism of zzso zzso zzso zzso
