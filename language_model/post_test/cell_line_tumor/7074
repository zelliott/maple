The role of zzso in particular its ability to promote or hinder zzso still remains zzso In order to zzso the functional relevance of zzso in zzso zzso the zzso cell line zzso was zzso zzso with a zzso zzso or with the respective zzso control zzso Assessing the molecular consequences of zzso zzso we present evidence that zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso family member zzso while expression of zzso zzso is not zzso Furthermore, expression of zzso diminishes expression levels of the zzso and zzso and the executioner zzso whereas the zzso zzso and -9 remain zzso The altered protein levels of the zzso in zzso zzso zzso are accompanied by a decrease of expression levels of the inhibitor of zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso Despite the described impact of zzso expression on major molecules of the zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso does not impact on the rate of zzso Upon a zzso stimulus such as serum withdrawal zzso is unable to maintain its influence on expression levels of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso
