Breast cancer is one of the most common zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the patients belong to the zzso breast cancer zzso group, and have the disadvantage of not benefiting from currently available zzso systemic zzso Some zzso in the zzso group harbor defects in DNA zzso break repair by zzso zzso zzso such as zzso dysfunction, and are hypersensitive to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, only a small fraction of the tumors are zzso and this restricts the therapeutic utility of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso is necessary not only for zzso zzso checkpoint zzso but also for HR, because it zzso zzso for the efficient formation of zzso zzso In this study, we showed that the combined zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso breast cancer cells resulted in dramatically reduced cell growth compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso investigations revealed that this sensitivity appears to be zzso by sustained DNA damage and inefficient DNA repair triggering zzso zzso as well as zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso represents a plausible strategy for expanding the utility of zzso zzso to zzso breast zzso
