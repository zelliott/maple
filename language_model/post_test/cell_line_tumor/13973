The processes of zzso and differentiation of the zzso lineage remain poorly zzso zzso cell lines derived from zzso leukemia are valuable zzso for studies on these zzso 

A new cell line, zzso was established from a zzso patient with acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso Its characteristics were studied by zzso zzso and molecular biological zzso 

zzso showed that the zzso cells were positive for zzso zzso and zzso as well as moderately to zzso positive for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed a composite zzso but no major zzso abnormalities were zzso zzso zzso disclosed that the zzso cells had numerous surface zzso and some cells also had zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of 4 major proteins zzso factor 4, zzso zzso and zzso 1) found in zzso were all expressed by the zzso zzso In particular, expression of zzso factor 4 was zzso To further characterize zzso cells, comparison with 4 other zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso was done by gene expression profiling using an zzso zzso The results showed that zzso was a distinctive cell zzso It was noteworthy that the zzso cells zzso zzso and expressed zzso zzso A zzso zzso for zzso partly inhibited the proliferation of the zzso 

zzso may be a useful cell line for investigating the differentiation and zzso of zzso cells and for studying the influence of zzso on these zzso
