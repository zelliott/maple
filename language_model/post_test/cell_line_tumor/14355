zzso acids containing zzso are very common in human zzso and their expression frequently zzso with zzso zzso and the tumor zzso The majority of tumor markers containing zzso acids in man involve changes in the amount of total zzso acids and in the presence of the two main zzso acid types, zzso and zzso and their zzso The aim of the present study was to examine whether zzso zzso cell lines zzso zzso acid containing zzso at both the zzso and cell membrane levels and particularly whether the type and the content of zzso and zzso are of biological importance for zzso cell differentiation and evaluation of its zzso The study was performed in three human zzso zzso cell lines, two with a zzso like zzso zzso and zzso and one of zzso differentiation zzso which developed from the zzso zzso of patients with zzso zzso and in one human zzso cell line zzso zzso and zzso were determined following a mild zzso step and a sample zzso zzso The determination was performed by zzso zzso after the zzso and zzso had been converted to zzso zzso It was found that zzso is the major zzso acid in the culture media of all cell lines zzso zzso ratios of zzso to zzso showed that zzso is the zzso zzso acid in the culture medium of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is almost zzso in the cell zzso whereas zzso is present in considerable zzso The obtained results suggest that the type and the content of zzso and zzso in culture media are of biological importance for zzso cell differentiation and may be of value in the evaluation of zzso
