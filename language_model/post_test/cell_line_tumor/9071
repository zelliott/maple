Information on gene zzso associated to poorly differentiated zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso Using human cancer cell lines as a tool for gene discovery, we performed a zzso and zzso analysis in five new cell lines derived from two zzso and three zzso In zzso we zzso as important, the involvement of the zzso zzso pathway, and zzso of a group of zzso genes that include zzso In zzso zzso of a specific group of zzso genes was also zzso Our zzso cell lines presented zzso markers of gene amplification, and we were able to identify for the first time the nature of the involved zzso target zzso We found that the main molecular differences between the two cell line types were related to signal zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso experiments performed for five zzso target genes and for two zzso which allowed a clear distinction between zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso array results, not only in the cell lines, but also in an additional set of primary 14 zzso and three zzso We suggest that our findings may represent new tools for the development of more effective therapies to the zzso zzso zzso
