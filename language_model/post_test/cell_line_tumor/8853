zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso functions as a zzso factor through the zzso type 1 zzso zzso In a previous work, we demonstrated that nerve growth factor zzso zzso gene expression through the zzso of zzso via the zzso zzso We also observed that zzso expression in zzso cells was zzso suppressed during in zzso zzso conditions, zzso deprivation zzso Because zzso zzso zzso stress is induced by zzso we attempted to clarify how zzso stress affects the expression of zzso zzso which zzso zzso stress, significantly suppressed zzso gene zzso and zzso a selective inhibitor of the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso of zzso stress, blocked the zzso In zzso reporter zzso we found that two zzso sites were involved in suppression of zzso gene expression due to zzso or zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso 2 zzso expression was suppressed by zzso or zzso a zzso activity zzso Further, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso was suppressed by zzso or zzso Together with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso specific for zzso also ameliorated zzso zzso of zzso gene zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso might be crucial in negative regulation of zzso gene expression due to zzso in zzso zzso zzso
