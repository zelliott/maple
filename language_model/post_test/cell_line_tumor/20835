To explore the zzso and the zzso protein zzso the effect and possible mechanism of zzso acid zzso on cell proliferation in human gastric zzso 

The zzso action of zzso on human gastric zzso was zzso by zzso zzso The zzso changes of zzso cells exposed to zzso was examined by reverse zzso zzso The zzso of zzso cells treated with zzso was observed by single cell gel zzso The zzso and zzso protein expressions were detected by Western zzso zzso 

zzso zzso indicated that the growth of zzso cells were inhibited by zzso in dose and time dependent zzso The zzso observation by reverse zzso microscope indicated that the growth of cells exposed to zzso were not zzso The DNA damage rates of zzso cells treated with zzso were more higher than those of control groups in dose and time dependent zzso The zzso protein expressions treated with zzso were reduced, and the zzso protein expressions treated with zzso were more than those of control groups in dose and time dependent zzso 

The proliferation of gastric zzso zzso cells zzso by zzso could be associated with zzso of gene zzso and zzso
