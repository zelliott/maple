zzso is a first in class zzso analog structurally related to zzso zzso that zzso DNA and zzso zzso zzso zzso is not a zzso zzso zzso and its activity is independent of zzso thus evading common drug resistance zzso To evaluate zzso as a clinically zzso radiation zzso we investigated its effects on tumor cell zzso in zzso and in zzso 

zzso effect on zzso sensitivity of zzso zzso and zzso cells was assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso studies were performed with zzso zzso Cell cycle distribution and zzso checkpoint integrity was analyzed by flow zzso DNA damage and repair was evaluated by a high zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed by flow zzso zzso catastrophe was assessed by microscopic evidence of fragmented zzso by zzso In zzso zzso was measured by subcutaneous tumor growth zzso 

zzso zzso treatment with zzso resulted in zzso of all 3 cell lines tested with a dose enhancement factor of zzso to zzso measured at a surviving fraction of zzso The zzso dose enhancement was seen in zzso cells treated with 75 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exposure did not change cell cycle distribution prior to zzso nor alter zzso checkpoint integrity after zzso No difference was seen in the zzso fraction regardless of drug or radiation zzso The number of cells in zzso catastrophe was significantly greater in zzso cells treated with zzso than cells receiving radiation only at 72 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alone did not significantly increase zzso catastrophe over control zzso zzso zzso zzso treated with zzso and radiation maintained significantly higher zzso levels than cells treated with vehicle control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or radiation alone zzso zzso zzso after 24 zzso In zzso tumor growth delay was zzso days for zzso alone zzso 10 zzso zzso days for radiation (3 zzso alone, and zzso days for the group treated with zzso 4 hours prior to zzso 

zzso enhanced tumor cell zzso in zzso and in zzso The mechanism appears to be related to zzso of DNA repair and increased zzso zzso
