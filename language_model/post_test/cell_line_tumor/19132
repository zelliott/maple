We have investigated the zzso and zzso activity of an zzso acid zzso mainly containing zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso on human gastric zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso effects were observed on zzso cells from the dose of zzso zzso zzso which were comparable with or better than those of the common zzso agent zzso zzso from the clone formation zzso and flow zzso indicated that the mixture of zzso acids resulted in a zzso reduction in the number of zzso cells and significantly inhibited cell zzso with induced zzso and zzso phase cell cycle zzso Also, the zzso acids could not only cause cell zzso but also functionally and structurally damage the zzso cell membrane and cell zzso These observations encourage further clinical evaluation of the zzso effects of zzso acids on various forms of zzso
