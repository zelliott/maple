zzso we have zzso two cellular models of zzso zzso cancer zzso where transfer of normal zzso 18 material into the zzso cell lines zzso and zzso induced in zzso and in zzso suppression of zzso zzso in derived hybrid zzso zzso zzso tandem mass zzso zzso with tandem mass tagging zzso was then employed to profile the whole cell, zzso and crude membrane zzso of the parental and hybrid cell models to identify zzso expressed proteins as potential markers of zzso tumor zzso zzso changes of interest were confirmed by zzso in additional hybrid and zzso cell zzso This method afforded quantitative coverage of around 1,000 unique proteins and is zzso to the analysis of any cell model, tissue or zzso
