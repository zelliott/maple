zzso is a solid zzso of childhood often with an zzso zzso One common genetic feature in aggressive zzso is zzso The zzso zzso gene is located in zzso region zzso within the common region of deletion in zzso One alternative translated product of the zzso zzso known as zzso acts as a negative regulator of the zzso zzso making the zzso gene a candidate as a zzso zzso zzso 

zzso used in this study are zzso of zzso and in zzso transcribed zzso cell growth zzso zzso real-time zzso zzso for expression studies, zzso sequencing and zzso for zzso zzso 

Here we demonstrate that zzso of zzso zzso into zzso zzso cell lines zzso reduced number of viable cells over time compared to a negative control and that it zzso zzso Interestingly, a similar but much stronger zzso reduction of cell growth was observed by zzso of in zzso transcribed zzso zzso into zzso zzso These effects could also be shown in zzso cells zzso indicating zzso to have general zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is zzso in primary zzso of all different stages and no difference in the level of expression can be detected between zzso and zzso zzso zzso Although small numbers (11 primary zzso there is some evidence that Stage 4 zzso has a lower level of zzso than Stage 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso screening of 44 primary zzso of all different zzso failed to detect any zzso 

Our studies indicate that zzso has zzso zzso activity and that high level of zzso expression has growth zzso zzso
