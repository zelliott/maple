zzso zzso of vascular zzso growth factor zzso in response to the hypoxic tumor zzso contributes to tumor growth, zzso and zzso We have recently demonstrated that zzso zzso with zzso at low zzso zzso high levels of a soluble form of the zzso zzso 1 zzso which zzso zzso and zzso its biological zzso Using small interfering zzso targeting to zzso zzso factor zzso or zzso in zzso zzso we found that zzso production of zzso in response to low zzso was dependent on zzso whereas zzso specifically regulated zzso zzso In our current report, we evaluated the growth of zzso zzso melanoma in mice with a zzso deletion of zzso or zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso treatment increased zzso zzso and zzso in control mice, an effect that was associated with a decrease in zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso mice induced zzso but not zzso resulting in an overall greater reduction in tumor growth and zzso compared with control zzso In addition, real-time zzso for zzso genes revealed a significantly reduced presence of lung zzso in zzso mice treated with zzso zzso zzso treatment induced zzso but not zzso in zzso mice, and, zzso zzso did not decrease tumor growth, zzso or lung zzso in these zzso This study reveals opposing roles for the zzso in the regulation of zzso by zzso zzso and suggests that administration of zzso might be an effective means of inducing zzso and zzso tumor growth and zzso in patients with zzso
