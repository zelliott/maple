zzso zzso family of zzso are zzso proteins that play an important role in host defenses, acute phase zzso immune responses, zzso and zzso The zzso are produced by various zzso and zzso cells and mediate their biological activity through initial zzso binding to cell surface zzso which are specific for their respective zzso zzso zzso binding results in the zzso zzso with zzso expressed zzso zzso component zzso followed by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which, in turn, zzso signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to the nucleus, where it activates gene zzso zzso of zzso is essential to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the ability to assess zzso zzso is important for drug discovery efforts targeting zzso family zzso Various zzso and technologies are available to detect the effect of zzso type zzso in treated zzso The present study describes the development of two zzso detection zzso the zzso screening zzso based on zzso Discovery technology, which zzso zzso signal zzso for the detection of zzso in treated cell zzso and the secondary characterization zzso based on fluorescent imaging analysis, which monitors zzso nuclear zzso in cells after zzso We have successfully zzso these zzso to screen a small library of zzso proteins and identified zzso of zzso zzso The results obtained in this study demonstrate that both zzso are zzso reliable, and amenable to zzso screening zzso
