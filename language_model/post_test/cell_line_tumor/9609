zzso and differentiation of zzso stem and zzso cells are defined by the ensembles of genes expressed by these zzso Here we report identification of a novel gene named zzso which is expressed predominantly in zzso and long-term zzso stem cells when compared to more mature bone zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein that contains multiple zzso zzso zzso and two earlier reported zzso zzso and zzso share a substantial zzso and are likely to represent a novel protein zzso Studies of the potential role of zzso in zzso regulation demonstrated that the zzso zzso expression of zzso in bone zzso cells decreased the number of zzso zzso in in zzso zzso zzso In addition, expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso resulted in a decreased number of late and early zzso zzso in the zzso zzso bone zzso zzso zzso shares a number of structural features with the zzso family of zzso zzso and our experiments indicate that the zzso domain of zzso similar to the corresponding domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso On the basis of obtained results, we suggest that zzso is involved in the fine regulation of the early stages of zzso zzso presumably through the zzso signaling zzso
