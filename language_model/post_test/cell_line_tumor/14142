The drug zzso has important uses in zzso zzso and transplantation medicine, but its clinically relevant molecular effects are not zzso When bound to zzso zzso interacts with and zzso the zzso activity of a zzso complex composed of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The distinct complex of zzso zzso and zzso zzso does not interact with zzso and is not thought to be zzso zzso zzso zzso and activates zzso a key regulator of cell zzso Here we show that zzso zzso the assembly of zzso and that, in many cell types, prolonged zzso treatment reduces the levels of zzso below those needed to maintain zzso zzso The zzso and zzso effects of zzso are suppressed in cells expressing an zzso zzso that is zzso zzso Our work describes an unforeseen mechanism of action for zzso that suggests it can be used to inhibit zzso in certain cell zzso
