zzso in zzso brain tumors 1 zzso has been proposed as a candidate tumor zzso for brain and zzso zzso zzso studies suggested loss of expression rather than zzso as the zzso mode of zzso zzso However, in zzso studies in lung cancer demonstrated highly sophisticated changes of zzso expression and zzso pointing to a zzso order of zzso Here we report on the investigation of zzso in breast cancer in order to test whether these principles might also be attributable to other tumor zzso Comprehensive zzso analyses did not uncover zzso zzso zzso zzso in breast zzso zzso analyses in the human and mouse zzso zzso pointed to the necessity of zzso zzso While zzso and hormonal effects could be ruled out, 9 of 10 mice showed induction of zzso expression after administration of the zzso zzso prior to the onset of zzso or other zzso zzso zzso displayed significant zzso in human zzso zzso compared to in normal breast zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the breast tumor cells displayed a switch from zzso zzso to zzso to the zzso zzso and a significant zzso compared to that in matched normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We concluded that loss of expression also is the zzso mode of zzso zzso in breast zzso The dynamic behavior of zzso in lung zzso is fully reflected in breast cancer, which suggests that this behavior might be common to tumor types arising from zzso zzso
