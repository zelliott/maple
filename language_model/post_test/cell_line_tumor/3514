zzso administration of zzso zzso can lead to cell resistance, probably because of the initial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing an zzso zzso sequence can overcome zzso We constructed an zzso zzso with zzso zzso expressing the TRAIL gene from the human zzso reverse zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso and tested its zzso activity in 5 colon zzso cell zzso 

zzso cancer cells were infected with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso PBS was used as a zzso Cell viability was determined by proliferation zzso zzso analysis and zzso of zzso and TRAIL were used to identify zzso 

Treatment with zzso resulted in significantly less cell zzso increased zzso and TRAIL activity, and a greater zzso fraction than treatment with PBS or zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso could become a potent therapeutic agent for the treatment of colon zzso
