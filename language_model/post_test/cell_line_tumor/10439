zzso zzso have been reported to reduce proliferation of human prostate cancer zzso However, the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso cell growth zzso of prostate cancer cells is not zzso zzso expression and zzso activity have important roles in prostate cancer zzso To investigate the mechanisms of the zzso zzso prostate cancer cell growth zzso we examined the effect of zzso on the expression of zzso zzso and activity of zzso as well as on the prostate cancer cell zzso zzso induced the expression of zzso in the nuclear of zzso cells, but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited cancer cell growth in a similar extend between both cells accompanied by the induction of cell cycle arrest in zzso phase and an increased in the similar extent of zzso cell death in concentration dependent zzso zzso inhibited the zzso expression of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso of zzso with a zzso inhibitor zzso or zzso zzso significantly zzso the zzso effect of zzso on the zzso activity and on prostate cancer cell growth zzso and zzso cell zzso However, zzso of zzso hindered zzso cell growth zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso prostate cancer cell growth through zzso of zzso via suppression of zzso zzso
