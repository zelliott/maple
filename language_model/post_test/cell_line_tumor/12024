The synthesis of zzso oxide by zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in the innate immune response by promoting microbial killing and cell zzso In response to inflammatory zzso and bacterial products, the human zzso zzso gene zzso rapid zzso zzso via binding of zzso zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso to its zzso zzso However, zzso zzso promoter induction was suppressed via an unknown zzso zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso of the zzso factor zzso by the zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso promoter induction by bacterial zzso and zzso zzso Human lung zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso with an zzso zzso promoter zzso reporter zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso B zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso In response to zzso zzso was zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso active zzso increased zzso promoter activity and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression showed that zzso was necessary for the zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso The same effect was observed upon zzso of a consensus zzso site in the zzso zzso By zzso analysis, the corresponding zzso probe bound zzso zzso in an zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso promoter by zzso represents a potentially important molecular mechanism by which the zzso zzso might suppress zzso and zzso responses to zzso and bacterial zzso
