To study the effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso immune response we used the zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso expresses zzso We generated zzso that do not express zzso levels of zzso and found that the T cell response to the tumors were zzso zzso zzso draining the zzso tumor contained zzso cells that produced greater levels of zzso in response to the tumor than zzso cells from zzso zzso draining a tumor that produced zzso Moreover, exposure of zzso T cells to zzso zzso in zzso decreased the ability of the T cells to produce zzso However, despite the enhanced zzso function evident in the absence of zzso zzso experiments failed to reveal an increase in zzso of the zzso zzso cells relative to the zzso zzso zzso these data indicate that zzso zzso could decrease T cell zzso function, yet not the overall zzso of the zzso
