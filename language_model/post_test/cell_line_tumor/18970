zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene expression in breast cancer zzso however, the mechanisms of gene repression are not well zzso In this study, we show that zzso decreases vascular zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso zzso levels in zzso cells, and this gene was used as a model for investigating pathways associated with zzso gene zzso zzso analysis of the zzso promoter indicates that the zzso zzso motifs at zzso and zzso are critical for the zzso decreased response in zzso zzso zzso or deletion of these zzso elements results in loss of hormone responsiveness and shows that the zzso to zzso region of the zzso promoter is critical for both zzso and zzso decreased zzso expression in zzso zzso Western zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso support a role for zzso proteins in zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells, primarily through zzso zzso zzso and zzso interactions with the zzso zzso Using zzso zzso and transient zzso interference zzso we show that the zzso zzso interactions are accompanied by recruitment of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso hormone zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to the promoter and that zzso and zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso of zzso expression in zzso zzso This study illustrates that both zzso and zzso are involved in zzso repression of zzso in zzso zzso
