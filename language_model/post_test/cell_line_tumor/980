A zzso model for simulation of the zzso zzso experiments has been zzso The simulation allows one to zzso the statistical properties of zzso experiments without actually performing zzso We introduce a new concept, the so-called zzso which allows for reconciliation between conflicting zzso of biological and statistical significance in zzso zzso It is shown that, for a small sample size, the zzso is a more powerful criterion of the presence of a signal in zzso data as compared to the standard approach based on zzso zzso Joint simulation of zzso and quantitative zzso data shows that the genes recovered by using the zzso have better chances to be confirmed by zzso than those obtained by the zzso test zzso We also employ extreme value considerations to derive plausible zzso levels for hypothesis zzso
