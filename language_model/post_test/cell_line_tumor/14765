zzso virus zzso vaccine effectively protects zzso individuals against zzso However, zzso of zzso zzso by maternal zzso after vaccination remains a problem, as it leaves infants susceptible to zzso zzso In cotton rats, passive transfer of zzso zzso mimics maternal zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso in the presence of passively transferred zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso but not the generation of zzso B zzso This finding suggested that zzso B cells require an additional stimulus to mature into zzso plasma zzso In order to provide such a zzso we generated a zzso zzso disease virus zzso expressing the zzso zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso induced high levels of type I zzso in zzso zzso cells and in lung zzso In cotton rats zzso with zzso zzso zzso were also generated in the presence of passively transferred zzso In the latter case, however, the level and zzso of zzso generation were zzso In zzso alpha zzso zzso the zzso of zzso B cells from zzso zzso zzso zzso infection (which zzso alpha zzso had the same effect, and stimulation could be zzso by zzso zzso alpha zzso but not zzso 6 zzso In zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso led to increased zzso zzso production in the presence and absence of passively transferred zzso These data indicate that zzso B cells are being generated after zzso in the presence of maternal zzso and that the provision of alpha zzso as an additional signal leads to zzso zzso
