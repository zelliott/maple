Poly zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso enhance the in zzso zzso of DNA zzso zzso agents such as radiation or zzso zzso The aim of this study was to test an approach combining the zzso inhibitor zzso with standard zzso therapy in human pancreatic cancer zzso 

Cell viability was determined by proliferation zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso zzso zzso zzso Western zzso for zzso 8 and zzso and electron zzso were used to identify zzso zzso growth and survival was assessed in nude mice by zzso injected zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso was performed on tumors for cell proliferation and in zzso zzso induction was measured by zzso zzso and zzso 

Combination therapy of zzso and zzso suppressed tumor cell growth more than zzso alone in zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

This in zzso study demonstrated a significantly reduced tumor weight and increased survival up to 40 days after cell zzso with combination therapy compared to animals treated with zzso zzso or zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso revealed a significant zzso induction and reduced proliferation in the combination zzso
