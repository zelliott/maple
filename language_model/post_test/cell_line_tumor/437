zzso B virus zzso infection exhibits a very narrow host range and shows a strong zzso for liver zzso cells, however none of the previously established experimental models can reproduce the natural process of zzso zzso In the present study, primary human zzso were fused with zzso cells to establish the hybrid zzso cell line with high zzso to zzso The zzso cells expressed zzso zzso when zzso with zzso serum from a zzso B zzso zzso zzso relaxed circular DNA and zzso closed circular DNA were detected in zzso cells using a zzso zzso chain reaction, and zzso particles were zzso by electron zzso of the culture media of zzso zzso zzso cells were not susceptible to zzso infection under the same zzso The zzso cells can be zzso for zzso 12 months while maintaining zzso to zzso and may, therefore, be useful for studying zzso infection and the viral life cycle in human zzso
