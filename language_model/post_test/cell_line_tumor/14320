We compared zzso zzso is zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso PET for imaging of tumor response to the heat shock protein 90 zzso inhibitor zzso zzso 

Mice bearing zzso breast tumor zzso were scanned with zzso PET and zzso PET before and after zzso treatment and then biweekly for up to 3 zzso 

Within 24 h after treatment, a significant decrease in zzso was measured by zzso zzso whereas zzso PET zzso a measure of zzso was zzso zzso growth zzso occurred in treated tumors but became evident only by 11 d after zzso Thus, zzso zzso occurs independently of changes in zzso after zzso therapy, and zzso reduction more accurately predicts subsequent tumor growth zzso 

zzso PET is an earlier predictor of tumor response to zzso therapy than zzso zzso
