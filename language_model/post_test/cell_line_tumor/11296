zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to exert zzso effects on many types of cancer zzso However, the effect of zzso zzso on liver cancer has not been zzso zzso the aim of this study was to determine the zzso effect of zzso zzso extract on zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso extract was prepared and zzso After the treatment of zzso zzso extract on zzso cells, cell zzso cell cycle arrest and cell death were analyzed by flow zzso The expression levels of tumor necrosis zzso zzso 1 zzso and death zzso 3 zzso zzso related with zzso zzso were assessed by reverse zzso zzso chain zzso Additionally, zzso and zzso cell cycle proteins as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins were analyzed by western zzso zzso To determine the effect of zzso zzso extract on cancer zzso cells, we analyzed changes in side population fraction through flow zzso 

The cell viability of zzso cells treated with zzso zzso extract was decreased by zzso potentially zzso to increases in the rates of zzso cells arrested in the zzso phase zzso zzso and that underwent zzso zzso zzso The expression levels of zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso and zzso cell cycle zzso were zzso Meanwhile, the expressions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins zzso However, in the case of side population cells, no remarkable changes were zzso 

zzso zzso extract exerts a potent zzso effect on the viability of liver cancer cells, although not on cancer zzso zzso
