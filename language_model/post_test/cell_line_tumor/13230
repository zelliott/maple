Several lines of evidence suggest that zzso controls immune zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso that regulate this process are not currently zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso zzso prevents the trafficking of engaged high affinity zzso zzso zzso to a zzso compartment in mast zzso We then concentrate our attention on zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as potential zzso zzso since it serves as critical regulator for zzso entry into zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and identify zzso as the zzso responsible for zzso zzso zzso was also required for zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso without affecting protein stability, controlled zzso zzso The majority of zzso zzso forms were observed only in membrane zzso whereas zzso zzso was predominantly zzso suggesting that both modifications might impact on zzso zzso Together, these findings provide a major step forward in understanding how zzso zzso zzso of engaged immune zzso
