zzso zzso is a biological zzso which belongs to the class of zzso and is zzso present in all living zzso zzso zzso zzso contain zzso consisting of up to 120 zzso zzso zzso played by zzso in zzso zzso remain zzso It was previously demonstrated that zzso of the size similar to one found in zzso mediates calcium transport in zzso zzso zzso We hypothesized that the presence of zzso in zzso membrane might play a significant role in zzso calcium zzso To test this, we investigated how the induction of zzso zzso affects zzso calcium zzso zzso zzso was altered zzso by targeted expression of bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso of zzso cultured zzso The expression of zzso induced changes in zzso metabolism resulting in decreased zzso membrane potential in zzso but not in zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, it significantly inhibited zzso calcium zzso in intact zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso by the zzso or by the application of increased zzso of calcium to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso expressing cells was restored by mimicking calcium zzso properties with natural zzso calcium zzso - zzso We propose that zzso is a previously zzso important component of the zzso calcium zzso zzso
