zzso zzso is lethal when zzso after chemotherapy and/or surgical zzso Thus animal models are necessary to study the zzso zzso spread and to validate novel therapies able to control the systemic zzso We report the development of a zzso zzso zzso zzso model, using a cell line derived from a spontaneous zzso zzso 

The zzso and zzso ability of zzso cell lines were zzso after zzso injection in mice zzso zzso zzso profiling was carried out to characterize the parental and zzso cell zzso zzso from zzso were zzso and engineered to express zzso in order to follow zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso allowed to monitor the primary tumor growth and revealed the appearance of spontaneous pulmonary zzso In zzso zzso showed that zzso is a stable property of zzso zzso cell lines after both propagation in culture and zzso zzso When compared to parental cell line, both unmodified and genetically marked zzso cells, showed comparable and stable differential expression of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso already associated to the zzso zzso in human zzso 

This zzso animal model faithfully zzso some of the most important features of the human zzso such as lung zzso Moreover, the zzso imaging allows monitoring the tumor progression in living zzso A great asset of this model is the zzso zzso which is a stable property, not modifiable after genetic zzso
