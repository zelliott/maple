Ewing zzso is a paradigm of solid zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in fusion proteins that act as zzso zzso zzso Ewing zzso zzso fuse the zzso gene with an zzso zzso factor, mainly zzso Most of the zzso target genes still remain unknown and many have been identified in zzso model zzso 

We have developed a stable zzso interference model knocking down zzso in the Ewing zzso cell line zzso Gene expression analyses were performed to study the effect of zzso interference on the genetic signature of zzso and to identify genes that could contribute to zzso 

zzso zzso induced zzso reduced cell migratory and zzso zzso and caused reduction in zzso zzso IGF-1 was zzso and the zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso expression was decreased because of zzso zzso We showed that zzso is a new target gene of zzso zzso zzso prompted a decrease in the proliferation rate and a dramatic change in the cell's ability to grow in zzso 

This is the first report of zzso activity in Ewing zzso and suggests a significant role of this zzso protein zzso in the Ewing zzso zzso
