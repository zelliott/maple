zzso zzso is a common childhood solid zzso resulting from zzso of the skeletal zzso zzso Two major zzso zzso occur in childhood zzso zzso and zzso While zzso zzso account for the majority of zzso tumors, the genetic defects underlying the zzso of zzso zzso remain largely zzso A few studies performed on small series of zzso tumors suggest that zzso of zzso function may be relevant to disease zzso To explore further the biological and clinical relevance of zzso with zzso consequences on zzso signaling in zzso zzso we investigated the prevalence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a relatively large cohort of primary zzso While zzso and zzso were found to be rarely zzso we identified zzso zzso zzso in zzso of zzso All zzso were zzso and affected zzso 61, with the introduction of a positive charged zzso acid zzso representing the most common zzso zzso was found zzso in one tumor zzso confirming that zzso defects in this gene are relatively uncommon in zzso while no zzso was observed in zzso and zzso zzso Although no clear association of zzso with any clinical variable was observed, comparison of the outcome between zzso and zzso cases indicated a trend for a higher percentage of patients exhibiting a better outcome in the zzso Our findings provide evidence that zzso of zzso signaling is a major event contributing to zzso zzso zzso
