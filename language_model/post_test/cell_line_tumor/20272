zzso zzso zzso is the most frequent and the most zzso human brain zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso growth factor zzso is strongly increased in zzso where they promote tumor zzso cell survival, migration, invasion and zzso We used zzso zzso zzso of zzso in order to block zzso growth and zzso cell migration and zzso The effect of zzso on three zzso cell lines was tested and we found their zzso effect on tumor zzso The maximum level of zzso reached zzso After treatment with zzso cells also became zzso as determined by zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso We examined the expression and activity of the zzso zzso on zzso cell lines and we observed zzso of zzso and zzso after zzso stimulation by western zzso zzso Since zzso cells express high level of zzso zzso and were shown to respond to zzso by increased zzso we tested if zzso could zzso affect zzso cell zzso In our study, we found that zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso cells toward the zzso growth factor zzso The zzso also blocked migration of tumor cells through a zzso layer in invasion zzso The strongest zzso effect was observed for zzso and its zzso zzso Based on our results, zzso particularly zzso could be considered as a new potential agent to treat zzso zzso
