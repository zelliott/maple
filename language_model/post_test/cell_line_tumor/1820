zzso zzso has been reported to be an important gene in cancer cell proliferation and survival, and tumor zzso However, its role in zzso zzso zzso cells remains zzso 

zzso of zzso was assessed in a zzso rat zzso model, and in zzso zzso and zzso cells using zzso zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso and zzso were determined in zzso by zzso zzso zzso was evaluated by zzso zzso Cell viability and zzso were determined by zzso zzso and flow zzso zzso zzso proteins in zzso and zzso cells were detected by Western zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso showed that zzso was zzso in rat zzso and two zzso cell lines, while the expression was inhibited by zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso zzso inhibited cell proliferation and induced zzso in rat zzso and both cell lines in a zzso and zzso zzso Our in zzso study demonstrated that zzso also reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso protein expression coupled with a slight increase of the expression of zzso and zzso of zzso Furthermore, zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso zzso Interestingly, the effects of zzso were reversed by zzso a zzso of zzso 

zzso of zzso leads to reduced numbers of zzso cells, partially caused by increased zzso zzso may be a potential molecular target for zzso prevention and zzso
