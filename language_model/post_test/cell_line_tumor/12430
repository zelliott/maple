The zzso zzso 225 zzso is known to block binding of zzso to the zzso growth factor zzso zzso However, the effect of this zzso zzso on zzso zzso trafficking and degradation remains zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso of zzso zzso occurs, albeit with a slower rate than that of zzso Using pulse chase zzso we show that zzso zzso zzso is recycled to the surface much more efficiently than zzso zzso Also, we found that zzso of zzso zzso in contrast to that of zzso is independent of zzso zzso zzso activity, as evidenced by its zzso to zzso a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the levels of cell surface and total zzso showed that treatment with 225 zzso results in a zzso decrease in surface zzso and a relatively slow zzso of total zzso Taken together, these data indicate that 225 zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso via a mechanism distinct from that underlying zzso zzso zzso and zzso
