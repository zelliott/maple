As part of a comprehensive survey of the impact of the environmental zzso and zzso zzso zzso on the zzso of zzso cells, we have performed a high resolution two-dimensional gel zzso study on the rat zzso cell line zzso 78 protein species corresponding to 73 different proteins were identified as zzso or zzso following exposure of the cells to 1 zzso zzso for 8 zzso There was an overlap of only nine proteins with those detected as altered by zzso in our recent study using the zzso zzso protein label method zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Schmidt, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso in zzso rat zzso cells using zzso protein zzso zzso 6, zzso indicating a strong zzso of the two zzso For the majority of the altered zzso an effect of zzso on their abundance or zzso modifications had not been known zzso Several observations suggest that a sizable fraction of the proteins with altered abundance was induced as an zzso response to zzso zzso stress that was demonstrated using the fluorescent probe zzso zzso A prominent group of these proteins comprised various zzso for which there is evidence that their expression is regulated via the zzso response element zzso Other proteins included several involved in the maintenance of zzso energy production and the regulation of the zzso zzso zzso A particularly intriguing finding was the zzso of the zzso outer membrane pore zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 2 zzso which was dependent on the presence of a functional zzso hydrocarbon zzso The zzso of zzso protein abundance has not been described zzso In view of the recently discovered central role of zzso as an inhibitor of the zzso of the zzso protein zzso and the zzso zzso pathway, the present data point to a zzso zzso mechanism by which zzso may affect cellular zzso and zzso
