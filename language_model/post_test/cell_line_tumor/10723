As many as 229 medicinal plants have been currently used in the zzso Traditional Medicine zzso as a chief ingredient of zzso zzso and these plants have been individually indicated for treating various types of infections including malaria, zzso and zzso We have focused our study only on seven species of these zzso 

We aim to evaluate the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities of the seven medicinal plants of zzso selected using an zzso zzso zzso This study creates a scientific basis for their use in the zzso and gives foundation for further zzso and biological evaluations which can result in the discovery of new drug lead zzso 

A three stage process was conducted which consisted of: zzso an assessment of a zzso and a formulary book of the zzso for their mode of plant zzso zzso selecting 25 zzso medicinal plants based on the five established criteria, collecting them, and screening for their major classes of zzso using appropriate test zzso and zzso finally analyzing the crude extracts of the seven medicinal plants, using the standard test zzso for their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities as directed by the zzso uses of each zzso 

Out of 25 medicinal plants screened for their major classes of zzso the majority contained zzso zzso and zzso Out of the seven plant species investigated for their biological activities, all seven of them exhibited mild zzso properties, five plants gave significant in zzso zzso activities, two plants gave moderate zzso zzso zzso activity, and one plant showed mild zzso zzso zzso showed the highest zzso activity with zzso values of zzso zzso against zzso strain (a wild type zzso and zzso sensitive zzso and zzso zzso against zzso zzso resistant zzso zzso zzso the extracts from this plant did not show any zzso 

These findings provide the scientific basis for the use of seven medicinal plants in the zzso for the treatment of malaria, microbial infections, infectious zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso The results also form a good preliminary basis for the zzso of candidate plant species for further in-depth zzso and pharmacological investigations toward our quest to unearth lead zzso zzso and zzso zzso
