zzso DNA zzso followed by abnormal gene expression is an zzso hallmark in zzso DNA zzso is zzso by DNA zzso and the zzso expression or zzso of DNA zzso genes are found in human zzso The zzso for zzso zzso were recently identified, and the biological significance of DNA zzso is a current focus of scientific attention in various research zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins have an zzso activity for the conversion from zzso to zzso zzso which is an intermediate of DNA zzso The zzso zzso of zzso gene were reported in zzso zzso suggesting that impaired zzso DNA zzso could play a crucial role in zzso It is still unknown, however, whether DNA zzso is involved in biological properties in solid zzso Here, we show the loss of zzso in a broad spectrum of solid zzso for example, a significant reduction of zzso was found in zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of gastric zzso compared to background zzso zzso expression was decreased in half of zzso and a large part of them was followed by the loss of zzso These findings suggest that the amount of zzso in tumors is often reduced via various mechanisms, including the zzso of zzso zzso in the in zzso experiments, the zzso of zzso was clearly induced by zzso cellular zzso and loss of zzso was seen in the transformed zzso These results suggest the critical roles of zzso DNA zzso for zzso processes in solid zzso
