zzso stimulates the proliferation of the most common type of human breast cancer that expresses zzso zzso alpha zzso through the zzso of the zzso D1 zzso zzso However, our knowledge of zzso zzso mechanisms remains zzso zzso it is still elusive why zzso zzso expressed in zzso breast cancer cells zzso is functional on zzso reporter zzso but lacks activity on many zzso target zzso including zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso stimulation of zzso expression in zzso depends on a novel zzso zzso downstream from the zzso coding region, which is the primary zzso recruitment site in zzso zzso The pioneer factor zzso is specifically required for the active zzso state of this zzso and as such is crucial for both zzso expression and subsequent cell cycle zzso Interestingly, even in zzso zzso levels and proliferation are tightly controlled by zzso through the establishment of a negative zzso loop involving the induction of zzso a putative tumor zzso capable of directly zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our results reveal an zzso zzso network including zzso zzso and zzso of zzso expression where zzso collaborates with other zzso factors associated with the zzso breast cancer zzso including zzso and zzso
