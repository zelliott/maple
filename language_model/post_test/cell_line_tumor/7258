The growth and zzso of solid tumors are dependent on zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso of collagen zzso is a potent zzso zzso zzso The authors designed a topical zzso gene therapy with zzso human zzso zzso zzso and assessed its effects on the zzso of zzso in zzso and tumor growth and zzso in zzso 

zzso cells zzso were infected with zzso The expression of zzso protein and the zzso of cultured human zzso vein zzso were zzso zzso zzso nude mice were treated with zzso injection of zzso the empty zzso zzso or saline zzso The zzso side effects, and serum concentration of zzso were zzso 

zzso zzso protein was detected in the infected tumor cells with different zzso zzso and its zzso effect on zzso cells growth was zzso In animal study, the volume of tumor and the number of pulmonary zzso zzso in the zzso treatment group were significantly smaller than those in the control groups ( zzso 

The present findings provide evidence of the zzso effects of the zzso and may be important for the further use of it in topical zzso gene therapy of zzso
