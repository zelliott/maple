zzso multiplex reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso is distinguishable from other multiplex zzso methods by zzso zzso of zzso that amplify sequences that fall within a single zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA as a zzso standard, and zzso zzso zzso conditions that allow amplification of bands of similar intensity using zzso DNA zzso We previously developed the human experimental systems of 68 zzso zzso 39 zzso zzso and 26 zzso zzso zzso and analyzed the expression of those genes in human adult zzso Here we report the establishment of an zzso zzso system of zzso and tumor zzso genes and the analysis of gene expression in human cancer zzso and cell zzso We also demonstrate that the zzso zzso system, which was developed for zzso expression analysis, could also be used successfully for more exquisite analysis of copy number changes in zzso zzso We observed a decrease in band intensity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes in most of the breast and prostate cancer cell lines zzso The decrease in copy number of zzso zzso leads us to suspect the presence of tumor zzso genes in the vicinity of this gene on zzso zzso
