zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso the e zzso of the zzso initiation factor zzso occurs in human breast zzso but how zzso relates to zzso remains zzso Here, we show that zzso is involved in the DNA damage zzso zzso was required for cell survival following zzso and zzso checkpoint zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso reduced zzso of the checkpoint zzso zzso and zzso after DNA zzso In addition, zzso zzso prevented sustained zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso at DNA damage sites in cells treated with zzso or the zzso drug zzso zzso this result could be explained by interaction of zzso with zzso which together with zzso was recruited to the sites of DNA zzso Finally, zzso zzso also reduced zzso events that promote retention of repair proteins at DNA zzso zzso zzso of the repair factor zzso was defective in the absence of zzso Our findings reveal unexpected and striking connections of zzso with zzso and zzso and suggest that the protective action of zzso in the onset of breast zzso relies on its involvement in the DNA damage zzso
