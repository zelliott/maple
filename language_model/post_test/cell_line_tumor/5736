zzso derivatives bearing zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso and a series of zzso were zzso and investigated in zzso binding studies at the zzso zzso in rat brain cortical membrane preparations zzso zzso zzso relationships were zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or in the zzso zzso with basic zzso or introduction of polar zzso at the zzso function zzso zzso zzso represented the best zzso zzso evaluation of selected zzso derivatives in zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso cells zzso expressing the zzso showed that all compounds investigated were zzso or partial zzso A subset of compounds was additionally investigated in binding studies at human embryonic kidney zzso cells, which also express a zzso zzso binding zzso zzso relationships at the human cell line were similar to those at the zzso but not zzso In particular, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso human: zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso human: zzso zzso were much more potent at the human as compared to the rat binding zzso The new zzso zzso may serve as lead structures and contribute to the zzso of the functions of the zzso zzso zzso
