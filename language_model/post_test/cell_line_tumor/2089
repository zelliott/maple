To investigate the zzso killing effect of zzso combined with zzso on human prostate cancer cell line zzso by inducing zzso and further to determine the mechanism underlying such zzso 

zzso cells were treated with various zzso of zzso or zzso zzso Cell viability was determined using zzso zzso zzso was assessed by zzso zzso analysis of cells with condensed and segmented zzso following zzso with zzso zzso Cellular DNA was stained with zzso zzso and flow zzso analysis was performed to analyze the cell cycle zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein changes were detected by Western zzso The activity of zzso was measured using a zzso zzso 

zzso (20 zzso combination with zzso zzso zzso for 48 hours, the cell viability was decreased to zzso zzso zzso to compare with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso separately and there was a synergistic effect between the two drugs zzso zzso zzso zzso rate of the combination group was higher than other two zzso zzso increased the cell number arrested in zzso phase compared with control group zzso zzso zzso but the combination treatment resulted in a significant arrest in the zzso zzso The combination treatment could significantly reduced the zzso zzso and zzso expression zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all P zzso zzso and enhanced the activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

The combination of zzso with zzso can zzso inhibit the proliferation of zzso cells through inducing zzso which may be associated with cell cycle arrest, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso expression and zzso of zzso
