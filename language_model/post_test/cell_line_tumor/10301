zzso zzso tumors, such as zzso are characterized by zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso However, how these phenomena of the tumor zzso may be linked at the molecular level during tumor development remains zzso Here, we provide evidence that zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso induction of zzso was found to elicit an zzso zzso zzso and to specifically zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso or zzso treatment efficiently zzso zzso zzso of hypoxic zzso We show that zzso zzso induction was associated with increased zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso induction as well as zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso the major zzso of zzso zzso zzso was substantially induced by zzso in several types of cancer cells, including zzso however, zzso was zzso in zzso even at prolonged zzso which zzso zzso zzso zzso through zzso Interestingly, hypoxic cancer cells were shown to release substantial amounts of zzso that was mainly associated with zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso cells were found to trigger zzso zzso of hypoxic zzso in a zzso zzso We provide evidence of a zzso signaling axis that links zzso zzso in cancer cells to zzso zzso of zzso The identified zzso may constitute an interesting target for the development of additional strategies to treat aggressive brain zzso
