zzso zzso invasion and zzso protein zzso is a zzso zzso zzso toxin zzso zzso zzso zzso exchange factor that was isolated based on its ability to induce a zzso zzso In polarized zzso zzso zzso is found at the leading edge where it zzso with the zzso zzso 1 zzso complex to establish zzso zzso Although a positive correlation has been observed between zzso expression and tumor grade in a variety of human zzso including breast, its role in breast cancer cells has not yet been zzso 

zzso expression and zzso activity were examined in a panel of human breast cancer cell lines which exhibit different degrees of cell zzso The contribution of zzso to cell zzso was directly examined using zzso zzso and wound healing zzso 

Although we observe a striking, positive correlation between zzso expression and cell zzso in the panel of breast cancer cell lines, we do not observe a correlation between zzso expression and overall levels of zzso zzso zzso with this, small interfering zzso acid zzso suppression of zzso expression limits the zzso of cell lines in which zzso expression is high zzso and zzso but does not substantially alter the overall levels of activated zzso zzso zzso is also not sufficient to increase the zzso of more poorly zzso cells zzso or increase zzso zzso zzso and cellular zzso indicate that zzso is found predominantly in the zzso of breast cancer cells, and in the latter case zzso was shown to zzso with a limited pool of zzso zzso with this zzso zzso zzso supports cell zzso and zzso zzso in response to serum in a wound healing zzso using zzso zzso zzso 

zzso expression zzso with cell zzso in human breast cancer cells, and is required to support the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso to the zzso and its demonstrated role in zzso zzso suggest that it may support zzso through a mechanism that is discrete from its known function in leading edge zzso
