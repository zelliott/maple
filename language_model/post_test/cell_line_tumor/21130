To assess the role of zzso regulatory factor zzso 8 in zzso development and zzso we studied its expression in zzso zzso zzso its relationship to other zzso zzso factors, and its expression in a series of 232 zzso tumors and 30 cell lines representing a variety of zzso zzso zzso We found that although zzso was zzso in most zzso zzso its expression levels differed with zzso zzso zzso center B cells contained the highest levels of zzso with lower levels seen in mantle and marginal zone B cells and none in plasma zzso zzso was zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and similar to zzso was absent from the small population of zzso zzso center B cells thought to be committed to zzso center zzso zzso Similarly, zzso was most strongly expressed in zzso of zzso center origin with lower levels present in mantle cell zzso chronic zzso zzso and marginal zone zzso and no expression observed in zzso zzso The zzso expression pattern with zzso in zzso zzso was generally maintained in zzso with some zzso These results suggest an important role for zzso during zzso center zzso development and in related zzso and provide a new diagnostic marker helpful in distinguishing zzso zzso zzso zzso
