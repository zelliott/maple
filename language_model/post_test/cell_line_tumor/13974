zzso has been reported to disappear by zzso in various zzso However, the relationship between the frequency of zzso of zzso and the mechanism of its zzso has not been completely zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso in the promoter region of the zzso gene and the expression of the zzso protein in 51 zzso including 8 zzso cancer cell lines, 7 normal zzso zzso 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso and 32 zzso cancer zzso were zzso 

Five out of 8 zzso cancer cell lines showed zzso with high frequency, although only 1 showed loss of gene zzso However, no zzso cancer tissue of the 32 specimens showed zzso Furthermore, loss of expression was zzso observed in 3 out of the 20 zzso 

These results suggest that zzso of zzso rarely occurs and, thus, has no significant effect on the zzso of zzso cancer in Japanese zzso
