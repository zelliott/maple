BACKGROUND AND zzso A novel zzso zzso complex zzso zzso earlier developed by us, is currently in phase I clinical zzso zzso induced zzso arrest and zzso via zzso zzso in a variety of zzso However, the underlying mechanism of zzso is zzso Here, we have explored the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in cancer cells, focusing on zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined in cancer cell lines, with different zzso status zzso , zzso and zzso zzso Time course analysis of zzso zzso calcium release, zzso promoter zzso zzso movements and zzso oxygen species zzso were zzso zzso zzso formation of the zzso zzso complex was zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were serially knocked down to study zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso triggered zzso zzso release stabilizing zzso complex and recruited zzso to zzso promoter, leading to zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso induced higher zzso zzso release and zzso followed by zzso of zzso downstream genes including those for the zzso zzso zzso In zzso and zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso generated zzso zzso further increased membrane zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso AND zzso This study disclosed a novel mechanism of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the mechanism of zzso zzso zzso will help establish this zzso organic compound as a potent zzso zzso
