Chemical zzso extends zzso applications zzso them new functions, but could modify their zzso We compared zzso and zzso effects of zzso zzso and pristine zzso to evaluated the influence of the zzso exposing zzso cells to zzso of both zzso for 2, 4 and zzso zzso was evaluated by zzso and zzso tests and zzso zzso zzso DNA damage by zzso comet zzso After zzso we found viability reduction significant at 20 and zzso for both the zzso with a zzso viability reduction already at lower zzso for zzso A significant zzso release was found only for zzso zzso zzso induction was found from zzso of zzso A zzso increase of direct DNA damage, significant at zzso of zzso and beginning from zzso of zzso was detected at all exposure zzso zzso DNA damage was not observed for both zzso The results indicate a different zzso zzso by membrane damage for zzso and zzso for zzso that could be explained by a different cellular zzso Moreover, we found an earlier zzso effect for zzso The findings suggest that further studies on zzso zzso are necessary before using them in several applications particularly in biomedical zzso
