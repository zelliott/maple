zzso viruses represent a global threat to the health and zzso of humans and zzso zzso the discovery of new approaches for the design of novel vaccines and zzso compounds attains high zzso Here we describe the potential of artificial zzso zzso low molecular weight compounds capable to cleave zzso bonds in zzso under mild conditions, to act as zzso compounds via destroying the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and the potential of utilizing honey bee larvae and adult bees zzso zzso as a novel experimental system for the screening of new zzso zzso zzso of an Acute bee paralysis virus zzso suspension with zzso zzso zzso or zzso in a zzso manner increased the survival rate of bee larvae and adult bees subsequently infected with these zzso whereas incubation of the virus with zzso zzso or zzso had no effect at zzso The results of zzso analysis of viral zzso isolated from zzso virus particles confirmed that virus zzso occurs via degradation of viral zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso well with the zzso of viral zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso of zzso particles zzso by zzso remains unaffected as compared to control virus zzso zzso the obtained results clearly demonstrate the potential of zzso as a new virus zzso agents and bee zzso as a new in zzso system for the screening of zzso zzso
