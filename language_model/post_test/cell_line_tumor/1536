We have previously shown that the zzso hormone zzso zzso regulates the zzso activity of the zzso precursor protein gene zzso in cultured zzso zzso cells, by a mechanism that involves binding of the nuclear zzso hormone zzso zzso to DNA sequences located within the first zzso of the zzso In this report we present results showing that the zzso hormones also repress the expression of zzso in human zzso cells and in primary cultures of rat zzso In addition, and in agreement with the results obtained in cultured cells, zzso zzso zzso and protein levels are significantly higher in the brain of zzso rats and mice, and also in zzso brain regions dissected from zzso mice lacking zzso These results show that binding of the zzso hormones to their nuclear receptors mediate their repressive effect on zzso gene expression in zzso
