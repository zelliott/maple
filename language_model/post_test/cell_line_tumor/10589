Human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso domain zzso zzso are proteins highly expressed in zzso center zzso B zzso zzso and zzso are also expressed in zzso zzso and distinguish biologically distinct zzso of diffuse large zzso zzso zzso associated with improved zzso However, little is known about their zzso zzso is a master regulator of terminal B cell differentiation and may also function as a tumor zzso in the zzso of zzso where it is frequently zzso by zzso and zzso We now demonstrate that both zzso and zzso are directly regulated by the zzso zzso zzso In zzso studies demonstrate that zzso directly binds to the recognition sites within the upstream promoters of both zzso and zzso zzso binding suppresses zzso protein and zzso levels of zzso and zzso In addition, promoter analysis reveals that zzso binding of zzso to the promoters is capable of zzso zzso zzso This zzso effect of zzso suggests that it has a key role in the loss of zzso and zzso expression upon differentiation of zzso B cells to plasma cells and may also contribute to absence of zzso and zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso
