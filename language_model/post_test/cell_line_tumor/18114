Iron regulatory protein 2 zzso a zzso regulator of cellular iron zzso zzso zzso degradation via the zzso zzso A stretch of 73 zzso acids within the zzso domain 1 of the protein was reported to function as an iron zzso However, zzso lacking this zzso remain sensitive to degradation in zzso zzso 

To identify elements within zzso involved in the control of its stability, we undertook a systematic zzso zzso zzso versions of zzso were expressed in zzso cells and analyzed for their response to zzso zzso zzso lacking the entire zzso domain 4 zzso acids zzso of zzso remained stable following iron zzso Moreover, the replacement of domain 4 of zzso with the corresponding region of zzso zzso the zzso zzso protein to zzso degradation, while the reverse manipulation gave rise to a stable zzso zzso zzso The deletion of just 26 or 34 zzso zzso acids stabilized zzso against zzso However, the fusion of zzso zzso fragments to zzso failed to sensitize the indicator protein for degradation in zzso zzso 

Our data suggest that the zzso of zzso contains elements that are necessary but not sufficient for zzso zzso The functionality of these elements depends upon the overall zzso zzso
