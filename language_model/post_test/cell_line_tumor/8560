zzso is used to treat zzso lung cancer zzso which targets zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between zzso plasma zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels, as well as the relationship between zzso levels and tumor growth zzso in a human zzso lung cancer zzso mouse zzso 

Female zzso nude mice were implanted with the human zzso cell line zzso The animals were given via zzso a single dose of zzso zzso zzso or 50 zzso zzso of zzso was determined using zzso zzso volume and zzso levels in tumor zzso were measured at different time points after zzso zzso The levels of zzso in tumor zzso was detected using Western zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso was described by a zzso model with first order zzso zzso zzso There was a time delay of approximately 2 h between zzso plasma zzso and zzso zzso The time course of zzso degradation was reasonably fit by the indirect response model with a calculated zzso value of zzso zzso The relationship between zzso levels and tumor volume was characterized by the integrated model with a zzso value of zzso zzso which described the impact of zzso degradation on tumor zzso 

The zzso properties of zzso in a human tumor zzso model were described by the indirect response model and integrated model, which will be helpful in understanding the detailed processes of zzso activity and determining an appropriate dosing regimen in clinical zzso
