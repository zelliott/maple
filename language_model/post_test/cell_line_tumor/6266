zzso proteins mediate most membrane fusion reactions in zzso cells, and are thereby vital for many functions, including synaptic transmission, cell growth, and zzso However, until recently it was still unclear how many of these proteins are required to catalyze membrane fusion in zzso In a recent Science paper, zzso et zzso zzso elegantly show that in zzso cells, three zzso complexes are required for the zzso release of zzso whereas only a single zzso complex is sufficient for overall zzso
