The large diversity of structures and unique bonding modes of zzso complexes make them possible to act as promising candidate therapeutic zzso In this study, the new type of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso has been zzso and their in zzso zzso activities have been explored by means of the zzso study, the real time cell electronic sensing zzso system, and biological zzso The zzso interactions were first monitored by zzso and the results show different cell zzso efficiency for zzso zzso and zzso toward target zzso Both the highly zzso zzso and zzso groups render the zzso able to rapidly enter cells and exert acute zzso after 4 h incubation in zzso zzso However, zzso zzso and zzso display different zzso efficiencies toward zzso and zzso cancer cells via the zzso arrest mechanism in a zzso zzso The zzso activity is in the order zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is parallel to the order of the zzso zzso of the zzso groups in the three zzso In particular, zzso and zzso display a potent selective zzso effect on the proliferation of the cancer cell lines zzso and zzso but almost no effect on the normal cell line, the human embryonic lung zzso zzso zzso Thus, these results may provide some clues for use of the zzso zzso in developing zzso zzso
