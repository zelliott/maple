We spliced the promoters of the human zzso and human zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso widely used for gene therapy and known to have the broadest cancer type spectrum of zzso Two zzso zzso were zzso the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso caused quantitative and qualitative changes in the promoter zzso In both zzso only the promoter zzso to the transcribed gene retained its ability to initiate transcription, whereas the zzso promoter was silent, the phenomenon never reported zzso However, the zzso promoter modulated the activity of the zzso one by increasing its strength and causing an appearance of additional zzso start zzso We suggested that this suppression might be due to the presence of zzso zzso factor binding sites in both promoters and zzso between these zzso Such zzso might convert the tandem promoter linear DNA into a zzso zzso If localized inside the formed loop, the zzso promoter could lose its ability to initiate zzso To test this hypothesis, we constructed two modified double zzso where the zzso zzso promoter was replaced either by a shortened zzso of the zzso promoter zzso or by the mouse zzso zzso Both zzso zzso were considerably shorter than zzso and had different numbers and/or positions of zzso zzso In modified zzso zzso was initiated from both zzso We also prepared two zzso forms of the zzso tandem with two or four zzso sites removed from the zzso zzso zzso zzso In the first case, the zzso zzso promoter remained silent, whereas the removal of four zzso binding sites restored its zzso In the majority of studied cancer cell lines the efficiency of zzso from the zzso zzso promoter tandem was markedly higher than from each constituent zzso In normal lung zzso cells, the tandem promoter activity was considerably zzso
