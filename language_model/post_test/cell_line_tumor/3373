zzso zzso zzso tumors generally have defects in differentiation and zzso zzso For a better understanding of these events, we use a zzso zzso cell line zzso that terminally zzso into mature zzso in response to elevated levels of zzso Because one of the main downstream zzso of the zzso signaling zzso is zzso element binding zzso we reasoned that it might affect the expression of genes associated with differentiation and zzso events in zzso zzso To investigate this, we established zzso expression zzso of zzso which zzso zzso promoters containing the zzso sequence zzso Using this system, we found that zzso expression of zzso in zzso cells results in 1) zzso differentiation that is characterized by the formation of zzso and growth cones, 2) zzso cell differentiation unlike zzso terminal zzso 3) cell cycle arrest at zzso 4) no zzso in the presence of partial zzso of zzso unlike an increase in zzso levels, and 5) changes in the expression of many zzso including zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso expression and zzso of the zzso zzso impart many similar effects in zzso cells, they also bear some distinct genetic and zzso zzso Our data suggest that increased levels of zzso function through not only zzso but also other signaling pathways that account for the additional zzso effects, including irreversible differentiation and onset of zzso during partial zzso of zzso in zzso zzso
