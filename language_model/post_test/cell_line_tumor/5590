Previous studies have suggested that the zzso zzso factors can both activate and inhibit gene zzso Here we show that zzso regulates the expression of zzso in a variety of tumor types through a zzso zzso zzso analysis in primary head and neck tumor samples indicates that zzso may serve as an in zzso marker for tumor zzso By zzso protein zzso we identified 50 potential zzso targets and validated randomly selected zzso The majority of these 50 genes are not classical zzso zzso suggesting zzso zzso genes expressed under zzso that are no longer necessary to adapt and survive in a hypoxic zzso When human head and neck or pancreatic tumor cells zzso expressing zzso were implanted into zzso mice, zzso zzso initiation of tumor zzso Taken together, these data zzso an important role for zzso in regulating the hypoxic response of tumor cells and tumor zzso
