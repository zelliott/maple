zzso are critical cell surface structures important in coordinated cell signaling and zzso One of the major proteins of zzso is zzso 1 zzso Cellular levels of zzso are associated with cancer zzso In prostate cancer cells, levels of zzso are positively correlated with tumor progression and zzso zzso can be zzso by prostate cancer cells into the zzso and triggers proliferation and zzso of the tumor and tumor zzso zzso Clinical studies have shown increased serum zzso levels in patients with poor zzso In tissue culture and animal model experiments, blocking zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso tumor cell zzso zzso is therefore a potential therapeutic target for prostate cancer zzso In this study, we used zzso zzso mice as hosts to produce zzso zzso zzso A total of 11 zzso cell lines were selected for their ability to produce zzso that bound zzso but not zzso on zzso zzso zzso Further screening with zzso using zzso fragments on zzso plates classified these zzso into four groups: zzso with five zzso binds the far zzso between zzso acids 1 and zzso zzso with three zzso binds between zzso acids 32 and zzso zzso with two zzso potentially bind the scaffolding domain zzso acids zzso and zzso with 1 zzso binds parts of the zzso zzso zzso affinities zzso of these zzso to soluble zzso ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso competition experiments revealed that these zzso recognized a total of six different zzso on zzso zzso of these zzso to neutralize zzso signaling pathways in cultured cells and in animal models will be zzso A selected zzso zzso will then be humanized and be further developed into a potential zzso cancer zzso
