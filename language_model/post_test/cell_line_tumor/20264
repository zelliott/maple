zzso zzso zzso compounds have recently received increasing attention due to their cancer zzso properties, and their zzso activities are extensively reported in many cancer cell zzso However, the zzso activity and the signaling zzso associated with the induction of zzso by extracts of garlic cloves have not been zzso In this study, we examined the effects of zzso extracts of garlic cloves zzso on zzso oxygen species zzso production and the association of these effects with zzso cell death, using a zzso human zzso cell line in zzso The results demonstrated that zzso mediate zzso production, and that this mediation is followed by a collapse of zzso membrane potential zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso also promoted the zzso of zzso and the zzso of Bid, a zzso zzso member of the zzso However, the zzso phenomena displayed by zzso were significantly diminished by the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso a widely used zzso scavenger, effectively blocked the zzso zzso effects via the zzso of zzso production and zzso zzso These observations clearly indicate that zzso zzso are key zzso of zzso collapse, which leads to the induction of zzso followed by zzso zzso
