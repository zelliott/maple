The aim of this study was to identify and to characterize a highly active zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso was screened for not yet addressed zzso triplets within highly zzso zzso Here we report the in zzso characteristics and the zzso activity of the zzso identified zzso zzso zzso targeting the 13th zzso zzso within the zzso pol gene zzso Multiple turnover zzso were determined in zzso and revealed very promising kinetic zzso zzso zzso 39 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso To analyze its zzso activity the zzso zzso was expressed zzso in zzso cells followed by zzso zzso The newly identified zzso zzso a long-term zzso of zzso replication until the end of the observation period at day zzso We were able to demonstrate that the zzso activity was mainly due to a zzso effect combined with a limited zzso zzso Additionally, the effect of the identified zzso was compared with a zzso expressed zzso directed against the same target in the zzso pol zzso This zzso zzso showed no zzso of zzso zzso In zzso the zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated to zzso superior zzso and zzso activity against zzso These results suggest that even in the zzso era zzso still have the potential as highly active zzso zzso
