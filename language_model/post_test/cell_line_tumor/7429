Here, we show that zzso zzso cell zzso zzso 1 zzso is expressed in umbrella cells of zzso zzso but is zzso in superficial zzso cancer, such as zzso tumor stage a zzso and transitional cell zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso in the zzso of adjacent zzso blood zzso zzso the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso was silenced in zzso cancer cell lines zzso and zzso using the small interfering zzso zzso zzso zzso was confirmed at the protein level by Western zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to a significant zzso of vascular zzso growth factor zzso and zzso in quantitative reverse zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso cancer cell lines zzso but those from zzso zzso induce zzso tube formation and zzso the zzso effects of zzso These data suggest that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso via increased expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso is zzso in zzso cells of zzso blood zzso This in turn is involved in the switch from zzso and zzso to invasive and zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to be a promising zzso target for zzso cancer zzso
