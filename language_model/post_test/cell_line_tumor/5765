The aim of this study was to select the best candidate drug for zzso zzso by zzso zzso evaluations of 11 zzso drugs on three human zzso zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso and zzso human zzso cell lines were exposed for 30 zzso to 11 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C, or zzso zzso was measured using a quantitative zzso zzso For each drug and cell line, we calculated the drug concentration that caused zzso cell death zzso To enable comparisons of drugs with different concentration zzso we zzso the zzso index zzso as the ratio of zzso drug concentration of more than zzso zzso were estimated using zzso zzso zzso zzso was the most active drug on all three cell zzso With zzso cells, the zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and more than 58 zzso higher than the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and other drugs, zzso With zzso cells, the zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso and more than zzso higher than the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and other drugs, zzso On the resistant zzso cell line, the zzso zzso was zzso and zzso higher than the zzso of zzso and zzso respectively, the only other drugs effective on this cell zzso Among 11 zzso agents including zzso zzso and zzso the most effective on three zzso cell lines was zzso Further clinical investigations are needed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of zzso for zzso zzso in zzso
