A systematic study on zzso Pt zzso and Pt zzso ratio in breast cancer zzso cell line has been performed on a number of zzso namely zzso zzso and zzso clinically employed as zzso drugs, zzso and zzso and zzso complexes, previously investigated also as potential zzso zzso In particular, long incubation times have been chosen in order to understand the fate of the complexes in the zzso For this purpose, zzso drug zzso must be employed and, therefore, a very sensitive method of analysis like as zzso coupled plasma mass zzso zzso superior to the widely employed atomic zzso zzso zzso has been zzso Any relationships among zzso and several parameters such as drug structure, zzso drug concentration and incubation time have been sought and zzso the bulk of data point for a passive diffusion mechanism through the cell zzso
