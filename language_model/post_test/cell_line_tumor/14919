There is increasing evidence suggesting that zzso of certain zzso zzso may contribute to tumor progression and zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso is zzso in some zzso but its role in zzso cancer is still zzso Here, we find that zzso is zzso in human zzso cancer zzso and cell zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso cancer cells significantly reduced their migration and invasion without affecting cell zzso zzso analysis identified the zzso gene zzso as a potential zzso zzso Further studies indicated that zzso suppressed the expression of zzso by binding to its zzso zzso zzso of zzso by small interfering zzso zzso the effects of zzso zzso whereas restoration of zzso in zzso cancer cells zzso cancer cells zzso zzso partially reversed the zzso effects of zzso We further showed that zzso and zzso may be downstream zzso proteins of zzso These findings indicate that zzso could be a potential tumor zzso in zzso zzso
