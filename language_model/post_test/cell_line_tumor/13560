The zzso zzso family member zzso is a zzso protein zzso sequences enriched in zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso and is subject to rapid degradation via multiple zzso zzso degradation leading to the maintenance of zzso expression is an important zzso of drug resistance in zzso zzso at zzso zzso in the zzso region, zzso by zzso zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with zzso stabilization in zzso zzso zzso zzso This contrasts with the observation that zzso zzso zzso in normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso producing a zzso that targets zzso for zzso In the present follow-up studies in zzso cells, zzso degradation was found to be independent of the zzso pathway, providing a parallel to emerging findings showing that zzso degradation through this zzso is lost in many different types of zzso zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso those in zzso cells in that the zzso zzso did not play a major role in zzso degradation, and a zzso zzso zzso resulted in marked zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, in addition to exhibiting zzso zzso zzso and zzso stabilization, exhibited an zzso increase in resistance to multiple zzso agents, including zzso zzso zzso or zzso In these cancer cells in which zzso degradation is not dependent on the zzso pathway, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are associated with pronounced zzso stabilization and drug resistance - effects that can be suppressed by zzso of zzso zzso
