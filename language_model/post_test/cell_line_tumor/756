zzso type 1 zzso a zzso zzso implicated in zzso membrane zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso is highly regulated and expressed in a zzso and zzso zzso It is known that zzso zzso 4 and 13 play important roles in zzso the zzso zzso However, the fact that they only exert such effects on a few types of cells suggests additional zzso for the profile control of zzso zzso In the present study, we demonstrate that zzso and zzso of zzso islands in the zzso promoter region is intimately associated with the zzso repression and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso promoter was exclusively zzso in all examined cells incapable of expressing zzso zzso solid tumor and human zzso cell lines and human T zzso while zzso in zzso cells (the human airway zzso cell line zzso and human zzso where zzso expression is zzso zzso of DNA zzso in zzso zzso cells restores zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso with this, the zzso zzso promoter reporter construct exhibited zzso higher activity in zzso cells compared to its zzso zzso Taken together, zzso of the zzso promoter is a prerequisite for the gene zzso which contributes to zzso and zzso regulation of zzso zzso
