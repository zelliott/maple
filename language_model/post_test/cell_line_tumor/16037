The clinical success of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as DNA zzso zzso zzso has spurred interest in the development of zzso zzso with improved zzso and safety zzso Because zzso zzso features attack of zzso bases by an zzso zzso group, we tested whether zzso zzso a zzso compound with known clinical safety, demonstrated zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso activity by zzso was assessed using zzso activity zzso with zzso zzso Next, prostate cancer cell lines were exposed to zzso and assessed for: zzso reduction of global zzso zzso zzso content using liquid zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by real-time zzso zzso was also tested for growth zzso using prostate cancer cell lines zzso in zzso in cell culture and in zzso as zzso in nude zzso 

zzso showed a zzso zzso of zzso activity on a zzso DNA zzso In prostate cancer cells in culture, zzso exposure led to reduction of global zzso zzso content, increase in zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso and associated zzso of these zzso but did not significantly alter zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited growth and zzso survival of prostate cancer cell lines in culture and showed a trend for reduced growth of prostate cancer zzso 

zzso is a zzso zzso inhibitor that can reduce global zzso content, reactivate zzso silenced zzso and significantly inhibit growth in prostate cancer cell zzso
