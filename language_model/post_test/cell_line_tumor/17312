By utilizing zzso fluorescent cellular prion protein zzso we revealed that the zzso and zzso zzso fragments exhibit distinct distribution patterns in mouse zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso a zzso cell line established from zzso zzso mice zzso 400 (1999) zzso Of note, the zzso zzso fragment, which predominantly localized in the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso after the treatment with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso in mouse zzso zzso exhibited a proper distribution profile, whereas those with zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso did zzso These data indicate the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso containing at least the zzso zzso acid zzso
