zzso like the zzso zzso with zzso linked to zzso zzso zzso are characterized by an zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso For zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso function including disturbed dynamics such as zzso and fusion are most likely major zzso of most neurodegenerative zzso However, very little is known if zzso itself affects zzso function and zzso We addressed this question using zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in a substantial complex I deficit accompanied by decreased zzso levels and increased zzso to zzso zzso This was paralleled by pronounced changes in zzso zzso decreased fusion and zzso rates accompanied by reduced expression of several zzso and fusion factors like zzso or zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso exhibits protective effects on zzso function and dynamics including enhanced complex I zzso Our findings clearly link zzso zzso to zzso function and zzso identifying a novel aspect of the zzso role of zzso and the zzso of zzso
