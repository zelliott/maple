zzso release many proteins into their zzso These proteins may enter the blood stream and have value as cancer zzso We examined the range of proteins released by zzso cancer zzso liver zzso zzso specimens and normal colon zzso during 16 h culture as zzso in the presence of zzso zzso released into the zzso media were isolated and separated by zzso and detected by zzso stain and de zzso zzso proteins by zzso The majority of proteins released by zzso zzso zzso in short-term culture were plasma proteins from zzso zzso fluid and tissue breakdown products including zzso and nuclear proteins from pre-existing zzso cells within the zzso De zzso zzso proteins were present at a lower abundance and included a high proportion of zzso proteins in addition to classically zzso zzso Many zzso proteins were also present in the zzso zzso of four zzso cell lines zzso despite high cell viability zzso suggestive of an alternative release zzso The zzso profiles varied significantly between different patients, and also between different cell lines, despite low zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso profiles prepared from zzso and normal colon zzso zzso revealed 32 protein spots that were zzso abundant between the normal and cancer tissue zzso including zzso and zzso gamma chain, which were zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Further characterization of de zzso zzso proteins released from human zzso may help to discover a novel set of zzso markers for zzso
