The fragile zzso zzso zzso gene is a zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene and protein expression have been described in many types of human zzso Furthermore, it has been reported that zzso gene zzso is induced by zzso of zzso zzso islands in the gene or by zzso deletion around the open reading frame zzso In this study, we explored the aberrations in the canine zzso gene and zzso protein expression and assessed the zzso status and zzso deletions by using 5 canine zzso cell zzso We found that the decrease in the expression of the zzso protein in canine zzso cell lines was similar to that in human zzso The expression of the zzso zzso transcript was reduced in all 5 cell zzso However, we could not confirm the involvement of zzso zzso events in the zzso zzso islands of the canine zzso zzso We were able to identify zzso or zzso deletions in the canine zzso genes in all 5 cell zzso Moreover, a widespread zzso deletion of the zzso zzso which included the zzso region, was detected in 1 cell zzso In the present study, we detected aberrations in the zzso gene and zzso protein expression in all 5 canine zzso cell lines, and this phenomenon might be an important factor in promoting canine zzso
