zzso zzso zzso zzso is a deadly cancer with a poor prognosis that is characterized by excessive zzso zzso zzso and marked zzso to a broad spectrum of zzso zzso zzso specificity protein zzso 1 zzso is a key negative regulator of zzso activated protein zzso zzso Yet, zzso is zzso in pancreatic cancer cells zzso in zzso where it paradoxically enhances colony formation in soft zzso and promotes in zzso zzso However, it is not known whether zzso zzso contributes to zzso zzso Using zzso and zzso human zzso we show that zzso activates zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activated protein zzso zzso zzso key zzso in two major zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso mediates increased zzso but also zzso zzso zzso as evidenced by increased zzso zzso levels and zzso zzso II loading at zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso enhances zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Using zzso zzso of zzso in established zzso pancreatic tumors, we found that combining zzso with zzso zzso improves animal survival, zzso zzso and enhances zzso cell death, as compared with zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso zzso of zzso contributes to a negative feedback loop that zzso its beneficial actions on stress pathways and zzso raising the possibility that targeting zzso in zzso may have the advantage of enhancing zzso zzso while suppressing zzso
