A set of zzso derivatives of zzso acid and zzso zzso was zzso and evaluated for the zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso compounds were further screened for their zzso activity in two human cancer cell lines, zzso zzso cell lung zzso and zzso zzso zzso All derivatives showed significant zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso while only the zzso zzso was reasonably effective in zzso zzso A zzso study provided insight into the binding mode of the most potent inhibitor in the active sites of the zzso allowing rationalization of the zzso The zzso compound could be of interest for testing against zzso tumors in an animal zzso The studied derivatives represent promising molecular templates for further development of dual activity zzso zzso
