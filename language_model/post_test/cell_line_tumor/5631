zzso zzso zzso is a well-established tumor marker for zzso zzso zzso but the precise mechanism by which zzso cells produce zzso remains zzso Our preliminary experiments demonstrated that zzso cells with chemical induction of zzso conversion zzso produced zzso through impairment of vitamin K zzso via zzso zzso zzso in this study we further examined this mechanism in zzso and using human zzso zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso were induced zzso or zzso transition zzso by zzso zzso 13 zzso zzso or transforming growth factor zzso We analyzed these cells by zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso We also examined zzso production and zzso expression in human surgically zzso zzso samples by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (as a surrogate for vitamin zzso was significantly impaired in zzso zzso cells following induction of zzso or zzso Further, zzso zzso which plays a critical role in zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso zzso A, an zzso zzso induced zzso zzso cells to produce zzso with impairment of zzso zzso In addition, an zzso zzso zzso did not induce zzso zzso Finally, zzso studies demonstrated that zzso production was zzso correlated with the intensity of zzso expression in human zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso changes during zzso or zzso plays a critical zzso role in zzso production via zzso in vitamin K zzso
