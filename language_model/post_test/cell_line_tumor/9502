To construct a zzso green fluorescent protein expressing zzso containing the zzso of zzso associated gene A zzso of zzso zzso zzso so as to lay a foundation for the research of gene vaccine of gastric zzso zzso 

The zzso of gene zzso was amplified from zzso using zzso The amplified product was examined by zzso and sequence zzso This zzso was inserted into zzso zzso and zzso fluorescent expression zzso The zzso zzso zzso was zzso into the gastric zzso cells of the strain zzso by zzso zzso Fluorescence zzso was used to observe the expression of zzso zzso 

zzso was inserted in the zzso zzso It was verified by DNA sequencing and restriction zzso The enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso expression zzso carrying zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso correctly and zzso in gastric zzso cell strain zzso Green zzso was observed in zzso gastric zzso zzso 

Construction of the enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso expression zzso carrying zzso was zzso
