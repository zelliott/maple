The zzso zzso is a key zzso of zzso zzso the type of zzso damage that has been zzso to be induced by zzso Here we describe a cellular system in which we can unleash zzso activity at will, in the absence of any actual damage or additional signaling pathways triggered by DNA zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso is sufficient to promote cell cycle arrest and, if persistent, triggers zzso but zzso zzso Moreover, we show that an zzso zzso of zzso leads to a zzso arrest in zzso cells, providing the first evidence of functional zzso of zzso zzso by zzso Our system provides a novel platform for the study of the specific functions of zzso signaling and adds evidence for the zzso potential of the DNA damage zzso
