zzso zzso are small zzso zzso that are involved in different biological processes by suppressing target gene zzso zzso expression of zzso has been reported in colon zzso To zzso its potential biological role in colon cancer, zzso was zzso via a zzso zzso system in two different colon cancer cell zzso This induced in both lines zzso growth zzso attributable to a cell cycle arrest at the zzso phase and an induction of zzso Combining global gene expression analyses of zzso transgenic line zzso with in zzso zzso target zzso we identified the zzso protein zzso zzso as a potential zzso zzso zzso reporter gene zzso confirmed the predicted zzso binding site in the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells partially rescued these cells from zzso growth zzso In addition, zzso and zzso expression were increased in zzso zzso cells, suggesting that zzso is able to zzso the cell cycle via a zzso regulatory zzso Finally, zzso zzso cancer zzso were screened for zzso expression and zzso was found to be zzso in zzso of human zzso zzso compared with normal colon zzso In conclusion, our data identified zzso as a zzso zzso in colon cancer cells exerting its function via zzso of zzso zzso which is frequently zzso in zzso zzso Thus, our data suggest that restoring zzso function may prove useful as therapeutic strategy for tumors with reduced zzso zzso
