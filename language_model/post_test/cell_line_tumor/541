zzso cell death, an important death zzso in many cells including zzso is executed via zzso factor zzso an zzso localized to the zzso zzso zzso zzso is processed and released from zzso following zzso zzso transition pore zzso formation, and zzso to the nucleus to induce DNA fragmentation and cell zzso The release of zzso requires zzso of its zzso anchored in the inner zzso zzso The zzso responsible for this zzso zzso has not been established, although there is considerable evidence suggesting a role for zzso We previously found that a pool of zzso is localized to the zzso zzso space, the zzso compartment in which zzso zzso zzso The close zzso proximity of zzso zzso and zzso gives support to the hypothesis that zzso zzso may be the zzso responsible for processing zzso prior to its zzso In the present study, zzso was released from rat liver zzso following zzso induction by zzso This release was inhibited by the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso but not by more specific zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso caused swelling in rat brain zzso but did not induce zzso zzso In a zzso fraction from zzso zzso cells, incubation with 5 zzso zzso resulted in the zzso of zzso but not in zzso zzso In zzso the zzso of zzso to the zzso zzso space is suggestive of its possible involvement in zzso processing, but direct experimental evidence supporting such a role has been zzso
