As a part of the research on the improvement of an alternative to conventional zzso therapy by zzso formation of zzso we zzso a series of novel zzso compounds and their zzso zzso We now report details about their zzso in respect to their potential of zzso zzso interactions with DNA and zzso of the tumor cell growth in zzso Among studied compounds only zzso zzso zzso were efficiently converted to the corresponding zzso while their zzso zzso all zzso derivatives and zzso zzso didn't show acceptable zzso The significantly stronger zzso activity of zzso zzso could be correlated to the property of these molecules to zzso into zzso The zzso molecules did not show any interaction with DNA, zzso with the inferior biological activity, except for one zzso zzso
