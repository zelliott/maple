The in zzso responses of zzso cells zzso a zzso cell line derived from a chemically induced rat peripheral zzso on various types of zzso zzso scaffolds of some commercially available zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were reported in comparison with those of the cells on corresponding zzso film scaffolds as well as on a zzso polystyrene plate zzso used as the positive zzso At 24 h after cell seeding, the viability of the attached cells on the various zzso could be ranked as zzso zzso film zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso film zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso film approximately zzso film zzso zzso film zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso At day 3 of cell culture, the viability of the proliferated cells on the various zzso could be ranked as zzso zzso zzso zzso film zzso zzso film zzso zzso film zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso film approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso film zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso At approximately 8 h after cell seeding, the cells on the flat surfaces of all of the film scaffolds and that of the zzso zzso scaffold appeared in their characteristic zzso shape, while those on the surfaces of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso scaffolds also appeared in their characteristic zzso shape, but with the cells being able to penetrate to the inner side of the zzso
