Selective zzso of cell death is important for rational zzso By depleting zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso render certain zzso cancer cells sensitive to zzso Here we investigated effects of zzso and zzso in zzso cells such as zzso and zzso In these cells, zzso zzso caused rapid zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso (a potent inhibitor of zzso and zzso arrest without significant zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso and zzso and delayed cell death caused by zzso zzso of translation and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso effects of zzso Also zzso failed to protect zzso cells from zzso of zzso D and zzso zzso zzso of zzso We next compared zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Whereas zzso arrest protected zzso cells from zzso zzso but not from FL and zzso zzso prevented zzso zzso but was less effective against zzso and zzso Thus, by inducing zzso zzso protected zzso cells in unique and zzso selective zzso Since zzso does not protect zzso cancer cells, we envision a therapeutic strategy to decrease side effects of chemotherapy without affecting its therapeutic zzso
