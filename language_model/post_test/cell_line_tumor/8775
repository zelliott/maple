zzso protein 1 zzso also known as class A basic zzso protein 38 zzso has been implicated in cell lineage determination and zzso Previous studies demonstrate that zzso expression is zzso in gastric cancer with poor clinical zzso Besides, zzso is suggested to be involved in progression of human gastric zzso However, its biological functions remain largely zzso In the present study, we show that Twist 1 zzso leads to a significant zzso of zzso which plays a key role in cell cycle progression in gastric cancer zzso In contrast, zzso of Twist 1 reduces zzso zzso suggesting that zzso might be a direct zzso target of Twist zzso At the molecular level, we further reveal that Twist 1 could bind to the promoter region of zzso and subsequently recruit zzso to induce zzso zzso zzso zzso our results uncover a previous unknown Twist zzso regulatory pathway, which may help to understand the mechanisms of gastric cancer zzso
