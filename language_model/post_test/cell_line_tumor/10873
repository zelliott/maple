zzso cell zzso cancer presents a significant health burden in many developing countries around the zzso In South Africa, this disease is one of the most common causes of zzso deaths in black zzso Because this cancer is only modestly responsive to available zzso agents, there is a need to develop more effective therapeutic agents for this zzso Marine organisms are currently regarded as a promising source of unique zzso molecules because they display a rich diversity of secondary zzso Some of these compounds have significant zzso activity, with a few of these currently in phase I and II clinical zzso We report here an ongoing program to screen marine organisms collected from zzso zzso communities off the coast of southern Africa for activity against cultured zzso cancer zzso Of the 137 extracts tested, zzso displayed high activity zzso zzso 3) and zzso displayed moderate activity zzso zzso 2) against cultured zzso cancer zzso Our results suggest that sponges had a higher hit rate zzso than zzso zzso Using zzso zzso seven previously described compounds and four novel compounds, with varying activity against zzso cancer cell lines, were isolated from the sponges zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The results of this study suggest that zzso zzso marine organisms collected off the coast of southern Africa hold potential for identifying possible drug leads for the development of agents with activity against zzso zzso
