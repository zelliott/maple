Seven star zzso with degrees of zzso zzso of the arms from 10 to 100 and dimensions in the zzso range were prepared using sequential group transfer zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso positively zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso neutral zzso The zzso were characterized in zzso by gel zzso zzso and zzso light scattering to determine the molecular weights and the zzso number of arms for each zzso The number of arms of the star zzso varied from 20 to zzso zzso solutions of the star zzso were studied by zzso hydrogen zzso zzso and dynamic light scattering to determine their cloud points, zzso and zzso zzso The cloud points of the larger star zzso with arm zzso zzso were found to be zzso degrees C, almost independent of the zzso of the zzso Similarly, the zzso of all star zzso were calculated to range between zzso and zzso again independent of the arm zzso In contrast, the zzso diameters of the star zzso strongly depended on the zzso of the zzso In particular, by increasing the zzso of the arms from 20 to 100, the zzso diameters in water increased from 7 to 31 zzso All star zzso were evaluated for their ability to zzso human cervical zzso cancer cells with the modified zzso zzso with the enhanced green fluorescent protein as the reporter zzso Our results showed that as the zzso of the arms of the zzso star zzso increased from 10 to 100, the overall zzso efficiency zzso with the star zzso with zzso of the arms of 10 emerging as the best zzso zzso zzso variation of the amounts of star zzso and zzso DNA used in the zzso led to an zzso of the performance of this star zzso yielding overall zzso efficiencies of zzso comparable to the optimum overall zzso efficiency of the commercially available zzso zzso zzso of zzso
