zzso in the culture medium is one crucial factor that compromises zzso efficiency of zzso zzso However, zzso roles of serum in zzso delivery remain zzso In this work, we took one zzso zzso zzso chemically modified by zzso zzso as zzso zzso as a zzso carrier model to investigate the effects of serum on key steps in zzso delivery including formation of Ps and zzso zzso zzso cellular zzso zzso escape, and zzso We demonstrate that low serum concentration zzso and zzso in culture medium results in large particles of zzso while high serum concentration zzso leads to small particles of zzso The larger particles initiated the zzso of zzso more effectively in comparison to the smaller zzso The engulfed zzso particles mainly locate in zzso The large particles exhibited stronger abilities of zzso zzso than that of the small particles as large zzso particles contain more zzso and subsequently elicit a stronger zzso sponge effect which results in more effective zzso escape of zzso Despite the lower zzso efficiency, the small particle of zzso in the high serum medium generates much lower zzso These findings explain why serum significantly affects zzso and also propose a strategy for improving zzso efficiency and safety by modulating serum concentration and enhancing zzso zzso
