zzso of zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso to cell surface zzso zzso promotes zzso and zzso of zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and leads to cell detachment from a variety of zzso zzso In this report, we begin to examine the mechanism of this zzso We show that neither specific zzso to zzso nor active site zzso of zzso can zzso the zzso Thus, cell detachment is not simply the result of the binding of zzso to zzso and/or of the zzso of zzso We further demonstrate that another zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also stimulates cell detachment in a zzso zzso The binding of both zzso to zzso leads to the specific zzso of the zzso zzso and the subsequent detachment of these zzso from the underlying zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso of zzso requires direct interaction between zzso and those zzso since cells attached to the zzso through zzso incapable of binding zzso do not respond to the presence of either zzso of zzso Although both zzso initiate the clearance of zzso only zzso triggers the zzso of zzso However, cell detachment by zzso or zzso does not depend on the zzso of these zzso since cell detachment was also observed when clearance of these zzso was zzso Thus, zzso and zzso induce cell detachment through two slightly different mechanisms that affect zzso zzso These differences may be important for distinct cellular processes that require controlled changes in the zzso zzso of these zzso
