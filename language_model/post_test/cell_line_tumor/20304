The finding that many zzso agents have zzso effects has provided the impetus to combine chemotherapy and zzso for synergistic zzso zzso However, the critical zzso of effective zzso immunity after chemotherapy have not been zzso Here we report that adoptive transfer of zzso zzso T cells after chemotherapy with zzso gave rise to zzso zzso zzso cells, which in turn intensified the inflammatory milieu and enhanced the zzso of zzso T cells in the tumor zzso Although this combined zzso initially resulted in progressive zzso of advanced zzso lymphoma, its therapeutic efficacy was not durable and most mice succumbed to late zzso zzso zzso was associated with acquisition of a zzso zzso in zzso zzso T cells, characterized by zzso of program zzso zzso zzso effective zzso immunity was maintained and cure became prevalent when zzso zzso zzso cells were prevented from undergoing zzso zzso either by zzso blockade of the zzso pathway, or targeted zzso of zzso in zzso zzso T zzso Our study suggests that zzso zzso T cells act as the zzso of the host zzso immunity in the zzso setting, thereby their functional status zzso the choice between zzso versus regrowth of residual zzso
