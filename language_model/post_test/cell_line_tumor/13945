The zzso nuclear factor 6 zzso or zzso protein is a zzso specific zzso factor that regulates expression of zzso zzso Using zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso protein was shown to associate with cell cycle regulatory zzso Here, we examined whether increased levels of zzso stimulate zzso proliferation during mouse liver zzso 

Tail vein injection of zzso expressing the zzso complementary DNA was used to increase zzso zzso levels during mouse liver zzso induced by partial zzso and DNA replication was determined by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used to determine zzso target zzso 

zzso expression of zzso during mouse liver zzso causes a significant increase in the number of zzso entering DNA replication zzso zzso and mouse zzso zzso cells diminished for zzso levels by small interfering zzso zzso exhibit a 50% reduction in S phase following serum zzso This stimulation in zzso zzso progression was associated with increased expression of the zzso zzso tumor growth factor alpha and the cell cycle regulators zzso D1 and zzso box zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso show that tumor growth factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso promoter regions are direct zzso targets of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso mouse liver extracts reveal an association between zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso show that zzso stimulates zzso zzso zzso 

These mouse liver zzso studies show that increased zzso levels stimulate zzso proliferation through zzso induction of cell cycle regulatory zzso
