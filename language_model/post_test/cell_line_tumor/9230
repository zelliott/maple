zzso is a zzso present in several plant zzso Its zzso properties against several diseases have been largely zzso To validate a model for the study of the factors influencing its biological fate at the zzso level, the metabolism and the zzso of zzso were studied in the human zzso cell line, zzso Comparative zzso liquid zzso analysis of cell culture media before and after zzso showed that zzso was rapidly zzso at the concentration of 10 zzso it was entirely zzso at 8 h of zzso Two main zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified by atmospheric pressure chemical zzso zzso thanks to their zzso zzso and their characteristic zzso To correlate with the zzso of zzso metabolism evidenced in zzso cells after a zzso for 48 h with 10 zzso zzso the zzso of phase II zzso by zzso was studied by real-time quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction and flow zzso zzso in particular, were an increase in zzso expression levels of three zzso zzso two zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso in cells zzso for 24 h with 10 zzso zzso These results were correlated with an increase in protein zzso especially after 48 h of zzso On the other hand, the zzso zzso retention in cells treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein zzso strongly suggests the involvement of this ABC zzso family in the zzso of zzso zzso from human zzso
