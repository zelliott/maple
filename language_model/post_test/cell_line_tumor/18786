Although there is tight association of the human zzso leukemia virus zzso zzso with adult zzso zzso zzso it has remained unresolved whether the zzso integration into the host zzso has any role in the development of this zzso We isolated a total of 58 zzso integration sites using newly developed, zzso zzso from 33 zzso patients and five zzso cell zzso We compared our data as well as the previously reported ones with the complete human zzso sequence for the location of its placement, structure, and expression of genes nearby the integration zzso The zzso target for integration was selected at random, but the integration favorably occurred within the zzso zzso more than zzso of total integration was observed within the zzso zzso All inserted genes by zzso integration were expressed in normal T zzso zzso of genes due to viral integration was found in two out of nine zzso zzso about zzso and zzso elevated zzso ( zzso and zzso ( zzso gene expressions were observed, zzso These data suggest that the preferential integration of zzso into an expressed locus occasionally causes deregulation of corresponding zzso which may lead to zzso of a fraction of zzso
