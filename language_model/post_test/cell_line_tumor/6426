zzso cancer is a major mortality factor in the female zzso This zzso is an excellent model for studying the mechanisms involved in cancer zzso because the Human zzso zzso zzso is the zzso factor in most zzso With the purpose of characterizing the effects of zzso transformation in cellular activity, zzso studies constitute a reliable way to monitor the biological zzso induced by this zzso In this contextual zzso a systemic description that enables the identification of the common events between cell lines of different origins, is required to distinguish the essence of zzso 

With this study, we sought to achieve a systemic perspective of the common zzso profile of six cervical cancer cell lines, both positive and negative for zzso and which differ from the profile corresponding to the zzso cell line, zzso Our objectives were to identify common cellular events participating in cancer zzso as well as the establishment of a pipeline to work with zzso zzso We analyzed by means of zzso zzso and zzso mass zzso the protein extracts of six cervical cancer cell lines, from which we identified a consensus of 66 zzso We call this group of zzso the zzso core of cervical zzso Starting from this core set of zzso we acquired a zzso network that pointed, through zzso analysis, to some proteins that may well be playing a central role in the zzso process, such as zzso In zzso overrepresentation analysis of zzso factors pointed to the zzso of zzso Max and zzso as key zzso factors involved in orchestrating the zzso zzso 

Our findings show that there is a zzso core of cervical zzso protein expression pattern, and suggest that zzso is key to determine if the cell zzso or zzso In addition, our zzso analysis suggests that the zzso zzso is governed by a zzso regulatory zzso
