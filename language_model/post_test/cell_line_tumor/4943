The zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso is predominantly expressed in nervous zzso and subject to complex zzso zzso To determine the effect of zzso on zzso zzso human zzso zzso cells were treated with zzso A zzso a zzso zzso zzso As a consequence, total and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso oxide production were zzso zzso and western zzso showed both nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in the presence of zzso The enhancement of the zzso and zzso zzso was in accordance with their increased binding affinities to the zzso responsive element, which was identified at position zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso the zzso activity of the zzso zzso promoter through zzso zzso Taken together, we demonstrate that zzso plays a crucial role in zzso expression and suggest that zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso treatment may augment their zzso zzso thereby zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso It may be one of the mechanisms by which zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso oxide output in zzso cells and may be the molecular basis for certain neurological zzso
