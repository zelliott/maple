We analyzed the zzso and zzso status of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene and both zzso and protein levels in primary oral zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso cell lines and examined the function of the zzso gene in zzso cell lines in zzso Using quantitative real-time reverse zzso zzso chain reaction, Western zzso and zzso on 7 zzso cell lines and normal oral zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein expression were commonly zzso in all cell lines compared to the zzso Although no sequence variation in the coding region of the zzso gene was identified in these cell lines, we found frequent zzso in the zzso island zzso zzso expression was restored by experimental zzso In addition, using a wound healing zzso and in zzso invasion zzso we performed functional analysis using zzso zzso into the zzso cell lines, and they showed significant zzso of zzso and zzso In clinical samples, high zzso of zzso zzso were detected by zzso zzso of 53 zzso Furthermore, the zzso expression status was correlated significantly zzso zzso zzso with tumor zzso to cervical zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso gene is frequently zzso during oral zzso and that an zzso mechanism may regulate loss of expression possibly leading to zzso
