We report the synthesis and the affinity data at both the peripheral zzso and the central zzso receptors of a series of zzso derivatives III, designed as zzso constrained zzso of zzso II such as zzso Most of the new compounds showed a high specificity and affinity for zzso with zzso in the zzso to zzso zzso The most potent zzso zzso 9, zzso zzso steroid zzso in rat zzso zzso cells with a potency similar to or higher than that of classical zzso The zzso of this new class of compounds are zzso
