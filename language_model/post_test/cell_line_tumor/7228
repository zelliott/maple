zzso zzso from the brain of normal adult zzso rats were compared to their initiated and zzso counterparts that were isolated from apparently normal brains of animals exposed to zzso zzso zzso growth zzso zzso or zzso growth factor zzso or zzso induced differentiation of normal zzso to a zzso or zzso zzso respectively, whereas the combination of these factors resulted in their terminal differentiation to zzso and zzso In contrast, initiated zzso did not exit the cell cycle when zzso with zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso showed an early zzso induction of growth zzso zzso zzso zzso IGF-1 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso followed by a late increase in the expression zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 2, and 1 during the zzso zzso Western zzso analyses demonstrated that zzso exposure caused progressive reduction of zzso protein levels, an increase of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Double zzso labeling showed progressive increase in nuclear zzso of zzso 2, and 4, which peaked in zzso zzso It is zzso that transition of normal rat zzso zzso to an initiated state is driven by IGF-1 and 2, zzso and the zzso of the receptors zzso and zzso 2, and zzso zzso of the cell cycle in this state involves reduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and an increase in zzso zzso that favors expression and nuclear zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso These events are associated with progressive zzso of zzso and zzso zzso transformation is enhanced by near elimination of zzso and zzso induction of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso pathway, and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso possibly in response to changes in the expression of nerve growth factor zzso I-A and zzso These data demonstrate that the events leading to zzso in the rat brain in response to zzso treatment are to a great extent similar to those described for secondary zzso zzso in zzso
