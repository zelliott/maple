zzso acids have a great influence on the process of zzso zzso which is considered as a modulating factor of immune response in both humans and zzso However the mechanism underlying the function of fatty acids in the process of zzso zzso is not fully zzso In this study we show that the appearance of zzso fatty acid binding protein zzso is induced upon administration of zzso zzso in both in zzso and cultured zzso and its distinct nuclear zzso occurs in close relation to the zzso zzso zzso In zzso of mouse zzso zzso starts to occur 3 h after zzso zzso and it zzso zzso in the nucleus 8 h after the treatment, while no zzso is discerned in the zzso of normal as well as 24 h zzso zzso In the zzso zzso leukemia zzso cells, zzso is also induced in both of the zzso and nucleus when the zzso is induced by zzso retrieval together with zzso treatment, while in the presence of zzso zzso is confined to the zzso with zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso is not detected by zzso retrieval zzso The present findings altogether suggest that zzso and its zzso fatty zzso play an important role in the process of zzso and the immune zzso induced by zzso
