Cancer cells are exposed to external and internal stresses by virtue of their unrestrained growth, hostile zzso and increased zzso zzso These stresses impose a burden on protein folding and degradation pathways and suggest a route for therapeutic intervention in zzso zzso and zzso zzso are in clinical trials and a zzso zzso zzso zzso is an approved zzso Other points of intervention in the folding and degradation zzso may therefore be of zzso We describe a simple screen for zzso of protein zzso zzso and zzso degradation pathways in this zzso The molecular zzso client zzso was fused to zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso tumor zzso Both zzso and protein zzso zzso activity were preserved in cells expressing this fusion zzso zzso these cells to the zzso inhibitor zzso caused a rapid reduction of zzso and zzso activities and depletion of zzso zzso fusion zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso activity and, when combined with zzso caused a buildup of zzso and zzso proteins in a zzso zzso zzso zzso also decreased zzso activity and caused a buildup of zzso proteins in a zzso zzso zzso synthesis zzso also reduced zzso activity, but had less of an effect on zzso zzso In contrast, certain zzso zzso zzso increased zzso and zzso zzso A mass screen led to the identification of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and protein synthesis zzso The largest group of compounds identified in the screen increased zzso activity, and some of these increase zzso levels and zzso When used in conjunction with appropriate secondary zzso this screen is a powerful zzso tool for studying compounds that affect protein zzso zzso and zzso
