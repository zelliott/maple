To investigate the expression of zzso inhibitor of zzso protein zzso and the zzso rate in cultured zzso cells, and discuss their zzso 

zzso zzso cells were zzso with 2, 4, 8 zzso gamma zzso Living inhibitor rate detected with zzso zzso rate and zzso index number of zzso in zzso level by zzso and in protein level by flow zzso zzso were measured at zzso 24th, 48th hours after radiation zzso 

After zzso the volume of adherent cells increased and the number of suspended cells increased zzso 48 hours after zzso with 2, 4, 8 zzso the living inhibitor rate of zzso cells were zzso zzso zzso and zzso rate was zzso zzso zzso The zzso index number of zzso protein measured by zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso With the dosage of 4 zzso at the zzso 24th, 48th hours of zzso the zzso rate was zzso zzso zzso The living inhibitor rate was direct correlation with zzso rate in radiated zzso zzso The expression of zzso increased quickly at the 24th hours after radiation but the zzso rate did not increased in the zzso zzso was no more increase at the 48th hours, while the zzso rate was significantly zzso Which indicated that Them two were negative zzso 

zzso can inhibit the growth of zzso zzso The zzso dosage was direct correlation with living inhibitor zzso zzso is the main death method of zzso cells after zzso The over expression of zzso maybe one reason which caused the delayed zzso after zzso
