Clinical trials with zzso agents have not been able to validate plasma or serum levels of zzso regulators as reliable markers of cancer presence or therapeutic zzso We recently reported that zzso contain numerous proteins that regulate zzso We now show that zzso of zzso regulators in zzso of animals bearing zzso tumors exceeds significantly their concentration in plasma or serum, as well as their levels in zzso from zzso zzso This process is selective, as zzso do not take up a zzso amount of other plasma proteins zzso zzso even though these may be present at higher zzso We also find that zzso zzso zzso implanted zzso into mice or the minute quantities of zzso zzso by microscopic subcutaneous tumors zzso zzso result in an zzso of zzso levels in zzso without any changes in its plasma zzso The profile of other zzso regulatory proteins zzso zzso growth factor, basic zzso growth zzso zzso by zzso also reflects the presence of tumors in zzso before they can be zzso zzso The ability of zzso to selectively take up zzso regulators in zzso hosts may have implications for the diagnosis and management of many zzso diseases and provide a guide for zzso zzso
