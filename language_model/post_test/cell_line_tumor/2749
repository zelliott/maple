This chapter describes how to design and conduct experiments to deliver zzso to adherent zzso cells in zzso by magnetic zzso zzso using zzso complexes of small interfering zzso zzso and zzso lipids or zzso that are associated with magnetic zzso These magnetic complexes are targeted to the cell surface by the application of a magnetic zzso zzso In this chapter, first we describe the synthesis of magnetic zzso for zzso and the association of zzso with the magnetic components of the zzso zzso Second, a simple protocol is described in order to evaluate magnetic responsiveness of the magnetic zzso zzso complexes and estimate the complex loading with magnetic zzso Third, protocols are provided for the preparation of magnetic zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso of gene zzso and the determination of cell zzso The addition of zzso zzso a zzso zzso to the magnetic zzso zzso improved gene zzso in zzso zzso The described protocols are also valuable for screening zzso compositions and novel magnetic zzso preparations to zzso zzso zzso by zzso in every cell zzso
