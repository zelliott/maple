zzso resistance zzso to zzso drugs is a major obstacle to successful chemotherapy of zzso zzso the molecular basis to zzso is likely to provide better zzso Cell lines resistant to zzso zzso were established from human zzso zzso zzso cell lines zzso Comparative zzso involving zzso gel zzso zzso and zzso were performed on protein extracted from zzso and zzso cell lines to screen drug zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso D zzso and zzso zzso zzso were identified as three proteins showing higher expression in zzso compared to zzso Furthermore, suppression of zzso expression by zzso resulted in decreased zzso in zzso zzso And zzso of zzso could result in increased of drug resistance in zzso cell zzso Taken together, zzso protein and its activity levels were higher in zzso zzso cell lines compared to their parental cell zzso These data clearly linked zzso and zzso resistance zzso zzso could serve as a zzso for chemotherapy sensitivity of zzso
