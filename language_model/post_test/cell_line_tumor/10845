zzso a potent inhibitor of zzso A zzso zzso is known to stimulate zzso cell death and induce cell cycle arrest through zzso of zzso The purpose of this study is to investigate whether zzso would be synergistic with zzso against human zzso cell lung cancer zzso zzso zzso effect was measured by growth zzso of cells and zzso zzso zzso The zzso interaction between zzso and zzso was assessed using the combination zzso zzso on cell cycle distribution and zzso were determined by flow zzso and DNA zzso zzso activity was measured by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined using zzso zzso zzso zzso Factor zzso zzso zzso was measured by zzso A combination of zzso with zzso showed significantly enhanced cell growth zzso compared with zzso alone, which resulted in a synergistic zzso zzso and zzso combination treatment of zzso and zzso cells increased zzso phase arrest, which was associated with zzso of zzso and zzso compared with zzso zzso In addition, zzso combination treatment increased zzso zzso as determined by zzso zzso and flow zzso zzso We also found that combination therapy showed superior zzso zzso activity leading to effectively suppress zzso zzso factor zzso zzso this effect was associated with zzso of zzso These findings suggest that zzso enhances zzso zzso in human zzso cells through zzso of zzso zzso
