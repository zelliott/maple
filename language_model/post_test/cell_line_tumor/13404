A novel 2009 zzso influenza A zzso virus zzso zzso has been transmitted among humans zzso However, the zzso of this virus in human airway zzso cells and zzso is not well zzso 

In this study, we showed that a 2009 A zzso influenza virus strain, zzso isolated from a human patient, caused typical zzso symptoms including weight loss, fluctuations in body temperature, and pulmonary pathological changes in zzso We demonstrated that the human lung zzso zzso cell line zzso was susceptible to infection and that the infected cells underwent zzso at 24 h zzso In contrast to the seasonal zzso influenza virus, the 2009 A zzso influenza virus strain zzso induced more cell death involving zzso zzso in zzso zzso Additionally, zzso infected with the zzso zzso virus strain exhibited increased body temperature, greater weight loss, and higher viral zzso in the zzso zzso the zzso zzso isolate successfully infected the lungs of zzso and caused more pathological zzso than the seasonal influenza zzso Our findings demonstrate that the difference in zzso of the 2009 pandemic zzso influenza virus and the seasonal zzso influenza virus in zzso and in zzso may have been zzso by different zzso 

Our understanding of the zzso of the 2009 A zzso influenza virus infection in both humans and animals is broadened by our findings that zzso cell death is involved in the zzso effect observed in zzso and that the pathological zzso in the lungs of zzso zzso zzso are much more zzso
