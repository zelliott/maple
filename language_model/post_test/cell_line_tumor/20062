The zzso protein zzso was found to be a zzso indicator for the development of zzso zzso zzso expression levels correlate with the formation of human zzso cancer zzso and shorter patients' zzso zzso of zzso expression in patients might therefore result in decreased zzso formation and prolonged zzso In the present study, we used zzso expression plasmids to inhibit zzso expression in the zzso cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso Cell lines with reduced zzso expression showed reduced cell migration and invasion in zzso The zzso of zzso expression also led to significantly diminished formation of liver zzso when zzso transplanted in mice zzso zzso zzso We then focused on the therapeutic potential of zzso applied zzso expression plasmids acting on zzso via repeated zzso tail vein injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso transplanted with zzso cells and treated zzso with zzso zzso showed a decrease of zzso and zzso expression levels, resulting in significantly reduced liver zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso we show for the first time the zzso knock down of zzso via systemic application of zzso zzso DNA, which restricts zzso formation in a zzso mouse model of zzso zzso
