We aimed to induce three different immune cell zzso from a single blood sample from cancer patients to target different biological characters of cancer zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso natural killer zzso cells adhere to zzso By using this ability, we could separate zzso cells, T cells, and zzso cells from peripheral blood zzso zzso The cultured zzso cells demonstrated higher zzso zzso against tumor cell lines than did the T zzso Furthermore, adherent zzso cells demonstrated higher zzso than zzso zzso cells, although there was no difference between adherent and zzso zzso cells in natural zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso With these results, we confirmed that we could induce zzso cell, T cell, and higher zzso zzso cells from a single blood draw, and this methodology zzso to the use of these cells for clinical grade zzso
