zzso is a routine therapy for differentiated zzso zzso zzso zzso can intake zzso after zzso of the human sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso The human zzso reverse zzso zzso promoter, an excellent zzso promoter, has potential value for targeted gene therapy of zzso We used the zzso promoter to drive the expression of the zzso and human zzso zzso zzso gene as a primary step for testing the effects of zzso therapy on zzso zzso The zzso and zzso cells were zzso with two zzso zzso in which the zzso gene had been coupled to the zzso promoter and the zzso gene had been coupled to the zzso promoter, zzso Then, we performed Western zzso zzso intake and zzso zzso and zzso zzso with cancer zzso We also did zzso tumor imaging of nude mice zzso After zzso with zzso and zzso zzso cells showed the zzso intake almost zzso times higher than cells zzso with zzso zzso Western blots revealed bands of approximately 70 zzso and 110 zzso consistent with the zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso approximately zzso of zzso cells were killed, compared to 50% of control cells after incubated with 37 zzso of zzso These results demonstrated that zzso therapy was effective in treating zzso zzso cell lines following induction of zzso zzso intake by the zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes can result in increased intake and longer retention of zzso zzso mice harboring zzso zzso with zzso can take zzso zzso
