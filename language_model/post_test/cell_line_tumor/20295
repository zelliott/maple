Cellular development requires the precise control of gene expression zzso zzso factors are involved in this regulatory process through their zzso binding with zzso Information about zzso factor binding sites can help determine which combinations of factors work together to regulate a zzso but it is unclear how far the binding data from one cell type can inform about regulation in other cell zzso 

By zzso data on zzso zzso factor binding sites in the zzso cell line with expression data across 38 distinct zzso cell types, we developed zzso models to describe the relationship between the expression of target genes and the zzso factors that zzso zzso With zzso binding sites identifying the zzso the proportion of expression explained by the models is statistically significant only for zzso cells zzso zzso which are closely related to zzso That is, cell type specific binding patterns are crucial for choosing the correct zzso factors for the zzso zzso of zzso obtained from binding sites in the zzso cell line with those from zzso shows that the amount of difference between binding patterns is directly related to the quality of the zzso By identifying individual genes whose expression is predicted accurately by the binding sites, we are able to link zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso to a sparsely studied gene zzso We also find that the activity of a zzso factor may be different depending on the cell type and the identity of other zzso zzso 

Our approach shows that gene expression can be explained by a modest number of zzso zzso factors, however, information on zzso specific binding is crucial for understanding zzso gene zzso
