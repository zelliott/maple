The pancreatic cancer remains a fatal disease for the majority of zzso zzso has displayed significant zzso effects against the pancreatic cancer cells, however the underlying mechanisms remain zzso Here, we found that zzso mainly induced zzso death of the pancreatic cancer cells zzso and zzso which was associated with a significant zzso zzso zzso and zzso Further, activated zzso was found to zzso to zzso where it formed a complex with zzso D zzso We provided zzso to support that zzso zzso zzso might be critical for zzso zzso death of pancreatic cancer zzso zzso of zzso by its inhibitor zzso A zzso or by zzso zzso suppressed zzso pancreatic cancer cell zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso also disrupted the zzso complex formation in zzso Meanwhile, the pancreatic cancer cells with zzso zzso were resistant to zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso zzso were zzso to zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso pancreatic cancer cell zzso death was not affected zzso or zzso zzso Together, these data suggested that zzso zzso death requires zzso zzso signaling in pancreatic cancer zzso
