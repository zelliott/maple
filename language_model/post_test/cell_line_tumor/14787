zzso are a protein family that regulates zzso zzso Although zzso is known to be essential for the early zzso zzso its role in the zzso of adult zzso has remained zzso In this study, we used new zzso zzso and small interfering zzso technology to uncover zzso functions of zzso in human zzso zzso in zzso and in adult skin in zzso In primary zzso zzso zzso is essential for the zzso zzso and zzso and it regulates cell zzso and directed migration by guiding formation and maturation of focal zzso zzso and organization of the zzso These functions are linked to the transmission of mechanical cues between cells and their zzso typically in processes wherein zzso differentiate to zzso under mechanical zzso In concert, zzso was shown to be required for the stabilization and maturation of zzso and stress fibers in activated zzso and zzso These findings implicated that in zzso wound closure and tissue repair, the prediction was validated by strong zzso of zzso in zzso zzso during middle stages of wound healing in human zzso Taken together, the data reveal a zzso role for zzso in skin zzso under normal zzso conditions and during tissue zzso
