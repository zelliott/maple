zzso I zzso zzso has been detected in cases of zzso abortion and zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso are growth factors that accelerate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a soluble zzso for zzso and suppresses the function of zzso In order to study the pathological mechanism of zzso zzso we evaluated the effects of zzso zzso on zzso zzso and zzso production from cultured zzso zzso 

The zzso were taken from six zzso zzso and six zzso zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso cells zzso were cultured in zzso zzso After each serum and isolated zzso G zzso were added to the culture zzso the zzso zzso and zzso in the culture medium were measured by zzso 24 h zzso When the isolated zzso was added to culture zzso only the levels of zzso were zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso and isolated zzso significantly suppressed the production of zzso from zzso cells more strongly than the zzso zzso zzso The zzso effects were not changed by serum zzso There was no significant difference in the values of the zzso zzso and the production of zzso and zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso suppress the production of zzso from zzso zzso We suggest that the zzso zzso may suppress zzso production from zzso and cause the failure of zzso formation and zzso
