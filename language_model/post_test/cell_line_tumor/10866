To explore zzso gene expression and its clinical significance in acute zzso 

The expression levels of zzso zzso in 5 leukemia cell lines, 87 patients with acute zzso zzso including 59 acute zzso leukemia zzso 26 acute zzso leukemia zzso and 2 acute hybrid zzso 21 zzso in complete zzso zzso 31 chronic zzso leukemia zzso and 14 normal controls were zzso by zzso 

zzso zzso was detected in zzso cell line, but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso The expression ratio of zzso zzso between zzso zzso and normal control zzso had no statistical difference zzso zzso zzso The expression ratios of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso were significantly lower than that in normal control zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso respectively), zzso also has a lower expression ratio than that of zzso zzso zzso zzso The decreased level of zzso zzso had a positive correlation with zzso factors zzso white blood cell count of zzso or zzso 20 zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

There is zzso expression of zzso gene in zzso zzso gene may play a role in zzso
