The Met zzso zzso zzso is zzso and/or activated in variety of human zzso Previously we have shown that zzso is zzso in Middle Eastern zzso zzso zzso zzso and significantly associated with an aggressive zzso but its role has not been fully zzso in zzso The aim of this study was to determine the functional link between the zzso signaling zzso and death zzso 5 zzso in a large cohort of zzso in a tissue zzso format followed by functional studies using zzso cell lines and nude zzso Our data showed that high expressions of zzso and zzso were significantly associated with an aggressive zzso of zzso and correlated with zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cell lines with zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso inhibited cell proliferation and induced zzso via the zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso zzso treatment or expression of zzso small interfering zzso resulted in zzso of zzso zzso and its downstream zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso treatment zzso zzso expression via generation of zzso oxygen species in zzso cell lines, and zzso zzso death zzso zzso with tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso with zzso and TRAIL caused more pronounced effects on zzso zzso tumor growth in nude zzso Our data suggest that the zzso zzso may be a potential target for therapeutic intervention for treatment of zzso zzso to conventionally therapeutic zzso
