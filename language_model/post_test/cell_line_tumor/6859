zzso zzso has been shown to reduce the activity of zzso zzso accompanied by growth zzso and the differentiation of zzso zzso Here we examine the induction of zzso by zzso in several human zzso cell lines, focusing on the release of zzso c and the zzso of zzso zzso in the human B cell line zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (an acute zzso zzso zzso zzso (a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso many zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was most affected by zzso among zzso zzso therefore, we employed zzso cells in the subsequent zzso The cells showed a zzso increase in DNA damage after zzso zzso zzso zzso A significant increase in the amount of zzso c release was detected after treatment with zzso zzso and zzso protein expressions were not changed by zzso zzso and -9 were activated by incubation with zzso whereas zzso was zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was prevented by a zzso zzso zzso a zzso and a zzso zzso but not by a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso appreciably protected cells from zzso zzso but no effect zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso by zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso strongly zzso the zzso effect of zzso This report shows that the induction of zzso by zzso occurs through a zzso zzso pathway, which zzso activates zzso and zzso
