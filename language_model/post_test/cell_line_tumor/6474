Ginger zzso of zzso zzso has been shown to exert potent zzso properties, but its mode of action has not yet been zzso Among its active constituents, zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso were shown in different in zzso studies to be at least partly responsible for the drug's zzso zzso In an attempt to gain more insight into the mode of action of these compounds, three different in zzso models were used to investigate their effects on zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso in more detail: zzso influx into zzso cells which express zzso zzso zzso zzso of the isolated guinea-pig zzso and equilibrium competition binding studies using a zzso labeled zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All four compounds inhibited the zzso influx through zzso zzso channels as well as zzso of the guinea-pig zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso a highly selective zzso zzso zzso Both effects were zzso with the following order of potency for both models: zzso or zzso or zzso All compounds showed also weak zzso and zzso activities in the guinea-pig zzso zzso and substance P are zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso did not seem to be involved derived from experiments using zzso None of the tested ginger zzso however, was able to zzso zzso from its binding site zzso zzso neither on intact zzso cells nor on the zzso zzso of zzso cells zzso the zzso zzso It may be concluded that zzso zzso zzso and zzso exert their zzso effect at least partly by acting on the zzso zzso zzso complex, probably by binding to a zzso site distinct from the zzso binding zzso This may include indirect effects via receptors in the signal cascade behind the zzso zzso channel complex such as substance P receptors and zzso zzso this needs further investigation since ginger is effective against motion sickness which is cured by some zzso and by zzso such as zzso
