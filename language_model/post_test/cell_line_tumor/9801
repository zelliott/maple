It is thought that small zzso zzso zzso undergo continuous zzso primarily due to their population of zzso stem zzso These stem cells give rise to transit amplifying zzso cells, which can differentiate into all mature cell types required for normal gut zzso Identification of stem cells in zzso is paramount to fully understanding this renewal zzso One major obstacle in gastrointestinal stem cell biology has been the lack of definitive markers that identify small zzso stem cells zzso Here we demonstrate that the novel putative zzso marker zzso and zzso zzso zzso is predominantly expressed in zzso cells in the lower two-thirds of zzso zzso zzso and in occasional zzso zzso cells zzso In contrast, the novel putative stem cell marker zzso zzso zzso zzso is observed in rapidly cycling zzso and in occasional zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, functionally zzso zzso zzso zzso cells retain zzso in a modified label retention zzso Moreover, we demonstrate that zzso is a cell surface expressing zzso zzso cells, isolated from the adult mouse small zzso by zzso activated cell zzso zzso and ultimately form zzso in suspension zzso These zzso formed zzso zzso structures in the zzso of zzso nude mice, which expressed multiple markers of gut zzso zzso Thus, zzso is a marker of zzso zzso and can be distinguished from the cycling zzso zzso Moreover, zzso can be used to isolate normal small zzso stem cells and represents a novel research tool for zzso medicine and cancer zzso
