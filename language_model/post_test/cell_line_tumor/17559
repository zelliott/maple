zzso E zzso is an important protein involved in zzso clearance and cholesterol zzso zzso is abundantly expressed in zzso in the brain and is closely linked to the zzso of Alzheimer's disease zzso We report here that small zzso zzso that activate either liver X receptors zzso or zzso X zzso zzso lead to a dramatic increase in zzso zzso and protein expression as well as zzso of zzso in a human zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso of primary mouse zzso also revealed significant induction of zzso zzso and protein expression and zzso following incubation with zzso zzso Moreover, treatment of mice with a specific synthetic zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso of zzso zzso and protein in both zzso and cerebral cortex, indicating that zzso expression in brain can be zzso by zzso zzso in zzso Along with a dramatic induction of zzso cholesterol zzso zzso these zzso effectively mediate cholesterol zzso in both zzso cells and mouse zzso in the presence or absence of zzso zzso zzso Our studies provide strong evidence that small zzso zzso zzso can effectively mediate zzso synthesis and zzso as well as cholesterol zzso in zzso zzso zzso may have significant impact on the zzso of multiple neurological diseases, including zzso
