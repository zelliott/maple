zzso zzso zzso is a tumor zzso for zzso zzso zzso High rates of zzso knockout mice developed zzso zzso zzso and zzso of several pathways including zzso zzso integration site zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso and signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso are associated with zzso development in zzso knockout zzso We hypothesized that zzso may regulate signal zzso through interacting with other proteins zzso In this report, we identified a zzso target of zzso zzso inhibitor zzso domain containing zzso protein zzso as a zzso protein by using zzso zzso zzso Fluorescence resonance energy transfer zzso demonstrated that the zzso half of zzso interact with the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso of zzso patients had higher expression levels of zzso in the zzso zzso than in zzso zzso especially among zzso patients with zzso B viral infection zzso ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso or patients with poor prognosis zzso hazard ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso In terms of molecular zzso zzso of zzso expression in zzso cells caused zzso and zzso zzso but suppressed zzso zzso of zzso activated zzso and increased survival of zzso zzso zzso of zzso caused zzso of zzso downstream signaling and delayed zzso cell cycle zzso which altogether resulted in cellular zzso Furthermore, zzso reduced proliferation of zzso cells and zzso them to zzso treatment both in zzso and in zzso In conclusion, zzso regulates zzso growth in part through interacting with zzso and modulating zzso signaling zzso Both zzso and zzso are potential targets for developing zzso for zzso
