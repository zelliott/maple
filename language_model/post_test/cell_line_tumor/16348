We tried to explore the intrinsic differences in the optical properties of the four representative zzso cell lines on the models of zzso and zzso by zzso The scattering zzso and zzso were extracted by fitting the average zzso zzso zzso based on the multiple scatter zzso The values of scattering zzso and zzso factors were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso The results showed that the zzso and zzso cell's model could be distinguished zzso which implied that the corresponding types of zzso tissue might be potentially differentiated by zzso
