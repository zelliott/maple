zzso zzso has recently been shown to inhibit various cancer stem zzso Here, we investigated whether Sal could sensitize cancer cells to the effects of zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

Using the zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis, we assessed the ability of Sal to increase DNA zzso We performed a cell proliferation zzso to determine cell zzso cellular zzso increased zzso region, zzso V zzso and zzso zzso to measure the ability of Sal to increase zzso 

Sal increased DNA breakage and zzso levels of zzso and zzso Sal also induced the formation of DNA zzso with zzso and zzso Furthermore, Sal increased the sensitivity of cancer cells to the zzso effects of zzso or zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels were greatly increased after zzso of Sal with zzso or zzso The level of zzso zzso protein was increased by zzso or zzso but decreased by zzso which increased zzso zzso 

This is the first study to report that Sal increases DNA damage, and this effect plays an important role in the increased zzso caused by zzso Overall, we demonstrated that the ability of Sal to sensitize cancer cells to the effects of zzso or zzso is associated with an increase in DNA damage and a decrease in zzso protein zzso zzso These results may contribute to the development of zzso chemotherapy for cancer patients receiving zzso or zzso zzso
