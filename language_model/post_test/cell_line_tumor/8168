Human zzso zzso protein is toxic in human tumor zzso Its interaction with the B alpha zzso of protein zzso 2A zzso is critical for cell zzso however, the effect of zzso binding is not zzso B alpha is one of several zzso zzso regulatory zzso that form zzso zzso with A and C zzso Here we show that zzso protein interacts uniquely with zzso family zzso and that cell killing increases with the level of zzso zzso Evidence suggesting that B zzso zzso activity, measured in zzso against zzso zzso is reduced by zzso binding was zzso and two potential zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were seen to be zzso in zzso following expression of zzso Furthermore, treatment of cells with low levels of the zzso inhibitor zzso acid or zzso of the zzso inhibitor zzso enhanced zzso cell killing and zzso arrest zzso These results suggested that zzso toxicity results from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso an idea that was strengthened by an observed growth arrest resulting from treatment of zzso cells with B zzso zzso zzso We believe that zzso zzso growth arrest resulting in cell death by reducing the global level of zzso zzso activity, thus preventing the zzso of zzso zzso zzso including those involved in cell cycle zzso
