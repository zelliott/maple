zzso aromatic zzso zzso and zzso are ubiquitous environmental pollutants and activate the zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso It has been reported that testosterone zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene in zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the mechanism for the repression of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells, which are zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso family and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in an zzso response zzso zzso reporter zzso in zzso and zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso was abolished by zzso of zzso protein with zzso The protein levels of zzso and zzso nuclear zzso zzso the zzso partner, were not affected by zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso significantly facilitated the complex formation between zzso and zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest that complex formation between activated zzso and zzso plays an important role in the suppression of zzso zzso of zzso family genes by zzso
