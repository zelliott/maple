zzso cancer patients frequently show zzso but it is uncertain whether zzso stimulates pancreatic cancer zzso We have investigated whether excess zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and stimulates zzso metabolism and cell migration in pancreatic cancer zzso We studied zzso zzso zzso pancreatic cancer cells and a zzso zzso zzso zzso that had zzso small interfering zzso zzso cells are known to be zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso whereas zzso cells are devoid of zzso in both zzso and zzso We incubated these cells with different amounts of zzso and determined zzso zzso and protein by real-time zzso chain reaction and western zzso We determined zzso consumption, zzso production and zzso zzso and zzso to assess zzso zzso and determined zzso zzso zzso zzso oxygen species and zzso to assess zzso zzso Further, we studied cell migration using a zzso zzso Excess zzso zzso increased zzso in hypoxic zzso zzso zzso expression increased zzso contents and inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso independent of zzso Excess zzso zzso the migration of zzso and zzso cells in both zzso and zzso Thus, zzso zzso cell migration independent of zzso Nevertheless, hypoxic zzso cells showed greater zzso ability than their zzso zzso We conclude that zzso excess zzso increases zzso and zzso in hypoxic zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso and zzso regulate zzso zzso independent of zzso and zzso zzso stimulates cell migration by mechanisms that are both dependent on zzso and independent of zzso
