Human zzso zzso K zzso is the most intact zzso in the human zzso There are multiple full-length or near full-length zzso zzso in zzso To analyze which zzso zzso give rise to viral transcripts in cancer cell lines and to test whether zzso radiation can alter the levels of zzso zzso zzso studies were undertaken using multiple human cancer cell zzso zzso from several positions in the viral zzso were used and included pairs designed to cross zzso junctions in viral zzso In the absence of zzso radiation, transcripts were detected from multiple zzso zzso in cell lines from human zzso zzso head and neck, or breast zzso and the zzso from which the transcripts originated varied among the different zzso Only one of 13 cell lines tested zzso cancer line zzso failed to show zzso zzso zzso zzso detected included viral zzso spliced as expected at the conventional viral zzso sites, plus several alternatively spliced zzso zzso spliced transcripts arose from specific zzso and were detected in most of the cell lines zzso zzso zzso was performed to assess the effects of zzso zzso These analyses showed that zzso transcripts were elevated in four of twelve lines tested, specifically all three prostate cancer lines used and one breast cancer zzso The increases were zzso zzso at 24 hours following a single dose of zzso that ranged from zzso to 20 zzso and returning to baseline levels by 72 zzso In zzso these studies showed that zzso radiation can affect the levels of zzso transcripts in cells, and these effects vary among different zzso The changes in zzso transcript levels might affect multiple biological processes in cells, and future studies of the effects of zzso radiation on zzso are worth zzso
