The biological activities of the zzso have attracted more and more attention in the zzso and medical areas due to their zzso zzso To estimate the zzso mechanism of zzso a novel zzso from the zzso zzso zzso the zzso effects of the zzso on the human zzso zzso cells zzso zzso were zzso The present studies showed that zzso could induce cell zzso which was closely accompanied with an increase of zzso calcium concentration zzso the enhancement of zzso oxygen species zzso level, dissipation of zzso membrane potential zzso zzso of zzso zzso increase expression of zzso zzso and decrease expression of zzso zzso These results suggested that cell zzso induced by zzso mainly was zzso by zzso zzso not involved death receptors zzso zzso The mechanism possibly is that zzso acts on zzso and boosts zzso zzso mediates a release of zzso from the zzso zzso pool, increasing zzso targets the cells a start-up of the zzso zzso However, further research on the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso on the zzso zzso is zzso
