There are currently no large animal models to study the biology of leukemia and development of novel zzso zzso We have previously shown that dogs transplanted with zzso B4 zzso zzso zzso cells developed zzso leukemia associated with zzso zzso Here we describe the transmission, zzso and expansion of these canine leukemia cells into two genetically zzso zzso zzso 

Two dogs zzso after major zzso zzso zzso cell transplantation and exhibiting mixed zzso zzso were accidentally infused trace amounts of zzso leukemia cells from a third-party zzso 

Six weeks after infusion of zzso leukemia cells, these two dogs rapidly developed zzso leukemia consisting of zzso and organ zzso circulating zzso and, in one dog, zzso zzso Despite neither of these dogs sharing any dog zzso zzso zzso with the zzso case, the zzso clones zzso and proliferated without difficulty in the presence of zzso zzso studies in both dogs confirmed that donor and, in one case, host zzso cell zzso was lost and replaced by third-party zzso zzso 

The zzso and expansion of these leukemia cells in dogs will allow studies into the biology of leukemia and development and evaluation of novel zzso therapies in a clinically relevant large animal zzso
