zzso zzso zzso has shown potential as a therapeutic agent in various zzso Previously, we found that zzso cell leukemia sequence 1 zzso was zzso in zzso cell cycle arrest in zzso human leukemia zzso Here, we investigated the role of this protein in zzso zzso cell cycle arrest in zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso treatment significantly increased the proportion of zzso phase zzso cells ( zzso and caused a zzso significant zzso of zzso and the cell zzso proteins zzso and zzso ( zzso Small interfering zzso zzso of zzso expression in zzso cells arrested the cell cycle in zzso zzso By zzso we demonstrated that zzso associated with zzso and zzso in zzso cell cycle arrest in zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased the interaction of zzso with zzso and zzso leading to zzso cell cycle arrest in zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso cell cycle arrest in zzso human leukemia zzso
