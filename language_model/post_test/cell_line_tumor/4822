To investigate the mechanism of the resistance to zzso zzso we established the zzso cell line, zzso from zzso oral zzso cell line, zzso The zzso zzso 2, zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso is zzso more resistant to zzso than zzso zzso analysis indicated that the expression levels of zzso genes were elevated at least zzso or more in zzso compared with zzso The expression status of zzso binding cassette (ABC) zzso zzso which belong to zzso resistance zzso was confirmed by zzso reverse zzso chain reaction and real-time zzso zzso and zzso were zzso whereas zzso was zzso zzso and zzso analysis using the zzso zzso Analysis tool indicated three highly significant genetic networks including 105 of the zzso zzso genes and one network including 35 zzso signaling and zzso related zzso Our results suggested that these cell lines, zzso and zzso may be useful for searching the candidate genes responsible for zzso and for further study to understand the mechanism of zzso
