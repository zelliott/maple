We have screened 22 zzso zzso cell lines and one normal zzso cell line for zzso copy number changes using array comparative zzso zzso zzso zzso of array zzso with existing zzso in zzso zzso zzso results revealed excellent zzso zzso of gain and loss were defined more accurately by array zzso and several small regions of deletion were detected that were not identified by zzso Numerous genetic changes were identified, many of which were compatible with previous results from conventional zzso and loss of zzso analyses on zzso zzso The most frequent changes involved complete or partial loss of zzso zzso and gain of zzso zzso Other frequent losses were of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have refined the zzso of a region of deletion at zzso to an zzso of approximately 1 zzso Five zzso deletions of zzso zzso genes were confirmed, and several potentially novel zzso deletions were zzso In all, 15 high-level zzso were zzso with a previously reported amplification at zzso being the most zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed a novel candidate gene with consistent zzso in all cell lines with the zzso zzso
