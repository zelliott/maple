Multiple myeloma zzso is a zzso of zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso stimulate bone zzso and zzso resulting in zzso zzso in the skeleton which persist upon successful treatment of the zzso with zzso We found that an interaction between zzso cells and zzso stem cells zzso from bone zzso zzso results in the formation and persistence of zzso bone zzso It is known that zzso cells activate zzso activity and zzso high levels of the zzso zzso zzso which prevents zzso from zzso into zzso We show that the zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso releases zzso from the zzso effects of zzso whereas zzso treatment does zzso Additionally, we show that the zzso fraction of zzso medium promotes the proliferation of zzso zzso cells and that an zzso zzso zzso blocks this zzso zzso expression levels were higher in zzso zzso than in zzso treated with zzso zzso remained high in the presence of zzso and were reduced by zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment reduces the zzso proliferation of zzso cells and may enable zzso to repair existing zzso zzso
