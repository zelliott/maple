zzso derivatives are powerful zzso drugs because of their ability to trap zzso I zzso zzso zzso However, they exhibit clinical limitations due to the instability of their zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, they exhibit bone zzso and zzso zzso especially in adults, and are drug zzso zzso Here, we report a novel zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso and its zzso induce zzso zzso at similar, as well as unique zzso positions, compared with zzso The compound also zzso zzso DNA breaks and zzso zzso complexes that persist longer after compound removal than zzso zzso and persistent zzso formation was readily observed in cells treated with zzso and was present in greater than 50% of the cell population following 24 hours compound zzso The compound shows partial zzso in cell lines resistant to zzso These cell lines include the human prostate zzso and the zzso zzso zzso Limited zzso to zzso was also found in the zzso zzso colon cancer zzso and breast cancer zzso cell lines and in human zzso cells zzso that zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso cassette family of cell surface transport proteins known to zzso zzso Together, our results provide the first molecular and cellular characterization of zzso and its clinically relevant zzso
