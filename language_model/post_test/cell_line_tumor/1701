Current regimens for induction therapy of pediatric acute zzso leukemia zzso or for zzso post zzso use a combination of zzso zzso a zzso and zzso zzso with or without an zzso With cure rates now approximately zzso robust zzso models are necessary to prioritize active new drugs for clinical trials in zzso patients, and the ability of these models to predict zzso with established therapy is an essential zzso In this study, we report zzso of an zzso regimen by combining zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso against ALL zzso models established from patient zzso in zzso zzso We demonstrate that the zzso combination was synergistic in zzso against leukemia cell lines as well as in zzso against ALL zzso In zzso zzso treatment caused delays in progression of individual zzso ranging from 22 to zzso zzso The median progression delay of zzso derived from long-term surviving patients was zzso greater than that of zzso derived from patients who died of their zzso zzso analysis revealed that systemic zzso exposure in mice increased zzso when administered in combination with VCR and zzso consistent with clinical findings, which may contribute to the observed zzso between the 3 zzso Finally, as zzso we tested the in zzso efficacy of combining zzso with either the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso to provide evidence of a robust in zzso platform to prioritize new drugs for clinical trials in children with zzso zzso
