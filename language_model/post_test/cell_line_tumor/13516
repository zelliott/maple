zzso zzso resistance is a major obstacle in the treatment of patients with zzso breast zzso We recently reported that the zzso factor zzso binding zzso zzso leads to acquisition of resistance to zzso in a zzso manner that relies on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To explore how this may occur we compared zzso target genes between zzso cells zzso and those with acquired resistance zzso and zzso using zzso zzso zzso sequencing zzso which identified zzso genes uniquely bound by zzso in the resistant cell zzso We then examined differences in protein expression and zzso between these cell lines using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso these two data sets identified the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso family as potentially being involved in acquired resistance downstream from zzso zzso and zzso were subsequently shown to be zzso in the resistant cell zzso however, only the former was a zzso target based on zzso and small interfering zzso zzso zzso zzso loss of zzso expression using zzso enhanced sensitivity to zzso Further, zzso zzso was sufficient to zzso resistance to zzso in cells that were previously zzso We then developed a de zzso model of acquired resistance by exposing zzso cells to zzso for 60 days zzso Similar to the zzso cells, the zzso cells had elevated zzso levels and were dependent on it for zzso In addition, we demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso and that this zzso was required for ability of zzso to mediate resistance to zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso with the small zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, this unbiased integrated approach identified zzso as a player in zzso zzso resistance as a consequence of zzso zzso and demonstrated zzso zzso as a means to overcome zzso to zzso
