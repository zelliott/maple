Recent findings in cell death zzso show that membrane type 1 zzso zzso zzso an zzso known for its involvement in cancer cell invasion and zzso can act as a zzso in the invasion versus cell death decision in brain zzso zzso Given that the zzso zzso zzso is a zzso compartment involved in zzso control and cell death zzso and that zzso zzso as encountered during cancer cell invasion, can lead to zzso stress, we questioned whether zzso contributes to zzso zzso We found that zzso gene zzso or pharmacological zzso of zzso trafficking with zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso also known to trigger the expression of zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso from the plasma zzso failed to do so when zzso was prevented from reaching the cell surface by zzso Gene zzso of zzso antagonized the expression of zzso zzso and of the zzso stress marker zzso protein 78 zzso further suggesting that plasma membrane zzso of zzso contributes to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which partially occurs during its trafficking from the zzso to the plasma zzso showed correlation of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso Finally, zzso treatment of zzso cells led to zzso zzso this effect was reversed when zzso was zzso zzso our results provide a molecular rationale for a new role for zzso in the regulation of cancer cell death processes through zzso stress zzso
