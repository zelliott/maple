The zzso zzso zzso zzso Gene 4 zzso is a zzso protein that is zzso in prostate cancer zzso especially in precursor zzso that result from inflammatory zzso In cells under stress, zzso of zzso to zzso increases while production of zzso oxygen species zzso Furthermore, zzso is also zzso in human fetal zzso zzso its potential role in zzso However, the proteins that interact with zzso and the mechanisms underlying its zzso functions in zzso development and disease remain zzso Here, we identified zzso as a zzso interacting zzso We show that both zzso and zzso are zzso in the human fetal zzso and in zzso zzso zzso robustly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance energy transfer experiments indicate that upon binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, no interaction is observed in presence of zzso or zzso zzso containing the zzso inner membrane zzso zzso marker zzso Together, our data indicate that zzso specifically interacts with zzso and that, zzso dynamics may account for its observed zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating zzso between a zzso and a zzso zzso zzso interactions using small molecules may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for zzso
