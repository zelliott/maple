zzso was first discovered as a zzso of zzso expression in zzso It is present in brain, adult liver, zzso and zzso zzso Recently, it has been reported that zzso regulates zzso differentiation and interacts with zzso in regulation of its zzso Using the zzso zzso system, we searched for zzso interactions to uncover new functions for zzso We present here experimental evidence that zzso is a new regulatory factor for zzso signal zzso through its interaction with zzso zzso was thus identified as an zzso zzso In zzso experiments, the full-length zzso was found to form complexes with zzso in zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso was found to have no influence on zzso signaling induced by zzso zzso but it did zzso enhance zzso zzso of activated zzso In conclusion, zzso can suppress the zzso cellular response by acting together with zzso
