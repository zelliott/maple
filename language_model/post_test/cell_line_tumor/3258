The majority of patients who succumb to cancer die from zzso disease progression rather than from the primary zzso zzso of the mechanisms underlying zzso zzso is essential to the development of effective zzso The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso is frequently activated in human tumors and has been shown to regulate genes involved in zzso migration, and zzso Studies with zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso cells showed that these cells are highly zzso but have a limited zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells from the zzso zzso causes disruption of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Several zzso breast zzso cell lines have been shown to be resistant to cell death following zzso zzso This zzso zzso can be modeled by zzso the zzso zzso protein in zzso This suggests that mechanisms that regulate survival of zzso tumor cells may enhance zzso zzso zzso we examined whether expression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells could provide a survival advantage and promote zzso zzso of zzso in parental zzso zzso zzso cells or zzso cells was insufficient to induce increased migration, invasion, or tumor zzso However, zzso expression markedly enhanced spontaneous lung zzso from zzso implanted primary zzso These results clearly show that mechanisms that regulate primary tumor development are distinct from those that promote zzso and that zzso designed to isolate genes involved in transformation may fail to identify genes that are critical regulators of zzso
