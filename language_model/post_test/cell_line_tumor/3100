zzso zzso expression that occurs during prostate cancer zzso progression zzso with poor prognosis and aggressive zzso This has been attributed to the ability to regulate zzso zzso zzso We have shown previously that the zzso milieu regulates the expression of the zzso zzso and zzso with severe consequences for zzso cell proliferation and zzso zzso zzso zzso To determine the extent of zzso dependency of zzso zzso we designed a zzso zzso selection, extension, and zzso zzso profiling array that zzso the expression of 186 zzso Using this zzso we demonstrated zzso control over approximately zzso of zzso genes in zzso zzso For a subset of 15 functionally diverse zzso zzso regulation was confirmed using real-time zzso and zzso The extent, dose dependency, and zzso by which zzso affect zzso expression differed widely, indicating diverse molecular mechanisms underlying these zzso Moreover, differences in zzso expression were observed between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Small interfering zzso changes in zzso expression had profound effects on cell zzso which were most pronounced in zzso zzso Taken together, our integrated approach combining expression zzso characterization of zzso zzso zzso and validation of the importance of altered zzso expression for cell proliferation identified several potential novel therapeutic targets for zzso zzso
