The zzso zzso which is expressed by zzso zzso and some tumor cells, is an attractive target for the development of both imaging agents and zzso While optimal zzso of zzso zzso will require a zzso identification of the presence of the target, the clinical evaluation of these compounds has typically not included parallel studies with zzso zzso This is at least partly due to the relatively limited availability of PET zzso in comparison to those labeled with zzso In an effort to begin to address this zzso we evaluated the tumor zzso of zzso a zzso zzso zzso that binds to zzso with zzso zzso in an zzso tumor model as well as its in zzso zzso 

zzso imaging was used to assess the ability of zzso a therapeutic with high affinity for zzso to block and zzso zzso in an zzso zzso zzso zzso The specificity of zzso was zzso evaluated in mice bearing subcutaneous zzso tumors, by comparison of the zzso of zzso with that of the zzso structural analogue zzso and by blocking zzso of zzso with excess zzso zzso 

zzso imaging studies demonstrated that zzso of zzso in the zzso tumor model was both blocked and displaced by the zzso therapeutic zzso zzso studies provided quantitative confirmation of these imaging zzso zzso zzso of zzso at zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso the mice with excess zzso zzso reduced tumor zzso by approximately zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These results confirm that zzso does, in fact, target the zzso zzso and may, therefore, be useful in identifying patients prior to zzso therapy as well as monitoring the response of these patients to zzso
