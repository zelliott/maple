Signaling through zzso has emerged as an important regulator of tissue zzso in the gastrointestinal zzso but the mechanism is not zzso Type 2 zzso protein zzso zzso is a major zzso zzso in the gut zzso and the present studies have tested its importance in the regulation of proliferation and differentiation in the mouse colon and in colon cancer cell zzso zzso zzso was examined in the zzso colon of zzso mice using zzso markers of proliferation and zzso The effect of zzso zzso on proliferation and differentiation was tested in zzso using zzso colon cancer cell zzso zzso and zzso reporter zzso were used to determine the importance of zzso downstream of zzso The zzso of zzso mice exhibited zzso zzso increased zzso zzso and reduced numbers of differentiated zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to inhibit proliferation and induce zzso and zzso expression in colon cancer cells, but did not significantly affect cell zzso zzso reduced zzso levels and zzso suggesting possible involvement of this zzso downstream of zzso in the zzso The work presented here demonstrates a novel zzso and zzso role for zzso in the zzso These zzso functions of zzso were zzso in colon cancer cells lines where zzso of zzso is a possible zzso The similarities in zzso between zzso and zzso knockout mice positions zzso as a likely zzso of the zzso effects of zzso signaling in the zzso
