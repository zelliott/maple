The differentiation capability of zzso zzso zzso was studied using zzso and zzso zzso 

Cell cycle was analyzed by zzso zzso using flow zzso zzso was measured by zzso double zzso using flow zzso zzso was observed by zzso criteria, zzso zzso and expression of cell surface markers zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at short treatment times (up to 24 zzso showed significant zzso activities among both cell zzso However, longer treatment times (up to 72 zzso were required to trigger zzso zzso analyses of the zzso cells indicated an increase in zzso population by 48 h followed by the appearance of a zzso peak after 72 h of zzso The effects of zzso on zzso and zzso cells were accompanied with differentiation toward zzso zzso This was evidenced by a sharp increase in the extent of zzso and zzso expression after 24 h of exposure to zzso The viability of both cell types did not significantly change during the first 24 zzso However, at longer treatment times zzso zzso dramatic decreases in both the extent of zzso expression and the cell zzso were zzso zzso measurement of zzso and zzso expression in zzso zzso cells indicated that cells with lower zzso content underwent more zzso 

These finding may pave the way for further pharmaceutical evaluation of zzso as a suitable zzso agent for acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso
