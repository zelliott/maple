zzso zzso cell zzso zzso is one of the most common forms of cancer associated with the presence of zzso oral zzso Given the poor prognosis associated with oral zzso and the difficulties in distinguishing it from cancer zzso there is an urgent need to zzso the molecular zzso and critical signal pathways underlying the zzso transformation of zzso to zzso zzso and thus to identify novel diagnostic and therapeutic zzso 

We have zzso two zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso to identify proteins zzso expressed in six pairs of oral zzso zzso with zzso and oral zzso cancer zzso each pair was collected from a single zzso zzso 85 zzso and constantly expressed proteins zzso zzso change, P zzso zzso were identified, including 52 zzso and 33 zzso Gene zzso methods were employed to identify the biological processes that were zzso in this zzso zzso Biological networks were also constructed to reveal the potential links between those protein zzso Among them, three zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso b and g were shown to have zzso zzso levels in zzso cells relative to oral zzso 

zzso levels of zzso expressed proteins were possibly involved in the zzso transformation of oral zzso Their expression levels, zzso and interaction networks were analyzed using a zzso zzso This study shows that the three zzso of zzso may play an important role in zzso transformation and is an example of a systematic biology study, in which functional zzso were constructed to help to zzso zzso aspects and potential involvement of zzso Our results provide new insights into the zzso of oral zzso These zzso expressed proteins may have utility as useful candidate markers of zzso
