Electric field stimulation has become one of the most promising therapies for a variety of neurological zzso However, the safety and effectiveness of the zzso are critical in determining the zzso Because there are few safe and effective in zzso and/or in zzso zzso devices, we demonstrate a method that allows for zzso electric field stimulation with a specific strength that is able to control zzso interaction in zzso zzso a form of zzso and zzso zzso zzso was used to create a zzso in zzso zzso film zzso A transient zzso electric field was produced by zzso zzso stimuli through the zzso film zzso and applied to cultured neural zzso We found that weak electric field stimulation zzso duration of 10 zzso as low as zzso zzso for 32 zzso was particularly effective in shaping zzso zzso Under weak electric field zzso we observed a significant increase in the number of cells forming new zzso zzso and in the number of cells strengthening existing zzso zzso The underlying mechanism of the altered cellular interactions may be related to an altered regulation of the zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso In conclusion, this technique may open a new therapeutic approach for zzso zzso zzso in cell transplantation therapy in the central nervous zzso
