The zzso zzso inhibitor zzso a critical regulator of the cell cycle, is mainly regulated by zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso Restoration of zzso expression in zzso zzso cells suppress zzso zzso zzso A zzso affects proliferation and survival of cultured zzso zzso cells and zzso growth of experimental zzso zzso induced zzso expression de zzso in human zzso cells with zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso of zzso expression correlated with induction of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso reduced zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso containing zzso was sufficient to activate the truncated zzso zzso zzso promoter, which does not contain zzso binding zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso is bound to the zzso part of zzso promoter in zzso zzso zzso It suggests that zzso activates zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso signaling zzso
