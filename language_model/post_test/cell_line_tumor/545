Adult zzso zzso zzso is a zzso tumor caused by zzso human zzso virus 1 zzso zzso We previously identified a common zzso cluster region at zzso in zzso zzso by spectral zzso Single zzso zzso array comparative zzso zzso analysis of the zzso region in three zzso cell lines and four patient samples revealed that the zzso zzso are localized within the zzso of zzso 1 zzso gene locus in an zzso cell line zzso and in one patient with zzso zzso zzso is a human zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso gene of zzso zzso expression of the zzso group gene family has been linked to the loss of normal gene zzso zzso which can contribute to the loss of cell identity and zzso transformation in many kinds of zzso In the case of the zzso cell line, which carried a zzso zzso zzso was fused with the additional sex zzso 2 zzso gene at zzso zzso In the case with an zzso zzso who carried a zzso zzso a putative truncated zzso gene zzso was zzso zzso of zzso enhanced cell growth in zzso cells, and a zzso fusion protein showed high zzso zzso Although a zzso fusion protein did not activate transcription, zzso of zzso accelerated cell growth in leukemia cells, suggesting that the zzso structural abnormalities in the zzso cell line and in the patient with zzso zzso may contribute to zzso
