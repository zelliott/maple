The tumor zzso zzso Cell Death 4 zzso has been found to be zzso in several zzso and associated with disease progression and zzso There are no current studies characterizing zzso expression and its clinical relevance in zzso zzso Cell Carcinoma zzso Since zzso zzso is a major zzso factor in zzso we focused on determining whether zzso zzso was associated with patient zzso status and had functional relevance in zzso zzso We also examined zzso regulation by zzso 21 zzso in zzso 

zzso zzso expression levels were assessed in 50 zzso and 25 normal oral zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso zzso with significantly reduced zzso levels in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and marginally associated with zzso tumor stage zzso zzso zzso zzso protein expression was zzso by zzso zzso in zzso zzso and adjacent normal zzso zzso protein was zzso in zzso zzso zzso and marginally associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso invasion zzso showed that zzso expression suppressed invasion, and zzso zzso loss was associated with increased invasive potential of oral zzso zzso Furthermore, we showed that zzso levels were increased in zzso tumors, and that zzso expression may be zzso in zzso by direct binding of zzso to the zzso zzso zzso 

Our data show an association between the loss of zzso zzso zzso and invasion in zzso and also identify a mechanism of zzso zzso by zzso in oral zzso zzso association with zzso zzso and invasion suggests that zzso may be a clinically relevant zzso with zzso value in zzso
