zzso syndrome zzso is a zzso condition that frequently develops into overt acute zzso leukemia zzso The zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso zzso In this cell line, zzso zzso by small interfering zzso specific for zzso or chemical zzso including zzso resulted in the zzso of zzso zzso target genes and subsequent cell death accompanied by loss of zzso zzso potential as well as by the zzso release of the zzso zzso zzso c and the zzso death zzso zzso G and zzso factor zzso Bone zzso cells from high-risk zzso patients also exhibited zzso zzso zzso similar to bone zzso samples from zzso zzso zzso zzso stem cells zzso and immature zzso cells zzso from high-risk zzso patients demonstrated the nuclear zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The frequency of cells with nuclear zzso correlated with blast counts, zzso suppression, and disease zzso zzso zzso was confined to those cells that carried zzso zzso zzso Since zzso zzso induced rapid zzso of bone zzso cells from high-risk zzso patients, we zzso that zzso zzso is responsible for the progressive suppression of zzso affecting zzso zzso cells and thus contributes to zzso zzso zzso zzso may constitute a novel therapeutic strategy if zzso induction of zzso stem cells is the zzso
