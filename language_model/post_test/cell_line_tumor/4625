The therapeutic zzso zzso induced the expression of the zzso and zzso zzso in the human zzso line zzso following binding to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso was specific, was observed in several cell lines and freshly isolated zzso samples and also took place at the protein level in zzso and in zzso To investigate the role of these zzso in the mechanism of action of zzso we zzso a zzso truncated zzso zzso zzso which had zzso activity on zzso zzso by either zzso or zzso zzso We also set up an established zzso zzso tumor model in zzso zzso zzso given weekly after tumors had reached 250 zzso led to complete disappearance of the zzso within 2-3 zzso Treatment of mice with zzso zzso factor showed that complement was required for zzso therapeutic zzso Treatment of zzso tumor bearing mice every 2 days with the zzso zzso starting 1 zzso before zzso treatment, had no effect on tumor growth by itself, but completely inhibited the therapeutic activity of the zzso To determine whether zzso acts through zzso of immune cells, we specifically depleted zzso cells, zzso cells, and zzso using zzso zzso treatment, or zzso zzso The data demonstrated that these different cell populations are involved in zzso tumor zzso We propose that zzso rapidly activates complement and zzso zzso in zzso which in turn activate the innate immunity network required for efficient zzso of the bulky zzso zzso
