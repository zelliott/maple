zzso receptors zzso are seven zzso zzso receptors zzso four genes zzso approximately zzso zzso cell has been identified to be able to express zzso and release an array of zzso upon zzso Recently, it was reported that zzso zzso could regulate the expression of zzso in mast cells, and zzso could induce zzso and zzso release from mast zzso In order to further investigate the issues, zzso interference zzso technique was employed and small interfering zzso zzso of zzso were zzso in zzso zzso 

The results showed that zzso for zzso zzso and zzso significantly zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and proteins in zzso cells at 24, 48 and 72 h following zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso induced zzso of zzso and zzso zzso respectively when zzso cells were zzso with them for 48 zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso induced zzso of zzso expression on both zzso and protein zzso It was also observed that zzso zzso and zzso zzso reduced zzso induced zzso release by approximately zzso and zzso and zzso induced zzso release by zzso and zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso eliminated zzso zzso release by zzso and zzso zzso diminished zzso induced zzso release by zzso However, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso at 10 zzso did not show any effect on zzso zzso release from zzso zzso 

In conclusion, zzso of zzso can zzso zzso expression and zzso related zzso production in mast cells, confirming that zzso are likely to play a role in allergic zzso
