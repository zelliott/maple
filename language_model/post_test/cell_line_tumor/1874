zzso zzso represent one of the most zzso groups of zzso reducing the risk of colon zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso zzso a zzso analog effective at lower doses compared to its parent compound, triggers the death zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso via zzso of the zzso zzso would be an ideal therapeutic strategy to eliminate cancer zzso In this study, we investigated the possibility that colon cancer cells are zzso to zzso zzso zzso by zzso acid zzso via zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Our data demonstrated that zzso combination zzso colon cancer cells to zzso zzso zzso leading to enhanced growth suppression of human colon cancer zzso The combination effect was primarily attributed to increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso with zzso zzso zzso or stable expression of dominant negative zzso genes blocked zzso zzso zzso zzso In view of the finding that zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso we propose that zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso plus zzso is zzso via zzso Our findings collectively support the utility of a combination of zzso zzso and zzso in the effective prevention and treatment of colon zzso
