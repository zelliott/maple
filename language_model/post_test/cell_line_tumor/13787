The zzso of zzso factor zzso zzso is a common finding in zzso zzso zzso and it leads to zzso and poor zzso zzso a zzso zzso has shown significant improvement in survival in patients with advanced zzso in clinical zzso However, the mechanisms that account for the zzso efficiency of zzso have not been fully zzso The present study aims to explore the effect of zzso on zzso expression and zzso in zzso cells and zzso 

zzso cells and zzso were treated with zzso or zzso Western zzso and quantitative zzso array were used to determine protein and zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, de zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso were determined using zzso zzso 

zzso dose zzso decreased the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Further analysis revealed that such reduction of zzso was associated with the zzso of zzso protein synthesis rather than the promotion of zzso protein degradation or the reduction of zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were significantly suppressed by zzso In zzso studies further confirmed the zzso effect of zzso on the expression of zzso and zzso zzso leading to a decrease in tumor zzso and growth of the zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso synthesis is associated with previously undefined pathways in which zzso and zzso zzso are zzso Our zzso data expand our understanding of zzso zzso mechanism of action by zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso
