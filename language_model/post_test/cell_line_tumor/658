zzso against zzso affinity for the targeted zzso and the ability to recruit zzso H are zzso for zzso zzso zzso applications where gene expression zzso is zzso Typically zzso zzso zzso designs are used with a central continuous stretch of zzso H recruiting zzso zzso zzso zzso flanked by affinity and zzso modified zzso However, many types of zzso modifications in the central DNA gap can disturb zzso H zzso Here we present studies into two different types of zzso zzso a flexible zzso zzso analog named unlocked zzso acid zzso and zzso in the gap of an zzso zzso zzso zzso flanked zzso We compared the efficacy of zzso degradation by the gap modified zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and cultured zzso This study shows that both zzso and zzso gap insertions are compatible with zzso H activity when used zzso However, multiple zzso modifications are better tolerated by zzso H than multiple zzso modifications in the zzso Furthermore, this report shows that zzso zzso zzso with multiple zzso zzso in the gap can mediate target zzso in zzso
