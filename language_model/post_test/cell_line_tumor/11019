zzso zzso is widely used in chemotherapy of zzso zzso breast zzso It zzso proliferation and zzso zzso of breast cancer cells by zzso zzso zzso of gene zzso but recent reports have shown that zzso (especially at pharmacological zzso has also rapid zzso zzso Here we studied the mechanisms by which zzso exerts rapid effects on breast cancer cell zzso In zzso medium zzso zzso zzso induced death of zzso and zzso cells in a zzso manner in less than 60 zzso This was associated with release of zzso zzso zzso a decrease of zzso membrane potential and an increase in production of zzso oxygen species zzso This suggests that disruption of zzso function has a primary role in the acute death response of the zzso zzso zzso acid, an inhibitor of zzso zzso transition, was able to protect zzso cells against zzso Rapid cell death induction by zzso was not associated with immediate zzso of zzso or zzso of zzso zzso zzso It was not blocked by the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso was able to prevent zzso cell death but not zzso c release, which suggests that zzso act zzso to zzso zzso The pure zzso zzso zzso (1 zzso could partly oppose the effect of zzso in zzso zzso positive zzso cells, but not in zzso zzso negative zzso zzso zzso zzso cells in the absence of zzso zzso or in the presence of a low zzso concentration (1 zzso made the cells even more susceptible to rapid death induction by 5 or 7 zzso zzso This effect was associated with decreased levels of the zzso proteins zzso and zzso In conclusion, our results demonstrate induction of a rapid zzso cell death program in breast cancer cells at pharmacological zzso of zzso which are achievable in tumor tissue of zzso breast cancer zzso These mechanisms may contribute to the ability of zzso therapy to induce death of breast cancer zzso
