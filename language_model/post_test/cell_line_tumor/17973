zzso zzso is a marine zzso zzso with a wide variety of biological activities including zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we tested the hypothesis that zzso may suppress zzso cell transformation by zzso the zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso in mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results provided the first evidence that zzso from zzso zzso exerted a potent zzso effect on zzso zzso of zzso zzso with its zzso action on zzso of zzso zzso clearly suppressed the zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso Moreover, zzso the zzso and zzso zzso activities were inhibited by zzso resulting to suppressing of zzso zzso zzso activity and cell transformation induced by zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso might exert zzso effects through the zzso of zzso of the zzso
