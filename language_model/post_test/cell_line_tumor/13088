zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso which regulates gene expression as part of the zzso zzso repressive zzso It functions as a scaffold upon which proteins with zzso activity dock, including zzso zzso zzso zzso Although regulation of zzso by zzso has been studied in detail, little is understood about the function of zzso in cancer zzso We previously showed that zzso is expressed in breast cancer cells and is a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso Here, we expand our previous studies to zzso the function of zzso in the control of gene expression and growth of breast cancer zzso 

Analysis of gene expression following zzso of zzso revealed changes in both zzso and regulated gene zzso Genes of known importance in breast cancer and zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were among those identified as zzso The mechanism of zzso action varied among genes and was found to be zzso through both zzso zzso and zzso zzso Loss of zzso inhibited breast cancer cell growth by increasing zzso without affecting cell cycle zzso Analysis of both zzso and zzso cell lines revealed that the effects of zzso on growth were zzso specific, as zzso expression promoted maximum growth of only the zzso cells, and, notably, zzso protein itself was increased by zzso Further gene expression experiments revealed that zzso zzso expression of key zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso but not zzso cell lines, which could provide a zzso explanation for zzso differences in zzso 

This study identifies zzso as a regulator of gene zzso survival, and growth in zzso breast cancer zzso zzso regulates the zzso of genes involved in breast cancer and zzso and acts through multiple mechanisms not limited to zzso zzso zzso These findings reveal previously zzso functions of zzso in breast cancer and provide evidence for an important role of this zzso zzso in zzso tumor cell zzso
