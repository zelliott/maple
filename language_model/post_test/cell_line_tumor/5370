Among zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the group X zzso has the most potent zzso capacity toward zzso the major zzso of cell membrane and zzso This zzso has recently been implicated in chronic inflammatory diseases such as zzso and asthma and may also play a role in colon zzso We show here that group X zzso zzso zzso is one of the most highly expressed zzso in the mouse colon and that zzso mouse and human zzso stimulate proliferation and zzso protein zzso zzso of various colon cell lines, including zzso cancer zzso Among various zzso zzso zzso is the most potent zzso to stimulate cell zzso Based on the use of zzso zzso zzso site zzso and small interfering zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso promotes cell proliferation independently of the zzso and via its intrinsic zzso activity and production of free zzso acid and zzso which are zzso by zzso zzso can also elicit the production of large amounts of zzso zzso and other zzso from zzso cells, but these zzso zzso do not play a role in zzso cell proliferation because zzso of zzso and zzso do not prevent zzso zzso zzso Together, our results indicate that group X zzso may play an important role in colon zzso by promoting cancer cell proliferation and releasing various zzso zzso involved in other key events in cancer zzso
