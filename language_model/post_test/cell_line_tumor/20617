zzso of how cell death mechanisms associated with Parkinson's disease zzso interact and whether they zzso would help identify targets for zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to use a cellular model to address these zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were exposed to a range of compounds zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that are zzso when applied to these cells for extended periods of times at specific zzso At the zzso used, these compounds cause cellular stress via mechanisms that mimic those associated with causing zzso in zzso namely zzso stress zzso zzso dysfunction zzso zzso dysfunction zzso and zzso dysfunction zzso The compounds were applied to the zzso cells either alone or in zzso When applied zzso the compounds produced a significant decrease in cell viability confirming that zzso stress, zzso zzso or zzso dysfunction can individually result in zzso cell zzso When the compounds were applied in pairs, some of the combinations produced synergistic zzso Analysis of these interactions indicates that zzso zzso and zzso dysfunction is exacerbated by zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of the zzso or zzso or increasing zzso stress has a synergistic effect on cell viability when combined with zzso dysfunction, suggesting that all cell death mechanisms impair zzso zzso Finally, we show that there are zzso relationships between zzso stress, zzso dysfunction, and zzso dysfunction, whereas zzso dysfunction appears to mediate cell death via an independent zzso Given the highly interactive nature of the various cell death mechanisms linked with zzso we predict that effective zzso strategies should target multiple sites in these zzso for example zzso stress and zzso
