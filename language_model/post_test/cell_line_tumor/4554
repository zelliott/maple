zzso zzso chemotherapy is regarded as the standard treatment of pancreatic zzso but yields a very limited disease zzso Very few studies have investigated salvage chemotherapy after failure of zzso or zzso chemotherapy and zzso studies attempting to widen the therapeutic zzso not including zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso pancreatic cancer cell lines were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as single zzso zzso inducing zzso with zzso under the zzso in the three lines tested, appeared the most effective drug as single zzso Based on these results, zzso and zzso drug interactions zzso using the combination zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The zzso study clearly indicated the zzso and zzso combination as the most active against pancreatic zzso To confirm the efficacy of zzso zzso we extended the study to a panel of 10 pancreatic cancer cell lines using clinically relevant zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso 1 zzso In eight of 10 lines, the zzso treatment significantly reduced cell recovery and increased both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso After a zzso wash out period, an increased fraction of zzso and zzso persisted in zzso cell lines and a significant reduction in the zzso capacity was zzso Finally, in zzso the zzso combination showed the ability to inhibit zzso zzso growth as zzso therapy after zzso zzso The zzso and zzso combination displays a strong zzso synergistic zzso activity against pancreatic cancer, providing experimental basis for its clinical testing as salvage chemotherapy in pancreatic cancer zzso
