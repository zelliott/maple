With potentially zzso properties, zzso zzso zzso has been suggested to be the main zzso of zzso zzso and zzso actions of zzso However, we had demonstrated that zzso zzso increased zzso of zzso 2A cells in zzso zzso and iron production from zzso activity may be responsible for the zzso This study was designed to explore the effect of zzso zzso on cultured zzso 2A and zzso cells exposed to zzso zzso We found that the zzso zzso was significantly associated with increased nuclear factor zzso B zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso and zzso nuclear zzso as well as increased production of zzso zzso of the induced zzso by zinc zzso reduced the increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso interference with zzso zzso reduced the expression of zzso transcripts and protein as well as oxygen radical zzso zzso of the iron zzso zzso to reduce the zzso of zzso iron from zzso by zzso resulted in blockade of the aggravated oxygen radical zzso There was no significant effect on production of oxygen zzso under these conditions in the presence of a CO donor zzso or a CO scavenger zzso In addition, the viable cells were significantly decreased in 48 h in those cells receiving zzso zzso plus zzso compared to those in control or exposed to zzso or zzso zzso This study revealed that zzso zzso led to increased zzso zzso and zzso production in the zzso cells when exposed to zzso and iron production may play a role in such a zzso
