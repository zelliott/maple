SKI and zzso proteins have been shown to inhibit zzso zzso acting both as zzso zzso in the cell nucleus, and as zzso of zzso proteins in the zzso zzso on the other hand, zzso zzso zzso degradation of both zzso How elevated SKI and zzso protein levels co-exist with active zzso zzso signaling in cancer cells is yet to be zzso 

In this study, we found elevated SKI and zzso protein levels in a panel of melanoma cell lines, as compared to normal zzso There was no correlation between SKI protein content and the capacity of melanoma cells to invade zzso to form subcutaneous tumors, or to zzso to bone after zzso zzso into nude zzso Nor did we find a correlation between SKI expression and zzso staging of human zzso zzso induced a rapid and zzso degradation of SKI zzso associated with zzso specific zzso response and induction of zzso target zzso partially prevented by zzso blockade of zzso zzso SKI zzso in zzso melanoma cells did not alter their invasive capacity or zzso responses to zzso and did not allow zzso expression in response to zzso or reveal any growth zzso activity of zzso 

Despite high expression in melanoma cells, the role of SKI in melanoma remains zzso SKI does not efficiently interfere with the zzso activities of zzso unless stabilized by zzso zzso Its highly zzso nature makes it an unlikely target for therapeutic zzso
