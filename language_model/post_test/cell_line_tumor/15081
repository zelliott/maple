Many strategies are pursued to enhance tumor vaccine immune response, including the zzso of zzso We have developed a novel zzso technology to zzso zzso on tumor cell zzso Here we reported the preparation of tumor cell vaccines by zzso zzso or zzso on zzso zzso cancer cells and evaluated their zzso efficacy zzso alone or zzso in a zzso mouse zzso 

zzso or zzso zzso zzso cells were prepared as zzso Mice were treated with zzso cell vaccines zzso alone or zzso Survival time, tumor growth, flow zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso T zzso zzso zzso were used to evaluate the zzso efficiency of the vaccines in the pulmonary zzso model of zzso zzso 

zzso vaccine induced more mature zzso cells in the mice zzso Combination with subsequent zzso vaccine significantly increased zzso zzso and zzso T but not zzso T cell population and induced the highest production of zzso zzso but not zzso Furthermore, the zzso from the zzso combined vaccines group showed the most potent zzso on zzso zzso Finally, the zzso combined vaccines evidently extended the survival time of mice (the median survival time of zzso zzso anchored zzso anchored zzso and anchored zzso + anchored zzso groups were 34, 37, 45, 47, and 59 days, zzso and effectively protected the mice against a second zzso cells but not zzso cells zzso 

This study demonstrated that sequential administration of zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells vaccines could effectively induce specific zzso immune zzso
