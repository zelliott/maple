zzso zzso C zzso is expressed in zzso zzso cells and serves as the zzso for bacterial zzso zzso zzso peptides and the zzso family of gastrointestinal zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso zzso and differentiation of zzso along the zzso zzso zzso activity can regulate zzso cell proliferation by inducing cell cycle arrest, and mice lacking zzso display increased cell proliferation in zzso zzso zzso of zzso by administration of ST to wild type, but not zzso mice resulted in a reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso human zzso zzso cells, ST led to a zzso zzso of zzso the cell cycle zzso via zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso treatment of human zzso zzso cells with ST led to nuclear zzso of zzso resulting in cellular zzso and reduced zzso zzso Our results, therefore, identify downstream zzso for zzso that contribute to regulating zzso cell zzso Thus, zzso responses to a bacterial toxin can influence zzso zzso and zzso
