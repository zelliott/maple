zzso of differentiation zzso T cells exist as zzso central memory, and zzso memory subsets, and any of these populations can be genetically engineered into zzso zzso cells for adoptive zzso However, the optimal subset from which to derive zzso zzso T cells for patient treatments is controversial and zzso We investigated human zzso T cells and found that zzso cells were not only the most abundant subset but also the population most capable of in zzso expansion and zzso zzso zzso zzso Despite increased expansion, zzso cells displayed minimal zzso zzso a quality associated with greater efficacy after cell zzso Similarly, the markers of terminal zzso killer cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso were expressed at lower levels in cells of zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso cells expressed higher zzso and retained longer zzso characteristics that suggest greater zzso potential and that have been linked to greater efficacy in clinical zzso Thus, these data suggest that zzso cells resist terminal zzso or zzso maintain high zzso potential, and therefore may be the superior subset for use in adoptive zzso
