zzso resistance is the main cause for failure of zzso zzso differentiation associated zzso zzso has been implicated in the zzso of human tumor cell zzso However, the reversing effect of zzso on zzso resistance of human zzso zzso zzso is not fully zzso In this study, we investigated the effects of zzso of the zzso gene in human zzso We established zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines and their drug sensitivity to zzso and zzso zzso which were investigated by zzso Furthermore, we investigated the zzso rate and the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso by flow zzso We also studied the expression of zzso resistance gene 1 zzso lung zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso protein 1 zzso by real-time zzso chain reaction and Western zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was determined by zzso reporter zzso The drug sensitivity of zzso or zzso the zzso rate, and the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were increased, while the zzso and protein expression levels of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was suppressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrated that zzso could restore the drug sensitivity through the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso and effectively reverse zzso
