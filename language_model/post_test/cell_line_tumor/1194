Cellular stress leads to DNA damage and zzso of the intrinsic zzso zzso in which zzso of zzso zzso c to the zzso plays a critical zzso Previous studies have suggested alternative mechanisms responsible for this zzso We examined initiation mechanisms of the intrinsic zzso zzso using human zzso and breast cancer zzso zzso indicated that zzso of zzso c does not require prior zzso of zzso but rather depends on zzso of specific zzso family members, depending upon the type of death zzso Thus, DNA zzso zzso requires new protein zzso zzso of zzso tumor zzso zzso and zzso induction of zzso and zzso zzso while a role for zzso in this zzso is not zzso In contrast, zzso induced by zzso does not require protein synthesis but is characterized by zzso of zzso Based on these findings, we propose a model of the intrinsic zzso cascade induced by DNA damage where zzso zzso zzso for a function of zzso
