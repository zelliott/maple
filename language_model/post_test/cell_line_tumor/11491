zzso is a zzso zzso II zzso zzso factor that is enriched in zzso The zzso domain of zzso shows strong similarities to that of zzso zzso zzso leukemia zzso which acts as a negative regulator of zzso and regulates cell proliferation and zzso Recent studies in our laboratory showed that zzso zzso the differentiation of mouse embryonic stem cells by protecting zzso cells from zzso via the promotion of zzso zzso In this study, we evaluated the function of zzso in breast cancer cell zzso zzso cell lines zzso zzso were used to examine cell proliferation and cancer stem cell zzso zzso expression of zzso in breast cancer cell lines zzso proliferation and zzso zzso In addition, zzso expression increases the cancer stem cell population, which is characterized by zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso potential and migration ability were also increased upon zzso expression in breast cancer cell zzso Through zzso and molecular biological zzso we showed that zzso regulates zzso cancer stem cell properties and drug resistance in breast cancer cell lines partly through the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso expression promotes zzso in zzso These results suggest that zzso may play a critical role in promoting zzso in breast cancer by regulating cell proliferation and cancer stem cell properties via the zzso signaling zzso
