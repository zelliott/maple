Cancer cells are frequently characterized by zzso increases in protein zzso and by disruption of zzso zzso zzso The relationship between altered zzso and loss of zzso zzso in cancer, however, remains zzso Previously, we reported that complex zzso on the zzso zzso of zzso inhibited the formation of mature zzso zzso Here, we examined whether zzso zzso was one of the underlying causes for cellular zzso in oral zzso We show that dense cultures of human zzso zzso zzso zzso cells exhibited elevated expression of zzso the gene that zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso correlated with the production of zzso complex zzso in nascent zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with small interfering zzso reduced the complex zzso of zzso and increased the abundance of zzso and stabilizing proteins in zzso zzso This was associated with the assembly of functional tight zzso The inverse relationship between zzso expression and zzso zzso was a feature of oral zzso cell zzso zzso zzso cell zzso displayed zzso of zzso that correlated with diminished zzso of zzso and zzso at the sites of zzso zzso Our studies show for the first time that zzso is an upstream regulator of zzso zzso status and zzso junction composition and suggest that zzso of zzso causes disturbances in zzso zzso in oral zzso
