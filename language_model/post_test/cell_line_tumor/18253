zzso tumor models are regarded as being suitable for zzso research on pancreatic zzso The zzso zzso of the tumor in the zzso however, provides little possibility for monitoring tumor zzso 

To assess zzso changes in zzso tumor volume, we applied zzso high-resolution compound imaging to the zzso zzso A zzso ultrasound probe was used to determine the feasibility of real-time zzso high-resolution zzso to initiate tumor growth by zzso of pancreatic tumor cells into the zzso and monitor tumor growth, as well as use as a tool for assessing response to zzso 

zzso ultrasound allows for precise tumor zzso in the zzso zzso tumor weight was found to be closely related to actual tumor weight (R zzso zzso measured during zzso 

zzso real-time compound imaging zzso killing of mice during zzso studies and can be used for minimizing animal consumption because each mouse can be followed in an experimental group rather than having to resort to euthanasia for tissue zzso
