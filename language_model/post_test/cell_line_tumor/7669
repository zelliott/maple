Our previous study has shown that zzso novel zzso 1 zzso knocking down significantly induced zzso zzso Although zzso is proved to be associated with zzso zzso zzso and its function in this chronic pathological process is widely zzso its role in acute energy crisis such as zzso stroke is poorly zzso In this study by employing an zzso deprivation zzso zzso model, we explored the function of zzso in cerebral zzso Human zzso two zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso were zzso before zzso using zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso of zzso zzso significantly ameliorated zzso induced cell death and energy zzso including reduced zzso generation and collapse of zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso also reversed zzso increased zzso zzso and suppressed the zzso of the zzso zzso protein zzso protein 1 zzso from the zzso to the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso failed to provide any protective effect, while zzso of zzso significantly increased the severity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso reversed the effects of knocking down zzso on zzso death and zzso production in response to zzso This study demonstrates that zzso prevents zzso damage in zzso by attenuating zzso zzso of zzso which maintains zzso function and zzso zzso zzso zzso These novel findings zzso a pivotal role of zzso regulated zzso dynamics in the pathology of zzso zzso In this study by employing an zzso deprivation zzso zzso model, we explored the function of zzso in cerebral zzso We indicated that zzso significantly ameliorated zzso induced cell death and energy zzso including reduced zzso generation and collapse of zzso membrane potential by attenuating zzso zzso of zzso which maintains zzso function and zzso zzso zzso zzso
