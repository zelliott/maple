The zzso sequence of the zzso protein is known to be involved in binding to the zzso domain of the zzso proteins zzso zzso their zzso Short peptides and zzso zzso based on the first zzso of zzso have been demonstrated to zzso resistant cancer cells, zzso zzso to zzso Based on the zzso structural basis for this interaction, a small focused library of zzso capped zzso peptides was designed in zzso using zzso to the zzso zzso zzso The top-ranked zzso hits were zzso zzso employing Solid Phase zzso zzso on an zzso zzso zzso zzso This novel approach afforded the rapid synthesis of the target zzso library with high flexibility for the introduction of various zzso zzso zzso The library members were obtained in high yield zzso and purity zzso upon zzso release from the activated zzso by treatment with various zzso zzso In zzso zzso activity zzso zzso of the peptides in the presence of the zzso zzso of human zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso zzso to be the most potent zzso zzso zzso of the series zzso inducing zzso recovery of zzso activity, when used at zzso zzso zzso zzso also demonstrated moderate zzso against the breast cancer cell lines zzso and zzso compared to the zzso zzso zzso sequences that were totally inactive in the same cell zzso
