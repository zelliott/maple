zzso zzso is a critical driver of proliferation and survival and is thus a validated therapeutic target in zzso We have developed a potent zzso termed zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling downstream of zzso in cancer cells, blocking DNA zzso and zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso is considerably more selective for zzso zzso cancer cell lines compared with zzso zzso zzso The inhibitor is well tolerated in mice and exhibits excellent oral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso signaling in human tumor zzso was observed following oral administration of a single dose of zzso As expected, the growth rate in zzso of a zzso zzso human tumor zzso model is unaffected by inhibitor zzso In contrast, zzso elicits significant therapeutic responses in zzso zzso human melanoma zzso
