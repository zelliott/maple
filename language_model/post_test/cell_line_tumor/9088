Selective expression of certain zzso receptors by melanoma cells and the presence of their zzso in zzso might govern organ zzso zzso Because the expression profile of zzso receptors in zzso of zzso origin is unknown, we performed a comprehensive study on zzso tissue samples investigating the expression of 18 zzso receptors at the zzso level by real-time zzso chain reaction, using a zzso approach, and of 3 zzso receptors zzso zzso and zzso at the protein zzso We report on the de zzso expression of zzso in primary zzso and melanoma zzso but absence in melanoma cell lines and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were the only 2 zzso receptors that were consistently expressed in zzso melanoma cell lines, primary, and zzso zzso zzso expression increased significantly over zzso zzso and zzso transcripts were found in zzso zzso and expression was confirmed by zzso zzso for zzso were not found in any of the zzso but in some melanoma cell zzso zzso of zzso was observed in primary zzso and some zzso zzso was exclusively expressed in primary zzso and some zzso zzso zzso revealed a restricted and differential pattern of zzso zzso expression in melanoma zzso which varies substantially from the expression profile of melanoma cell lines and warrants functional studies on some zzso
