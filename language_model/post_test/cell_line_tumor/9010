zzso zzso one of small heat shock proteins zzso is zzso expressed in various zzso and has several zzso We previously reported that the expression levels of zzso in human zzso zzso zzso cells zzso correlated with the progression of zzso and that zzso suppresses the growth of zzso cells via the zzso and zzso protein zzso signaling zzso However, the exact mechanism underlying the effect of zzso on the regulation of these signaling pathways remains to be zzso To clarify the details of this effect in zzso we explored the direct targets of zzso in zzso using human zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso proteins in the zzso cells were zzso with the zzso regulatory zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso an upstream zzso of zzso Although zzso zzso in zzso cells failed to affect the expression levels of zzso the activity of zzso in the zzso cells and even in the transforming growth zzso zzso cells were zzso by zzso zzso The association of zzso with zzso was also observed in human zzso zzso in zzso These findings strongly suggest that zzso directly associates with zzso and suppresses its activity in zzso resulting in the zzso of the zzso pathway, and subsequently decreasing the growth of zzso
