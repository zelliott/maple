The zzso zzso in the zzso cell membrane is important for the growth and migration of zzso into zzso tissue and is also a survival factor for these zzso The zzso zzso zzso is responsible for zzso zzso and, with zzso release of different stored zzso factors, and zzso zzso zzso 

An zzso nude rat model was used to study zzso growth in zzso bone, with zzso cells negative for the target zzso and zzso zzso 

Daily zzso injections of zzso zzso zzso fragment, blocking human and rat zzso and zzso zzso reduced the measured size of the zzso growing in the zzso bone by zzso zzso zzso zzso and also the zzso density in these zzso The concentration of the important zzso factor zzso was significantly reduced by zzso in the treated zzso The treatment slightly increased the time to the appearance of the zzso from zzso to zzso days, indicating a small but significant effect on the early stages of zzso growth and invasion through the bone zzso 

zzso treatment reduced zzso growth, solely targeting the host zzso This treatment strategy should be further exploited for use in combination with conventional treatment strategies, or the combined targeting of alternative zzso zzso
