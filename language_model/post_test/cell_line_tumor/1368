Association of cellular influences and physical and chemical properties were examined for 24 kinds of industrial metal oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso blue zzso We prepared a stable medium zzso for each zzso and examined the influence on cell viability and zzso stress together with physical and chemical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed a large amount of metal zzso release in the culture zzso The cellular influences of these soluble zzso were larger than zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed strong protein zzso zzso however, cellular influences of these zzso were zzso The primary particle size and the specific surface area seemed unrelated to cellular zzso Cellular influences of metal oxide zzso depended on the kind and zzso of released metals in the zzso For zzso zzso the zzso property was involved in cellular zzso The primary particle size and specific surface area of metal oxide zzso did not affect directly cellular zzso In conclusion the most important zzso factor of metal oxide zzso was metal zzso zzso
