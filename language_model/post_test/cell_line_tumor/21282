zzso activate zzso in response to numerous zzso controlling zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso particularly zzso is implicated in the zzso of many zzso including zzso by promoting cell cycle zzso stimulating zzso and zzso tumor immune zzso Little is known about the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso in human zzso The objective of this study was to examine the expression of zzso and its negative regulator, zzso in human tissue samples from control and zzso zzso 

Control and zzso human zzso were analyzed by zzso and zzso to determine the zzso status of zzso and expression of the zzso zzso The functional consequence of zzso zzso by small interfering zzso or zzso zzso in zzso cells was determined by examining cell zzso zzso zzso activity, and zzso target gene zzso This was accomplished using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso as assessed by zzso and zzso zzso was elevated in zzso tissue compared with control zzso Interestingly, we observed expression of zzso in control zzso whereas zzso protein expression in zzso tissue was greatly zzso zzso of zzso resulted in enhanced zzso cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso activity, expression of zzso zzso and cell zzso We propose that the loss of zzso in zzso contributes to enhanced zzso zzso activity and subsequent cell zzso
