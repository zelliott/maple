zzso cavernous zzso zzso are vascular zzso mostly located in the central nervous system, which occur in zzso of the zzso They are characterized by zzso enlarged and often leaking zzso cavities without intervening neural zzso Some are clinically silent, whereas others cause seizures, zzso zzso or focal neurological zzso These vascular zzso can arise sporadically or may be inherited as an zzso dominant condition with incomplete zzso At least zzso of families affected with cerebral cavernous zzso zzso a zzso in zzso interaction zzso zzso gene zzso cavernous zzso zzso zzso This gene contains 16 coding zzso which zzso a zzso acid protein containing three zzso repeats and a zzso zzso Neither the zzso zzso mechanisms nor the function of the zzso protein are understood so far, although several hypotheses have been zzso from the predicted consequences of zzso zzso as well as from the identification of zzso as a binding partner of zzso zzso and zzso Here, we report the identification of zzso a novel zzso zzso characterized by the alternative zzso of the 15th coding zzso We show that the zzso zzso zzso is widely expressed in mouse cell lines and zzso whereas its expression is highly restricted in zzso In addition, we developed a real-time zzso strategy to accurately zzso the relative ratio of the two zzso alternative transcripts in different zzso demonstrating a zzso ratio up to zzso in mouse zzso but significantly lower ratios in other zzso zzso analysis using zzso comparative alignment and structure analysis programs supported the existence of zzso alternative transcripts lacking the 15th coding zzso and showed that the zzso out of this zzso occurs outside of potentially important zzso structural zzso but in a region required for association with zzso suggesting a zzso yet important effect on the protein zzso Our results indicate that maintenance of a proper ratio between zzso and zzso could be functionally relevant and suggest that the novel zzso zzso might expand our understanding of the role of zzso in zzso zzso
