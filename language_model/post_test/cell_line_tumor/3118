zzso has been considered as an attractive zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso It has been well accepted that zzso type 1 zzso zzso immunity is critical for the successful induction of zzso immunity in a zzso zzso The adoptive zzso cell therapy has been shown to be an attractive strategy for inducing zzso zzso in mouse zzso However, zzso therapy using human zzso zzso cells, which were expanded from peripheral blood zzso cells zzso in a clinically useful zzso has never been zzso Here, we first identified zzso zzso helper zzso zzso zzso zzso bound to both zzso and zzso Using the zzso we established a suitable protocol for the propagation of zzso zzso cells in zzso Culture of zzso T cells with zzso zzso adherent cells in the presence of helper zzso zzso resulted in a great expansion of zzso zzso cells producing zzso , but not zzso Moreover, it was shown that zzso of zzso zzso cells with the zzso zzso caused the production of zzso and zzso Thus, our identified zzso helper zzso zzso will become a good tool for the propagation of zzso zzso cells zzso to adoptive zzso of human zzso
