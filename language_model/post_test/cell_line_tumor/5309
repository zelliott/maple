zzso lateral sclerosis zzso is a progressive neurodegenerative disease characterized by the selective loss of lower and upper zzso The pathology is zzso in approximately zzso of cases to zzso in the ubiquitous zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Common theories to explain the zzso mechanisms of ALS include zzso of zzso responsible for the release of zzso zzso However, how zzso zzso affects zzso zzso and subsequently zzso zzso is still zzso Considering that zzso zzso through zzso zzso zzso constitutes a well recognized zzso alarm zzso the aim of this study was to investigate how the expression of zzso zzso affects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We used primary and immortalized zzso cells from zzso zzso mice to explore several aspects of zzso by zzso zzso and to analyze the overall effect of such stimulation on the viability of zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso We observed zzso of zzso zzso and zzso receptors and zzso of zzso activities in zzso zzso zzso This zzso of the zzso machinery reflected into enhanced sensitivity mainly to zzso zzso a zzso zzso preferential zzso and translated into deeper zzso changes, enhancement of zzso and zzso content, and finally into toxic effects exerted on zzso cell lines by zzso expressing zzso zzso All these parameters were prevented by the zzso zzso Blue zzso The zzso zzso of zzso may thus constitute a new route involved in the progression of ALS to be exploited to potentially halt the zzso
