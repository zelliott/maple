Using gene expression zzso others and we have recently found that zzso zzso and zzso zzso are two of the most highly and consistently zzso genes in zzso zzso Because these tight junction proteins are the naturally occurring receptors for zzso zzso zzso zzso in this study, we used the zzso 30 zzso acids of the zzso zzso a zzso that is known to retain full binding affinity but have no zzso effect, to target tumor necrosis factor zzso to zzso zzso We constructed a zzso zzso that expressed the fusion zzso designated here as zzso in which zzso was fused to zzso at its zzso zzso Western zzso confirmed presence of both zzso and zzso in the fusion zzso The zzso component in zzso was zzso less potent than free zzso as determined by a standard zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso was zzso more zzso than free zzso to 2008 human zzso cancer cells, which express both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso expression in 2008 markedly attenuated the zzso effects of zzso The fusion construct was efficiently delivered into target cells and located in both zzso and zzso compartments as assessed by zzso zzso We conclude that zzso effectively targeted zzso to zzso cancer cells and is an attractive targeting zzso for development of zzso toxins for therapy of zzso zzso that zzso zzso and zzso
