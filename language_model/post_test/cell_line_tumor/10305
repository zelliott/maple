To investigate the zzso in zzso gene expression driven by the different promoters in leukemia cells, four zzso reporter zzso zzso carrying different zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso were infected with zzso produced from these reporter zzso zzso Then, zzso zzso flow zzso and zzso quantitative zzso were used to detect the zzso expression zzso The results of this study clearly showed that the expression levels of the reporter genes with four different promoters were significantly zzso Among them, zzso drove the highest level of zzso zzso while zzso promoter induced the lowest zzso Our results suggested that promoters should be carefully chosen in order to get the appropriate zzso expression level in leukemia cells according to the study zzso
