To investigate the expression of zzso zzso C zzso in human gastric cancer zzso zzso and assess the effect of zzso small interfering zzso zzso on the proliferation and zzso of zzso 

The expression of zzso in 30 specimens and three human zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso were detected by zzso for zzso zzso zzso by Western zzso and zzso for zzso zzso plasmids containing zzso zzso and scrambled zzso were constructed and zzso into zzso cells, zzso A cell counting zzso flow zzso zzso and terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to evaluate cell zzso cell cycle distribution and zzso followed by wound healing zzso and cell adherent zzso for cell zzso and zzso zzso 

The expression of zzso was absent in zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso and protein expressions were detected in zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso was statistically different from diffuse zzso zzso zzso zzso The proliferation of zzso cells was markedly inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso changes including zzso reduction, zzso and zzso were zzso zzso showed that the cell count in the zzso peak increased from zzso zzso h after zzso to zzso zzso h after zzso The wound healing zzso and cell adherent zzso revealed that zzso gene zzso decreased cell zzso and zzso 

The zzso of zzso has been detected in zzso type zzso zzso zzso can effectively inhibit the proliferation and invasion of zzso cells and induce cell zzso zzso might be a novel zzso and therapeutic target for zzso
