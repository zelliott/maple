The zzso zzso DNA binding protein 5 zzso has recently been identified as a tumor zzso in a mouse zzso The zzso locus at zzso is deleted, and its zzso has been detected in breast zzso zzso therefore, evaluated whether zzso plays a role in human breast zzso 

We screened zzso in 55 tumors, determined promoter zzso in 39 tumors, measured zzso expression in 90 tumors, analyzed protein expression in zzso tumors, and correlated expression changes with zzso characteristics of breast zzso zzso effects of zzso on cell zzso invasion and zzso were also zzso 

Although only one zzso was zzso zzso zzso expression was significantly reduced, accompanied by frequent zzso deletion and promoter zzso in breast zzso The extent of zzso was significantly associated with reduced zzso zzso and zzso treatment restored zzso zzso Lower zzso zzso levels correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein expression was also reduced in breast cancer, and lack of zzso expression significantly correlated with higher tumor stage, zzso zzso zzso distant zzso and worse patient survival zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in breast cancer cells inhibited cell proliferation and invasion in zzso and zzso in nude zzso zzso with the zzso of invasion, zzso zzso zzso markers zzso zzso and zzso in breast cancer zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso at least in part by promoter zzso contributes to the development and progression of human breast zzso
