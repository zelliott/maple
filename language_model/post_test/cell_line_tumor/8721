zzso zzso zzso is a very common head and neck cancer in southern zzso Despite advances in surgical and zzso approaches, its prognosis is still not zzso zzso signaling zzso was reported to be involved in a number of zzso including head and zzso However, it remains unclear regarding the role of this zzso in zzso By real-time zzso we found zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in all human zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso Compared with zzso normal zzso zzso the zzso expression level of zzso was higher in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso While compared with zzso zzso the zzso expression level of zzso was lower in zzso zzso and normal zzso The expressions of zzso zzso were not significantly different among these zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the expression level of zzso was higher in zzso than zzso Thus, our data indicated that zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso Furthermore, blocking the zzso with zzso inhibited the proliferation of zzso zzso cell zzso In addition, blockade of the zzso in three zzso cell lines with zzso tumor cell zzso The zzso of zzso target genes also is inhibited by zzso These data suggested that zzso zzso may sustain zzso tumor zzso Our data demonstrated that zzso signaling zzso was involved in zzso zzso and might be a novel therapeutic target for zzso
