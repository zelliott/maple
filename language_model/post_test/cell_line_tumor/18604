zzso have allowed the expression level of thousands of genes or proteins to be measured zzso Data sets generated by these zzso consist of a small number of observations zzso zzso zzso on a very large number of variables zzso 10,000 genes or zzso The observations in these data sets often have other attributes associated with them such as a class label denoting the pathology of the zzso Finding the genes or proteins that are correlated to these attributes is often a difficult task since most of the variables do not contain information about the pathology and as such can mask the identity of the relevant zzso We describe a genetic zzso zzso that employs both supervised and zzso learning to mine gene expression and zzso zzso The pattern recognition zzso selects features that increase zzso while simultaneously searching for features that zzso the separation of the classes in a plot of the two or three largest principal components of the zzso Because the largest principal components capture the bulk of the zzso in the data, the features chosen by the zzso contain information primarily about differences between classes in the data zzso The principal component analysis routine embedded in the fitness function of the zzso acts as an information zzso significantly reducing the size of the search space since it restricts the search to feature sets whose principal component plots show zzso on the basis of zzso The zzso zzso aspects of artificial intelligence and evolutionary zzso to yield a smart one pass procedure for feature selection, zzso zzso and zzso
