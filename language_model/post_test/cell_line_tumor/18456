During human prostate cancer zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed on the cancer cell surface during invasion and in zzso zzso zzso We previously identified a novel structural zzso of the zzso zzso called zzso This zzso was produced on the cell surface and was missing the zzso zzso zzso Using several different zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we showed that zzso acting as a zzso is responsible for production of zzso We also showed that addition of zzso in the culture media of cells that do not produce zzso resulted in a zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the addition of zzso did not result in the zzso of other zzso Using zzso and zzso depleted media, we observed that zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso Further, zzso zzso induced the production of zzso and this induction was abolished by zzso but not zzso Finally, the zzso zzso zzso was detected in invasive human prostate zzso tissue indicating that this is not a tissue culture zzso These data, taken together, suggest that this is a novel function of zzso that is, to remove the zzso zzso domain of the zzso while preserving its zzso zzso
