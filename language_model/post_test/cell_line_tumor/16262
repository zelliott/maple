We evaluated the effect of combining zzso with therapeutic zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso of solid tumor cells, and the requirement for expression of natural killer zzso zzso receptors and their solid tumor surface zzso zzso human tumor cell lines zzso breast, zzso head and neck, zzso and bone zzso were zzso zzso zzso cells were isolated from healthy donors, zzso with and without zzso and incubated with zzso tumor cells to determine zzso In blocking experiments, zzso cells were zzso with zzso or zzso zzso and target zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso 3 zzso zzso between groups were assessed using zzso and paired zzso zzso test and one-way zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso tumor zzso zzso against zzso cancer cells was dependent on target zzso zzso but independent of zzso status and zzso zzso The extent of zzso and its enhancement by zzso correlated with zzso cell expression of zzso and zzso and tumor cell expression of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked natural zzso but not zzso zzso enhances the ability of zzso zzso to mediate zzso of solid tumor cells, the extent of which is largely dependent on zzso zzso zzso but appears to be independent of zzso This provides a rationale for exploratory clinical studies and an assessment of potential zzso zzso of clinical zzso
