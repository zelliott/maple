The zzso players in membrane fusion events are the soluble zzso factor attachment protein zzso zzso family of zzso We zzso that zzso proteins mediate fusion events at the zzso inclusion and are important for zzso zzso zzso We have previously demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso to the zzso zzso To investigate the role of zzso 6 at the zzso zzso we examined the zzso and function of another zzso zzso and zzso zzso partner, zzso membrane protein 4 zzso at the zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso 6 and zzso zzso to the zzso inclusion and interact at the zzso zzso Furthermore, in the absence of zzso zzso 6 is not retained at the zzso zzso Small interfering zzso zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso with a log decrease in infectious zzso zzso retention at the inclusion was shown to be dependent on de zzso zzso protein zzso but unlike zzso 6, zzso recruitment is observed in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso trafficking only to inclusions in which it zzso These data support the hypothesis that zzso proteins play a central role in zzso zzso zzso interactions at the zzso inclusion and, thus, support zzso zzso acquisition and zzso zzso
