zzso is strongly expressed in embryonic zzso and in tumor cells but is low or absent in differentiated normal zzso zzso zzso expresses low levels of zzso but can zzso its synthesis on zzso to zzso The mechanisms responsible for zzso zzso in resting conditions are still zzso We report here that zzso and vascular zzso zzso expression induce contact zzso of cell growth and zzso zzso in the zzso Using zzso zzso and positive zzso zzso cell lines we found that the effect requires zzso expression and its association to zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, in zzso organ cultures, zzso expression is zzso in areas of growing vessels where zzso is partially dismantled from junctions or in zzso zzso zzso Overall, these data indicate that zzso and zzso may zzso regulate zzso synthesis in zzso zzso zzso in zzso and pancreatic cell lines or zzso tumors, zzso zzso and zzso expression is zzso zzso suggesting a zzso role of zzso in reducing zzso zzso
