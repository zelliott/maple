zzso growth factor binding zzso zzso is a gene identified as being low expressed in zzso zzso zzso cell zzso In the current study, we investigated the function of zzso in zzso by zzso zzso We found that zzso could inhibit cell growth, decrease soft zzso colony formation activity and induce zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis between the expression of zzso in zzso tissue and the prognosis in 218 patients showed that high expression of zzso was associated with favorable zzso Based on above results, we conclude that zzso plays a potential tumor zzso role in zzso zzso
