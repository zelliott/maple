zzso zzso is known to be due to zzso stress acting through a zzso involving the excessive zzso of zzso zzso We studied the zzso potential of an zzso zzso extract of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso root zzso zzso PM extract was evaluated for its zzso and zzso activities against zzso toxicity in mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso The extract at zzso of 10 and zzso exhibited considerable zzso activity with significant zzso based on the microscopic observations of cell zzso and the determination of cell viability and cell zzso Studies of the possible mechanisms of action indicated that the zzso exerted by PM extract was related to its scavenging activity against zzso and related zzso oxygen zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso and zzso zzso (TLC) analyses showed that the extract contained zzso and zzso as identified constituents, as well as additional components with zzso zzso While zzso and zzso individually and in combination were observed not to be zzso we propose that the zzso and zzso activities of PM extract are derived from the combined properties of its zzso
