The mechanisms for tissue zzso and renewal after acute zzso are not well understood but may involve zzso of zzso zzso To study the effect of zzso signaling zzso during acute experimental zzso we used a chemical and genetic approach to zzso zzso signaling in zzso zzso in zzso 

Acute zzso was induced by zzso treatment in mice treated with the zzso inhibitor zzso or in conditional zzso knockout zzso Mice were characterized using zzso zzso and molecular zzso To investigate zzso and zzso interaction, zzso zzso cells were analyzed using zzso and zzso zzso 

Loss of zzso signaling results in impaired zzso after acute zzso with fewer mature zzso cells in zzso and zzso mice in the zzso phase 3 days after zzso zzso expression was increased and prolonged during zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso signaling was identified, with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso was dependent on a functional zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso signaling in zzso leads to impaired zzso of the zzso zzso after acute zzso Our results suggest an interaction of zzso and zzso signaling in pancreatic zzso cells, providing evidence for a role of these pathways in the regulation of the maturation process of zzso zzso
