zzso is an essential zzso factor required for development of neural zzso zzso peripheral zzso and enteric zzso Multiple zzso targets regulated by zzso have been zzso however, little is known regarding regulation of zzso High sequence conservation surrounding zzso zzso 1 through 3 suggests these regions might contain functional regulatory zzso However, we observed that these zzso zzso sequences do not zzso appropriate zzso zzso in zzso when linked to a zzso zzso To identify elements required for expression of zzso in zzso we modified bacterial artificial zzso zzso to generate a zzso zzso Our approach leaves zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso issues that arise from gene zzso zzso expression closely zzso zzso expression in zzso resulting in expression in anterior zzso neural tube at embryonic day zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso and developing zzso root zzso at zzso zzso of zzso expression confirms the presence of essential regulatory regions and additionally identifies previously zzso expression in zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso deletions in independent zzso lines result in loss of zzso expression in peripheral nervous system lineages and coincide with zzso zzso zzso Our analysis indicates that zzso expression requires the presence of distant zzso regulatory zzso The zzso zzso offers one avenue for specifically testing the role of individual zzso regions in regulation of zzso and makes possible analysis of zzso derivatives in the context of normal neural crest zzso
