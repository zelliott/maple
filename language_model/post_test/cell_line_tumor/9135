The neuroendocrine status of zzso zzso is considered a zzso indicator for development of aggressive, zzso zzso zzso cells are thought to function by providing growth and survival signals to surrounding tumor cells, particularly following zzso zzso zzso To test this hypothesis directly, zzso cells were engineered to zzso express a zzso activated form of the zzso zzso protein zzso A zzso zzso zzso which was previously found upon transient zzso to be sufficient for acquisition of zzso characteristics and loss of zzso zzso zzso cells that zzso expressed zzso enhanced the growth of prostate tumor cells in zzso and zzso in zzso zzso as well as the growth of prostate tumor zzso in zzso with the greatest effects seen under conditions of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso cells of zzso tumors have the potential to enhance zzso tumor growth in a zzso manner, thereby contributing to progression of the zzso
