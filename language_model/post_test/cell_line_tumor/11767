Numerous zzso gene expression studies performed on several types of solid tumors revealed significant changes in key genes involved in progression and regulation of the cell cycle, including zzso that is known to be zzso in many types of human zzso zzso zzso is associated with poor prognosis in several cancer types, including breast cancer zzso Since zzso is a condition that influences the expression of many genes involved in zzso zzso and cell cycle regulation, we performed a zzso gene expression analysis in order to identify zzso expressed genes in BC cell lines exposed to zzso This analysis showed that zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso Although zzso is a tumor feature, the molecular mechanisms that regulate zzso expression in response to zzso in BC are still zzso For the first time, we demonstrated that zzso zzso downstream of zzso could drive zzso zzso in BC zzso In fact, we found that zzso zzso of zzso significantly reduces the zzso zzso in BC cells under zzso The aim of our study was to obtain new insights into zzso zzso regulation in hypoxic zzso zzso reporter zzso showed a reduction of zzso promoter activity in zzso Unlike the previous findings, we zzso a new possible mechanism where zzso rather than inducing zzso zzso could promote the zzso zzso via its binding to zzso elements into the zzso region of the zzso zzso The present study shows that zzso directly links zzso with zzso zzso suggesting a possible zzso role of this new zzso in BC and confirming zzso as an important player linking an environmental signal to the zzso zzso Since zzso zzso zzso the zzso growth and zzso in BC cells, these findings could be important for the development of new possible therapies against zzso
