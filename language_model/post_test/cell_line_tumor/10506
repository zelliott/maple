Three novel zzso complexes of the general formula zzso where zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) and zzso zzso is a naturally occurring zzso zzso have been zzso and zzso The molecular structures of 1 and 2 have been determined by X-ray zzso zzso The cellular zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso properties of these complexes have been extensively zzso zzso 1-3 exhibit potent zzso activities against a panel of human cancer cell lines with zzso values lower than those of zzso Further studies show that 1-3 can cause cell cycle arrest in the zzso phase and induce zzso through zzso dysfunction and zzso oxygen species zzso zzso In zzso DNA binding studies have also been conducted to provide information about the possible mechanism of zzso
