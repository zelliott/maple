This study aimed to develop a novel zzso promoter gene linking sodium zzso zzso zzso gene to specifically target zzso zzso in a mouse tumor zzso 

A zzso zzso promoter for zzso gene zzso was combined with zzso B virus zzso zzso II to investigate zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell lines after transfer of zzso zzso A zzso zzso carrying the zzso gene was employed in zzso and in zzso zzso imaging was acquired for 30 zzso at 60 zzso after administration of zzso to monitor zzso gene expression in zzso using zzso 

The highest zzso zzso of zzso and zzso clones which zzso expressed zzso gene were zzso and zzso higher than that of parental cells, zzso After infection of zzso zzso gene controlled by zzso zzso promoter was expressed in both zzso and zzso cells, and zzso gene induction by zzso promoter was higher than by zzso promoter in zzso cells but not in zzso zzso A similar result was observed in zzso zzso controlled by zzso promoter was highly expressed in both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso tumor zzso with zzso virus specifically, but the zzso tumor did not activate the zzso promoter and further express the zzso zzso 

zzso of the zzso gene controlled by the novel zzso zzso promoter successfully zzso zzso transport in zzso
