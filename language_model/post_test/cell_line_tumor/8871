zzso differentiation is a major pathological zzso associated with poor prognosis in patients with pancreatic zzso zzso and the molecular signature underlying zzso differentiation may involve key proteins potentially affecting the zzso characters of zzso We aimed to identify the proteins which could be implicated in zzso zzso We used zzso tags for relative and absolute zzso zzso coupled with two-dimensional liquid zzso mass zzso to compare protein expression in zzso zzso with different degrees of zzso zzso A total of zzso proteins were repeatedly identified by performing the zzso experiments zzso Of these, 15 proteins were zzso expressed according to our defined zzso zzso zzso was selected to validate the zzso results by western zzso zzso in a further 154 zzso cases revealed that zzso significantly correlated with the degree of zzso differentiation zzso and zzso and zzso analyses indicated that zzso is an independent zzso factor for survival zzso ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso of patients with zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso alleviated zzso zzso of both primary and zzso zzso cell lines in zzso and in zzso Thus, zzso quantitative zzso revealed the zzso value of zzso in zzso 

Our results provide the possibility of novel strategies for pancreatic zzso zzso
