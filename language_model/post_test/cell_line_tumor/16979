The zzso zzso zzso related zzso zzso is associated with tumor progression in zzso and certain human zzso Recent reports indicate zzso may participate in the zzso transition zzso This study investigates whether zzso expression is associated with the clinical outcome of zzso cancer zzso patients and whether zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso expression in surgical tissue samples and zzso data from 102 zzso patients were analyzed by real-time zzso chain reaction and zzso The biological role of zzso in zzso was analyzed using zzso interference against zzso in the zzso cell line zzso to assess tumor progression and the correlation between zzso and zzso zzso 

Patients with high zzso zzso expression in clinical samples had a significantly poorer prognosis relative to those with low zzso levels zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso correlated with zzso at both the zzso and protein zzso In zzso cell proliferation zzso zzso zzso migration zzso zzso zzso and invasion zzso zzso zzso were significantly inhibited by zzso zzso while the zzso rate increased in zzso zzso cells compared to control zzso Interestingly, zzso expression in zzso zzso cells was higher than in control cells and zzso was lower zzso 

High zzso expression is associated with poor prognosis in zzso patients and enhanced zzso potential in terms of zzso migration, invasion, and zzso zzso in zzso zzso These results indicate zzso could induce zzso and play an important role in zzso progression to zzso
