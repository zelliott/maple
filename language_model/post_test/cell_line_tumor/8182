The development of short interfering zzso zzso has provided great hope for therapeutic targeting of specific genes responsible for pathological zzso However, the poor cellular zzso and zzso of zzso remain a major obstacle to their clinical development and most strategies that propose to improve zzso delivery remain limited for in zzso zzso In this study, we report a novel zzso approach, zzso an improved zzso of the zzso zzso carrier zzso that forms zzso with zzso and promotes their efficient delivery into primary cell lines and in zzso upon zzso zzso Moreover, we show that zzso of this carrier with cholesterol significantly improves tissue distribution and stability of zzso in zzso thereby enhancing the efficiency of this technology for systemic administration following intravenous injection without triggering any zzso inflammatory zzso We have validated the therapeutic potential of this strategy for cancer treatment by targeting zzso B1 in mouse zzso models, and demonstrate that zzso growth is zzso The zzso of the biological response achieved through this approach, zzso that zzso zzso technology holds a strong promise for therapeutic administration of zzso
