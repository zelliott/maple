We have studied the zzso efficacy of two zzso zzso named zzso and zzso zzso which differ from each other only in that whereas zzso has two small deletions in its zzso gene that restrict its replication to rapidly cycling cells, zzso zzso has zzso zzso zzso Both zzso zzso the zzso death protein zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso effectively suppressed the growth of subcutaneous human zzso and zzso tumors in nude mice upon zzso injection, and contained the growth of subcutaneous zzso tumors after intravenous injection, making some tumors shrink or zzso However, in a more demanding model, intravenous injections of neither zzso nor zzso zzso were effective against subcutaneous zzso tumors, whereas zzso zzso increased the mean survival time by zzso zzso zzso was also effective in suppressing tumor growth in a challenging zzso zzso lung cancer zzso zzso zzso was superior to zzso zzso in zzso subcutaneous zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso such as zzso zzso might provide better zzso efficacy in the clinic as zzso
