The potential zzso effects of zzso in the brain are of special interest in aging, neurodegenerative diseases, exposure to zzso and zzso zzso effects on zzso have been widely zzso but less is known about zzso effects on zzso zzso cells are primary targets of zzso zzso which arises from liver disease or failure (such as from zzso in zzso zzso cycle disorders, or zzso errors of zzso We examined the ability of zzso to protect zzso cells from ammonium zzso toxicity using an in zzso model zzso zzso cells in later passage have many zzso characteristics and provided a convenient and well established model system for this zzso When zzso cells were exposed to 15 zzso ammonium zzso we observed major cell death zzso zzso cell survival relative to zzso within 72 zzso zzso with zzso (10 zzso significantly protected zzso cells from zzso toxicity zzso cell survival relative to zzso In addition to enhancing the viability of zzso cells against zzso challenge, zzso zzso was also found to protect zzso function as zzso using the zzso reduction zzso zzso function was reduced to zzso of control levels in zzso cultures and was mostly protected by zzso zzso of control zzso The findings are potentially relevant for the development of therapeutic strategies to protect zzso cells against zzso toxicity resulting from zzso failure or other zzso
